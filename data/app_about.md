## Exploring Business Analytics in Healthcare

This web application is designed so that researchers can explore content related to business analytics in healthcare. 
The app takes all abstracts related to **business analytics in healthcare** from 2007-2020 and fits a topic model.
The topics can be considered themes based on the words included in the abstracts.

### What is a topic model?

Topic models facilitate *thematic exploration* of large text-based datasets.
For a text dataset (for example, a collection of abstracts from scientific articles), a topic model will estimate a distribution of themes for the dataset.
Each theme is an ordered list of probabilities of words, given the selected topic.
The most probable words can be thought of as representing the topical theme.

A general introduction to topic models can be found <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133806.2133826">here</a>.

There are also a number of videos on YouTube that explain topic models in greater detail (*note:* none of the authors are affiliated with any of the links below):

### Data

We provide two curated data sets based on our analyses:

- Relevant articles from the UT Dallas list of top business journals: [[link](https://jsom.utdallas.edu/the-utd-top-100-business-school-research-rankings/)]
- Relevant articles from the top five (5) journals for each subcategory from the Health and Medical Sciences category of Google Scholar journal rankings: [[link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med)]

Details on how these data sets were collected can be found in **Section 3** of our manuscript.

If you desire more flexibility, you can upload your own dataset.
