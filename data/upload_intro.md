### Augmenting your Analyses with a Custom Dataset

If you would like to use your own data set, you can. 
The app can use a custom data set of abstracts saved as one of three file types:

- NBIB files exported from PubMed
- BIB and RIS files exported from reference management software such as Zotero or EndNote

Please click the "Show Upload Instructions" button below for information on how to extract articles from PubMed for analysis.
Please refer to specific instructions from your reference management software for details on how to export articles to BIB or RIS format.
