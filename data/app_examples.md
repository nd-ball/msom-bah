## Example Topic Models for Analysis

We present the following three example models to start your exploration of the data. 

### Example 1

This fits a 4-topic model across all years and all journals. This is the model we use for our detailed description of the app in Section 3.2.2 of the manuscript.

### Example 2

This fits a 6-topic model from 2007-2014 for the IS journals. This is part of the analysis in Section 4.2.1. To fit the other three models, simply modify the relevant parameters.

### Example 3

This fits a 10-topic model from 2007 to 2020 for the IS and Management journals. This corresponds to Section 4.2.3 in our manuscript.
