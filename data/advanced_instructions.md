**Caution:** Do not change the following parameters unless you are familiar with topic models.
We cannot set expectations in terms of performance due to the open-ended nature of these options.

- **Exclusion words** refers to words that you do not want included in the topic model and network analyses.
- **Merge words** refers to phrases that you would like to be considered as a single token (e.g., "machine learning" or "healthcare analytics").
- **Alpha** is a hyperparameter for fitting the topic model.
- The **keywords for network analysis** toggles whether the network analysis should use keywords (e.g., from EBSCO) as the input or words from the titles of the articles.
