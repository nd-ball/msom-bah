AB  - This paper contributes to research on quality drivers in healthcare settings by examining the relationships between patient volume, teaching mission, and process quality in US hospitals. To develop a model that accurately assesses the impact of patient volume and teaching status on quality, we draw on three related research streams pertaining to the volume-quality relationship, the comparative quality of care in teaching and non-teaching hospitals, and quality drivers in service institutions. We propose the impact of patient volume on process quality varies across hospitals with different teaching intensities. The test of this proposition uses a large data set that measures process quality for treatments for heart attacks and heart failures in all major US hospitals. Our results suggest that, as hospital teaching intensity increases, greater patient volume is associated with decreased process quality. Never before was such a relationship uncovered. This initial finding has important practical implications. First, the regionalization policy of hospitals should be re-evaluated in light of their teaching function. Second, the root causes for the lower quality scores of large, high resident-to-bed ratio teaching hospitals, compared with smaller versions, must be found. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Health Care's Grand Challenge: Stimulating Basic Science on Diseases That Primarily Afflict the Poor
AU  - Vakili, Keyvan

T2  - Academy of Management Journal
AB  - Perhaps the most compelling Grand Challenge in health care is addressing diseases that primarily afflict the poor. Policies and practices conceived in high-income countries for improving the lives of patients in low-income countries have been criticized as ineffective or harmful. We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization's 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for "neglected diseases" such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases. We call for the application of management theories to grand challenges, and to the evaluation of policies such as TRIPS.

AB  - Robotics is a rapidly expanding area of digital innovation with important implications for organizational practice in multioccupational settings. This paper explores the influence of robotic innovations on the boundary dynamics of three different occupational groups-pharmacists, technicians, and assistants-working in a hospital pharmacy. We extend Pickering's tuning approach [Pickering, A. 1995. The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science. University of Chicago Press, Chicago] to examine the temporally emergent process that entangled the mechanical elements and digital inscriptions of a dispensing robot with the everyday practices of hospital pharmacy work. We found that engagement with the robot's hybrid and dynamic materiality over time reconfigured boundary relations among the three occupational groups, with important and contradictory consequences for the pharmacy workers' skills, jurisdictions, status, and visibility.

AB  - Are Online Reviews of Physicians Reliable Indicators of Clinical Outcomes? A Focus on Chronic Disease Management Policy/practice abstract Because online reviews of physicians have grown in popularity, it is important to ask if such reviews actually convey useful information about the quality of care delivered by physicians. We address this issue by examining whether online reviews of physicians treating chronic conditions are indicative of clinical outcomes, such as inpatient readmission rates, based on a large longitudinal data set of physician reviews. The main finding is that online reviews are not informative in the context of chronic diseases and are not useful from the viewpoint of prospective patients. This is because the outcomes of chronic disease treatment are often not easy to comprehend by patients who have not undergone extensive medical training. Further, unlike outcomes of many episodic treatments, such as surgeries, the outcomes of chronic disease treatments may not be easily discernible to patients, and possible relapses can cloud patients' assessment of changes in their health conditions. The broader lesson is that consumer feedback is unlikely to be useful in contexts involving credence goods whose quality is difficult to ascertain even after consumption. Our research suggests that prospective patients should use online reviews with caution, and policymakers should make alternative information sources available to facilitate better decision making by patients. Current trends on patient empowerment indicate that patients who play an active role in managing their health also seek and use information obtained from online reviews of physicians. However, it is far from certain whether patient-generated online reviews accurately reflect the quality of care provided by physicians, especially in the context of chronic disease care. Because chronic diseases require continuous care, monitoring, and multiple treatments over extended time periods, it can be quite hard for patients to assess the effectiveness of a particular physician accurately. Given this credence nature of chronic disease care, the research question is the following: what is the information value associated with online reviews of physicians who treat chronic disease patients? We address this issue by examining the link between online reviews of physicians and their patients' actual clinical outcomes based on a granular admission-discharge data set. Contrary to popular belief, our study finds that there is no clear relationship between online reviews of physicians and their patients' clinical outcomes, such as readmission risk or emergency room visits. Our findings have two major implications: (a) online reviews may not be helpful in the context of healthcare services with credence aspects; (b) because treatments of chronic diseases have more credence good characteristics when compared with surgeries or other acute care services, one should not extrapolate research on surgeries and acute care services to chronic disease care. Rather, one should acquire a better understanding of the information conveyed in online reviews regarding a physician's ability to deliver certain clinical outcomes before drawing inferences. Our findings have important ramifications for all stakeholders including hospitals, physicians, patients, payers, and policymakers.

AB  - The Influence of Professional Subculture on Information Security Policy Violations: A Field Study in a Healthcare Context In recent years, we have witnessed substantial increases in the frequency, scope, and cost of data breaches. Accordingly, information security researchers have sought to understand why employees comply with or violate information security policies (ISPs) designed to prevent security incidents. Research suggests that compliance is not uniform but rather depends on contextual and individual factors, such as national culture. Scholars have long recognized that organizational subculture may be equally influential. A key example is professional subcultures, within which members typically share similar education, training, values, and identity. Research shows that behavior can vary widely across professional subcultures, and thus a single approach to promoting ISP compliance may not be equally effective across these subcultures. However, it is presently unclear how subculture influences ISP compliance. To address this need, we adopt a mixed-methods design to examine differences in ISP violation behavior among different professional subcultures in a healthcare organization. We first conducted an exploratory qualitative study to identify different attitudes toward ISP violations among three prominent professional healthcare groups: physicians, nurses, and support staff. Then, using a combination of qualitative interviews, observational fieldwork, and a quantitative survey, we explored how professional group membership moderates (1) the influence of perceptions of sanctions on intentions to violate the ISP and (2) the effect of intentions to violate on actual ISP violation behaviors. Our findings highlight the substantial effect of professional subculture on ISP violations in organizations and provide insights for researchers and managers that may be used to improve overall ISP compliance.

AB  - This paper quantifies the effect of state privacy regulation on the diffusion of electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs allow medical providers to store and exchange patient information using computers rather than paper records. Hospitals may be more likely to adopt EMRs if they can reassure patients that their confidentiality is legally protected. Alternatively, privacy protection may inhibit adoption if hospitals cannot benefit from easily exchanging patient information. We find that state privacy regulation restricting hospital release of health information reduces aggregate EMR adoption by hospitals by more than 24%. We present evidence that suggests that this is due to the suppression of network externalities.

AB  - The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to penalize hospitals with excess readmissions. We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP's benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4%-13% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy's outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process-comparing hospitals against similar peers-improves the performance of the policy. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

TI  - Mitigating Delays and Unfairness in Appointment Systems
AU  - Qi, Jin
T2  - Management Science
AB  - We consider an appointment system where heterogeneous participants are sequenced and scheduled for service. Because service times are uncertain, the aims are to mitigate the unpleasantness experienced by the participants in the system when their waiting times or delays exceed acceptable thresholds and to address fairness in the balancing of service levels among participants. To evaluate uncertain delays, we propose the Delay Unpleasantness Measure, which takes into account the frequency and intensity of delays above a threshold, and introduce the concept of lexicographic min-max fairness to design appointment systems from the perspective of the worst-off participants. We focus our study in the healthcare industry in balancing physicians' overtime and patients' waiting times in which patients are distinguished by their service time characterizations. The model can be adapted in the robust setting when the underlying probability distribution is not fully available. To capture the correlation between uncertain service times, we suggest using the mean absolute deviations as the descriptive statistics in the distributional uncertainty set to preserve the linearity of the model. The optimal sequencing and scheduling decisions can be derived by solving a sequence of mixed-integer programming problems, and we report the insights from our computational studies.

TI  - Does Technology Substitute for Nurses? Staffing Decisions in Nursing Homes
AU  - Lu, Susan F.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Over the past 10 years, many healthcare organizations have made significant investments in automating their clinical operations, mostly through the introduction of advanced information systems. Yet the impact of these investments on staffing is still not well understood. In this paper, we study the effect of information technology (IT)-enabled automation on staffing decisions in healthcare facilities. Using unique nursing home IT data from 2006 to 2012, we find that the licensed nurse staffing level decreases by 5.8% in high-end nursing homes but increases by 7.6% in low-end homes after the adoption of automation technology. Our research explains this by analyzing the interplay of two competing effects of automation: the substitution of technology for labor and the leveraging of complementarity between technology and labor. We also find that increased automation improves the ratings on clinical quality by 6.9% and decreases admissions of less profitable residents by 14.7% on average. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an analytical staffing model that incorporates technology adoption and vertical differentiation. Overall, these findings suggest that the impact of automation technology on staffing decisions depends crucially on a facility's vertical position in the local marketplace.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2695.This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.

AB  - The relationship between pharmaceutical detailing and prescriptions for non-FDA-approved (off-label) use has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny, with more than $12 billion in regulatory settlements for off-label promotion since 2004. Using the case of AstraZeneca's antipsychotic drug, Seroquel, I study the extent to which off-label prescriptions are caused by detailing. Using a physician panel that connects detailing exposure to medical charts, I exploit within-physician variation to identify detailing effects. I find the effect of detailing on off-label prescriptions is small in both absolute and relative terms. Detailing on net tilts the prescribing distribution toward on-label.

TI  - Saving Patient Ryan-Can Advanced Electronic Medical Records Make Patient Care Safer?

AB  - The risk of patient harm resulting from medical care affects hundreds of thousands of patients and costs tens of billions of dollars every year. Advanced electronic medical records (EMRs) are expected to improve patient safety, but the evidence of their impact on patient safety is inconclusive. A key challenge to evaluating advanced EMRs' impact has been the lack of reliable patient safety data. We address this issue by analyzing a new patient safety data set from the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority (PSA), a state agency that aggregates patient safety data from Pennsylvania hospitals. Using a 2005-2014 panel from PSA, we identify advanced EMRs' effect using the difference-in-differences method. We find that advanced EMRs lead to a 17.5% decline in patient safety events, driven by reductions in medication errors, falls, and complication errors. Further, our analysis shows a decline in medium- and high-severity events. This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - We investigate the impact of delay announcements on the coordination within hospital networks using a combination of empirical observations and numerical experiments. We offer empirical evidence that suggests that patients take delay information into account when choosing emergency service providers and that such information can help increase coordination in the network, leading to improvements in the performance of the network, as measured by emergency department wait times. Our numerical results indicate that the level of coordination that can be achieved is limited by the patients' sensitivity to waiting, the load of the system, the heterogeneity among hospitals, and, importantly, the method hospitals use to estimate delays. We show that delay estimators that are based on historical averages may cause oscillation in the system and lead to higher average wait times when patients are sensitive to delay. We provide empirical evidence that suggests that such oscillations occur in hospital networks in the United States. This paper was accepted by Gad Allon, operations management.

TI  - Data-Driven Patient Scheduling in Emergency Departments: A Hybrid Robust-Stochastic Approach
AU  - He, Shuangchi
AU  - Sim, Melvyn
AU  - Zhang, Meilin
T2  - Management Science
AB  - Emergency care necessitates adequate and timely treatment, which has unfortunately been compromised by crowding in many emergency departments (EDs). To address this issue, we study patient scheduling in EDs so that mandatory targets imposed on each patient's door-to-provider time and length of stay can be collectively met with the largest probability. Exploiting patient flow data from the ED, we propose a hybrid robust-stochastic approach to formulating the patient scheduling problem, which allows for practical features, such as a time-varying patient arrival process, general consultation time distributions, and multiple heterogeneous physicians. In contrast to the conventional formulation of maximizing the joint probability of target attainment, which is computationally excruciating, the hybrid approach provides a computationally amiable formulation that yields satisfactory solutions to the patient scheduling problem. This formulation enables us to develop a dynamic scheduling algorithm for making recommendations about the next patient to be seen by each available physician. In numerical experiments, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms both the sample average approximation method and an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy.This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.

AU  - Wang, Shan

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Despite the prevalence and significance of walk-ins in healthcare, we know relatively little about how to plan and manage the daily operations of a healthcare facility that accepts both scheduled and walk-in patients. In this paper, we take a data-analytics approach and develop an optimization model to determine the optimal appointment schedule in the presence of potential walk-ins. Our model is the first known approach that can jointly handle general walk-in processes and heterogeneous, time-dependent no-show behaviors. We demonstrate that, with walk-ins, the optimal schedules are fundamentally different from those without. Our numerical study reveals that walk-ins introduce a new source of uncertainties to the system and cannot be viewed as a simple solution to compensate for patient no-shows. Scheduling, however, is an effective way to counter some of the negative impact from uncertain patient behaviors. Using data from practice, we predict a significant cost reduction (42%-73% on average) if the providers were to switch from current practice (which tends to overlook walk-ins in planning) to our proposed schedules. Although our work is motivated by healthcare, our models and insights can also be applied to general appointment-based services with walk-ins.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Although significant research has examined how technology can intensify racial and other outgroup biases, limited work has investigated the role information systems can play in abating them. Racial biases are particularly worrisome in healthcare, where underrepresented minorities suffer disparities in access to care, quality of care, and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we examine the role clinical decision support systems (CDSS) play in attenuating systematic biases among black patients, relative to white patients, in rates of amputation and revascularization stemming from diabetes mellitus. Using a panel of inpatient data and a difference-in-difference approach, results suggest that CDSS adoption significantly shrinks disparities in amputation rates across white and black patients-with no evidence that this change is simply delaying eventual amputations. Results suggest that this effect is driven by changes in treatment care protocols that match patients to appropriate specialists, rather than altering within physician decision making. These findings highlight the role information systems and digitized patient care can play in promoting unbiased decision making by structuring and standardizing care procedures.

AU  - Yan, Zhenzhen
T2  - Management Science
AB  - This paper studies how to schedule medical appointments with time-dependent patient no-show behavior and random service times. The problem is motivated by our studies of independent datasets from countries in two continents that unanimously identify a significant time-of-day effect on patient show-up probabilities. We deploy a distributionally robust model, which minimizes the worst-case total expected costs of patient waiting and service provider's idling and overtime, by optimizing the scheduled arrival times of patients. This model is challenging because evaluating the total cost for a given schedule involves a linear program with uncertainties present in both the objective function and the right-hand side of the constraints. In addition, the ambiguity set considered contains discrete uncertainties and complementary functional relationships among these uncertainties (namely, patient no-shows and service durations). We show that when patient no-shows are exogenous (i.e., time-independent), the problem can be reformulated as a copositive program and then be approximated by semidefinite programs. When patient no-shows are endogenous on time (and hence on the schedule), the problem becomes a bilinear copositive program. We construct a set of dual prices to guide the search for a good schedule and use the technique iteratively to obtain a near-optimal solution. Our computational studies reveal a significant reduction in total expected cost by taking into account the time-of-day variation in patient show-up probabilities as opposed to ignoring it.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Safety alerts are announcements made by health regulators warning patients and doctors about new drug-related side effects. However, not all safety alerts are equally effective. We provide evidence that the day of the week on which the safety alerts are announced explains differences in safety alert impact. Specifically, we show that safety alerts announced on Fridays are less broadly diffused: they are shared 34% less on social media, mentioned in 23% to 66% fewer news articles, and are 12% to 51% less likely to receive any news coverage at all. As a consequence of this, we propose Friday alerts are less effective in reducing drug-related side effects. We find that moving a Friday alert to any other weekday would reduce all drug-related side effects by 9% to 12%, serious drug-related complications by 6% to 15%, and drug-related deaths by 22% to 36%. This problem is particularly important because Friday was the most frequent weekday for safety alert announcements from 1999 to 2016. We show that this greater prevalence of Friday alerts might not be random: firms that lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the past are 49% to 56% more likely to have safety alerts announced on Fridays.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - We examine the effect of charge-price-transparency regulation (PTR)-a common policy solution intended to curb rising healthcare costs-on hospitals' prices. We find that, although PTR does not affect payments or consumer search, it does cause hospitals to reduce charges by approximately 5%. The reputational costs of perceived overcharging appear to be one impetus for the reduction in charges, suggesting that certain stakeholders who are able to impose costs on hospitals are unaware that hospitals can decouple charges from payments. The ineffectiveness of PTR policies in reducing payments and the apparent inability of some stakeholders to realize this fact could explain why charge-transparency policies have been widely adopted with little opposition. Overall, our findings provide a cautionary note-transparency regulation focusing on an indicator that can be decoupled from the construct of interest might placate some stakeholders without actually solving the underlying problem.

AU  - Sambamurthy, V.
AU  - Kelley, Ken
T2  - Management Science
AB  - We use a social contagion lens to study the dynamic, temporal process of the diffusion of electronic medical records in the population of U.S. hospitals. Social contagion acknowledges the mutual influence among organizations within an institutional field and implicates information transmission through direct contact and observation as the mechanisms underlying influence transfer. We propose hypotheses predicting a hospital's likelihood of adopting electronic medical records as a function of its susceptibility to the influence of prior adopters, the infectiousness or potency of influence exerted by adopting hospitals, and its social and spatial proximity to prior adopters. Results obtained by fitting a heterogeneous diffusion model to data from a sample drawn from an annual survey, spanning 1975 to 2005, of almost 4,000 U.S. hospitals suggest that diffusion can be accelerated if specific attention is given to increasing social contagion effects. In particular, with respect to susceptibility to influence, greater hospital size and age are positively related to the likelihood of adoption for nonadopters, whereas younger hospitals are associated with greater infectiousness for adopters. A hospital's "celebrity" status also contributes to its infectiousness. We further find strong effects for social proximity and significant regional effects for spatial proximity and hospital size, suggesting that geographical covariates should be included in diffusion studies. Results also reinforce the importance of theorizing about and including interactions in examinations of social contagion.

TI  - Centrality-Is Proficiency Alignment and Workgroup Performance
AU  - Kane, Gerald C.
AU  - Borgatti, Stephen P.
T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Virtually all of the extensive previous research investigating the effect of information systems proficiency on performance has been conducted at the individual level. Little research has investigated the relationship between IS proficiency and performance at the group level. In this paper, we argue that IS proficiency at the group level may be more than the simple sum or average of the IS proficiency of individual group members.Rather, effective group-level IS proficiency may also be a function of how a group's IS proficiency is distributed across its members. Relying on concepts associated with social network analysis (SNA), we introduce the concept of centrality-IS proficiency alignment. We argue that groups will perform better if their more proficient members are highly central in the group's communication and workflows network. Data from 468 employees in 32 workgroups show that centrality-IS proficiency alignment is significantly and positively related to performance across multiple systems examined individually and with the portfolio of systems examined as a whole. This approach effectively integrates the structural and resource perspectives of SNA,providing a roadmap so that others may follow a similar approach to address broader questions of group-level user-system interactions in the IS literature and more general questions of central resource alignment in the broader organizational literature.

TI  - DIGRESSION AND VALUE CONCATENATION TO ENABLE PRIVACY-PRESERVING REGRESSION
AU  - Li, Xiao-Bai

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Regression techniques can be used not only for legitimate data analysis, but also to infer private information about individuals. In this paper, we demonstrate that regression trees, a popular data-analysis and data-mining technique, can be used to effectively reveal individuals' sensitive data. This problem, which we call a regression attack, has not been addressed in the data privacy literature, and existing privacy-preserving techniques are not appropriate in coping with this problem. We propose a new approach to counter regression attacks. To protect against privacy disclosure, our approach introduces a novel measure, called digression, which assesses the sensitive value disclosure risk in the process of building a regression tree model. Specifically, we develop an algorithm that uses the measure for pruning the tree to limit disclosure of sensitive data. We also propose a dynamic value-concatenation method for anonymizing data, which better preserves data utility than a user-defined generalization scheme commonly used in existing approaches. Our approach can be used for anonymizing both numeric and categorical data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world financial, economic, and healthcare data. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective in protecting data privacy while preserving data quality for research and analysis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - PROACTIVE VERSUS REACTIVE SECURITY INVESTMENTS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR
AU  - Kwon, Juhee
AU  - Johnson, M. Eric
T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - This study identifies the effects of security investments that arise from previous failures or external regulatory pressure. Building on organizational learning theory, the study focuses on the healthcare sector where legislation mandates breach disclosure and detailed data on security investments are available. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrate that proactive security investments are associated with lower security failure rates. Coupling that result with the economics of breach disclosure, we also show that proactive investments are more cost effective in healthcare security than reactive investments. Our results further indicate that this effect is amplified at the state level, supporting the argument that security investments create positive externalities. We also find that external pressure decreases the effect of proactive investments on security performance. This implies that proactive investments, voluntarily made, have more impact than those involuntarily made. Our findings suggest that security managers and policy makers should pay attention to the strategic and regulatory factors influencing security investment decisions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - DOES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT INFLUENCE A FIRM'S MARKET VALUE? A CASE OF NON-PUBLICLY TRADED HEALTHCARE FIRMS
AU  - Kohli, Rajiv

AU  - Ow, Terence T.
T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Managers make informed information technology investment decisions when they are able to quantify how IT contributes to firm performance. While financial accounting measures inform IT's influence on retrospective firm performance, senior managers expect evidence of how IT influences prospective measures such as the firm's market value. We examine the efficacy of IT's influence on firm value combined with measures of financial performance for non-publicly traded (NPT) hospitals that lack conventional market-based measures. We gathered actual sale transactions for NPT hospitals in the United States to derive the q ratio, a measure of market value. Our findings indicate that the influence of IT investment on the firm is more pronounced and statistically significant on firm value than exclusively on the accounting performance measures. Specifically, we find that the impact of IT investment is not significant on return on assets (ROA) and operating income for the same set of hospitals. This research note contributes to research and practice by demonstrating that the overall impact of IT is better understood when accounting measures are complemented with the firm's market value. Such market valuation is also critical in merger and acquisition decisions, an activity that is likely to accelerate in the healthcare industry. Our findings provide hospitals, as well as other NPT firms, with insights into the impact of IT investment and a pragmatic approach to demonstrating IT's contribution to firm value.

AB  - Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary business organizations. This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are defined and described in terms of their key characteristics and capabilities. Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A research and education are identified. We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications, researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications. Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the proposed BI&A research framework. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article discusses a study on the elements of a mother's social network integral to the success or failure of the information and communication technology (ICT) intervention. It examined an eHealth kiosk intervention in 10 villages over 7 years focusing on infant mortality that might occur from the time of birth through the first year of life. It suggests that addressing the problem with ICT requires a contextual perspective with focus on mothers' social networks.

AB  - Big data generated by crowds provides a myriad of opportunities for monitoring and modeling people's intentions, preferences, and opinions. A crucial step in analyzing such big data is selecting the relevant part of the data that should be provided as input to the modeling process. In this paper, we offer a novel, structured, crowd-based method to address the data selection problem in a widely used and challenging context: selecting search trend data. We label the method "crowd-squared," as it leverages crowds to identify the most relevant terms in search volume data that were generated by a larger crowd. We empirically test this method in two domains and find that our method yields predictions that are equivalent or superior to those obtained in previous studies (using alternative data selection methods) and to predictions obtained using various benchmark data selection methods. These results emphasize the importance of a structured data selection method in the prediction process, and demonstrate the utility of the crowd-squared approach for addressing this problem in the context of prediction using search trend data.

TI  - MEANINGFUL HEALTHCARE SECURITY: DOES MEANINGFUL-USE ATTESTATION IMPROVE INFORMATION SECURITY PERFORMANCE?
AU  - Kwon, Juhee

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Certification mechanisms are often employed to assess and signal difficult-to-observe management practices and foster improvement. In the U.S. healthcare sector, a certification mechanism called meaningful-use attestation was recently adopted as part of an effort to encourage electronic health record (EHR) adoption while also focusing healthcare providers on protecting sensitive healthcare data. This new regime motivated us to examine how meaningful-use attestation influences the occurrence of data breaches. Using a propensity score matching technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, our study shows that the impact of meaningful-use attestation is contingent on the nature of data breaches and the time frame. Hospitals that attest to having reached Stage 1 meaningful-use standards observe fewer external breaches in the short term, but do not see continued improvement in the following year. On the other hand, attesting hospitals observe short-term increases in accidental internal breaches but eventually see long-term reductions. We do not find any link between malicious internal breaches and attestation. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights into the effective design of certification mechanisms.

AB  - Clinical intelligence about a patient's risk of future adverse health events can support clinical decision making in personalized and preventive care. Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models-one for each event-and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - CPOE-ENABLED COORDINATION: APPROPRIATION FOR DEEP STRUCTURE USE AND IMPACTS ON PATIENT OUTCOMES
AU  - Romanow, Darryl

AU  - Keil, Mark
T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun instituting pay-for-performance incentives that reward hospitals based on patient-centric outcomes such as patient satisfaction. Further, to promote the "meaningful use" of health information technology (HIT), CMS has been prompting hospitals to adopt and use HITs. Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) is one such HIT and is designed to improve coordination in patient care teams and consequently patient outcomes. We explore the impact of CPOE-enabled coordination on patient satisfaction with the care team. In a departure from prior research that has tended to treat the team as all clinicians within a hospital unit/clinic, we conceptualize (and operationalize) patient care teams as ad hoc and patient-specific and thus comprised of those clinicians having direct contact with the patient. In a further departure from prior research that has employed lean measures of IS use (e.g., use intentions, duration, or frequency of use), we respond to the call for rich measures of IS use by conceptualizing deep structure use (DSU) of CPOE as patient care team-level usage of CPOE features. We draw upon adaptive structuration theory (AST) to identify faithfulness of appropriation (FOA) and consensus on appropriation (COA) as two related, but distinct, aspects of CPOE appropriation by patient care teams that affect DSU. We also draw on relational coordination theory to conceptualize communicative coordination (CC) as team communication for coordination purposes and theorize that DSU affects patient satis-faction through CC and informating the patient differentially across high/low patient mortality risk conditions. Based on data from 224 patient care teams caring for both low and high patient mortality risk conditions, our results indicate that FOA and COA are salient predictors of DSU, and that the effect of COA on DSU is mediated by FOA. We also observed a significant indirect effect of DSU on patient satisfaction (as mediated by communicative coordination and patient informating), but only for high patient mortality risk conditions. Our findings are important because they show that by using CPOE in a comprehensive manner, patient care team members are better able to coordinate patient care and are able to better inform the patient about their care,ultimately leading to improved patient satisfaction. Additional implications for HIT research and practice are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research examines hospital digital advantage, defined as a hospital's technological edge relative to its competitors across a composite of technologies supporting the hospital's various functions and processes. Drawing on Bourdieu's forms of capital and the logic of digital options, we develop an integrative conceptual framework to identify and organize antecedents of digital advantage, which can translate to hospital performance through the creation of digital options. Focusing on the antecedents of digital advantage for our research model and hypotheses, we suggest that digital advantage is influenced by (1) economic capital, (2) institutional-arrangement-based social capital that results in knowledge sharing through information exchange networks and parent organization membership, (3) geographic-proximity-based social capital due to locational externalities that facilitate knowledge spillover, and (4) cultural capital that reflects the hospital's health information technology (HIT) knowledge stock. Our findings, based on the aggregate adoption of 90 HITs by 953 hospitals, support main effects; complementary effects of the two forms of social capital; and substitutive effects between (1) economic capital and other forms of capital such that cultural capital and both types of social capital mitigate the effects of inadequate economic capital, and between (2) institutional-arrangement- based social capital and cultural capital such that knowledge shared through institutional arrangements mitigates the effects of having inadequate in-house HIT expertise. We also provide preliminary evidence to show that hospital digital advantage is positively associated with hospital performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - USING ORGANISMIC INTEGRATION THEORY TO EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN USERS' EXERCISE MOTIVATIONS AND FITNESS TECHNOLOGY FEATURE SET USE

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Wearable devices and applications (apps) that offer a variety of features intended to support exercisers have flooded the marketplace. Organismic integration theory (OIT) proposes that motivations to exercise can vary along a spectrum of self-determination. To best serve exercisers and assist organizations that are developing and promoting fitness technologies, we need a better understanding of how individuals' exercise motivations influence their fitness technology feature set use. We also need to determine the impact of fitness technology features on enhancing or undermining wellness outcomes-such as subjective vitality. Our results suggest that almost every subtype of exerciser, where the subtype is defined by OIT motivations toward exercise, has a unique use profile. Our findings also suggest that the social interaction and data management features of current fitness technologies show promise in assisting well-being outcomes, but only for the more self-determined and amotivated subtypes of exercisers. This leads us to suggest that providing every type of exerciser the motivational support that best fits their motivational profile may not be a trivial task, but it ultimately may be necessary for fitness technologies to be universally useful in supporting wellness outcomes.

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Individuals increasingly rely on healthcare virtual support communities (HVSCs) for social support and companionship. While research provides interesting insights into the drivers of informational support in knowledge-sharing virtual communities, there is limited research on the antecedents of emotional support provision and companionship activities in HVSCs. The unique characteristics of HVSCs also justify the need to reexamine members' voluntary provisions of help in such communities. This paper develops a model that examines the relationships between the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital and the provision of informational and emotional support, and engagement in companionship activities in HVSCs. The model is tested based on data generated through an automated method that classifies and analyzes user-generated text in three healthcare virtual support communities (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer). The results show that all three dimensions of social capital impact the provision of emotional support; both structural and relational capital facilitate engagement in companionship activities; and only cognitive capital enables the provision of informational support. Research and practical implications on the need to facilitate informational and emotional support provision and companionship activities in healthcare virtual support communities are discussed.

TI  - IS THERE A GENETIC BASIS FOR INFORMATION SEARCH PROPENSITY? A GENOTYPING EXPERIMENT
AU  - Browne, Glenn J.
AU  - Walden, Eric A.
T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - In this work we explore the question of whether there is a genetic basis for people's different propensities to search for information. Specifically, we test whether the rs1044396 polymorphism-one variation in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 4 (CHRNA4) gene-is a reliable predictor of propensity to search for information. A sample of 205 subjects performed an information search task and then donated genetic material, which was analyzed. Using these data we found that the rs1044396 polymorphism is associated with both search duration and the amount of information searched, contributing a genetic explanation for a portion of propensity to search for information. People with the C:C version of rs1044396 gathered 25% more information but spent 13% less time on each piece of information than people with T-alleles before making a decision. Thus, the amount of information that people gather and the temporal cost of gathering that information have a strong genetic component, which has implications for internet search strategies, information use, and information systems design.

TI  - THE BRIGHT AND DARK SIDES OF TECHNOSTRESS: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY INVOLVING HEALTHCARE IT
AU  - Califf, Christopher B.
AU  - Sarker, Saonee

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Today's healthcare workers, specifically nurses, are experiencing technostress associated with the use of healthcare information technology (HIT). Technostress is often characterized by IS researchers as negative, or as being on the "dark side" of technology. However, a broader reading of the stress literature suggests that technostress may be both positive and negative, and can therefore have a "bright side" in addition to a dark side. The objective of this study is to conceptualize a holistic technostress process that includes positive and negative components of technostress embedded in two subprocesses: the techno-eustress subprocess and the techno-distress subprocess, respectively. The study instantiates this holistic technostress model through a sequential mixed-methods research design in the context of HIT. Phase 1 of the design is a qualitative, interpretive case study involving interviews with 32 nurses. Based on the findings from the case study, the paper builds a research model that operationalizes the concepts embedded in the holistic technostress model and identifies contextually relevant challenge and hindrance technostressors and outcomes. In Phase 2, the research model is empirically validated by analyzing survey data collected from 402 nurses employed in the United States. Results reveal that several challenge and hindrance technostressors are related to positive and negative psychological responses, respectively, and that such responses are related to job satisfaction and attrition, which impact turnover intention. Contributions to theory and practice are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many people face problems of emotional distress. Early detection of high-risk individuals is the key to prevent suicidal behavior. There is increasing evidence that the Internet and social media provide clues of people's emotional distress. In particular, some people leave messages showing emotional distress or even suicide notes on the Internet. Identifying emotionally distressed people and examining their posts on the Internet are important steps for health and social work professionals to provide assistance, but the process is very timeconsuming and ineffective if conducted manually using standard search engines. Following the design science approach, we present the design of a system called KAREN, which identifies individuals who blog about their emotional distress in the Chinese language, using a combination of machine learning classification and rulebased classification with rules obtained from experts. A controlled experiment and a user study were conducted to evaluate system performance in searching and analyzing blogs written by people who might be emotionally distressed. The results show that the proposed system achieved better classification performance than the benchmark methods and that professionals perceived the system to be more useful and effective for identifying bloggers with emotional distress than benchmark approaches [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - With a view toward improving the success of information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives in less developed countries in general and India in particular, this work seeks to uncover reasons for success and failure of ICT for development (ICT4D) initiatives. We drew on social networks theory in general and social contagion theory in particular, and examined the impact of advice network constructs on ICT kiosk use and the impact of ICT kiosk use on women's health outcomes (i.e., seeking modern medical care and maternal mortality). A two-level model (i.e., village and individual) was developed to understand how women in rural India were influenced by other women in their advice networks to use ICT kiosks, and the effects of ICT kiosk use on seeking modern medical care and maternal mortality. At the village level, we proposed lead user network effects. At the individual level, we proposed structural network effects of other women in a focal woman's network on individual outcomes of ICT kiosk use, seeking modern medical care, and maternal mortality. We focused on network position (i.e., centrality) and network tie strength (i.e., strong ties and weak ties) as explanatory variables. Specifically, we argued that strong tie centrality will have an adverse effect on ICT kiosk use, whereas weak tie centrality will have a favorable effect. We also argued ICT kiosk use will have a positive effect on seeking modern medical care and a negative effect on maternal mortality. Finally, we argued that seeking modern medical care will have a negative effect on maternal mortality. Our model was mostly supported in data collected about 6,710 women in 10 intervention group villages in rural India and 8,344 women in the control group villages over a period of approximately 7 years.

TI  - IT-ENABLED SELF-MONITORING FOR CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEW
AU  - Jiang, Jinglu

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Self-monitoring is a strategy that patients use to manage their chronic disease and chronic disease risk factors. Technological advances such as mobile apps, web-based tracking programs, sensing devices, wearable technologies, and insideable devices enable IT-based self-monitoring (ITSM) for chronic disease management. Since ITSM is multidisciplinary in nature and our understanding is fragmented, a systematic examination of the literature is performed to build a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. We review 159 studies published in 108 journals and conferences between 2006 and 2017. By adapting affordance actualization theory, we develop an overarching framework to organize the existing literature on ITSM for chronic disease management. Four themes emerge: key ITSM functionalities that enable affordances; effects on ITSM system use; effects on the achievement of chronic care goals; and the role of intermediary outcomes. For each theme, we identify what is known, what is unknown, and opportunities for future research. We also discuss cross-theme opportunities for future research where more diverse theoretical perspectives can contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon. This work provides research directions for IS researchers studying ITSM for chronic disease self-management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Video sharing social media platforms, such as YouTube, offer an effective way to deliver medical information. Few studies have identified evidence-backed digital therapeutics with technology-enabled interventions to improve the ease with which patients can retrieve medical information to manage chronic conditions. We propose an interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes deep learning methods with themes emphasized in Information Systems and Healthcare Informatics research to examine user engagement with encoded medical information in YouTube videos. We first use a bidirectional long short-term memory method to identify medical terms in videos and then classify videos based on whether they encode a high or low degree of medical information. We then employ principal component analysis on aggregate video data to discover three dimensions of collective engagement with videos: nonengagement, selective attention-driven engagement, and sustained attention-driven engagement. Videos with low medical information result in nonengagement; at the same time, videos with a greater amount of encoded medical information struggle to maintain sustained attention-driven engagement. Our study provides healthcare practitioners and policymakers with a nuanced understanding of how users engage with medical information in video format. Our research also contributes to enhancing current public health practices by promoting normative guidelines for educational video content enabling management of chronic conditions.

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Asthma is a common chronic health condition affecting millions of people in the United States. While asthma cannot be cured, it can be managed if we identify and understand triggers and risk factors that cause asthma exacerbations. However, this is challenging because these triggers and risk factors are complex and interconnected, and there are limitations to current mainstream approaches for identifying them. The recent availability of massive amounts of heterogeneous data has opened up new possibilities for asthma triggers and risk factors analyses. In this study, we introduce a data-driven framework, adapt and integrate multiple advanced machine learning techniques, and perform an empirical analysis to (1) derive characteristics of selfreported asthma patients from social media, (2) enable integration and repurposing of highly heterogeneous and commonly available datasets, and (3) uncover the sequential patterns of asthma triggers and risk factors, and their relative importance, both of which are difficult to achieve via retrospective cohort-based studies. Our methods and results can provide guidance for developing asthma management plans and interventions for specific subpopulations and, eventually, have the potential to reduce the societal burden of asthma.

TI  - CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT: HOW IT AND ANALYTICS CREATE HEALTHCARE VALUE THROUGH THE TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT OF CARE
AU  - Thompson, Steve

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - The treatment of chronic diseases consumes 86% of U.S. healthcare costs. While healthcare organizations have traditionally focused on treating the complications of chronic diseases, advances in information technology (IT) and analytics can help clinicians and patients manage and slow the progression of chronic diseases to result in higher quality of life for patients and lower healthcare costs. We build on prior research to introduce the notion of temporal displacement of care (TDC), in which IT and analytics create healthcare value by displacing the time at which providers and patients make interventions to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. We propose that healthcare value is created by strategic actions taken at specific points-in-time during the treatment process. Our theoretical development identifies TDC mechanisms through which IT and analytics displace later high cost interventions in favor of earlier preventative procedures. We test our hypotheses using four years of data on 45,000 cardio-metabolic patients from the U.S. state of Vermont, which implemented a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program. Our study includes four cohorts with increasing levels of IT and analytics use: (1) non-PCMH practices, (2) PCMH practices with basic IT systems installed, (3) practices that completed data quality sprints (DQS) to increase use of IT systems, and (4) practices that use analytics through the Vermont Healthcare Information Exchange (VHIE). Our results provide insights into how TDC effects develop over time. In Year 1 after implementation, the DQS cohort demonstrates a marked increase in the use of preventative procedures such as eye exams and neuropathy screenings, the increase becomes more pronounced in Years 2 and 3, and the increase is even greater for the VHIE cohort. As the use of preventative procedures increases, emergency department utilization decreases, with a more pronounced decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 2, the DQS and VHIE cohorts experience a decrease in total healthcare costs, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 3, the healthcare outcomes indicator of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level is statistically significantly lower, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. The increased use of low-intervention healthcare treatments earlier in the process leads to a decrease in overall healthcare costs, which then leads to an improvement in healthcare indicators.

AU  - Son, Junbo

AB  - Asthma is a prevalent respiratory chronic disease affecting a large portion of the global population. Patients diagnosed with asthma may experience significantly reduced quality of life if their asthma is not properly controlled. To facilitate better asthma self-management, asthma specialists and engineers have developed the smart asthma management system (SAM). This new health information system provides Bluetooth-enabled inhalers and collects time stamps of every rescue inhaler use. Such detailed inhaler usage logs, which are crucial for investigating patterns of inhaler usage, were not available in traditional clinical trials because clinical trials acquire data only periodically. Due to the low data collection resolution of clinical trials, quantitative asthma studies based on trial data have been focusing mainly on capturing the increasing trend in the number of rescue inhaler uses. Taking advantage of the patient monitoring capability of the SAM system, we developed a data analytics framework for detecting abnormal inhaler use that is out of the patient's normal usage pattern. The new statistical model developed in this paper can address the key features of the data collected from the SAM system such as the heterogeneous impact of environmental factors on inhaler usage behavior and the correlation structure governed by the patient's repetitive routines. We show the satisfactory performance of our data analytics framework through rigorous comparison with various benchmark methods. Furthermore, we give an in-depth discussion on our contribution to the information systems (IS) knowledge base and practical implications of our analytics framework to data-driven asthma management practice.

AB  - While telemonitoring technology is widely used in treatment of patients with chronic diseases, our understanding of how it influences patient-related outcomes is limited. Drawing upon feedback intervention theory, the paper develops a model that examines how a telemonitoring feedback ecosystem (patient, telemonitoring technology, care provider) is related to patient behavioral outcomes. More precisely, we study the cascading effects of two types of technology feedback (medical and compliance alerts) on the provision of three types of feedback (outcome, corrective, and personal) given by care providers, and how the feedback in turn is related to patient adaptation and ultimately to calls to 911. Using generalized linear mixed modeling, we tested our hypotheses with longitudinal data from 212 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or chronic heart failure (CHF) over 26 weeks. Our results show that medical alerts had a positive association with all three types of provider feedback. By contrast, compliance alerts had curvilinear relationships with corrective and personal feedback. Our results also show that outcome feedback and personal feedback were associated with increases in patient adaptations. Patient adaptation was negatively related to the odds of calling 911. Interestingly, we found a significant negative interaction between outcome and corrective feedback and patient adaptation. Finally, our results show that while the frequency of feedback decreased over the life of the program, the amount of adaptations increased over the same period, which suggests that patient self-management improved over time. By examining a telemonitoring-based ecosystem with two stages of feedback, our study contributes to the chronic disease management literature as well as to other contexts where monitoring technologies deliver feedback that is mediated by a third party. Theoretical and practical implications of our study are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - TRAJECTORIES OF REPEATED READMISSIONS OF CHRONIC DISEASE PATIENTS: RISK STRATIFICATION, PROFILING, AND PREDICTION
AU  - Ben-Assuli, Ofir

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - The problem of recurrent, unplanned readmissions, where some patients return shortly after discharge from the hospital and are readmitted for the same or a related condition, has become a challenge worldwide due to care quality, health outcomes, and financial concerns. Predicting frequent, preventable readmissions and understanding the contributing factors is a critical problem that is being widely studied. However, few studies have examined longitudinal risk stratification, profiling, and prediction of multi-morbid, heterogeneous patient populations. We examine how readmission risk may progress over multiple emergency department visits of chronic disease patients, their early stratification into distinct trajectories with related frequencies, and the relationship of these trajectories to patient characteristics. We further extend this analysis to investigate the impact of time-stable and time-varying covariates in predicting future readmission conditional on latent class membership. Results indicate that longitudinal risk stratification can enable early identification of specific patient groups following distinct trajectories based on their presentation for emergency care. Prediction models that incorporate latent classes perform well and demonstrate the promise of trajectory modeling methods combined with advanced prediction models for longitudinal risk assessment in addressing readmission challenges. The methodology and insights from this study are generalizable to other important Information Systems problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Hospitalization of patients with chronic diseases poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Frequent hospitalization can be partially attributed to the failure of healthcare providers to engage effectively with their patients. Recently, patient portals have become popular as information technology (IT) platforms that provide patients with online access to their medical records and help them engage effectively with healthcare providers. Despite the popularity of these portals, there is a paucity of research on the impact of patient-provider engagement on patients' health outcomes. Drawing on the theory of effective use, we examine the association between portal use and the incidence of subsequent patient hospitalizations, based on a unique, longitudinal dataset of patients' portal use, across a 12-year period at a large academic medical center in North Texas. Our results indicate that portal use is associated with improvements in patient health outcomes along multiple dimensions, including the frequency of hospital and emergency visits, readmission risk, and length of stay. This is one of the first studies to conduct a large-scale, longitudinal analysis of a health IT system and its effect on individuallevel health outcomes. Our results highlight the need for technologies that can improve patient-provider engagement and improve overall health outcomes for chronic disease management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - THE IMPACT OF HEALTH INFORMATION SHARING ON DUPLICATE TESTING

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Recent healthcare reform has focused on reducing excessive waste in the U.S. healthcare system, with duplicate testing being one of the main culprits. We explore the factors associated with duplicate tests when patients utilize healthcare services from multiple providers, and yet information sharing across these providers is fragmented. We hypothesize that implementation of health information sharing technologies will reduce the duplication rate more for radiology tests compared to laboratory tests, especially when health information sharing technologies are implemented across disparate provider organizations. We utilize a unique panel data set consisting of 39,600 patient visits from 2005 to 2012, across outpatient clinics of 68 hospitals, to test our hypotheses. We apply a quasi-experimental approach to investigate the impact of health information sharing technologies on the duplicate testing rate. Our results indicate that usage of information sharing technologies across health organizations is associated with lower duplication rates, and the extent of reduction in duplicate tests is more pronounced among radiology tests compared to laboratory tests. Our results support the need for implementation of health information exchanges as a potential solution to reduce the incidence of duplicate tests. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The popular press has long used the terms single-sourcing and multisourcing (also known as best of breed) to describe organizations' sourcing strategies. Whereas there is an implicit understanding of these terms, no research has quantified what distinguishes one sourcing configuration from another or what institutional factors contribute to the pursuit of one strategy over the other. We leverage institutional theory to examine how key organizational antecedents such as strategic orientation (mission), formal structure (size), and internal dynamics (patient case mix complexity) influence the rate at which organizations move toward or away from a single-sourcing configuration. Employing longitudinal modeling combined with sequence analysis techniques, we empirically evaluate IS sourcing strategies of nearly all U.S. hospitals operating continuously over a 9-year time frame from 2005 to 2013. We find that hospitals are generally trending toward a single-sourcing configuration and that formal structure and internal dynamics serve as predictors of this trend. Contrary to the predictions of institutional theory, we find that strategic orientation is not predictive of IS sourcing strategy. These results have important implications for research and practice. Notably, we are the first to quantify sourcing strategies, and, by doing so, are able to inform practitioners and academics of the key organizational characteristics that lead hospitals to move more quickly toward single-sourcing configurations.

TI  - The Effects of Operational and Financial Performance Failure on BI&A-Enabled Search Behaviors: A Theory of Performance-Driven Search
AU  - Anand, Abhijith
AU  - Sharma, Rajeev
AU  - Kohli, Rajiv
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Abstract for Practice and Policy Investments in business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) systems has grown exponentially in recent years. A key reason behind those investments is driven by the expectation that such investments enable improved organizational performance through analyzing critical business data. Despite the evidence that shows the positive impact of BI&A on organizational improvements, not all firms have been able to achieve positive outcomes from their investments in BI&A. To address this gap, we formulate hypotheses about conditions under which firms leverage BI&A systems. Findings from this study suggest that firms employ BI&A systems only under a narrow set of conditions. Specifically, it is observed that BI&A use is trigged by failures in operational and financial performance and performance related aspirational levels. In other words, when firms experienced failures in operational and financial performance, we observed greater use of BI&A systems to reverse performance failures. However, successful performance conditions did not motivate BI&A use. In order to generate value from BI&A investments, it is important for firms to proactively use BI&A systems. Firms that are struggling to derive value from BI&A systems need to reassess their performance control systems and reward systems to motivate greater use of BI&A under a wider set of conditions. Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) systems enable firms to analyze data and search for insights that could potentially lead to improved organizational performance. While there is evidence that BI&A systems can improve performance through search, our theoretical understanding of how and under what conditions firms leverage BI&A systems to conduct search is rather limited. In particular, while problemistic search theory posits that performance failures motivate search, how firms respond to different types of performance failures remains unclear. We draw on and extend problemistic search theory by theorizing that BI&A-enabled search is influenced by complex interactions between failures in financial and operational performance and performance-related aspirations. We refer to this notion as the Theory of Performance-driven Search (TPS) and test it using longitudinal data gathered for a four-year period from seven U.S. hospitals. We find evidence that firms employ BI&A systems to search in a narrow set of circumstances. We find that performance failures are an important antecedent of BI&A-enabled search. In particular, failures in financial performance, failures in operational performance, and their joint failures are important conditions that trigger BI&A-enabled search. We find that historical and social aspiration levels of financial and operational performance influence BI&A-enabled search during failures in operational performance. We also find that only in organizations experiencing a sustained failure in financial performance do operational performance failures trigger BI&A-enabled search and that the latency of search response is dependent on the speed of failure in financial performance. Through our findings, we make two important contributions: we extend the business value of IT literature by identifying the contextual conditions that trigger BI&A use for search and we extend problemistic search theory by theorizing for the differential effects of operational and financial performance failures.

AB  - In this study, we argue that institutional factors determine the extent to which hospitals are symbolic or substantive adopters of information technology (IT) specific organizational practices. We then propose that symbolic and substantive adoption will moderate the effect that IT security investments have on reducing the incidence of data security breaches over time. Using data from three different sources, we create a matched panel of over 5,000 U.S. hospitals and 938 breaches over the 2005-2013 time frame. Using a growth mixture model approach to model the heterogeneity in likelihood of breach, we use a two class solution in which hospitals that (1) belong to smaller health systems, (2) are older, (3) smaller in size, (4) for-profit, (5) nonacademic, (6) faith-based, and (7) less entrepreneurial with IT are classified as symbolic adopters. We find that symbolic adoption diminishes the effectiveness of IT security investments, resulting in an increased likelihood of breach. Contrary to our theorizing, the use of more IT security is not directly responsible for reducing breaches, but instead, institutional factors create the conditions under which IT security investments can be more effective. Implications of these findings are significant for policy and practice, the most important of which may be the discovery that firms need to consider how adoption is influenced by institutional factors and how this should be balanced with technological solutions. In particular, our results support the notion that deeper integration of security into IT-related processes and routines leads to fewer breaches, with the caveat that it takes time for these benefits to be realized.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Hospitals are characterized by high levels of technical expertise as well as patient interactions. In an attempt to improve their performance along these dimensions, hospitals are making significant investments in health information technologies (HIT). However, the performance benefits from these investments are largely unknown. This study employs a portfolio approach to study HIT adoption using a large longitudinal panel data for 3615 US hospitals from 2007 to 2012. Insights from the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) and existing HIT literature are used to categorize 76 HITs into 3 distinct bundles based on their extent of patient centered integration, and the extent of caregiver interaction. We then examine how two key HIT bundles: Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for patient data collection, diagnosis and treatment) and Augmented Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for integrating patient information and augmenting decision making capability of caregivers) jointly impact cost and process quality outcomes. Cost is measured in terms of total hospital operating expenses per bed while process quality is assessed along two dimensions: conformance quality or the ability to adhere to technical standards and experiential quality or the ability to cater to preferences of the patient. Results suggest complementarities between Clinical and Augmented Clinical HIT with respect to process quality but not cost outcomes. A follow-up post-hoc analysis which divides Augmented Clinical HIT into Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Non-EMR technologies offers additional explanation to the lack of association with cost. We discuss these implications to both theory and practice of HIT adoption.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - We examine the longitudinal impact of service mix on cost efficiency in U.S. acute care general hospitals. We propose two different dimensions of service mix, with the first dimension capturing internal emphasis on specific service lines (i.e., specialization) and the second dimension reflecting the deviation of a hospital from the average level of specialization for hospitals in the same service area (i.e., differentiation). We hypothesize that as the level of a hospital's specialization increases, hospital cost efficiency should improve at a decreasing rate. We also hypothesize that differentiation helps improve cost efficiency in competitive markets. Lastly, we examine whether acute care general hospitals can use service mix as an operational lever to improve cost efficiency when specialty hospitals are present in the same local markets. We find strong empirical support for the hypothesized relationships.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Online reviews are playing an increasingly important role in how patients select and evaluate health-care providers. Physician rating websites not only act as open platforms for patients to share their experiences, but can also offer valuable feedback for physicians to improve the quality of care. In this study, we analyze over one million physician reviews across 17 medical specialties and investigate the relationship between operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. We combine econometrics models with text analytics techniques to quantify the effect using both patients' ratings of physicians and their qualitative review narratives. The results provide strong empirical evidence that operational inefficiency negatively influences patient satisfaction. Specifically, a waiting time longer than 17 min will, on average, reduce the odds of getting a high rating status by 14%. Though many health care ratings examined in this study do not mitigate the negative effects brought on by long waiting time, patient narratives reflecting the importance of technical and interpersonal qualities to patients suggest a more complex set of relationships between waiting time and patient satisfaction. Our study showcases the usefulness of online physician reviews and reveals unique insights for improving the delivery of patient-centered health care.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Healthcare information technologies (HIT) have been promoted as key enablers of improved patient safety, reduced medical errors, and increased patient satisfaction but have yielded mixed results. Drawing upon information processing theory and quality management concepts, we examine HIT infrastructure simultaneously with two distinct means of processing information: (1) operational use of error data for detecting and reducing hospital errors, and (2) strategic use of objective data for organizational planning. We use time-sequenced data to examine HIT infrastructure (secondary data in 2008), information processing mechanisms (primary survey data from 258 hospitals in 2009), and two measures of hospital performance: (1) care quality, and (2) patient satisfaction (secondary data in 2010). Using hierarchical regression analysis we find that whether and how investments in HIT infrastructure are complemented by information processing mechanisms depends upon the performance measure under consideration and the form of information processing employed. Specifically, operational error processing complements HIT infrastructure in its association with higher care quality but not with patient satisfaction. In comparison, higher levels of strategic information processing complement HIT infrastructure in its association with higher patient satisfaction.

TI  - Managing Production Yields and Rework through Feedback on Speed, Quality, and Quantity
AU  - Gardner, John W.
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Balancing priorities of production speed and conformance quality is an ongoing challenge in production and operations management. Organizations may emphasize these priorities through various forms of performance feedback. However, the impacts of using feedback to emphasize speed, quality, and quantity remain unclear in production settings. This study employs controlled laboratory experiments to examine the impact of real-time feedback on production quantities, first time yield percentages, and rework percentages. Drawing on concepts from speed-accuracy tradeoffs, we study four types of feedback: speed, accuracy, joint speed and accuracy, and yields. Laboratory activities focus on the repetitive task of converting paper-based medical records to electronic data formats. These tasks are critical inputs to data analytics and are similar in nature to simple independent manufacturing and service tasks. We study feedback effects in a setting critical to practice but rarely studied in research, where workers are incentivized for both speed and quality as they perform production tasks that explicitly allow rework. The results show that production yields worsen under speed feedback but improve under each form of quality-containing feedback. Results also show that each form of quality-containing feedback increases the proportion of correctly reworked to produced errors through different mechanisms of increased error fixing, decreased error production, or both.

TI  - Inpatient Overflow: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach
AU  - Dai, J. G.
AU  - Shi, Pengyi
T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - Problem definition: Inpatient beds are usually grouped into several wards, and each ward is assigned to serve patients from certain "primary" specialties. However, when a patient waits excessively long before a primary bed becomes available, hospital managers have the option to assign her to a nonprimary bed. although it is undesirable. Deciding when to use such "overflow" is difficult in real time and under uncertainty. Relevance: To aid the decision making, we model hospital inpatient flow as a multiclass, multipool parallel-server queueing system and formulate the overflow decision problem as a discrete-time, infinite-horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP incorporates many realistic and important features such as patient arrival and discharge patterns depending on time of day. Methodology: To overcome the curse-of-dimensionality of this formulated MDP, we resort to approximate dynamic programming (ADP). A critical part in designing an ADP algorithm is to choose appropriate basis functions to approximate the relative value function. Using a novel combination of fluid control and single-pool approximation, we develop analytical forms to approximate the relative value functions at midnight, which then guides the choice of the basis functions for all other times of day. Results: We demonstrate, via numerical experiments in realistic hospital settings, that our proposed ADP algorithm is remarkably effective in finding good overflow policies. These ADP policies can significantly improve system performance over some commonly used overflow strategies-for example, in a baseline scenario, the ADP policy achieves a congestion level similar to that achieved by a complete bed sharing policy, while reduces the overflow proportion by 20%. Managerial implications: We quantify the trade-off between the overflow proportion and congestion from implementing ADP policies under a variety of system conditions and generate useful insights. The plotted efficient frontiers allow managers to observe various performance measures in different parameter regimes, and the ADP policies provide managers with operational strategies to achieve the desired performance.

AU  - Dai, Tinglong

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - A new generation of healthcare operations management (HOM) scholars is studying timely healthcare topics (e.g., organization design, design of delivery, and organ transplantation) using contemporary methodological tools (e.g., econometrics, information economics, and queuing games). A distinguishing feature of this stream of work is that it explicitly incorporates behavior, incentive, and policy considerations arising from the entanglements across multiple entities that make up the complex healthcare ecosystem. This focus is a departure from an earlier generation of research that primarily centered on optimizing given operations of a single entity. This paper provides an introduction to this burgeoning field and maps out research opportunities. We start with identifying key entities of healthcare delivery, financing, innovation, and policymaking, illustrating them on a healthcare ecosystem map (HEM). Next, we explore the HOM literature examining the interactions among various entities in the HEM. We then develop a taxonomy for the recent HOM literature (published in Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, Management Science, and Operations Research between 2013 and 2017), provide a tool-thrust graph mapping methodological tools with research thrusts, and situate the HOM literature in context by connecting it with perspectives from medical journals and mass media. We close with a reference to technological innovations that have the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem in future decades.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Abstract: The impact of information technologies on manufacturing operations and performance is well established. However, scant research has been devoted to examining information technology (IT) investment among hospitals and how it influences patient care and financial performance. Using the lens of the Theory of Swift Even Flow (TSEF), we present an operations management-based perspective on the effect of IT in streamlining hospital operations. Specifically, we examined the role of IT on patient flow and its consequences for improved hospital efficiency and performance. Analysis of data from 567 U.S. hospitals shows that IT is associated with swift and even patient flow, which in turn is associated with improved revenues. Interestingly, we find that the improvement in financial performance is not at the expense of quality because we find similar effects of IT and patient flow in improvements in the quality of patient care. Further, we observed differential effects of swift flow and even flow on various measures of hospital performance. Although swift flow affects financial performance, even flow primarily affects quality performance. Taken together, they have a mutually reinforcing overall impact on hospital performance. The implications of these findings for hospital decision makers are that patient flow is an important mediating variable that is affected by IT and can significantly affect the quality of patient care and financial performance.

We organize the prior findings under five distinct themes: importance of operational variables, importance of volume, routing patients through healthcare systems, to err is human, and managing the improvement process. We also identify several key areas of future research, including personalized medicine, value-based healthcare, and connected health. We conclude with a call to action for greater engagement with the medical community in areas where tools and insights of operations management can bring about improvements in healthcare delivery.

T2  - MIS Quarterly
AB  - Electronic health records (EHR) facilitate integration of patient health history for planning safe and proper treatment. Combined with data analytics, aggregate-level EHR enable examination and development of effective medicines and therapies for chronic diseases. Although promising efforts to implement EHRs are under-way, social and organizational challenges plague EHR development and widespread use. These challenges are due to lingering issues such as privacy, interoperability, and security among key stakeholders (patients, providers, and purveyors). Based upon stakeholders' needs and the issues, we identify two primary thematic areas-integration and analytics-in which the information systems (IS) discipline can contribute to EHRs. Through the accumulated body of knowledge, IS researchers are well positioned and have the expertise to design, develop, and facilitate the use of EHR in the delivery of healthcare. We identify potential research opportunities in each of the two thematic areas that have the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare.
We conclude with a recommendation for IS scholars to collaborate with allied healthcare disciplines in order to advance the use of EHR to improve patient care.

AB  - The healthcare industry represents a substantial portion of worldwide economic and social activities and initiatives and employs many people around the globe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that its member countries spend over 8% of gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare. The United States spends almost 18% of GDP and is projected to move closer to 20% in the near future (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2019). The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that there are over 59 million workers in the healthcare arena, while the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported that the United States alone has over 18 million (Centers for Disease Control, 2018; World Health Organization, 2019). Research about health-related problems by operations- management (OM) scholars is increasing: The Journal of Operations Management (JOOM) has published 22 papers on this topic (not including these in this special issue) since 2015. One reason research by OM scholars about healthcare processes has rapidly increased is the open access to rich data sets that enable investigations on core operational issues. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have collected and made avail- able volumes of data (e.g., Ding, 2013; Dobrzykowski, McFadden, & Vonderembse, 2016; Senot, Chandrasekaran, & Ward, 2016), enabling OM researchers to partner with medical professionals to examine pressing, real world, operational issues in healthcare.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This research examines the performance benefits of the Office of Patient Experience (OPX), a new administrative innovation in the health care industry. OPX is an independent structure within a hospital, having its own annual budget and full-time staff, and is responsible for improving patient experience during the hospital stay. We specifically investigate the effectiveness of OPXs in improving experiential quality (EQ), measured as the quality of interactions between hospital's caregivers and patients. In addition, we look at how the operation of these offices help hospitals manage variability during the delivery of care, which introduces additional challenges to maintaining high EQ. Specifically, we investigate the impact of variability in care delivery introduced due to two factors-patient case mix index (CMI) and resident intensity. CMI is an indicator of patient acuity and their care burden on hospitals while resident intensity is measured as a ratio of residents to beds at a hospital and is a proxy for variability introduced due to disruptions in caregiver teams due to the presence of residents who are getting trained at the hospital. Our empirical analyses involve tracking the operation of these offices across 3615 US acute care hospitals for the years 2007-2014. To account for endogeneity, we used an instrumental variable fixed effects regression model with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) on the first-stage to identify and select the strongest instruments. Findings suggest that the OPX is associated with 1.95% higher EQ for each year of its operation. Furthermore, we find that an OPX is more effective in improving EQ for hospitals that deal with high CMI patients (6.5% for high vs. -0.3% for low) or high resident intensity (1.8% for high vs. 0.9% low). Moreover, we find evidence of operating efficiencies associated with OPXs, with a 1.4% reduction in operating cost for each year of its operation. Preliminary evidence also suggests that Chief Patient Experience Officers (CXOs), leaders of OPX, with medical backgrounds (i.e., MD or nursing degree) are more effective at improving EQ. Finally, we validate our findings through interviews with OPX and hospital staff at a prominent teaching hospital with an active OPX.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Abstract: Doctors' orders entered with Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems are designed to enhance patient care by standardizing routines that are intended to improve quality of healthcare. As with other health information technology (IT) performance studies, literature shows conflicting results regarding the CPOE-performance relationship. By adopting a more nuanced perspective and employing not just adoption but extent of use of CPOE, we first examine whether or not CPOE use improves patient satisfaction. Next, given that CPOEs are implemented in the backdrop of other hospital IT infrastructure, we examine how IT infrastructure impacts the relationship between CPOE use and satisfaction, testing both a complementary and substitution perspective. Finally, we examine the differential impact of CPOE use between academic and non-academic hospitals. Using data from 806 hospitals nationwide, we find a positive relationship between extent of CPOE use and patient satisfaction. Contrary to extant research, our results suggest this relationship is stronger in non-academic hospitals. We also find evidence that a hospital''s IT infrastructure substitutes for CPOE use in its effect on patient satisfaction.

AB  - Behavioral operations is now an established and fundamental research field dedicated to understanding how the behavior of managers, workers, and customers influences operational decisions and outcomes. Just 20 years ago, behavioral research within operations management was relatively small and dispersed. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management has played an integral role in the field's development since then through its openness to new research questions and methodologies. In this article, we reflect on the research goals pursued in behavioral operations as well as the operational contexts explored. We also share thoughts on promising areas for future research.

AB  - Because of the importance, limited supply, and perishable nature of blood products, effective management of blood collection is critical for high-quality healthcare delivery. In this paper, working closely with the American Red Cross (ARC), we study a blood collection problem focusing on whole blood that is to be processed into cryoprecipitate (cryo), a critical blood product for controlling massive hemorrhaging. In particular, we aim to determine when and from which mobile collection sites to collect blood for cryo production, such that the weekly collection target is met while the collection costs are minimized. The cryo collection problem imposes a unique challenge: if blood collected is to be processed into cryo units, it has to be processed within eight hours after collection, while this time limit is 24 hours for most other blood products. To analyze the cryo collection problem, we first develop a mathematical program to represent and compare two different blood collection business models, namely, the status quo nonsplit model and an alternative model we propose, which splits each collection window into two intervals and allows different types of collections in the two intervals. Then, we establish several structural properties of the proposed mathematical program and develop a near-optimal solution algorithm to determine the cryo collection schedules under each collection model. Our extensive computational analyses based on real data indicated that, compared with the status quo, our proposed collection model can significantly reduce total collection costs. Based on this significant potential impact, our proposed collection model has been implemented by the ARC Douglasville manufacturing facility, the largest ARC blood manufacturing facility supplying blood to about 120 hospitals in the southern United States. Field data from postimplementation indicated that our proposed solution has resulted in (i) reducing inconsistencies in supply of cryo collections, and (ii) an approximately 40% reduction in the per-unit collection cost for cryo. Because of this success, the ARC is now at the stage of rolling out our proposed solution approach to other regions in the nation.

T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Addressing endogeneity can be a challenging task given the different sources of endogeneity and their impacts on empirical results. While premier business journals typically expect authors to rigorously address endogeneity, this expectation is relatively new to many Operations Management (OM) scholars, as exemplified by a recent editorial in Journal of Operations Management that calls for more rigorous treatment for endogeneity. This study serves two purposes. First, we summarize recent OM literature with respect to the treatment for endogeneity by reviewing studies published in leading OM journals between 2012 and 2017. The review provides evidence that endogeneity problems have received increasing attention from OM scholars. However, we also find some common problems that may render the chosen techniques for addressing endogeneity less effective and potentially lead to biased analysis results. Second, since instrumental variable regression is the most prevalent technique for dealing with endogeneity in the OM literature according to our review, we provide an empirical illustration tailored to OM researchers for using instrumental variable regression in the post-design (data analysis) phase. Using variables from a publicly available healthcare dataset, our analysis sheds light on the importance of examining instruments' quality and triangulating results based on more than one test/estimator.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Sensor-based home Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) monitoring systems have emerged to monitor elderly people's self-care ability remotely. However, the unobtrusive, privacy-friendly object motion sensor-based systems face challenges such as scarce labeled data and ADL performer confusion in a multi-resident setting. This study adopts the design science paradigm to develop an innovative deep transfer learning framework for human identification (DTL-HID) to address both challenges. A novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to automatically extract comprehensive temporal and cross-axial motion patterns for the DTL-HID framework. We rigorously evaluate the DTL-HID framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and alternative CNN designs). Results demonstrate our proposed DTL-HID framework can identify the ADL performer accurately even on a small amount of labeled data. We demonstrate a case study and discuss how stakeholders can further apply this approach to unobtrusive smart home monitoring for senior citizens. Beyond demonstrating the framework's practical utility, we discuss two implications of our design principles to mobile analytics and design science research: (1) extracting temporal and axial local dependencies can capture richer information from multi-axial time-series data and (2) transferring knowledge learned on a relevant source domain with sufficient data can improve the performance of the desired task on the target domain with scarce data.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - This study explores the process by which trust evolves over time. There have been a number of studies underscoring the importance of trust in the online environment. However, most trust studies have concentrated on the initial trust, and there is little known about how trust beliefs evolve over time. The dynamics of trust are of particular importance in the use of infomediaries (online information providers), among which health infomediaries are the most important for Web consumers in dealing with their wellness and health issues. We investigate the evolution of trust using the case of health infomediaries. The examination of the temporal changes in trust was carried out through two approaches-comparative statics and dynamic analyses. The research method was laboratory experiment and the data were collected for two episodes of encounters. Two comparative statics models and one dynamic model were estimated in order to examine the parameter changes from one episode of encounter to the next as well as the dynamics of belief changes. The results of analysis show that the structure of trust changes over time and information quality becomes the single most important antecedent in infomediary trust building in the later stages of use. Furthermore, our study also indicates that satisfaction plays an important role in changing Web customers' trust beliefs. Contributions as well as research and managerial implications are discussed.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This study focuses on determining the appointment scheduling for healthcare facilities with series patients. "Series" patients are patients who are scheduled for a series of appointments instead of a single appointment. Examples of healthcare services with series patients include radiotherapy/chemotherapy for cancer, physical therapy, kidney dialysis, diabetes treatment, etc. The aim of this study is to design appointment scheduling policies taking into account revenues per service per patient, costs of staffing, overtime, overbooking and delay. The appointment scheduling problem is formulated using an MDP model. However, due to the huge state space, computing the optimal policy is impractical. Hence, we propose the Index Policy (IP) based on a one-step policy improvement algorithm applied to the MDP model. We study a further simplification obtained by approximating the distribution of the number of patient visits by a Geometric distribution. A key analytical contribution is to prove the MDP to be a uni-chain, which implies that there exists an optimal policy that maximizes the long-run average profit. We also find that the IP provides a significant improvement over the other policies. Especially with the Geometric approximation, the IP requires minimal effort in implementing, and works almost as well. To test the effectiveness of our proposed IP in a real-world setting, we use the data from a local physical therapy center to compare its performance with two other commonly used policies, namely, the Next Available Day Policy and the Shortest Queue Policy. We recommend the IP with Geometric approximation for series patients' scheduling, which is computationally efficient and can significantly increases profits by incorporating the series feature of the patients' appointments. Finally, we provide analysis that incorporates several practical considerations such as accounting for patient heterogeneity in number of visits and inter-visit times, the option to reject new patients when the system is at full capacity, and incorporating patients with known number of visits at the time of the scheduling decision.

AB  - Health Information Exchanges (HIE) are becoming integral parts of the national healthcare reform efforts, chiefly because of their potential impact on cost reduction and quality enhancement in healthcare services. However, the potential of an HIE platform can only be realized when its multiple constituent users actively participate in using its variety of services. In this research, we model HIE systems as multisided platforms that incorporate self-service technologies whose value to the users depends on both user-specific and network-specific factors. We develop a model of adoption, use, and involvement of clinical practices in the coproduction of the HIE services. This model is grounded in social network theory, service operations theory, and institutional isomorphism theory. A longitudinal study of actual adoption and use behaviors of 2,054 physicians within 430 community medical practices in Western New York over a three-year period has been carried out to evaluate the proposed model. This study has been supported by HEALTHeLINK, the Regional Health Information Organization of Western New York, which has an extensive database comprising over half a million transactions on patient records by the HIE users. We extracted panel data on adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors from this database and carried out a detailed analysis using metrics derived from the foundational theories. Positioning practices within two distinct but interrelated networks of patients and practitioners, we show that adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors are influenced by the topographies of the two networks, isomorphic effects of large practices on the smaller ones, and practice labor inputs in HIE use. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the drivers of HIE adoption and use at the level of medical practices. These results have implications for marketing and revenue management of HIE platforms, as well as public health and national/regional healthcare policy making.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate whether social support exchanged in an online healthcare community benefits patients' mental health. We propose a nonhomogeneous Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model to examine the latent health outcomes for online health community members. The transition between different health states is modeled as a probability function that incorporates different forms of social support that patients exchange via discussion board posts. We find that patients benefit from learning from others and that their participation in the online community helps them to improve their health and to better engage in their disease self-management process. Our results also reveal differences in the influence of various forms of social support exchanged on the evolution of patients' health conditions. We find evidence that informational support is the most prevalent type in the online healthcare community. Nevertheless, emotional support plays the most significant role in helping patients move to a healthier state. Overall, the influence of social support is found to vary depending on patients' health conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed POMDP model can provide accurate predictions for patients' health states and can be used to recover missing or unavailable information on patients' health conditions.

AB  - Online health-care communities have become increasingly popular among patients, enabling them to connect to a large population of patients who suffer from similar health problems and to access massive amounts of health-related information. We are interested in investigating how other patients' consensus on treatment experiences affects patients' perceived treatment effectiveness. In this regard, we use the cue diagnosticity framework to examine patients' shared treatment reviews. By controlling individual heterogeneity and the inhomogeneous weighting function of social influence on patients, we find that consensus has a positive impact on patients' perceived treatment effectiveness. This positive effect, however, is negatively moderated by the characteristics of the shared information, including volume and patients' precommitment and social connectedness. Overall, we find that perceived treatment effectiveness is closely related to community participants' perceptions about the treatment. These findings can be used to help health-care practitioners incorporate patients' experiences into health-care systems and develop effective interventions to help patients better engage in their disease management.

TI  - Network Dynamics: How Can We Find Patients Like Us?

AB  - Social networks have been shown to affect health. Because online social networking makes it easier for individuals to interact with experientially similar others in regard to health issues and to exchange social support, there has been an increasing effort to understand how networks function. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to how these networks are formed. In this paper, we examine the driving forces behind patients' social network formation and evolution. We argue that patients' health-related traits influence their social connections and that the patients' network layout is shaped by their cognitive capabilities and their network embeddedness. By studying longitudinal data from 1,322 individuals and their communication ties in an online healthcare social network, we find that firsthand disease experience, which provides knowledge of the disease, increases the probability that patients will find experientially similar others and establish communication ties. Patients' cognitive abilities, including the information load that they can process and the range of social ties that they can manage, however, limit their network growth. In addition, we find that patients' efforts to reach out for additional social resources are associated with their embeddedness in the network and the cost of maintaining connections. Practical implications of our findings are discussed.

TI  - The Kindness of Commenters: An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of Perceived and Received Support for Weight-Loss Outcomes
AU  - Yan, Lu (Lucy)
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Social media-based online communities are becoming increasingly popular for various social interactions, including those for healthcare and health-related activities. The benefits from these activities, however, are constrained by how a platform is designed, as a platform's design defines what activities can be done and how individuals can engage and interact on the platform. In this study, we focus on weight-loss communities and social tools that facilitate social communication and establish a variety of relationships between users. In particular, we examine the effectiveness of one-way and two-way social relationships on individuals' weight-loss management. Drawing from theories of social support, social reciprocity, and social indebtedness, we use two-way friendship relationships to proxy perceived support and one-way commenting relationships to proxy received support and conjecture that they work through different pathways. We find, through empirical analyses, that both types of social relationships as well as self-monitoring are effective in promoting weight loss, but perceived and received support have different impacts. Whereas both perceived and received support are positively related to weight-loss outcomes, the effect of received support is found to be higher than that of perceived support and the difference is statistically significant. Moreover, we find that received support is positively associated with self-monitoring behaviors, whereas perceived support is not. These findings provide insights for platform providers to improve the social design aspect of online services and for healthcare practitioners in their efforts to advise individuals on weight self-management. Our results also can be used to design and implement more effective online interventions.

AB  - Using real data and process flows from two large hospitals (in Singapore and in Chengdu, China) as cases, we illustrate how to apply certain modeling and optimization techniques, along with simulation as a validation tool, to hospital resource planning problems. We demonstrate how these simple analytical tools can help achieve significant improvements in both patient service and resource utilization, and without the need to increase the overall level of existing capacities. Two resource planning problems are studied in detail, one concerns the rebalancing of bed capacities among various wards, and the other addresses the allocation of medical diagnostic resource among different types of patients.

AB  - Physicians' participation in online healthcare platforms serves to integrate online healthcare resources with the offline medical system. This integration brings opportunities for reshaping healthcare delivery systems. In the field of telemedicine, there has been an extensive discussion about physician participation, but little is known about how physicians actually participate in online healthcare platforms and offline medical systems. Understanding physicians' participation dynamics between online and offline channels is of great importance to academic researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. Such an understanding can reveal insights into how healthcare is actually delivered to patients through both channels, how to contribute to quantifying the social impacts of online healthcare services (Health 2.0), and how to improve healthcare delivery systems. Thus, in this study, we investigate physicians' online-offline behavior dynamics using data from both online and offline channels to conduct our analysis. As physicians' online and offline activities are highly endogenous, we deploy a time-series technique and develop a structural vector autoregression model to examine the behavior dynamics. We find that physicians' online activities can lead to a higher service quantity in offline channels, whereas offline activities may reduce physicians' online services because of resource constraints. Our results also show that the more offline patients physicians serve, the more articles the physicians will likely share online. These findings are robust to various econometric specifications and estimation methods. Our research advocates for the benefits Health 2.0 produces and provides evidence of the value of online healthcare communities and the policies that support them.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - With the strong ongoing push toward investment in and deployment of electronic healthcare (e-healthcare) systems, understanding the factors that drive the use of such systems and the consequences of using such systems is of scientific and practical significance. Elaborate training in new e-healthcare systems is not a luxury that is typically available to healthcare professionals-i.e., doctors, paraprofessionals (e.g., nurses) and administrative personnel-because of the 24 * 7 nature and criticality of operations of healthcare organizations, especially hospitals, thus making peer interactions and support a key driver of or barrier to such e-healthcare system use. Against this backdrop, using social networks as a theoretical lens, this paper presents a nomological network related to e-healthcare system use. A longitudinal study of an e-healthcare system implementation, with data gathered from doctors, paraprofessionals, administrative personnel, patients, and usage logs lent support to the hypotheses that: (1) ingroup and outgroup ties to doctors negatively affect use in all user groups; (2) ingroup and outgroup ties to paraprofessionals and administrative personnel positively affect use in both those groups, but have no effect on doctors' use; and (3) use contributes positively to patient satisfaction mediated by healthcare quality variables-i.e., technical quality, communication, interpersonal interactions, and time spent. This work contributes to the theory and practice related to the success of e-healthcare system use in particular, and information systems in general.

AU  - Tong, Yu

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - When an organization introduces an information system (IS), management often expects employees to utilize the system. However, rather than use the system directly, designated users may delegate some parts of their IS use to other users while assuming primary responsibility and accountability for the system use tasks. This behavior is called indirect IS use, a behavior that is acknowledged in some studies but not adequately scrutinized. This research distinguishes between direct and indirect IS use and proposes a model of their respective antecedents. The research was carried out in three stages. First, we conceptually distinguished direct and indirect IS use and drew on a social power lens to develop a theoretically driven research framework. Second, we contextually refined the research framework with a case study in a Confucian society. Third, we validated the research model through a survey of 213 Chinese physicians. Results revealed that direct and indirect IS use are partially substitutive, as demonstrated by the varying effects of social power and physiological power on these types of IS use. Further insights were gained by splitting the two forms of IS use based on the extent of clinical accountability risks and combining the two types of IS use based on their sum or relative amount. With the distinct relationships between social power and different forms of IS use, management could employ the appropriate strategies to influence the desired system usage behavior from its employees.

AB  - Based on our interactions with the key personnel of three different healthcare information exchange (HIE) providers in Texas, we develop models to study the sustainability of HIEs and participation levels in these networks. We first examine how heterogeneity among healthcare practitioners (HPs) (in terms of their expected benefit from the HIE membership) affects participation of HPs in HIEs. We find that, under certain conditions, low-gain HPs choose not to join HIEs. Hence, we explore several measures that can encourage more participation in these networks and find that it might be beneficial to (i) establish a second HIE in the region, (ii) propose more value to the low-gain HPs, or (iii) offer or incentivize value-added services. We present several other interesting and useful results that are somewhat counterintuitive. For example, increasing the highest benefit the HPs can get from the HIE might decrease the number of HPs that want to join the HIE. Furthermore, since the amount of funds from the government and the other agencies often changes (and will eventually cease), we analyze how the changes in the benefit HPs obtain from the HIE affect (i) participation in the network, (ii) the HIE subscription fee and the fee for value-added service, (iii) the number of HPs that request value-added service, and (iv) the net values of the HIE provider and HPs. We also provide guidelines for policy makers and HIE providers that may help them improve the sustainability of HIEs and increase the participation levels in these networks.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - In this paper, we study systems that allocate different types of scarce resources to heterogeneous allocatees based on predetermined priority rules-the U.S. deceased-donor kidney allocation system or the public housing program. We tackle the problem of estimating the wait time of an allocatee who possesses incomplete system information with regard, for example, to his relative priority, other allocatees' preferences, and resource availability. We model such systems as multiclass, multiserver queuing systems that are potentially unstable or in transient regime. We propose a novel robust optimization solution methodology that builds on the assignment problem. For first-come, first-served systems, our approach yields a mixed-integer programming formulation. For the important case where there is a hierarchy in the resource types, we strengthen our formulation through a drastic variable reduction and also propose a highly scalable heuristic, involving only the solution of a convex optimization problem (usually a second-order cone problem). We back the heuristic with an approximation guarantee that becomes tighter for larger problem sizes. We illustrate the generalizability of our approach by studying systems that operate under different priority rules, such as class priority. Numerical studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms simulation. We showcase how our methodology can be applied to assist patients in the U.S. deceased-donor kidney waitlist. We calibrate our model using historical data to estimate patients' wait times based on their kidney quality preferences, blood type, location, and rank in the waitlist.

AB  - Algorithmic matches in fielded kidney exchanges do not typically result in an actual transplant. We address the problem of cycles and chains in proposed matches failing after the matching algorithm has committed to them. We show that failure-aware kidney exchange can significantly increase the expected number of lives saved (i) in theory, on random graph models; (ii) on real data from kidney exchange match runs between 2010 and 2014; and (iii) on synthetic data generated via a model of dynamic kidney exchange. This gain is robust to uncertainty over the true underlying failure rate. We design a branch-and-price-based optimal clearing algorithm specifically for the probabilistic exchange clearing problem and show that this new solver scales well on large simulated data, unlike prior clearing algorithms. Finally, we show that failure-aware matching can increase overall system efficiency and simultaneously increase the expected number of transplants to highly sensitized patients, in both static and dynamic models.

AB  - The contextual bandit literature has traditionally focused on algorithms that address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In particular, greedy algorithms that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be suboptimal in general. However, exploration-free greedy algorithms are desirable in practical settings where exploration may be costly or unethical (e.g., clinical trials). Surprisingly, we find that a simple greedy algorithm can be rate optimal (achieves asymptotically optimal regret) if there is sufficient randomness in the observed contexts (covariates). We prove that this is always the case for a two-armed bandit under a general class of context distributions that satisfy a condition we term covariate diversity. Furthermore, even absent this condition, we show that a greedy algorithm can be rate optimal with positive probability. Thus, standard bandit algorithms may unnecessarily explore. Motivated by these results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new algorithm that uses only observed contexts and rewards to determine whether to follow a greedy algorithm or to explore. We prove that this algorithm is rate optimal without any additional assumptions on the context distribution or the number of arms. Extensive simulations demonstrate that Greedy-First successfully reduces exploration and outperforms existing (exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling or upper confidence bound.This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, big data analytics.

TI  - Rushed Innovation: Evidence from Drug Licensing
AU  - Hermosilla, Manuel
T2  - Management Science
AB  - We study the drug licensing behavior (acquisition of rights for developing drugs) of large pharmaceutical firms in the aftermath of large negative shocks to their pipelines, phase 3 failures (P3Fs). We find that P3Fs lead to increased licensing within a year of the event. This result is significant, because one year is a short window given the usual timelines-licensing is a lengthy process that requires extensive planning and careful execution. Supported by a series of additional results, we interpret this finding as a reflection of rushed firm behavior. Correspondingly, our main finding is that drugs licensed in these circumstances (within a year of a P3F event) underperform in subsequent development: they are significantly less likely to reach the market compared with others licensed in normal conditions. Further analysis suggests that this underperformance may stem from the influence of rush on activities taking place in the "last mile" of the licensing process and could hinge on the quality of the agreements that firms converge to during contract negotiations.This paper was accepted by Juanjuan Zhang, marketing.

AB  - Health information exchanges (HIEs) are healthcare information technology efforts designed to foster coordination of patient care across the fragmented U.S. healthcare system. Their purpose is to improve efficiency and quality of care through enhanced sharing of patient data. Across the United States, numerous states have enacted laws that provide various forms of incentives for HIEs and address growing privacy concerns associated with the sharing of patient data. We investigate the impact on the emergence of HIEs of state laws that incentivize HIE efforts and state laws that include different types of privacy requirements for sharing healthcare data, focusing on the impact of laws that include requirements for patient consent. Although we observe that privacy regulation alone can result in a decrease in planning and operational HIEs, we also find that, when coupled with incentives, privacy regulation with requirements for patient consent can actually positively impact the development of HIE efforts. Among all states with laws creating HIE incentives, only states that combined incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational HIEs; HIEs in those states also reported decreased levels of privacy concern relative to HIEs in states with other legislative approaches. Our results contribute to the burgeoning literature on health information technology and the debate on the impact of privacy regulation on technology innovation. In particular, they show that the impact of privacy regulation on the success of information technology efforts is heterogeneous: both positive and negative effects can arise from regulation, depending on the specific attributes of privacy laws.This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - This paper studies the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR) system on the productivity of physicians. Physicians influence a vast majority of treatment decisions and are central to the care delivery process; thus, it is important to understand how EMRs may impact the nature of their work. Our research builds on prior literature on physician productivity, IT productivity, and task-technology fit theory. We use a unique panel data set comprising 87 physicians specializing in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice, located in 12 primary care clinics of an academic healthcare system in the western United States. We employ the Arellano-Bond system generalized method of moments estimation technique on our data set, which contains 3,186 physician-month productivity observations collected over 39 months. We find that productivity drops sharply immediately after technology implementation and recovers partly over the next few months. The ultimate, longer-term impact depends on physician specialty. The net impact of the EMR system is more benign on internal medicine physicians than on pediatricians and family practitioners. We postulate that the fit provided by an EMR system to the task requirements of physicians of various specialties may be key to disentangling the productivity dynamics. Our research finds that on one hand, present-day EMR systems do not produce the kind of productivity gain that could lead to substantial savings in healthcare; at the same time, EMRs do not cause a major productivity loss on a sustained basis, as many physicians fear.

AU  - Chandrasekaran, Aravind

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - This research investigates the effect of process management on clinical and experiential quality. Clinical quality measures hospitals' performance on patient safety, i.e., adherence to standards, whereas experiential quality relates to patient centeredness, i.e., responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the patient. Drawing from the organizational learning literature, we argue for a trade-off between clinical and experiential quality as hospitals emphasize process management. We also study how external and internal forces, i.e., state legislation and hospital leadership, influence this relationship. A combination of primary data and secondary data collected at various time intervals is employed to test our hypotheses. Four important implications emerge from this work. First, we find that hospitals' emphasis on process management is associated with an increase in clinical quality but a decrease in experiential quality. Second, we find that state legislation initially reinforces this trade-off but, overtime, facilitates a positive impact of process management on both quality outcomes. Third, a post hoc analysis suggests that a specific type of hospital leadership, namely, patient-centered leadership, helps mitigate the negative association between process management and experiential quality. Finally, our research provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between clinical quality and patient satisfaction contingent on experiential quality. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Overcrowding in emergency rooms (ERs) is a common yet nagging problem. It not only is costly for hospitals but also compromises care quality and patient experience. Hence, finding effective ways to improve ER care delivery is of great importance. Using a large data set covering all emergency visits in New York State from 2010 to 2014, we investigate whether telemedicine enhances ER care delivery. We show that, on average, telemedicine availability in the ER significantly reduces average patients' length of stay (LOS), which is partially driven by the flexible resource allocation. Specifically, the adoption of telemedicine leads to a larger reduction in ER LOS when there is a demand surge or supply shortage. Furthermore, such improvement is not a by-product of other widely adopted health IT applications and does not come at the expense of care quality or patient cost. We also replicate the analysis using annual U.S. hospital data and find that ER telemedicine adoption significantly reduces average patients' waiting time, which suggests that the LOS reduction partially comes from the reduction of waiting time.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms invest billions of dollars in R&D, primarily in new drug discovery. Nonetheless, the industry is facing declining returns on R&D investments. Failure to discontinue less-promising new drug discovery projects is a key driver of this decreased productivity. Hence, firms are scrambling to restructure the new drug discovery process to improve decision-making and to limit the attrition rate to the early stages of drug discovery. Drawing on insights from the exploration-exploitation literature, our study addresses this timing problem by using a formal model and empirically testing its implications on how the time to discontinuation of new drug discovery projects are impacted by project- and firm-specific characteristics, so that a firm's resources can be promptly redeployed to more fruitful endeavors. Our findings, based on an analysis of 1274 early-stage drug discovery projects worldwide, suggest that the time to discontinuation of early-stage drug discovery projects requires careful consideration of these project- and firm-specific characteristics. These findings hold important implications for the industry, which is undergoing tremendous stress and transformation. The results also contribute to the exploration-exploitation literature by modeling and testing the time-allocation decision between exploratory and exploitative activities.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Although hospitals increasingly consider solutions based on information technolgy (IT) for revenue cycle management, contextual constraints and numerous IT investment alternatives make it difficult to identify and realize appropriate solutions. Thus far, however, health IT theory has been silent on how IT can support financial and administrative purposes within hospitals, focusing instead on IT for clinical support. Against this backdrop, we report on an action research project involving IT-enabled revenue cycle transformation in a financially strapped rural hospital. Our research contributes to health IT theory by expanding the discourse to include revenue cycle transformation and by demonstrating how resource-constrained hospitals can improve their financial performance through selective investments in low-cost IT solutions across the revenue cycle. We also contribute to action research methodology by generalizing our interventions to propose digital options inquiry-a systematic approach to business process transformation that combines digital options theory with diagnostic process mapping-to help researchers and practitioners jointly understand and transform business processes.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - We use detailed clickstream data on online word-of-mouth (WOM) to uncover mechanisms underlying its influence on consumer decision making. A feature launch on a major doctor appointment booking platform allows us to examine the effects of online WOM on three dimensions of a consumer's choice process: the consideration set size, the time taken to consider alternatives (web session duration), and the geographic dispersion of the choices considered. Results indicate that the effects of WOM on decision-making processes are not monotonic but rather are contingent on the abundance of WOM (number of rated doctors) in a market. When the abundance of WOM is high, the introduction of WOM makes patients consider fewer doctors, browse for a shorter duration, and focus on doctors that are geographically more proximate. In contrast, when the abundance of WOM is low, the introduction of WOM makes patients consider more doctors, browse for longer duration, and consider doctors that are geographically more dispersed. We also find that WOM can lead to a cannibalization effect: when ratings are published, the highly rated doctors reap the benefits (in the form of increased demand) at the expense of unrated doctors. Our study contributes to the extant literature on online WOM by providing new insights into how WOM influences consumer decision making and by examining this question at a more granular level than prior work.This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The gap between medical research on diagnostic testing and clinical workflow can lead to rejection of valuable medical research in a busy clinical environment due to increased workloads, or rejection of medical research in the lab that may be valuable in practice due to a misunderstanding of the system-level benefits of the new test. This has implications for research organizations, diagnostic test manufacturers, and hospital managers. To bridge this gap, we develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from which we create "adoption regions" that specify the combination of test characteristics medical research must achieve for the test to be feasible for adoption in practice. To address the curse of dimensionality from patient risk stratification, we develop a decomposition heuristic along with structural properties that shed light on which patients and when a new diagnostic test should be used. In a case study of a partner Emergency Department, we show that the conventional myopic medical criterion can lead to poor decision making in both research development and clinical practice. This myopic approach can lead to overvaluing or undervaluing new medical research. This mismatch is accentuated when a simple (current) policy is used to integrate research into the clinical environment compared with our MDP's policy - poor implementation of a new test can also lead to unnecessary rejection. Our framework provides easily interpretable guidelines for medical research development and clinical adoption decisions that can guide medical research as to which test characteristics to focus on to improve chances of adoption.

TI  - Research Commentary-The Disciplines of Information: Lessons from the History of the Discipline of Medicine
AU  - Schwartz, David G.
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - In this research commentary we show that the discipline of information systems (IS) has much that can be learned from the history of the discipline of medicine. We argue that as interest in historical studies of information systems grows, there are important historical lessons to be drawn from disciplines other than IS, with the medical discipline providing fertile ground. Of particular interest are the circumstances that surrounded the practice of the medical craft in the 1800's-circumstances that drove a process of unification and specialization resulting in the modern conceptualization of medical education, research, and practice. In analyzing the history of the field of medicine, with its long-established methods for general practice, specialization, and sub-specialization we find that it serves as an example of a discipline that has dealt effectively with its initial establishment as a scientific discipline, exponential growth of knowledge and ensuing diversity of practice over centuries, and has much to say in regards to a number of discipline-wide debates of IS. Our objective is to isolate the key factors that can be observed from the writings of leading medical historians, and examine those factors from the perspective of the information systems discipline today. Through our analysis we identify the primary factors and structural changes which preceded a modern medical discipline characterized by unification and specialization. We identify these same historic factors within the present-day information systems milieu and discuss the implications of following a unification and specialization strategy for the future of the disciplines of information.

AB  - To increase transparency of healthcare quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). However, the impact of PQRS on physicians is unclear, particularly as related to their online reputation. Is there an association between a physician's online reputation and her adherence to clinical guidelines stipulated in the PQRS? Is online reputation associated with use of electronic health records (EHR)? To investigate these questions, we combine data on online physician reviews with the PQRS data on clinical guideline adherence and EHR use. Unlike prior research, which primarily uses clinical outcomes as proxies for care quality, our study uses adherence to clinical guidelines, a process measure that reflects physician conformance with evidence-based clinical practices. In addition, we focus on EHR use at the physician level, in contrast to the usual approach of examining it at the aggregate institutional level. Consistent with the economic theory of credence goods, we observe no significant relationship between physicians' adherence to clinical guidelines and their online reviews. Although there is some evidence of association between EHR use and their overall rating, similar relationships are not consistently observed for individual dimensional ratings. Overall, the online reputation of a physician exhibits minimal association with her actual clinical activities - and is mostly driven by latent topics in the textual reviews - implying that the ability of online reviews to inform prospective patients of care quality might be quite limited. Therefore, patients should be cautious when using online physician reviews, and policymakers should increase the accessibility of PQRS and other similar data to help patients make informed physician choices.

AB  - Collaboration in complex and dynamic environments such as hospitals, airlines, and disaster response teams is challenging. High performance requires smooth coordination across multiple groups whose incentives, cultures, and routines can conflict. In this paper, we present an in-depth case study of a hospital's operating room practices to understand challenges associated with multiple group coordination and how information technology may help. We use the concept of trajectory to focus our observations and interviews on workflow across groups and critical events when coordination breaks down. A careful examination of the sources, coping mechanisms, and consequences of coordination breakdowns suggests three factors whose absence may impede effective responses to unexpected interruptions: (1) trajectory awareness of what is going on beyond a person's immediate workspace, (2) information systems integration, and (3) information pooling and learning at the organizational level. We conclude with technological recommendations to promote trajectory awareness and to automate information gathering and monitoring, so as to facilitate multiple group coordination in complex and dynamic task environments.

TI  - The Competitive Business Impact of Using Telemedicine for the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Conditions

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - The use of telemedicine to improve patients' health has been evolving rapidly over the past few years. Initially, our clinical research focus was on the development of effective ways for treating chronically ill patients, mostly those suffering from neurological disorders. While we identified the medical benefits of this information technology, there remains a salient strategic question addressing its competitive impact. In this paper, we analyze the impact of introducing telemedicine on the market share of the specialty hospital deploying this technology and on the competing hospitals in the region. Our analytical results prove that, contrary to earlier expectations, the value of telemedicine relative to in-person visits is not always increasing with the distance of the patient from the hospital. This result explains why patients located far from the specialty hospital may not prefer telemedicine care. We prove that telemedicine, unlike numerous other e-commerce applications, does not lead to the "winner takes all" phenomenon. We found that the advent of telemedicine changes the competitive equilibrium between specialty hospitals and community hospitals. Both hospital types will significantly benefit from delivering complementary care to chronic patients, rather than continuing to compete with each other.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Fragmentation of care delivery remains one of the main challenges of healthcare systems. In this study, we examine health information technology (HIT) that is electronically integrated across care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacists and its impact on quality of care. Drawing on the structure-process-outcome framework, we hypothesize that integrated HIT will have both a direct and an indirect effect on quality of care. By providing more complete information to physicians and allowing them to detect and manage health problems early in the care cycle, integrated HIT is expected to directly improve quality of care. Integrated HIT is also hypothesized to improve quality of care indirectly by increasing continuity of care and reducing the odds of therapeutic errors. We test these hypotheses through a contemporaneous natural experiment of a matched set of 15,626 outpatients receiving ambulatory care through an integrated HIT system and 15,626 outpatients in a control group. The results show that the patients treated with the integrated system had better quality of care in the follow-up period than patients of the control group. Integrated HIT also had an indirect effect on quality of care through an increase in continuity of care. Our study contributes to research by examining how an integrated HIT system-rather than specific HIT components-influences patient-related outcomes, and how this effect is mediated by two key processes: continuity of care and therapeutic duplication errors. Our work also helps decision makers to better understand the impact of HIT in a complex and highly decentralized and fragmented care delivery system.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Telemedicine services may improve the quality of life of individuals while also reducing the costs of service provisioning. They represent an important but as yet understudied type of complex services that integrates many stakeholders acting in service value networks. These complex services typically comprise a combination of information technology (IT) services and highly person-oriented, non-IT services, and are characterized by long service delivery periods. In such an environment, it is particularly difficult to generate successful and sustainable business models, which are necessary for the widespread provision of telemedicine services. Following a design research approach, we develop and evaluate the CompBizMod framework, a morphological box allowing for: (1) the analysis, description, and classification of telemedicine business models, (2) the identification of white spots for future business opportunities, (3) and the identification of patterns for successful business models. We contribute to the literature by presenting a specific business model framework and identifying three business model patterns in the telemedicine industry. We exhibit how business models for complex services can be decomposed into their constituent elements and present an easy and replicable approach for identifying business model patterns in a given industry.

TI  - Healthcare IT Adoption: An Analysis of Knowledge Transfer in Socioeconomic Networks

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Despite the potential of health information technology (HIT) systems to significantly reduce medical errors, streamline clinical processes, contain healthcare costs, and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare, their adoption by hospitals in the United States has been rather slow. To study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate HIT adoption.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Given the popularity and prevalence of medical question-and-answer (Q&A) services, it is increasingly important to understand what constitutes a helpful answer in the medical domain. Prior studies on user-generated content have examined the independent impacts of content and source characteristics on reader perception of the content's value. In the setting of medical Q&A sites, we propose a novel content-context congruence perspective with a focus on the role of congruence between an answer's content and the answer's contextual cues. Specifically, we identify two types of contextual cues critical in this unique setting-the language attributes (i.e., concreteness and emotional intensity) of the question's content, and the acuteness of the disease to which the question is related. Building on the priming literature and construal-level theory, we hypothesize that an answer will be perceived as more helpful if the language attributes of the answer's content are congruent with those of the preceding question, and if they are congruent with the disease's acuteness. Analyses of a unique data set from WebMD Answers provide empirical evidence for our theoretical model. This research deepens our understanding of readers' value judgment of online medical information, demonstrates the importance of considering the congruence of content with contextual cues, and opens up exciting opportunities for future research to explore the role of content-context congruence in all varieties of user-generated content. Our findings also provide direct practical implications for knowledge contributors and Q&A sites.

AB  - We investigate the incentive issues that surround the adoption and sharing of electronic health records (EHR) and the potential role of a personal health record (PHR) platform in facilitating data sharing. Through our analysis, we find evidence that health-care providers may not have an incentive to share patients' records electronically even though EHR systems will increase consumer surplus, especially in the presence of provider heterogeneity and myopic consumers. In this context, we find that an independent PHR platform can create incentives for the providers to share their patients' records electronically with other providers by selectively subsidizing them. In a pluralistic health-care system like that in the United States, where health-care providers have varying incentives to implement electronic health records, an online PHR platform can provide a proxy for a "national health information network,"' wherein consumers can freely exchange their health records among competing providers.

TI  - Genre Combinations: A Window into Dynamic Communication Practices
AU  - Osterlund, Carsten
T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - The notion of a genre system typically connotes sequences of interrelated communicative genres. This paper suggests that we can find other types of relationships among genres. Data from a field study in a large emergency room illustrate how doctors, nurses, and clerical staff routinely combine document genres not only in sequences but also in various accumulations achieved through proximity and movement. The combinations of genres add flexibility to the emergency room staff's genre use and allow them to employ individual genres for several purposes. The data allow us to explore how organizational members manage the tension between a need for continuity in communicative practices and a need for flexibility in managing a jumble of paper-based and digital information systems. In addition, it demonstrates how end users often tinker with genres' media and form in the process of altering combinations among specific genres.

AB  - In this paper we examine the use of electronic patient records (EPR) by clinical specialists in their development of multidisciplinary care for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. We develop a practice theory lens to investigate EPR use across multidisciplinary team practice. Our findings suggest that there are oppositional tendencies towards diversity in EPR use and unity which emerges across multidisciplinary work, and this influences the outcomes of EPR use. The value of this perspective is illustrated through the analysis of a year-long, longitudinal case study of a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and nurse specialists adopting a new EPR. Each group adapted their use of the EPR to their diverse specialist practices, but they nonetheless orientated their use of the EPR to each others' practices sufficiently to support unity in multidisciplinary teamwork. Multidisciplinary practice elements were also reconfigured in an episode of explicit negotiations, resulting in significant changes in EPR use within team meetings. Our study contributes to the growing literature that questions the feasibility and necessity of achieving high levels of standardized, uniform health information technology use in healthcare.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - To improve operational efficiencies while providing state of the art healthcare services, hospitals rely on information technology enabled physician referral systems (IT-PRS). This study examines learning curves in an IT-PRS setting to determine whether agents achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates and how information technologies transform the learning dynamics in this setting. We present a hierarchical Bayes model that accounts for different agent skills (domain and system) and estimate learning rates for three types of referral requests: emergency (EM), nonemergency (NE), and nonemergency out of network (NO). Furthermore, the model accounts for learning spillovers among the three referral request types and the impact of system upgrade on learning rates. We estimate this model using data from more than 80,000 referral requests to a large IT-PRS. We find that: (1) The IT-PRS exhibits a learning rate of 4.5% for EM referrals, 7.2% for NE referrals, and 12.3% for NO referrals. This is slower than the learning rate of manufacturing (on average 20%) and more comparable to other service settings (on average, 8%). (2) Domain and system experts are found to exhibit significantly different learning behaviors. (3) Significant and varying learning spillovers among the three referral request types are also observed. (4) The performance of domain experts is affected more adversely in comparison to system experts immediately after system upgrade. (5) Finally, the learning rate change subsequent to system upgrade is also higher for system experts in comparison to domain experts. Overall, system upgrades are found to have a long-term positive impact on the performance of all agents. This study contributes to the development of theoretically grounded understanding of learning behaviors of domain and system experts in an IT-enabled critical healthcare service setting.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - With the lack of timely and relevant patient information at the point of care increasingly being linked to adverse medical outcomes, effective management and exchange of patient data has emerged as a strategic imperative for the healthcare industry. Healthcare informaticians have suggested that electronic health record systems (EHRS) can facilitate information sharing within and between healthcare stakeholders such as physician practices, hospitals, insurance companies, and laboratories. We examine the assimilation of EHRS in physician practices through a novel and understudied theoretical lens of physicians' identities. Physician practices and the physicians that lead them occupy a central position in the healthcare value chain and possess a number of unique characteristics that differentiate them from other institutional contexts, including a strong sense of affiliation with other physicians, potent professional identities, and a desire for autonomy. We investigate two salient physician identities, those of careprovider and physician community, grounded in the roles physicians play and the groups with which they affiliate. We argue that these identities and their evolution, triggered by EHRS, manifest as both identity reinforcement and deterioration, and are important drivers of EHRS assimilation. We use survey data from 206 physician practices, spread across the United States, to test our theoretical model. Results suggest that physician community identity reinforcement and physician community identity deterioration directly influence the assimilation of EHRS. We further find that the effects of careprovider identity reinforcement and careprovider identity deterioration on EHRS assimilation are moderated by governmental influence. Theoretical and pragmatic implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Decision strategies in dynamic environments do not always succeed in producing desired outcomes, particularly in complex, ill-structured domains. Information systems often capture large amounts of data about such environments. We propose a domain-independent, iterative approach that (a) applies data mining classification techniques to the collected data in order to discover the conditions under which dynamic decision-making strategies produce undesired or suboptimal outcomes and (b) uses this information to improve the decision strategy under these conditions. In this paper, we formally develop this approach and illustrate it by providing detailed examples of its application to a chronic disease care problem in a healthcare management organization, specifically the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, the proposed iterative approach is used to improve treatment strategies by predicting and eliminating treatment failures, i.e., insufficient or excessive treatment actions, based on information that is available in electronic medical record systems. We also apply the proposed approach to a manufacturing task, resulting in substantial decision strategy improvements, which further demonstrates the generality and flexibility of the proposed approach.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - A new empirical model for the production function of the hospital incorporating two types of information systems (IS) is developed. One type of IS is representative of information technology (IT) used in primary, clinical, value-chain activities, and the other is representative of the IT used in support (administrative) value-chain activities. The model innovation is that it accommodates up to a seven-year lag for each type of IS. The output variables for the production function are hospital output and medical labor productivity. Using data spanning from 1979 to 2006 from several hospitals, it was found that clinical IS improve hospital output in the short run (of two years). Administrative IS were found to be negatively associated with organizational performance in the short run, but positively associated with these performance measures over the long run (over four years). These results highlight the importance of timing IT investments and the sequencing chosen for the implementation of IS presenting various value-chain activities, and the resulting pattern of business value over time. Differential lag length of the types of IS is to be considered in estimating the rate of return of new IT projects.

AU  - Menon, Nirup M.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Prior studies on the business value of information technology (IT) mainly focus on the impact of IT investments on productivity and firm profitability. Few have considered its implication on expected and actual product or service quality. This paper fills this gap by investigating the impact of past healthcare IT (HIT) expenditure on the malpractice insurance premium (MIP) and the moderating effect of past HIT expenditure on the relationship between past MIP and current quality of patient care in a longitudinal model. Based on archival panel data on costs, operations, and patient care outcomes of 66 hospitals in the U.S. state of Washington from 1998 to 2007, we find that past HIT expenditure is negatively associated with MIP, supporting our argument that HIT provides value that is anticipated by insurers and is captured by a change in MIP. We find that past HIT is positively associated with quality of patient care. We also find that past MIP is positively associated with quality of patient care, supporting the premise that hospitals respond to MIP by making risk mitigation efforts. However, we find that past HIT moderates this relationship negatively, suggesting a reliance on HIT at the expense of risk mitigation.

AU  - Mejia, Jorge

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - From an upset stomach to a life-threatening foodborne illness, getting sick is all too common after eating in restaurants. Although health inspection programs are designed to protect consumers, such inspections typically occur at wide intervals of time, allowing restaurant hygiene to remain unmonitored in the interim periods. Information provided in online reviews may be effectively used in these interim periods to gauge restaurant hygiene. In this paper, we use textual information from online reviews of restaurants to effectively identify cases of hygiene violations in restaurants, even after the restaurants have been inspected and certified, thereby identifying moral hazard. Using a data set of restaurant hygiene inspections in New York City from 2010 through 2016 and the associated set of online reviews for the same set of restaurants from Yelp, we use supervised machine learning techniques to develop a hygiene dictionary specifically crafted to identify hygiene-related concerns. The use of this dictionary and the related word counts in online reviews allows us to identify systematic instances of moral hazard, wherein restaurants with positive hygiene inspection scores are seen to regress in their hygiene maintenance within 90 days of receiving the inspection scores. To the extent that social media provide some visibility into the hygiene practices of restaurants, we argue that the effects of information asymmetry that lead to moral hazard may be partially mitigated in this context. Based on our work, we also provide strategies for how cities and policymakers may design effective restaurant inspection programs, through a combination of traditional inspections and the appropriate use of social media.

AU  - Ma, Xiao

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - The objective of this work is to examine various psychological forces underlying the behavior of people's online gambling, an increasingly popular form of entertainment in the gaming industry. Drawing on extant theories, we first developed a model of how cumulative outcomes, recent outcomes, and prior use affect online gambling behavior differently. We empirically tested the model using longitudinal panel data collected over eight months from 22,304 actual users of a gambling website. The results of a multilevel panel data analysis strongly supported our hypotheses. First, consistent with gambling theory, individuals' online gambling was found to increase with any increase in a cumulative net gain or cumulative net loss. Second, as the availability heuristic prescribes, a recent loss reduced online gambling, whereas a recent gain increased it. Third, consistent with the literature on repeated behavior, regular use and extended use moderated the relationship between current and subsequent gambling. Taken together, the present study clarifies how people react differently to immediate and cumulative outcomes and also how regular use and extended use facilitate routine behavior in the context of online gambling. In general, our findings suggest that the three perspectives, i.e., gambling theory, the availability heuristic, and repeated behavior, should be taken into account to understand online gambling, which is in essence a series of risk-taking attempts with the potential of eventually becoming routine behavior. This study is expected to offer valuable insights into other types of online games that could engage people in risking real or cyber money and, at the same time, could be easily enmeshed with everyday life (e.g., fantasy sports, online virtual worlds).

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Abundant empirical evidence supports the overall efficacy of social norms as a strategy to induce behavior change. However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual's digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users' goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms.

TI  - Do Electronic Health Records Affect Quality of Care? Evidence from the HITECH Act
AU  - Lin, Yu-Kai
AU  - Lin, Mingfeng

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act is landmark legislation that places electronic health record (EHR) technologies at the center of health system reform in the United States. However, despite their promises, studies in the EHR evaluation literature have found mixed evidence of EHRs' quality benefits. In contrast to existing research that has focused on EHR investments or adoption, we propose that its actual use should be the focus in evaluating the advantages of EHRs. We leveraged the meaningful use (MU) provisions of the HITECH Act to quantify different degrees of EHR use in a large and heterogeneous set of hospitals. The results provided evidence of EHRs' positive effects on quality of care and reconciled earlier mixed findings by showing that their benefits vary according to different levels of use and hospital characteristics. Specifically, we found that, although adopting EHRs had no significant quality impact, attaining MU of EHRs yielded a significant 0.19-0.43 percentage point increase in process quality of care, which further translates into significant societal benefits. The effect sizes were larger in disadvantaged (i.e., small and rural) hospitals, suggesting the potential of EHRs in mitigating the disparities in the quality of healthcare. This study contributes to this ongoing discussion and the literature on EHR evaluations and use of information systems. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.The online appendices are available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/isre.2018.0813.

AB  - Post-hospital care transitions involve coordination and continuity of care from hospital providers to patients and community providers. These care transitions represent a domain of high-risk interorganizational collaborations. However, a conversation about how health information technology (HIT) can enhance interorganizational knowledge transfer during care transitions is largely absent in the information systems literature. We conducted a review of qualitative studies of post-hospital care transitions to better understand barriers to knowledge transfer in high-risk interorganizational collaborations. Our analysis highlights how time pressures inhibit multilateral knowledge transfers, accommodation of fluctuating absorptive capacity, and reconciliation of knowledge and goal conflicts. We advance research questions that focus on HIT capabilities to ease these barriers.

AB  - Health information technology has increased accessibility of health and medical data and benefited medical research and healthcare management. However, there are rising concerns about patient privacy in sharing medical and healthcare data. A large amount of these data are in free text form. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing deal largely with structured data. Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identifiers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics fields. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a value-enumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world medical documents. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This study identifies how security performance and compliance influence each other and how security resources contribute to two security outcomes: data protection and regulatory compliance. Using simultaneous equation models and data from 243 hospitals, we find that the effects of security resources vary for data breaches and perceived compliance and that security operational maturity plays an important role in the outcomes. In operationally mature organizations, breach occurrences hurt compliance, but, surprisingly, compliance does not affect actual security. In operationally immature organizations, breach occurrences do not affect compliance, whereas compliance significantly improves actual security. The results imply that operationally mature organizations are more likely to be motivated by actual security than compliance, whereas operationally immature organizations are more likely to be motivated by compliance than actual security. Our findings provide policy insights on effective security programs in complex health-care environments.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Drawing on the rational addiction framework, this study explores the digital vulnerabilities driven by dependence on mobile social apps (e.g., social network sites and social games). Rational addicts anticipate the future consequences of their current behaviors and attempt to maximize utility from their intertemporal consumption choices. Conversely, myopic addicts tend toward immediate gratification and fail to fully recognize the future consequences of their current consumption. In lieu of conducting self-report surveys or aggregate-level demand estimation, this research examines addictive behaviors on the basis of consumption quantity at an individual level. To empirically validate rational addiction in the context of social app consumption, we collect and analyze 13-month, individual-level panel data on the weekly app usage of thousands of smartphone users. Results indicate that the average social app user conducts herself in a forward-looking manner and rationally adjusts consumption over time to derive optimal utility. The subgroup analysis, however, indicates that substantial variations in addictiveness and forward-looking propensities exist across demographically diverse groups. For example, addictive behaviors toward social network sites are more myopic in nature among older, less-educated, high-income groups. Additionally, the type of social app moderates the effects of demographic characteristics on the nature of addictive behaviors. We provide implications that policymakers can use to effectively manage mobile addiction problems, with the recommendations focusing on asymmetric social policies (e.g., information- and capacity-enhancing measures).

TI  - Does the Web Reduce Customer Service Cost? Empirical Evidence from a Call Center
AU  - Kumar, Anuj

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Firms are investing millions to deploy Web-based self-services at their call centers. The rationale for such investment is that the firm's cost of interacting with its customers through the Web-based channel is an order of magnitude cheaper than the assisted channels such as telephony. We conduct a field study at the call center of a prominent U.S. health insurance firm to examine this cost-saving rationale of the Web-based self-service channel. On the one hand, the Web channel may substitute for the telephony channel in some cases. On the other hand, the Web also exposes customers to a vast amount of information about their health policy, claims, and coverage; this information can create uncertainty leading to customers seeking more information and hence making more telephone calls. We designed a quasi-natural experiment in our field setting and used difference-in-difference specifications to show that the Web-based self-service usage leads to a 14% increase in telephone calls. We conduct several robustness checks to show that our specifications are robust to any potential selection of customers in the Web-based self-service usage. We further find that the impact of Web portal usage is moderated by the Web portal characteristics. We find that if the information is unambiguous and easily retrievable on the Web, calls for such information decline by 29%. However, for ambiguous information, the calls increase substantially. Our research provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of self-service technologies design.

AU  - Kokkodis, Marios

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - In an online community, users can interact with fellow community members by voluntarily contributing to existing discussion threads or by starting new threads. In practice, however, the vast majority of a community's users (≈90%) remain inactive (lurk), simply observing contributions made by intermittent (≈9%) and heavy (≈1%) contributors. Our research examines increases and decreases of types of user engagement in online communities using hidden Markov models. These models characterize latent states of user engagement from trace user activity or lack of activity. The resulting framework then differentiates lurkers who can later become workers (i.e., engaged in the community) from those who will not. Differentiating lurkers who can be engaged from those who cannot enables managers to anticipate and proactively direct their resources toward the users who are most likely to become or remain workers (i.e., heavy contributors), thereby promoting community welfare. Analysis of 533,714 posts from an online diabetes community shows that incorporating latent user engagement variables can significantly improve the accuracy of welfare prediction models and guide managerial interventions. Application of our framework to five additional communities of various contexts demonstrates its generalizability.

TI  - How Do EHRs and a Meaningful Use Initiative Affect Breaches of Patient Information?
AU  - Kim, Seung Hyun
AU  - Kwon, Juhee
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Given the cost of electronic health records (EHRs) to society and hospitals and the heightened concern about breaches of patient information, it is imperative to understand the risks that EHRs and the pursuit of a meaningful use (MU) initiative, apart from actual attestation of MU, may pose to the privacy of patient information. In this study, we examine how the adoption of EHRs and an MU initiative affect the occurrence of breaches of patient information. We also study whether and how EHRs and MU initiatives may increase the risk of accidental and malicious breaches of patient information. Using data from multiple sources, such as the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics™ Database, and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), our study shows that implementing EHRs leads to a 3.081 times higher risk of a breach of patient information. This heightened risk is mostly driven by the occurrence of more accidental breaches. Although the effect of an MU initiative on the overall number of breaches is not significant, undertaking MU increases the risk of accidental breaches 1.771 times. We also found that these risks increased more among relatively larger hospitals. However, simply having more components of EHRs does not necessarily increase the risk of breaches. Overall, our findings show that breaches of patient information may be rooted in the digitized data and processes enabled by technologies such as EHRs and their usage rather than resident in the technological components themselves. We conclude that, despite recent evidence that usage of EHRS has improved the quality of healthcare, quality must go hand in hand with the protection of patient information.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Question-and-answer (Q&A) forums are gaining popularity as a user-engagement tool to drive traffic on multiservice portals. In a platform market model, demand-side users seek answers from supply-side users because such answers can indicate value offered, reduce buyer uncertainty, and offer social proof. Analyzing user-generated content on the Q&A forum of a prominent healthcare portal, we find that the introduction of doctors' responses has a significant causal impact on demand-side user perception of medical services offered. More importantly, our research suggests that doctors' specialty, experience, qualifications, transparency in appointment booking, service fees, and response quality moderate the effect of doctors' Q&A responses on user recommendations. These results demonstrate that because of information asymmetry in healthcare, doctors use thoughtful online responses not only to socially interact with patients but also to signal their expertise.

AU  - Kane, Gerald C.
AU  - Labianca, Giuseppe (Joe)
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - The information systems (IS) literature has focused considerable research on IS resistance, particularly in the health-care industry. Most of this attention has focused on the impact of IS resistance on systems' initial implementation, but little research has investigated whether and how post-adoption resistance affects performance. We focus on a particular type of post-adoption resistance, which we call IS avoidance, to identify situations in which individuals avoid working with adopted IS despite the need and opportunity to do so. We examine the effects of IS avoidance on patient care delivered by health-care groups across three levels of analysis: the individual level, the shared group level, and the configural group level. We find that IS avoidance is significantly and negatively related to patient care only at the configural group level, which suggests that patient care is not degraded by the number of doctors and/or nurses in a group avoiding a system, but rather by their locations in the group's workflow network configuration. We use qualitative data collected over 16 months at the research site to help explain these results. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AU  - Kane, Gerald C.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Information systems (IS) researchers have typically examined the user-system relationship as an isolated dyad between a single, independent user and an individual, freestanding information system. We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes-efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes.

AB  - This paper investigates a web-based, medical research network that relies on patient self-reporting to collect and analyze data on the health status of patients, mostly suffering from severe conditions. The network organizes patient participation in ways that break with the strong expert culture of medical research. Patient data entry is largely unsupervised. It relies on a data architecture that encodes medical knowledge and medical categories, yet remains open to capturing details of patient life that have as a rule remained outside the purview of medical research. The network thus casts the pursuit of medical knowledge in a web-based context, marked by the pivotal importance of patient experience captured in the form of patient data. The originality of the network owes much to the innovative amalgamation of networking and computational functionalities built into a potent social media platform. The arrangements the network epitomizes could be seen as a harbinger of new models of organizing medical knowledge creation and medical work in the digital age, and a complement or alternative to established models of medical research.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - In pursuit of notable reputations, organizations commonly engage their stakeholders using various online mechanisms. While "reputation signaling" via online user engagement is commonplace, its implications in the context of user-generated content (UGC) remain largely unaddressed. This study empirically explores the impact of UGC on hospital reputational dynamics. A unique panel dataset was analyzed using a lagged model approach to determine the effects of signals of quality, awareness, and content variance on hospital prominence and quality as well as the impact of reputation on financial performance. The findings suggest that quality signals significantly impact patient-perceived quality ratings, and signals of awareness and content variance significantly impact prominence rating. Also, in contrast to prominence, perceived quality significantly impacts financial performance. Given the ready availability of user-generated feedback, these findings can inform patient-provider online engagement strategies and related budget allocations. Furthermore, they highlight the unique role of Facebook ratings as an antecedent to quality and prominence dimensions of reputation.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Technology implementation at the individual level within an organization, after the organization has adopted the technology, has been an ongoing challenge in every field. In this study, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian learning model to examine the impact of social learning, through both targeted early adopter effects and general peer effects, and experiential learning on the information technology implementation process by physicians in a community health system. Our unique data allow us to disentangle the most common and challenging endogeneity issues associated with most social influence studies. We find that the experiential learning signal is more accurate than the social learning signals in the technology implementation process; and, between the two types of social learning signals studied here, targeted early adopter effects are much more informative than general peer effects. Furthermore, we experiment with several policy simulations to illustrate and quantify the two different types of social influence on this implementation process. The simulation results suggest that maintaining consistency in technology usage by targeted early adopters is more effective than increasing the frequency of their technology usage in reducing their colleagues' perceptions of uncertainty about the new technology. More specifically, we find that technology implementation probability would increase: (a) by 15%, on average, by adding a targeted early adopter to a group without early adopters; (b) by 25% by adding peer effects to solo users; and (c) by 47% by adding early adopter effects to solo users. The model can be adapted and generalized to other similar settings that examine social influence on the technology implementation process and also provide quantifiable measures of the improvements that the interventions may produce.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - The U.S. healthcare system has experienced rapid growth in the adoption and use of clinical health information technology, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In a field as complex and pluralistic as healthcare, the introduction of these sweeping information technology platforms is transforming the practices, roles, interdependencies, and communication mechanisms that connect a heterogeneous mix of stakeholders. In this study, we assess the impact of EHR adoption and use on the practices of U.S. healthcare stakeholders and the institutional logics that they instantiate. We identify four prominent logics around the adoption and use of EHR systems-medical professionalism, private sector managerialism, technical design, and regulatory oversight. Our analysis reveals the ways in which practices enacted through EHR systems interact to engender a confluence of the institutional logics that mark the field. Specifically, we theorize a mechanism by which the reticulation, or intertwining, of practices mediated by an EHR system variously fosters complementarity and conflict between institutional logics based on the commensurability of the organizing principles invoked. This proposed framework offers a novel approach to the role of information system use in the institutional dynamics of the healthcare system. In addition, this research offers a range of practical insights regarding the ways in which the diverse institutional logics of the U.S. healthcare system may be impacted by the growth of EHR system use.

AB  - Despite the publicity regarding big data and analytics (BDA), the success rate of these projects and strategic value created from them are unclear. Most literature on BDA focuses on how it can be used to enhance tactical organizational capabilities, but very few studies examine its impact on organizational value. Further, we see limited framing of how BDA can create strategic value for the organization. After all, the ultimate success of any BDA project lies in realizing strategic business value, which gives firms a competitive advantage. In this study, we describe the value proposition of BDA by delineating its components. We offer a framing of BDA value by extending existing frameworks of information technology value, then illustrate the framework through BDA applications in practice. The framework is then discussed in terms of its ability to study constructs and relationships that focus on BDA value creation and realization. We also present a problem-oriented view of the framework-where problems in BDA components can give rise to targeted research questions and areas for future study. The framing in this study could help develop a significant research agenda for BDA that can better target research and practice based on effective use of data resources.

TI  - How Does the Implementation of Enterprise Information Systems Affect a Professional's Mobility? An Empirical Study

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Although significant research has examined the effect of enterprise information systems on the behavior and careers of employees, the majority of this work has been devoted to the study of blue- and gray-collar workers, with little attention paid to the transformative effect information technology may have on high-status professionals. In this paper, we begin to bridge this gap by examining how highly skilled professionals react to the increasing presence of enterprise systems within their organizations. Specifically, we investigate how the implementation of enterprise systems-in the form of electronic health records-affects the decision of physicians to continue practicing at their current hospital. Results suggest that when enterprise systems create complementarities for professionals, their duration of practice at the organization increases significantly. However, when technologies are disruptive and force professionals to alter their routines, there is a pronounced exodus from the organization. Interestingly, these effects are strongly moderated by individual and organizational characteristics, such as the degree of firm-specific human capital, local competition, and the prevalence of past disruptions, but are not associated with accelerated retirement or the strategic poaching of talent by competing organizations.

AU  - Gao, Guodong (Gordon)
AU  - Agarwal, Ritu
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Despite the significant potential for performance gains from health IT (HIT), there has been limited study of the mechanisms underlying successful HIT implementations. We conducted an extensive longitudinal field study to gain an understanding of the interplay between technology and patterns of clinical work embodied in routines. We use the analytical device of narrative networks to identify where and how HIT influences patterns of work. We further draw upon adaptive structuration theory to conceptualize HIT as an intervention that alters the flow of events in a narrative network. Our findings suggest that the key to successful implementation is to manage the co-evolution process between routines and HIT and to actively orchestrate a virtuous cycle through agentic action. We propose a dynamic process model of adaptive routinization of HIT that delineates the major channels through which HIT and routines interact, identifies the different stages in the dynamic co-evolution process, and isolates the pivotal role of two forms of agency in enabling the virtuous cycle of co-evolution. This is one of the first studies to offer a processual, microlevel analysis of HIT implementation in a clinical setting.

TI  - Releasing Individually Identifiable Microdata with Privacy Protection Against Stochastic Threat: An Application to Health Information
AU  - Garfinkel, Robert
AU  - Gopal, Ram
AU  - Thompson, Steven
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - The ability to collect and disseminate individually identifiable microdata is becoming increasingly important in a number of arenas. This is especially true in health care and national security, where this data is considered vital for a number of public health and safety initiatives. In some cases legislation has been used to establish some standards for limiting the collection of and access to such data. However, all such legislative efforts contain many provisions that allow for access to individually identifiable microdata without the consent of the data subject. Furthermore, although legislation is useful in that penalties are levied for violating the law, these penalties occur after an individual's privacy has been compromised. Such deterrent measures can only serve as disincentives and offer no true protection. This paper considers security issues involved in releasing microdata, including individual identifiers. The threats to the confidentiality of the data subjects come from the users possessing statistical information that relates the revealed microdata to suppressed confidential information. The general strategy is to recode the initial data, in which some subjects are "safe" and some are at risk, into a data set in which no subjects are at risk. We develop a technique that enables the release of individually identifiable microdata in a manner that maximizes the utility of the released data while providing preventive protection of confidential data. Extensive computational results show that the proposed method is practical and viable and that useful data can be released even when the level of risk in the data is high.

TI  - Research Note-Parenting New Acquisitions: Acquirers' Digital Resource Redeployment and Targets' Performance Improvement in the U.S. Hospital Industry
AU  - Du, Kui
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - This paper examines how information technology (IT) can contribute to value creation in horizontal acquisitions. We propose that acquisition value can be created when an acquirer redeploys its digital resources to its newly acquired businesses and consequently improves their operations. However, not all acquirers are equally capable of redeploying their digital resources. In this study, we propose two enabling factors pertaining to an acquirer's IT resource base: IT extensiveness and IT standardization. We argue that the magnitude of digital resource redeployment increases when the acquirer has had extensive use of IT systems within its existing business units and has standardized IT systems across its business units. Moreover, the relative strength of the IT resources of the acquirer, as compared to those of the acquired business, also affects the reuse of the acquirer's IT resources in its digital resource redeployment activities. We empirically test these hypotheses by tracking the IT and performance changes in 108 U.S. hospitals before and after they were acquired across a seven-year study timeframe.

AU  - Dimoka, Angelika

AU  - Davis, Fred D.
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - This paper introduces the idea of drawing upon the cognitive neuroscience literature to inform IS research (herein termed "NeuroIS"). Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience are uncovering the neural bases of cognitive, emotional, and social processes, and they offer new insights into the complex interplay between IT and information processing, decision making, and behavior among people, organizations, and markets.The paper reviews the emerging cognitive neuroscience literature to propose a set of seven opportunities that IS researchers can use to inform IS phenomena, namely (1) localizing the neural correlates of IS constructs, (2) capturing hidden mental processes, (3) complementing existing sources of IS data with brain data, (4) identifying antecedents of IS constructs, (5) testing consequences of IS constructs, (6) inferring the temporal ordering among IS constructs, and (7) challenging assumptions and enhancing IS theories.The paper proposes a framework for exploring the potential of cognitive neuroscience for IS research and offers examples of potentially fertile intersections of cognitive neuroscience and IS research in the domains of design science and human-computer interaction. This is followed by an example NeuroIS study in the context of e-commerce adoption using fMRI, which spawns interesting new insights. The challenges of using functional neuroimaging tools are also discussed. The paper concludes that there is considerable potential for using cognitive neuroscience theories and functional brain imaging tools in IS research to enhance IS theories.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Inpatient flow management plays a critical role in efficient care delivery, patient outcomes, and hospital operational and financial costs. Modeling and performance analysis of inpatient flow present unique features and challenges that differ from operations in other service industries. In this paper, we review recent modeling and analytical advances in the setting of inpatient flow management, with a particular focus on service time models motivated from the observations of inpatient discharges. We first compare two new service time models developed to capture the time-of-day inpatient flow dynamics and reveal interesting connections between the two models. We then review analytical methods developed to analyze systems with the new service time models. Based on one method, which is amenable to a one-dimensional exact analysis under certain conditions, we further introduce its approximations that have explicit analytical forms and enable efficient computations in large systems. In particular, we showcase how to leverage a powerful tool, the Stein's method framework, in the hospital setting for steady-state approximations and characterizing error bounds. We conclude the paper by a literature review on other important aspects in inpatient flow management and propose future research directions, from both the modeling and analytical perspectives.

TI  - Information Infrastructure Development and Governance as Collective Action
AU  - Constantinides, Panos
AU  - Barrett, Michael
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - In this paper, we examine the challenges around the development and scalability of information infrastructures. We identify two possible solutions proposed in the literature, one emphasizing more top-down control and the need for a clear IT governance framework, and a second arguing for a more flexible approach since absolute control is impossible and only leads to drift and unintended outcomes. We suggest that there is a clear gap in the literature in better understanding how to govern the development of information infrastructures using a bottom-up approach. We build on research that approaches IS development as a collective action problem and focus on how different actors frame the infrastructure as a public and private good, and how the framing process is underpinned by actors' different ideologies. We use our theoretical approach to examine the framing of the development of a regional health information infrastructure in Crete. Our analysis examines how different actors frame the infrastructure as a collective action good and explore their ideological positioning. We explore the struggle around meanings attributed to the good over time as being a public or private one in establishing or sustaining relations of power, and how legitimacy is challenged or reinforced. Finally, we develop contributions on the collective action challenges in infrastructure development and suggest how a polycentric approach to governance might be further developed to promote the ongoing cultivation of information infrastructures from the bottom up.

AB  - Increasing global connectivity makes emerging infectious diseases (EID) more threatening than ever before. Various information systems (IS) projects have been undertaken to enhance public health capacity for detecting EID in a timely manner and disseminating important public health information to concerned parties. While those initiatives seemed to offer promising solutions, public health researchers and practitioners raised concerns about their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news coverage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles-coupling and decoupling circles-between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS. We leverage the guidelines to evaluate current public health initiatives. By doing so, we identify limitations of existing public health IS, highlight the direction future development should consider, and discuss implications for research and public health policy.

However, questions remain as to how individual OHC participants are affected by the relationships they have established within an OHC and how the content exchanged between OHC participants impacts individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. To address these open questions, we develop a model that integrates participant network position (i.e., structural social capital) in an OHC, informational and emotional support exchange, and downstream individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. Based on a panel dataset collected from nine chronic disease-focused discussion boards within an OHC platform, we find that structural social capital is indeed a significant antecedent to social support exchange within an OHC and, interestingly, that social support provisioning (i.e., proactively aiding others) has a stronger effect than social support receipt on health literacy and health attitude improvement.

AB  - Problem definition: Given the variety of urgency levels in highly utilized operating rooms, capacity allocation decisions can have a major impact on how wait times are rationed. We examine a longer-term sequential capacity planning problem in which a hospital allocates operating room time to different surgical specialties. We seek to minimize an urgency-weighted wait-time metric. Academic/practical relevance: Our data set on patient selection patterns revealed considerable noise in the queuing discipline. We apply an urn model to generate a probabilistic queuing discipline, which validates well against the selection patterns observed in practice. We believe that this model may prove to be useful for representing noisy queuing disciplines in other settings. Also, our validated simulation model, in combination with our proposed solution approach, demonstrates a substantial reduction in urgency-weighed wait times. Methodology: For representing the noisy queuing discipline, we fit a Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution. We formulate the capacity allocation problem as a Markov decision process. The large state space and detailed system dynamics lead us to simulation-based dynamic programming approaches for finding good capacity allocation decisions. Rather than approximate the expected cost-to-go function, we propose a limited look-ahead policy and embed this in a rolling-horizon framework. Results: Our baseline model-based allocation policy yields a 14.3% reduction in urgency-weighed wait time compared with current practice. It also results in a 21.0% improvement in the number of patients treated within their urgency-based recommended wait-time limits. Managerial implications: In elective surgery settings, it may be important to ration capacity in a way that considers the different urgency levels of patients. We propose a flexible modeling approach for achieving this.

TI  - How Can We Develop Contextualized Theories of Effective Use? A Demonstration in the Context of Community-Care Electronic Health Records
AU  - Burton-Jones, Andrew

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - We contribute to the shifting discourse in the literature on information system use, towards context-specific (rather than general) theories and effective use (rather than just use). Organizations are under great pressure to use information systems effectively but they have few theories to turn to for insights. Motivated by this need, we propose an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use. The approach suggests that effective use can be theorized by: (1) understanding how a network of affordances supports the achievement of organizational goals, (2) understanding how the affordances are actualized, and (3) using inductive theorizing to elaborate these principles in a given context. We demonstrate the approach in the context of a Canadian health authority's use of a community-care electronic healthcare record (EHR). We discovered that effective use in this context can be viewed at a high level as the accuracy and consistency with which users work with the EHR, and how they engage in reflection-in-action across a network of nine affordances. The key, however, is understanding how those elements interact with the multiple levels of data needed to achieve the organization's various goals. Overall, we contribute by offering an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use, demonstrating its usefulness in an important context, and discovering the importance of understanding in a new way the multilevel nature of information systems.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/isre.2017.0702.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Fraud, waste, and abuse are significant problems in major industries such as healthcare, particularly when third-party payers such as Medicare are involved. Auditors looking for fraudulent activities use scoring models to select practitioners or claims that are likely to be fraudulent. In addition to the direct benefits of the audit effect, which evokes a response by auditing fraudulent individuals, the sentinel effect provides second-order benefits. Yet current auditing algorithms do not take the sentinel effect into account. In this paper, we present an algorithm that supports a deterrence-driven audit approach in the presence of audit and sentinel effects. Our results indicate that a significant reduction in healthcare excess costs can be achieved, while maintaining fairness, when auditing policies take sentinel effects into account.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/isre.2019.0841.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - How is value created in an online community (OC) over time? We explored this question through a longitudinal field study of an OC in the healthcare arena. We found that multiple kinds of value were produced and changed over time as different participants engaged with the OC and its evolving technology in various ways. To explain our findings, we theorize OC value as performed through the ongoing sociomaterial configuring of strategies, digital platforms, and stakeholder engagement. We develop a process perspective to explain these dynamics and identify multiple different kinds of value being created by an OC over time: financial, epistemic, ethical, service, reputational, and platform. Our research points to the importance of expanding the notion of OC users to encompass a broader understanding of stakeholders. It further suggests that creating OC value increasingly requires going beyond a dyadic relationship between the OC and the firm to encompassing a more complex relationship involving a wider ecosystem of stakeholders.

AU  - Baird, Aaron

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Web-based portals extend many convenient and collaborative capabilities to consumers and are being adopted by small firms with ever greater frequency, especially in the context of health care. The early adoption of patient portals by ambulatory-care clinics (outpatient health providers) presents a unique opportunity to more fully understand the characteristics of supply-side adopters in a context where firms (ambulatory-care clinics) are extending digital services to consumers (patients). Using diffusion of innovations literature and contingency theory as the theoretical base, we expand upon the firm characteristics traditionally considered to be predictors of adoption (e.g., firm size, slack resources, competition, capabilities, and management support) and examine how demand contingencies, service contingencies, and learning externality contingencies affect patient portal adoption by ambulatory-care clinics in the United States. We find that early adopters often have a structure in place that provides support for innovations (e.g., part of integrated delivery systems), as would be predicted by diffusion of innovation theory. We also find, though, that service contingencies associated with continuity of care, learning externality contingencies associated with local influences, and select demand contingencies associated with the local market significantly influence patient portal adoption decisions. Our findings suggest that the adoption and diffusion of patient portals may be affected by more than traditionally considered "dominant" firm characteristics and provide insights into how such customer-facing systems may be affected by contingent factors.

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - We use panel data from multiple wards from two hospitals spanning a three-year period to investigate the impact of automation of the core error prevention functions in hospitals on medical error rates. Although there are studies based on anecdotal evidence and self-reported data on how automation impacts medical errors, no systematic studies exist that are based on actual error rates from hospitals. Further, there is no systematic evidence on how incremental automation over time and across multiple wards impacts the rate of medical errors. The primary objective of our study is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining how the automation of core error prevention functions affects two types of medical errors. We draw on the medical informatics literature and principal-agency theory and use a unique panel data set of actual documented medical errors from two major hospitals to analyze the interplay between automation and medical errors. We hypothesize that the automation of the sensing function (recording and observing agent actions) will have the greatest impact on reducing error rates. We show that there are significant complementarities between quality management training imparted to hospital staff and the automation of control systems in reducing interpretative medical errors. We also offer insights to practitioners and theoreticians alike on how the automation of error prevention functions can be combined with training in quality management to yield better outcomes. Our results suggest an optimal implementation path for the automation of error prevention functions in hospitals.

AU  - Anderson, Catherine L.
AU  - Agarwal, Ritu
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - As healthcare becomes increasingly digitized, the promise of improved care enabled by technological advances inevitably must be traded off against any unintended negative consequences. There is little else that is as consequential to an individual as his or her health. In this context, the privacy of one's personal health information has escalated as a matter of significant concern for the public. We pose the question: under what circumstances will individuals be willing to disclose identified personal health information and permit it to be digitized? Using privacy boundary theory and recent developments in the literature related to risk-as-feelings as the core conceptual foundation, we propose and test a model explicating the role played by type of information requested (general health, mental health, genetic), the purpose for which it is to be used (patient care, research, marketing), and the requesting stakeholder (doctors/hospitals, the government, pharmaceutical companies) in an individual's willingness to disclose personal health information. Furthermore, we explore the impact of emotion linked to one's health condition on willingness to disclose. Results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 adults underscore the complexity of the health information disclosure decision and show that emotion plays a significant role, highlighting the need for re-examining the timing of consent. Theoretically, the study extends the dominant cognitive-consequentialist approach to privacy by incorporating the role of emotion. It further refines the privacy calculus to incorporate the moderating influence of contextual factors salient in the healthcare setting. The practical implications of this study include an improved understanding of consumer concerns and potential impacts regarding the electronic storage of health information that can be used to craft policy.

AU  - Ahsen, Mehmet Eren

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - When algorithms use data generated by human beings, they inherit the errors stemming from human biases, which likely diminishes their performance. We examine the design and value of a bias-aware linear classification algorithm that accounts for bias in input data, using breast cancer diagnosis as our specific setting. In this context, a referring physician makes a follow-up recommendation to a patient based on two inputs: the patient's clinical-risk information and the radiologist's mammogram assessment. Critically, the radiologist's assessment could be biased by the clinical-risk information, which in turn can negatively affect the referring physician's performance. Thus, a bias-aware algorithm has the potential to be of significant value if integrated into a clinical decision support system used by the referring physician. We develop and show that a bias-aware algorithm can eliminate the adverse impact of bias if the error in the mammogram assessment due to radiologist's bias has no variance. On the other hand, in the presence of error variance, the adverse impact of bias can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by the bias-aware algorithm. The bias-aware algorithm assigns less (more) weight to the clinical-risk information (radiologist's mammogram assessment) when the mean error increases (decreases), but the reverse happens when the error variance increases. Using point estimates obtained from mammography practice and the medical literature, we show that the bias-aware algorithm can significantly improve the expected patient life years or the accuracy of decisions based on mammography.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/isre.2018.0789.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Frequently, policy makers seek to roll out an intervention previously proven effective in a research study, perhaps subject to resource constraints. However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the treatment is large.This paper was accepted by Chung-Piaw Teo, optimization.

This database includes 236 empirical papers. We analyze the set of empirical papers to look for longitudinal trends and other bibliometric patterns. In particular, we show that (a) empirical research as a whole is gaining in popularity as measured by the publication rates in these three journals, (b) empirical papers in M&SOM are more likely to get citations than nonempirical papers, and (c) researchers are now more commonly using instrumental variables and are more likely to consider endogeneity challenges in their research design. Using our database, we propose three dimensions on which empirical operations management papers can be compared, including their main objective, their data sources, and their identification strategy.

We review 91 empirically focused papers published in M&SOM since its inception in 1999, classifying them based on data type and data collection methodology. The results show that although empirical operations management research has made great strides thus far, empirical research still lags analytic modeling, and much work remains to  be done. We  call on operations management scholars to broaden and increase their use of empirical tools as a vital source of new knowledge creation; and we highlight the benefits of filling methodological gaps, especially in case and survey research. Drawing on the dynamics associated with paradigm shifts, we offer a new research paradigm that we term combinative research value, in which these two empirical techniques, coupled with other approaches (e.g., web scraping, analyses of big data, and/or analytic modeling), can help accelerate our understanding of changing operating strategies and practices. We advocate for a tighter integration of analytical and empirical operations management  knowledge  in order  to  address the challenges and opportunities of the fast-paced, enormous forces of change in the 21st
century.

TI  - Updating Accounting Systems: Longitudinal Evidence from the Healthcare Sector

AB  - This paper provides evidence on the determinants and economic outcomes of updates of accounting systems (AS) over a 24-year timespan in a large sample of U.S. hospitals. We provide evidence that hospitals update their AS in response to three types of pressures: economic pressures, such as increases in the quality of accounting information driven by vendor rollouts of improved AS; coercive pressures imposed by regulators mandating certain practices, such as internal control practices imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404; and mimetic pressures for hospitals to conform their AS to those of their peers, such as local county and prominent "celebrity" peers. We find that only economically driven updates lead to economic benefits in the form of lower operating expenses and higher revenues. In contrast, we find some evidence that AS updates prompted by coercive regulatory pressures actually impose economic costs in the form of higher operating expenses.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

AB  - Mitigating preventable readmissions, where patients are readmitted for the same primary diagnosis within 30 days, poses a significant challenge to the delivery of high-quality healthcare. Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and advanced cancer is often treated with combinations of
multiple chemotherapy drugs. In this work, we develop models to predict the outcomes of clinical trials
testing combination chemotherapy regimens before they are run and to select the combination chemotherapy
regimens to be tested in new phase II and phase III clinical trials, with the primary objective of improving the
quality of regimens tested in phase III trials compared to current practice. We built a database of 414 clinical trials
for advanced gastric cancer and use it to build statistical models that attain an out-of-sample R2 of 0.56 when
predicting a trial's median overall survival (OS) and an out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 when
predicting if a trial has unacceptably high toxicity. We propose models that use machine learning and optimization
to suggest regimens to be tested in phase II and phase III trials. Though it is inherently challenging to evaluate the
performance of such models without actually running clinical trials, we use two techniques to obtain estimates for
the quality of regimens selected by our models compared with those actually tested in current clinical practice.
Both techniques indicate that the models might improve the efficacy of the regimens selected for testing in
phase III clinical trials without changing toxicity outcomes. This evaluation of the proposed models suggests that
they merit further testing in a clinical trial setting.

AU  - Ayal, Moshe

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - This paper identifies and measures the various business value benefits that accrue as a result of implementing and integrating large-scale enterprise information systems. Specifically, we look at the integration of electronic medical records for all patients with the radiology information system and a picture archiving and communication system at a regional medical center. Our work is among the first to carefully study and analyze the impact of enterprise information systems at a large-scale service organization that produces intangible outputs-health. It extends the literature on information economics by quantifying the benefits in process dynamics as a source of ongoing firm-level performance improvements. The key dimensions of measurements include financial revenues, operating lead times, and subjective satisfaction levels by the clinical staff and by the referring physicians. Analyses of longitudinal data suggest that performance levels along a key metric-clinical process lead time-showed a significant improvement immediately after the deployment and integration of the systems. The evidence reveals that performance kept improving for the following 12 months at an impressive learning rate of 63 percent. Moreover, the reported satisfaction level after installation was higher among referring physicians who actively used the full spectrum of technological functionalities at their own clinics or at the hospital's site. Finally, we present a general framework for capturing the actual tangible and intangible benefits of enterprise information systems installation and integration in a clinical context.

TI  - Dual Role of IT-Assisted Communication in Patient Care: A Validated Structure-Process-Outcome Framework
AU  - Angst, Corey M.

AU  - D'Arcy, John
T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Despite the fact that about 90 percent of information transactions in hospitals are communications between patients, doctors, nurses, and other staff, little research has addressed the role that information technology (IT) plays in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these communications-based transactions. Addressing this research gap is important considering that a substantial number of adverse hospital events stem from communication failures. Furthermore, effective communication is a major driver of patient satisfaction in hospitals. Using a structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework and guided by the strategic role of IT literature, we develop a model that includes "structure," operationalized as organizational characteristics and two different categories of IT; "process," two different communication-based processes; and "outcomes," quantified as case-mix adjusted mortality, patient loyalty, and patient ratings. Specifically, we hypothesize that a subset of clinical IT (cardiology IT) will affect technical protocols of patient care, which in turn affects mortality, while administrative IT will affect interpersonal patient care, which relates to patient loyalty and ratings. Thus, IT can serve as a double-edged sword affecting both technical and interpersonal processes of care, but possibly independently and differentially. We test our hypotheses on 2,179 hospitals using data collected and matched from three different sources. Our findings suggest that different types of IT differentially affect hospital processes and these same processes influence performance metrics such as mortality and patient satisfaction. For example, cardiology IT has a greater effect on objective patient health status through improvements in the technical protocols of care. Surprisingly, administrative IT was shown to adversely affect interpersonal care processes. It could be true that the IT is intrusive and interferes in the doctor-patient relationship; however, a post hoc analysis suggests the possibility of curvilinear impacts. Thus, managers should recognize that over- and underinvestment in IT can potentially have negative effects on performance and these results vary by IT type. Both technical and interpersonal processes yielded significant relationships to their respective outcomes and some cross-outcome effects were found, further suggesting that the mediating role of processes is an important link between IT and value.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - An online health-care community (OHC) is a novel channel through which doctors share medical or health-care knowledge with patients. While the sustainable development of an OHC relies on doctors' participation, we have limited information on how doctors can gain benefits from OHCs. In attempting to close this knowledge gap, we examine the determinants of social and economic returns of doctors at OHCs by extending the social exchange theory into the professional domain. The notion of professional capital, as a set of renewable resources for social professionals developed by good education within a territory of social practice, is introduced to understand the unique resources available to doctors for social exchange. Specifically, we examine the effects of status capital and decisional capital (two dimensions of professional capital) on doctors' social and economic returns. Moreover, we explore how such effects differ across different doctor groups. The results show that, in addition to the widespread pursuit of celebrity doctors (who can be recognized by their high status capital) offline, the doctor's decisional capital is also an important professional component in maintaining exchange returns at OHCs. This study provides empirical evidence of the relationship between professional capital and the exchange returns, and extends prior research on OHCs through a professional capital perspective with implications for theory and practice.

AB  - Contemporary organizations operate in highly interconnected environments where they are frequently confronted by the challenge of balancing the protection of information resources with the need for sharing information. This tension between the expected benefits and the potential security risks inherent in the information sharing process, exists in many domains, including business, health care, law enforcement, and military-yet it is not well-understood. We propose an information security control theory to explain and manage this tension. We evaluate this theory through a longitudinal case study of the iterative development of the information security policies for a health information exchange in the western United States. Our study shows that the theory offers a good framework through which to understand the information security policy development process, and a way to reconcile the tension between information sharing and information protection. The theory has practical applicability to many business domains.

T2  - Journal of Management Information Systems
AB  - Effectively incorporating complex technology into organizational practices requires moving beyond initial plateaus of postadoption usage. However, achieving this is especially challenging for small businesses because competing priorities in addition to resource and attention constraints may lead to technology assimilation satisficing. With this context in mind, we conducted a four-year action research project in which we supported electronic health record (EHR) assimilation in 10 small physician practices by facilitating reflections to help these small organizations move beyond an initial plateau of postadoption EHR usage. Drawing from these results, we theorize reflective technology assimilation (RTA) as an emergent process of facilitating deeper learning and reflection within and across small resource- and attention-constrained organizations to enable ongoing technology assimilation. In addition, we articulate the foundational principles for reflective action research (RAR) as an approach in which researchers facilitate reflective problem solving while advancing theoretical knowledge.

TI  - Active Social Media Management: The Case of Health Care
AU  - Miller, Amalia R.
AU  - Tucker, Catherine
T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Given the demand for authentic personal interactions over social media, it is unclear how much firms should actively manage their social media presence. We study this question empirically in a health care setting. We show that active social media management drives more user-generated content. However, we find that this is due to an incremental increase in user postings from an organization's employees rather than from its clients. This result holds when we explore exogenous variation in social media policies, employees, and clients that are explained by medical marketing laws, medical malpractice laws, and distortions in Medicare incentives. Further examination suggests that content being generated mainly by employees can be avoided if a firm's postings are entirely client focused. However, most firm postings seem not to be specifically targeted to clients' interests, instead highlighting more general observations or achievements of the firm itself. We show that untargeted postings like these provoke activity by employees rather than clients. This may not be a bad thing because employee-generated content may help with employee motivation, recruitment, or retention, but it does suggest that social media should not be funded or managed exclusively as a marketing function of the firm.

AB  - With greater impetus on broad postmarket surveillance, the Voice of the Customer (VoC) has emerged as an important source of information for understanding consumer experiences and identifying potential issues. In organizations, risk management groups are increasingly interested in working with their information technology teams to develop robust VoC listening platforms. Two key challenges have impeded success. First, prior work has leveraged diverse sets of channels, adverse event types, and modeling methods, resulting in diverging conclusions regarding the viability and efficacy of various user-generated channels and accompanying modeling methods. Second, many existing detection methods rely on "mention models" that have low detection rates, have high false positives, and lack timeliness. Following the information systems design science approach, in this research note we propose a framework for examining key design elements for VoC listening platforms. As part of our framework, we also develop a novel heuristic-based method for detecting adverse events. We evaluate our framework and method on two large test beds each encompassing millions of tweets, forums postings, and search query logs pertaining to hundreds of adverse events related to the pharmaceutical and automotive industries. The results shed light on the interplay between user-generated channels and event types, as well as the potential for more robust event modeling methods that go beyond basic mention models. Our analysis framework reveals that user-generated content channels can facilitate timelier detection of adverse events: on average, two to three years or earlier than commonly used databases. The inclusion of negative sentiment polarity in the models can further reduce false-positive rates. Additionally, we find social media channels provide higher detection rates but lower precision than do search-based signals. The search and web forum channels are timelier than Twitter. The proposed heuristic-based method attains markedly better results than do existing methods-with earlier detection rates of 50%-80% and far fewer false positives across an array of VoC channels and event types. The heuristic method is also well suited for signal fusion across channels. Our note makes several contributions to research. The results also have important implications for various practitioner groups, including regulatory agencies and risk management teams at product manufacturing firms.

AB  - Information and communication technologies that strengthen knowledge-based governance in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) will affect work processes and organizations on a massive scale. This paper draws attention to demands on public sector organizations in resource-constrained contexts that face different challenges than in high-income societies. This paper from the Indian public healthcare sector reports on design, development, implementation, and scaling of a free and open-source software-based hospital information system for district hospitals. The paper focuses on the implications for work, competencies, and organization, building on and extending the concepts of "automate" and "informate." The paper focuses on the emerging and recursive interplay between information infrastructure and work within the context of organizational realities of a district hospital in an LMIC context, captured by the concepts of "infrastructuring of work" and "work of infrastructuring."

TI  - Reducing Medicare Spending Through Electronic Health Information Exchange: The Role of Incentives and Exchange Maturity
AU  - Adjerid, Idris

T2  - Information Systems Research
AB  - Health information exchanges (HIEs) are entities that have emerged in healthcare delivery markets across the United States. By providing an interorganizational information system (IOIS) and governance over use of this system and the information exchanged through it, HIEs enable more routine and efficient electronic sharing of patient information between disparate and fragmented healthcare providers. This should result in improved quality and efficiency of care. However, significant questions persist about the extent to which HIEs produce these benefits in practice, particularly in terms of reducing healthcare spending. We use transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize that HIEs establish a quasi-hierarchy that decreases frictions associated with information sharing in ways that reduce healthcare spending, and that the magnitude of reductions is greater when (1) insurer and provider incentives align, and (2) HIE capabilities mature. We can test these conjectures because HIEs, unlike other efforts that provide IOIS, are typically confined to regional markets and develop heterogeneously between these markets, introducing variation in insurer-provider incentive alignment and HIE maturity. Leveraging a unique national panel data set, we evaluate whether HIEs reduce spending for the largest insurer in the United States, i.e., Medicare, and whether incentives and HIE maturity modify the magnitude of reductions. We find significant spending reductions in healthcare markets that have established operational HIEs, with an average reduction of $139 per Medicare beneficiary per year (1.4% decrease) or a $3.12 billion annual reduction in spending if HIEs were nationally implemented in 2015. We also find that these reductions occur disproportionately in healthcare markets where providers have financial incentives to use an HIE to reduce spending and when HIEs are more mature. Our results inform an important open empirical question in the healthcare domain related to the value of HIEs, while also joining perspectives from TCE with the IOIS literature to understand the factors that may be relevant to IOIS value creation more generally.

AB  - As the United States expends extraordinary efforts toward the digitization of its health-care system, and as policy makers across the globe look to information technology (IT) as a means of making health-care systems safer, more affordable, and more accessible, a rare and remarkable opportunity has emerged for the information systems research community to leverage its in-depth knowledge to both advance theory and influence practice and policy. Although health IT (HIT) has tremendous potential to improve quality and reduce costs in healthcare, significant challenges need to be overcome to fully realize this potential. In this commentary, we survey the landscape of existing studies on HIT to provide an overview of the current status of HIT research. We then identify three major areas that warrant further research: (1) HIT design, implementation, and meaningful use; (2) measurement and quantification of HIT payoff and impact; and (3) extending the traditional realm of HIT. We discuss specific research questions in each domain and suggest appropriate methods to approach them. We encourage information systems scholars to become active participants in the global discourse on health-care transformation through IT.

T2  - Organization Science
AB  - What difference does robotic telepresence make to the coordination of complex, dynamic, and distributed knowledge work? We explored this question in a post-surgical intensive care unit where medical workers struggled to coordinate their work in the face of different assessments of their extremely sick patients. Our in-depth field study examined night rounds, a central routine for coordinating work in this unit that was performed remotely through different technologies. We found that night rounds that are materially enacted through robotic telepresence intensify coordination outcomes both positively and negatively, resulting in contrary implications for subsequent coordination of work. We further found that these differences in intensification depend on whether preparatory work is more or less distanced from the bedside. We develop a theoretical account of these findings by explaining how the coordination of complex, dynamic, and distributed work is crucially related to how that work is materially enacted over time.

TI  - Achieving Time-Sensitive Organizational Performance Through Mindful Use of Technologies and Routines
AU  - Gardner, John W.
AU  - Boyer, Kenneth K.
AU  - Ward, Peter T.
T2  - Organization Science
AB  - Organizational performance is often dependent on the timing of critical processes and the simultaneous use of both technology and routines. Existing publications emphasize the importance of time sensitivity but also reflect divergent, untested perspectives. Prior works do not clearly explain or examine how different mechanisms are associated with achieving time-sensitive versus general (or non-time-sensitive) performance. We build on concepts from organizational mindfulness and organizational routines to address these gaps. Specifically, this paper examines how the mindful use of information technologies and adherence to specified routines are associated with both time-sensitive and general organizational performance. We employ split-group structural equation modeling based on high and low levels of information technology adoption to account for potential technology contingencies in performance. We use time-sequenced data from 262 U.S. hospitals to analyze two categories of clinical care quality: time-sensitive care and general care. The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with both time-sensitive and general performance in contexts with high technology adoption but not in those with low adoption. In contrast, adherence to specified routines is associated with time-sensitive performance in contexts with low technology adoption but not in those with high adoption. The results also clarify that high levels of technology adoption and mindful use may at times assume the place of specified routines in their association with time-sensitive performance. Finally, we find evidence that continuous improvement may bridge adherence to specified routines and mindful use of technologies.

T2  - Organization Science
AB  - We explore how members of a community of practice learn new tools and techniques when environmental shifts undermine existing expertise. In our 20-month comparative field study of medical assistants and patient-service representatives learning to use new digital technology in five primary care sites, we find that the traditional master-apprentice training model worked well when established practices were being conferred to trainees. When environmental change required introducing new tools and techniques with which the experienced members had no expertise, third-party managers selected newer members as trainers because managers judged them to be agile learners who were less committed to traditional hierarchies and more willing to deviate from traditional norms. This challenged community members' existing status, which was based on the historical distinctions of long tenure and expertise in traditional tasks. In three sites, the introduction of this illegitimate learning hierarchy sparked status competition among trainees and trainers, and trainees collectively resisted learning new tools and techniques. In the other two sites, managers paired the new, illegitimate learning hierarchy with the opportunity for trainee status mobility by rotating the trainer role; here, trainees embraced learning in order to exit the lower-status trainee group and join the higher-status trainer group. Drawing on ideas of status group legitimacy and mobility, we suggest that managers' pairing of an illegitimate learning hierarchy with the opportunity for trainee status mobility is a mechanism for enabling the situated learning of new techniques when traditional expertise erodes.

AU  - Catena, Rodolfo

AU  - Holweg, Matthias
T2  - Journal of Operations Management
AB  - Hospitals increasingly adopt standardized policies as a way to improve the efficiency of health care delivery. One key policy has been to reduce a patient's length of stay, which is commonly perceived as an effective means of improving patient outcome, as well as reducing the cost per procedure. We put this notion to the empirical test by using a database of 183,712,784 medical records of patients in the English NHS between 1998 and 2012, studying the effects of the NHS's policy of decreasing length of stay for hernia patients. While we found it to be an effective way of reducing the cost per procedure, on aggregate, we also found that it increases the risk of readmission and of death for vulnerable and elderly patients, unduly increasing the long-term failure costs of the operation for these patient groups. Based on our findings, we propose a differentiated policy to selectively decrease length of stay, which we estimate could save up to US$565 per nonemergency hernia procedure (19.97% reduction in the cost per procedure). We outline the implications of our findings for medical practice and discuss the wider theoretical contributions to the wider standardization-customization debate in health care operations management.

AB  - Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented by managers. Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2810.This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - Fee-for-service (FFS) contracts, first introduced in 2004, dramatically changed the way the pharmaceutical distribution supply chains are designed, managed, and operated. Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit-the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 107% on average, and as much as 505%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply-demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3063% on average and as much as 13001%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in American men and is screened for using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests. We report on a nonstationary partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for prostate biopsy referral decisions. The core states are the patients' prostate cancer related health states, and PSA test results are the observations. Transition probabilities and rewards are inferred from the Mayo Clinic Radical Prostatectomy Registry and the medical literature. The objective of our model is to maximize expected qualityadjusted life years. We solve the POMDP model to obtain an age and belief (probability of having prostate cancer) dependent optimal biopsy referral policy. We also prove a number of structural properties including the existence of a control-limit type policy for the biopsy referral decision. Our empirical results demonstrate a nondecreasing belief threshold in age, and we provide sufficient conditions under which PSA screening should be discontinued for older patients. Finally, the benefits of screening under the optimal biopsy referral policy are estimated, and sensitivity analysis is used to prioritize the model parameters that would benefit from additional data collection.

AB  - We study the impact of physician workload on hospital reimbursement utilizing a detailed data set from the trauma department of a major urban hospital. We find that the proportion of patients assigned a "high-severity" status for reimbursement purposes, which maps, on average, to a 47.8% higher payment for the hospital, is substantially reduced as the workload of the discharging physician increases. This effect persists after we control for a number of systematic differences in patient characteristics, condition, and time of discharge. Furthermore, we show that it is unlikely to be caused by selection bias or endogeneity in either discharge timing or allocation of discharges to physicians. We attribute this phenomenon to a workload-induced reduction in diligence of paperwork execution. We estimate the associated monetary loss to be approximately 101% (95% confidence interval, 004%-109%) of the department's annual revenue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - We consider an appointment-based service system (e.g., an outpatient clinic) for which appointments need to be scheduled before the service session starts. Patients with scheduled appointments may or may not show up for their appointments. The service of scheduled patients can be interrupted by emergency requests that have a higher priority. We develop a framework that can be utilized in determining the optimal appointment policies under different assumptions regarding rewards, costs, and decision variables. We propose two methods to evaluate the objective function for a given appointment schedule. We specifically consider two different formulations, both of which aim to balance the trade-off between the patient waiting times and server utilization and carry out a numerical study to provide insights into optimal policies. We find that policies that ignore interruptions perform quite badly, especially when the number of appointments to be scheduled is also a decision variable. We also find that policies that require equally spaced appointments perform reasonably well when the interruption rate is constant. However, their performance worsens significantly when the interruption rate is time dependent. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - The literature on business process design has focused on issues such as bottlenecks, workflow configuration (series versus parallel), replacing an existing workflow with a shorter one, etc. One important issue that has not received adequate attention is the information-intensive nature of medical service systems. Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - One key driver of improvement in surgical outcomes is a surgeon's prior experience. However, research notes that not all experience provides equal value for performance. How, then, should surgeons accumulate experience to improve quality outcomes? In this paper, we investigate the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience. We open up the black box of the volume-outcome relationship by going beyond just dividing experience into focal and related categories, but also considering how subtasks and context (i.e., the organization in which the work takes place) affect performance. To understand these issues, we assemble a novel data set on 71 cardiothoracic surgeons who performed more than 6,500 procedures during a period of 10 years after the introduction of a breakthrough surgical procedure. We find that, as compared to related experience, surgeon focal experience has a greater effect on surgeon performance. We also demonstrate that subtask experience has different, nonlinear performance relationships for focal and related experience. Finally, we find that focal experience is more firm specific than related experience and that nonfirm experience reduces the learning rate for both focal and related experience. We discuss implications of our findings for healthcare delivery and operations management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Performance-Based Contracts for Outpatient Medical Services.
AU  - Jiang, Houyuan

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - In recent years, the performance-based approach to contracting for medical services has been gaining popularity across different healthcare delivery systems, both in the United States (under the name of "pay for performance") and abroad ("payment by results" in the United Kingdom). The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal-agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an M=D=1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - We consider the work flow in a medical teaching facility, examining the process that involves an initial patient exam by a resident physician, a subsequent conference between the resident and the attending physician, and the attending physician's visit with the patient. We create an analytical model of a tandem queue with finite buffer space to analyze the impact of different work prioritization policies on the throughput and the flow time of patients in the facility-measures that influence both the facility's finances and patients' satisfaction. We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - We consider the problem of balancing two competing objectives in the pursuit of efficient management of operating rooms in a hospital: providing surgeons with predictable, reliable access to the operating room and maintaining high utilization of capacity. The common solution to the first problem (in practice) is to grant exclusive "block time," in which a portion of the week in an operating room is designated to a particular surgeon, barring other surgeons from using this room/time. As a major improvement over this existing approach, we model the possibility of "shared" block time, which need only satisfy capacity constraints in expectation. We reduce the computational difficulty of the resulting NP-hard block-scheduling problem by implementing a column-generation approach and demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using simulation, calibrated to a real hospital's historical data and objectives. Our simulations illustrate substantial benefits to hospitals under a variety of circumstances and demonstrate the advantages of our new approach relative to a benchmark method taken from the recent literature.

AB  - Provision of safe, timely care to hospital patients requires services from multiple support departments, such as environmental services and pharmacy. However, few studies have examined the impact of the service quality of internal support departments on clinical performance. The lack of studies linking internal service quality (ISQ) to clinical performance creates a gap in healthcare operations management theory and--from a practice standpoint--might contribute to underinvestment in the quality of services delivered by internal support departments. To address these issues, we test whether higher ISQ is associated with a lower rate of adverse events. We leverage a unique dataset from a hospital that developed a measure of ISQ provided by support departments. Using over a year's worth of monthly data on the average ISQ delivered by 11 support departments to five nursing units, we test the impact of ISQ on two nursing-sensitive adverse events: patient falls with injury and hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. We find support for our hypothesis that higher levels of ISQ are associated with lower rates of adverse events, controlling for patient acuity and other confounding factors. Our results show that improving the overall average ISQ received by a nursing unit by 0.1 on a 5-point scale has almost the same benefit for reducing adverse events as would increasing staffing on that unit by one full-time equivalent nurse. Our study has important implications for theory and practice as it points to a fruitful, cost effective, and yet underutilized avenue for reducing adverse events experienced by hospital patients.

TI  - Toward an Effective Design of Behavioral Health Care Delivery: An Empirical Analysis of Care for Depression
AU  - Zepeda, E. David

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - A criticism of behavioral health care delivery is that it has largely missed the social determinants of behavioral health disorders and their diagnosis. Toward addressing this criticism, this study evaluates the delivery of behavioral health care as a part of primary care operations. Focusing on the treatment of depression, the study results show that: (i) primary care clinics operating in communities with superior social environment characteristics are associated with improved depression outcomes in the short term, and (ii) psychosocial resources (social and emotional support) and the built environment (man-made resources and infrastructure to support human activity) of primary care clinics are associated with sustaining the improvement in depression outcome in the long term. Centering our attention on IT-enabled, evidence-based, and affordable primary care as mechanisms that can enable the integration of behavioral and medical care delivery, the results suggest that IT-enabled and evidence-based primary care are associated with improvements in depression outcomes. We also find that the effect of improving the affordability of behavioral health care delivery depends on the community's socioeconomic status. Primary care clinics in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities practicing cost-containment are associated with improvements in depression outcomes, and, therefore, can contribute toward reducing disparities in behavioral health care delivery. Counter to our original expectations, we find that the effect of evidence-based care on improvements on depression outcomes increases as the availability of medically trained behavioral health care specialists practicing in a community increases lending support to concerns that primary care clinics in resource-rich communities obtain greater benefit from quality improvement interventions.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Limited guidance is available for providing patient-specific care to hypertensive patients, although this chronic condition is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. To address this issue, we develop an analytical model that takes into account the most relevant risk factors including age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes status, smoking habits, and blood cholesterol. Using the Markov Decision Process framework, we develop a model to maximize expected quality-adjusted life years, as well as characterize the optimal sequence and combination of antihypertensive medications. Assuming the physician uses the standard medication dose for each drug, and the patient fully adheres to the prescribed treatment regimen, we prove that optimal treatment policies exhibit a threshold structure. Our findings indicate that our recommended thresholds vary by age and other patient characteristics, for example (1) the optimal thresholds for all medication prescription are nonincreasing in age, and (2) the medications need to be prescribed at lower thresholds for males who smoke than for males who have diabetes. The improvements in quality-adjusted life years associated with our model compare favorably with those obtained by following the British Hypertension Society's guideline, and the gains increase with the severity of risk factors. For instance, in both genders (although at different rates), diabetic patients gain more than non-diabetic patients. Our sensitivity analysis results indicate that the optimal thresholds decrease if the medications have lower side-effects and vice versa.

AU  - White, Denise L.

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - Capitalizing on the operational concept of division-of-labor, clinics often reduce physician service time by off-loading some of his/her clinical activities to lower-cost personnel. These personnel, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are often collectively referred to as 'mid-level providers' (MLPs) and can perform many patient-consultation tasks. The common rationale is that using an MLP allows the physician to serve more patients, increase patients' access to care, and, due to MLPs' lower salaries, improve the clinic's financial performance. An MLP is typically integrated into the outpatient clinic process in one of two modes: as an 'ice-breaker,' seeing each patient before the physician, or as a 'standalone' provider, a substitute for the physician for the entirety of some patients' visits. Despite both of these modes being widely used in practice, we find no research that identifies the circumstances under which either one is preferable. This study examines these two modes' effects on operational performance, such as patient flow and throughput, as well as on financial measures. Using queueing and bottleneck analysis, discrete-event simulation, and profit modeling, we compare these two deployment modes and identify the optimal policies for deploying MLPs as either ice-breakers or as standalone providers. Interestingly, we also find there exists a range of scenarios where not hiring an MLP at all (i.e., the physician works alone) is likely to be most profitable for the clinic. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - Many parts of the healthcare system remain fragmented and outpatient surgical care is no exception. In this study, we develop a coordinated pre-operative scheduling approach between Anesthesiology and Internal Medicine to optimize patients' medical conditions prior to surgery. Coordinating these two services has conceptual appeal because any health issues discovered by the anesthesiologist can often be addressed by a general internist. We design a patient-centered approach that allows the patient to see both providers, if necessary, on a single visit. This problem is modeled as a two-station stochastic network, where each station (or clinic) may be staffed by multiple parallel providers and patients see the first available provider. To solve the scheduling problem, we formulate an optimization model to maximize the net benefit of scheduling patients. The objective balances benefits against patient waiting time and clinic overtime costs. We develop a scheduling method with a booking limit to create a balanced network schedule. Due to the complexity of this problem, the solution approach is myopic. In addition, we develop a hybrid method that combines analytical calculation and simulation-based optimization. We demonstrate our approach on a healthcare network at The University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio. We compare our method against other policies and show that it yields high quality and robust results. Based on the level of generality of our model and results, the insights gained are not limited to the particular application, but can be applied to other patient-centered models where scheduling coordination can be used.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Nursing home managers are increasingly striving to ensure consistency of care, defined as minimizing the number of unique nurse aides who care for a resident during at least one shift over the course of one month. Unfortunately, managers often struggle to provide consistent care, primarily due to last-minute nurse aide absences and choosing to staff these absences with aides from an external rental agency. We are the first to study the use of an "on-call" pool-aides on staff who may be called in to work in the event of absences-as an operational strategy to improve consistency. We provide structural results for the relationship between the number of aides in the on-call pool, staffing cost, and inconsistency level. We also show that a "restricted" on-call pool-in which the slots in the pool are distributed as evenly as possible across units-outperforms an "open," or unrestricted, on-call pool. We further demonstrate that converting full-time positions to part-time positions can improve consistency of care if the part-time aides' on-call pool participation rate is sufficiently high. Numerical results for a typical 100-bed and a 200-bed facility demonstrate that an on-call pool can (a) reduce the staffing costs due to absences by 24% while also (slightly) reducing the inconsistency level, or (b) significantly reduce the inconsistency level without increasing costs.

Nine invited essays provide a wide range of perspectives on the role of big data in customer-driven supply chains, healthcare operations, retail operations, demand planning and manufacturing, environmental and social issues, humanitarian operations, agriculture supply chains, and service operations. Decision makers should have clean, valid, and reliable data, and they should have a thorough understanding of the contexts of applications. Big data shorten virtual distance to customers, and thus facilitate personalization of products and services. Successful implementation of big data applications requires sharing the data with appropriate stakeholders.

TI  - Role of Bottom-Up Decision Processes in Improving the Quality of Health Care Delivery: A Contingency Perspective
AU  - Senot, Claire
AU  - Chandrasekaran, Aravind

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Recent changes to health care reimbursements policy mandate hospitals to improve simultaneously on conformance and experiential quality. Conformance quality measures the level of caregivers' adherence to evidence-based standards of care while experiential quality measures the level of interaction between caregivers and patients. Hospitals operate in regulated environments characterized by heavy top-down control mechanisms that are conducible for improving conformance quality. However, mechanisms that propel experiential quality, which emerges from the operational-level interactions between caregivers and patients, remain unclear. This study employs a two-phase multi-method research to investigate this issue. The first phase uses qualitative data from five U.S. acute care hospitals involving 49 semi-structured interviews and develops hypotheses on the effect of bottom-up and top-down decision processes on hospitals' ability to simultaneously improve on conformance and experiential quality. These hypotheses are then tested and refined using secondary data for a sample of 3,124 U.S. acute care hospitals between the years of 2006 and 2012. Results from the case analyses suggest that Magnet status, a sign of bottom-up decision processes, is associated with hospitals' ability to improve on both conformance and experiential quality. However, hospitals' administrative intensity, which relates to top-down decision processes, appears to mitigate the effect of Magnet status on simultaneous improvement. Testing this framework using large-scale secondary data supports the positive effect of Magnet status on simultaneous improvement. However, we do not find support for a negative moderating effect of administrative intensity. A follow-up analysis reveals that this moderation is in fact curvilinear (inverted U-shape), which indicates that a moderate level of administrative intensity is most beneficial to the relationship between Magnet status and simultaneous improvement. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the complementary between top-down and bottom-up decision processes in hospitals.

TI  - Continuity of Care and Risk of Readmission: An Investigation into the Healthcare Journey of Heart Failure Patients
AU  - Senot, Claire
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - We investigate the association between continuity of care mechanisms and a patient's risk of readmission in the context of one chronic condition, heart failure. We define continuity of care as the level of consistency across patient care episodes. We dynamically measure continuity of individual referring provider; continuity of physical location, which links multiple individual providers; and continuity of Accountable Care Organization, which spans a variety of individual and institutional providers. We compile a unique large-scale dataset that includes patient-level claims, to follow heart failure patients throughout inpatient and outpatient settings in 2014. Our final sample covers 44,129 episodes of care for 3263 patients. Using a competitive-risks survival model, we find that all three continuity mechanisms are associated with a patient's lower risk of readmission. This exploratory study contributes to operations management literature by identifying effective integration mechanisms in the setting of healthcare delivery. In addition, by providing the first quantitative evidence for the critical role of multiple simultaneous mechanisms in ensuring continuity of care, this study offers important preliminary insights for public policy efforts.

AB  - Hospital decision-makers face trade-offs that make it difficult to obtain the trifecta of high performance on clinical quality, patient experience, and technical efficiency. We use the term "triple aim performance" (TAP) to refer to the simultaneous achievement of these three goals. Using datasets from 2010 and 2012 and data envelopment analysis, we identify about 20 triple aim performance hospitals in each year among U.S. acute care hospitals with at least 200 beds. We also examine factors that influence the probability of being a TAP hospital. We find that the percentage of physicians employed by the hospital has a positive and significant relationship with TAP, and that bed utilization rate has a positive relationship with technical efficiency, but a negative relationship with clinical quality and patient experience performance.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The ability to accurately forecast and control inpatient census, and thereby workloads, is a critical and long-standing problem in hospital management. The majority of current literature focuses on optimal scheduling of inpatients, but largely ignores the process of accurate estimation of the trajectory of patients throughout the treatment and recovery process. The result is that current scheduling models are optimizing based on inaccurate input data. We developed a Clustering and Scheduling Integrated (CSI) approach to capture patient flows through a network of hospital services. CSI functions by clustering patients into groups based on similarity of trajectory using a novel semi-Markov model (SMM)-based clustering scheme, as opposed to clustering by patient attributes as in previous literature. Our methodology is validated by simulation and then applied to real patient data from a partner hospital where we demonstrate that it outperforms a suite of well-established clustering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that extant optimization methods achieve significantly better results on key hospital performance measures under CSI, compared with traditional estimation approaches, increasing elective admissions by 97% and utilization by 22% compared to 30% and 8% using traditional estimation techniques. From a theoretical standpoint, the SMM-clustering is a novel approach applicable to any temporal-spatial stochastic data that is prevalent in many industries and application areas.

AB  - Patients' skills, knowledge, and motivation to actively engage in their health care are assessed with the patient activation measure (PAM). The literature on the role of PAM, when patient counseling is coupled with a technology enabled continuity of care intervention, is scant. We model the patient-health care provider feedback loop and learning through error corrections to explore the relations between continuity of care, PAM and patient readmissions. We test this model using data from a randomized, controlled field experiment. Our data show a direct effect of technology-enabled continuity of care, together with its interaction with PAM, reduces readmissions over the base case without technology enabled continuity of care. Using exploratory analysis, we further show how a machine learning algorithm can be used to predict PAM, that can potentially furnish health care providers with useful information during the process of supporting their patients.

TI  - Comparison of Subsidy Schemes for Reducing Waiting Times in Healthcare Systems
AU  - Qian, Qu
AU  - Guo, Pengfei
AU  - Lindsey, Robin
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This study analyzes subsidy schemes that are widely used in reducing waiting times for public healthcare service. We assume that public healthcare service has no user fee but an observable delay, while private healthcare service has a fee but no delay. Patients in the public system are given a subsidy s to use private service if their waiting times exceed a pre-determined threshold t. We call these subsidy schemes ( s, t) policies. As two extreme cases, the ( s, t) policy is called an unconditional subsidy scheme if t = 0, and a full subsidy scheme if s is equal to the private service fee. There is a fixed budget constraint so that a scheme with larger s has a larger t. We assess policies using two criteria: total patient cost and serviceability (i.e., the probability of meeting a waiting time target for public service). We prove analytically that, if patients are equally sensitive to delay, a scheme with a smaller subsidy outperforms one with a larger subsidy on both criteria. Thus, the unconditional scheme dominates all other policies. Using empirically derived parameter values from the Hong Kong Cataract Surgery Program, we then compare policies numerically when patients differ in delay sensitivity. Total patient cost is now unimodal in subsidy amount: the unconditional scheme still yields the lowest total patient cost, but the full subsidy scheme can outperform some intermediate policies. Serviceability is unimodal too, and the full subsidy scheme can outperform the unconditional scheme in serviceability when the waiting time target is long.

TI  - Are Patients Patient? The Role of Time to Appointment in Patient Flow
AU  - Osadchiy, Nikolay
AU  - Kc, Diwas
T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - The current state of outpatient healthcare delivery is characterized by capacity shortages and long waits for appointments, yet a substantial fraction of valuable doctors' capacity is wasted due to no-shows. In this study, we examine the effect of wait to appointment on patient flow, specifically on a patient's decision to schedule an appointment and to subsequently arrive to it. These two decisions may be dependent, as appointments are more likely to be scheduled by patients who are more patient and are thereby more likely to show up. To estimate the effect of wait on these two decisions, we introduce the willingness to wait (WTW), an unobservable variable that affects both bookings and arrivals for appointments. Using data from a large healthcare system, we estimate WTW with a state-of-the-art non-parametric method. The WTW, in turn, allows us to estimate the effect of wait on no-shows. We observe that the effect of increased wait on the likelihood of no-shows is disproportionately greater among patients with low WTW. Thus, although reducing the wait to an appointment will enable a provider to capture more patient bookings, the effects of wait time on capacity utilization can be non-monotone. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that increasing wait times can sometimes be beneficial for reducing no-shows.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Adequate length of stay (LOS) during hospitalization is not only a critical determinant of quality of care, but can be a useful predictor of the risk of future readmissions. Recent studies have shown alarming evidence that the United States leads developed nations in terms of shorter hospital stays, rendering patients with greater risk of future readmissions. We focus on deviation between hospital LOS and the geometric mean LOS (GMLOS), a guideline for care delivery stipulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Our objective is to establish the relationship between LOS and readmission risk, examine the role of health IT in reducing the deviation of LOS, and address cost trade-offs between early discharges and readmissions. Based on a large panel of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients during a 4-year period, we find that implementation of health IT applications is associated with a reduction in the deviation between LOS and GMLOS. This deviation is associated with a significant increase in future 30-day readmission risk. Patients whose inpatient stays are shorter than the GMLOS guideline, by 1 day or more, are likely to exhibit a 1.1% greater risk of readmission, and even shorter stays are likely to further exacerbate their readmission risk. Further, we find that the total readmission costs are much higher than the costs incurred in keeping patients longer during their initial hospital visit. Our results have important policy implications for providers and hospital administrators with respect to their discharge policies of CHF patients.

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - This study investigates judgment bias (under-reaction or over-reaction) in product recall decisions by firms when they respond to adverse event reports generated by users of their products. We develop an integrative theoretical framework for identifying the sources of judgment bias in product recall decisions. We analyze user-generated reports (big and unstructured data) on adverse events related to medical devices, using a combination of econometric and predictive analytic methods. We find that (i) noisy signals in user feedback, that is, high noise-to-signal ratio, are associated with under-reaction likelihood; and (ii) user feedback related to adverse events characterized by high severity is associated with high over-reaction likelihood. We also identify conditions related to the situated context of managers that are associated with under-reaction or over-reaction likelihood. The findings of this study are consequential for firms and government regulatory agencies, in that they shed light on the sources of judgment bias in recall decisions, thereby ensuring that such decisions are made correctly and in a timely manner. Our findings also contribute toward improving the post-launch market surveillance of products (e.g., medical devices) by making it more evidence-based and predictive.

AU  - Lu, Lauren Xiaoyuan

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - We empirically investigate the pattern of where heart attack patients are transferred between hospitals. Using 2011 Florida State Emergency Department and Inpatient Databases, we demonstrate the relative importance of three key factors in determining transfer destinations: (1) the distance between sending and receiving hospitals, (2) publicly reported quality measures of receiving hospitals, and (3) the relationship between sending and receiving hospitals as indicated by whether they are affiliated with the same multihospital system. Our conditional logit analysis shows that hospital relationship plays a more dominant role in determining transfer destinations than distance and quality. This result is robust to three alternative specifications of choice sets using distance ranking, radius circles, and Hospital Referral Regions, and also robust to alternative measures of distance and quality. Using 30-day readmission rate to evaluate the health outcome of transferred patients, we find that relationship-based transfers led to worse outcome than distance-based and quality-based transfers. We also find that nonprofit hospitals are more likely to conduct quality-based transfers and less likely to conduct relationship-based transfers than their for-profit counterparts. Our study calls for reevaluating the current practice of relationship-driven routing of heart attack patients-selecting transfer destinations based on quality or distance can potentially decrease hospital readmission rate.

TI  - The Boarding Patient: Effects of ICU and Hospital Occupancy Surges on Patient Flow
AU  - Long, Elisa F.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Patients admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) often endure prolonged boarding within the ICU following receipt of care, unnecessarily occupying a critical care bed, and thereby delaying admission for other incoming patients due to bed shortage. Using patient-level data over two years at two major academic medical centers, we estimate the impact of ICU and ward occupancy levels on ICU length of stay (LOS), and test whether simultaneous "surge occupancy" in both areas impacts overall ICU length of stay. In contrast to prior studies that only measure total LOS, we split LOS into two individual periods based on physician requests for bed transfers. We find that "service time" (when critically ill patients are stabilized and treated) is unaffected by occupancy levels. However, the less essential "boarding time" (when patients wait to exit the ICU) is accelerated during periods of high ICU occupancy and, conversely, prolonged when hospital ward occupancy levels are high. When the ICU and wards simultaneously encounter bed occupancies in the top quartile of historical levels-which occurs 5% of the time-ICU boarding increases by 22% compared to when both areas experience their lowest utilization, suggesting that ward bed availability dominates efforts to accelerate ICU discharges to free up ICU beds. We find no adverse effects of high occupancy levels on ICU bouncebacks, in-hospital deaths, or 30-day hospital readmissions, which supports our finding that the largely discretionary boarding period fluctuates with changing bed occupancy levels.

AB  - Hospital readmissions affect hundreds of thousands of patients every year, negatively impacting patients and placing a tremendous burden on the national healthcare system. Post-discharge checkup policies can reduce readmissions through early detection of health conditions, however, the methods behind designing effective checkup policies are poorly understood. Under current practice, up to 67% of readmitted patients return to the hospital before their first scheduled office visit. This work aims to develop effective checkup plans to monitor patients following hospital discharge, using a variety of checkup methods, including phone calls and office visits. We develop and analyze a new delay-time analysis model to identify the optimal type and timing of checkups to implement post-discharge monitoring plans. By analyzing the structure of optimal policies, we develop checkup schedules that can detect up to 43.7% more readmission-causing conditions experienced by readmission-bound patients. Further, we uncover simple rules of thumb that can help doctors design and improve monitoring plans even in the absence of advanced computer software or complex computations.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Despite the fact that hospital care is often delivered in successive stages, current healthcare scheduling and capacity planning methods usually treat different hospital units in isolation. To address such a shortcoming, we introduce the first Markov decision process model for scheduling surgical patients on a daily basis, explicitly taking into account patient length-of-stay in hospital after surgeries and inpatient census. By way of a simple and yet innovative variable transformation, we reveal the hidden submodularity structure in our model. This transformation, in particular, allows us to show that the optimal number of patients to admit increases when the waitlist of surgical patients is longer, given the number of patients recovering downstream is fixed. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to study the applicability of our theoretical model in various settings. Our simulations based on real data demonstrate substantial values in making integrated scheduling decisions that simultaneously consider capacity usage at all locations in a hospital, especially when demand and system capacities are balanced or more elective patients present in the patient mix. The traditional scheduling policy, which is solely driven by operating room usage, however, can lead to significantly suboptimal use of downstream capacity and, as our numerical experiments show, may result in up to a three-fold increase in total expenses. In contrast, a scheduling policy based on downstream capacity usage often performs relatively close to the integrated scheduling policy, and therefore may serve as a simple, effective scheduling heuristic for hospital managers-especially when the downstream capacity is costly and less flexible.

TI  - Optimal Choice for Appointment Scheduling Window under Patient No-Show Behavior
AU  - Liu, Nan
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Observing that patients with longer appointment delays tend to have higher no-show rates, many providers place a limit on how far into the future that an appointment can be scheduled. This article studies how the choice of appointment scheduling window affects a provider's operational efficiency. We use a single server queue to model the registered appointments in a provider's work schedule, and the capacity of the queue serves as a proxy of the size of the appointment window. The provider chooses a common appointment window for all patients to maximize her long-run average net reward, which depends on the rewards collected from patients served and the 'penalty' paid for those who cannot be scheduled. Using a stylized M/M/1/K queueing model, we provide an analytical characterization for the optimal appointment queue capacity K, and study how it should be adjusted in response to changes in other model parameters. In particular, we find that simply increasing appointment window could be counterproductive when patients become more likely to show up. Patient sensitivity to incremental delays, rather than the magnitudes of no-show probabilities, plays a more important role in determining the optimal appointment window. Via extensive numerical experiments, we confirm that our analytical results obtained under the M/M/1/K model continue to hold in more realistic settings. Our numerical study also reveals substantial efficiency gains resulted from adopting an optimal appointment scheduling window when the provider has no other operational levers available to deal with patient no-shows. However, when the provider can adjust panel size and overbooking level, limiting the appointment window serves more as a substitute strategy, rather than a complement.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - We study outpatient appointment block scheduling policies for single providers under conditions of patient heterogeneity in service times and patient no-shows. The objective is to find daily appointment schedules that minimize a weighted sum of patients' waiting time, the physician's idle time, and the physician's overtime. We contribute by suggesting new effective sequential block scheduling procedures motivated by actual outpatient clinic practices across the globe and grounded in the successful Toyota Production System load smoothing approach. Our block scheduling policy first assigns a sequence of different patient types within a time block. The policy then allocates repetitive blocks across a planning horizon. We start our analysis by studying the case with zero probability of no-shows. Under the setting that the physician's idle time is zero, we propose a polynomial time optimal scheduling approach for two patient types, before demonstrating that the problem with at least three patient types is NP-Hard. Various extensions to incorporate practical outpatient clinic environment dimensions are considered. We then extend our scheduling approach to incorporate reasonable patient no-show probabilities. Finally, our block scheduling approach is adapted for scenarios where outpatient clinics use an open-access scheduling environment, where patients make same-day appointments. We compare our block scheduling policies against extant scheduling policy, finding our block scheduling policies surpass the benchmark method.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The healthcare industry has invested heavily in electronic health records and other clinical information systems in order to improve caregivers' access to information and ability to share information with other care providers. It has been shown that these systems can readily induce in their users a state of information overload, where the volume and complexity of information overwhelms the user, leading to lower decision speed and quality. This research introduces and tests a cognitive technique called "emphasis framing" as an operational tactic to help mitigate the effects of information overload, thereby improving the quality and timeliness of clinical decision-making. Emphasis framing is the highlighting or stressing of some aspect or component of the information being exchanged in order to make it more easily processed, or more likely to be processed, by the recipient. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with emergency department physicians experiencing information overload to measure the effect of emphasis framing on two operational performance metrics: (1) the quality of the physician's clinical evaluation, and (2) the efficiency (timeliness) of the physician's clinical decision-making. Our findings show that the emphasis frame helped mitigate the effects of information overload and increased the quality of clinical decision-making. Contrary to expectations, however, we found decision-making took longer with the emphasis frame, reinforcing the need to consider the impacts of quality/speed trade-offs. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Health information exchanges ( HIEs) are new organizational forms in the United States that facilitate digital exchange of health data across participants. Many believe that these multi-sided digital platforms will become key enablers of the digital transformation of healthcare in the United States. However, like other entrepreneurial ventures, HIEs face challenges to achieve operational maturity and financial viability. Entrepreneurial ventures often fail to attain financial viability due to the initial design of the business model and the inability to evolve the model over time. We focus on the influence of service offerings, revenue models, and their evolution on the viability of HIEs. Using a unique archival dataset constructed from surveys of HIEs in the United States from 2008 to 2010, we find that providing an extensive service bundle may lead to higher operational maturity with the HIE's increasing age, but this may deter the HIE's potential to achieve financial viability. The findings also show that the influence of service offerings on financial viability is mediated by operational maturity. Qualitative evidence corroborates these findings and suggests that HIEs need to move from providing a set of foundational services to offering more advanced services as they evolve and that they need to appropriately bundle the services using transaction-, subscription- or mixed-fee models. We discuss how these findings contribute to research at the intersection of operations management and information systems and offer important implications for HIEs with regard to crafting and evolving appropriate service offerings and revenue models.

AU  - Jia, Justin

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Drug shortages have been a major challenge facing the US pharmaceutical industry and government in recent years. Although the problem has drawn tremendous attention from the government and media, limited academic research has been devoted to this problem, and few solutions have been proposed based on rigorous research. This study addresses the drug shortage problem from a supply chain perspective, a key aspect missing in the literature, and proposes to mitigate shortages through drug purchase contracts. By modeling the drug supply chain, we capture the objectives of various supply chain parties, and investigate Pareto-improving contracts that mitigate drug shortages, improve drug manufacturer's and group purchasing organization (GPO)'s profits, and cut government spending and healthcare providers' costs. We explore structural properties of key supply chain decisions and the Pareto-improving contracts, and conduct scenario analysis with realistic industry data to evaluate shortage mitigation solutions. Our analysis shows that increasing drug prices only, a solution advocated by many, is not very effective in shortage mitigation. Price increases must be paired with strengthened failure-to-supply clauses (called the IPS approach) to achieve consistent and significant shortage reduction as well as Pareto improvement. Across all scenarios tested, a 30% price increase under IPS can lead to a minimum, average, and maximum shortage reduction of 25%, 53%, and 70%, respectively. Our analysis also shows the impacts of IPS on different parties in the supply chain and the impacts of various model parameters on shortage mitigation. The IPS approach rewards reliability of drug supply, which is in line with the FDA's strategic plan to reward quality, but is easier to achieve in this regulation-based industry. Interactions with the government and industry practitioners indicate that IPS also challenges the current mindset in pharmaceutical contracting.

AB  - The big data revolution is making vast amounts of information available in all sectors of the economy including health care. One important type of data that is particularly relevant to medicine is observational data from actual practice. In comparison to experimental data from clinical studies, observational data offers much larger sample sizes and much broader coverage of patient variables. Properly combining observational data with experimental data can facilitate precision medicine by enabling detection of heterogeneity in patient responses to treatments and tailoring of health care to the specific needs of individuals. However, because it is high-dimensional and uncontrolled, observational data presents unique methodological challenges. The modeling and analysis tools of the production and operations management field are well-suited to these challenges and hence POM scholars are critical to the realization of precision medicine with its many benefits to society.

AB  - Hospital readmissions present an increasingly important challenge for health-care organizations. Readmissions are expensive and often unnecessary, putting patients at risk and costing $15 billion annually in the United States alone. Currently, 17% of Medicare patients are readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of initial discharge with readmissions typically being more expensive than the original visit to the hospital. Recent legislation penalizes organizations with a high readmission rate. The medical literature conjectures that many readmissions can be avoided or mitigated by post-discharge monitoring. To develop a good monitoring plan it is critical to anticipate the timing of a potential readmission and to effectively monitor the patient for readmission causing conditions based on that knowledge. This research develops new methods to empirically generate an individualized estimate of the time to readmission density function and then uses this density to optimize a post-discharge monitoring schedule and staffing plan to support monitoring needs. Our approach integrates classical prediction models with machine learning and transfer learning to develop an empirical density that is personalized to each patient. We then transform an intractable monitoring plan optimization with stochastic discharges and health state evolution based on delay-time models into a weakly coupled network flow model with tractable subproblems after applying a new pruning method that leverages the problem structure. Using this multi-methodologic approach on two large inpatient datasets, we show that optimal readmission prediction and monitoring plans can identify and mitigate 40-70% of readmissions before they generate an emergency readmission.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - In this study, we examine performance-based payment contracts to promote the optimal use of an optional diagnostic test for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Our work is inspired by three trends: tremendous increases in the cost of new, advanced cancer drugs; development of new diagnostic tests to allow physicians to tailor treatment to patients; and changes in healthcare funding models that reward quality care. We model the interaction between two parties-a healthcare payer and an oncologist, in which the oncologist has private information about patients' characteristics (adverse selection) and the payer does not know whether the oncologist takes the optimal course of action (moral hazard). We show that, in the presence of information asymmetry, a healthcare payer should never incentivize an oncologist to use a diagnostic test for all patients, even if the diagnostic test is available for free. Moreover, although the oncologist has additional information about a patient's risk, he cannot always benefit from this private information. We also find that social welfare may not increase as a result of a decrease in the oncologist's concerns regarding the health outcome of patients. Finally, we show that it is not always socially optimal to make a diagnostic test compulsory even if such a policy can be implemented for free.

AB  - Managing emergency physicians is a complex task and has increasingly intensified with the recent consolidation of many emergency departments (EDs). Large-scale physician groups are facing challenges in resource deployment and performance evaluation. To objectively evaluate physicians across facilities, we leverage big data from an emergency physician management network and propose data-driven metrics using a large-scale database consisting of 84 hospitals, 1,079 physicians, and 10,615,879 patient visits in 14 states over 600,000 clinical shifts from 2010 to 2014. To ensure physicians are fairly evaluated and compensated within diverse facilities, we propose an index system and use clustering to help identify factors which might impact physician performance. The proposed indices benchmark physicians from the perspectives of revenue potential, patient volume, patient complexity, and patient experience by controlling for exogenous factors at the facility level. We empirically show the volume and complexity indices are key elements of the revenue potential index, and use two-stage least squares regression to relate volume and complexity and uncover their drivers. Revenue potential and patient experience are found to be positively correlated, which suggests productive physicians are often liked by their patients. Through implementing the proposed evaluation system, administrators can better manage and incentivize physicians and provide directions for performance improvement, while controlling for location idiosyncrasies. The proposed framework can also be adapted to non-medical professional settings such as value chains, where employees often provide services in various profit- and cost-centers.

AB  - The prevailing first-come-first-served approach to outpatient appointment scheduling ignores differing urgency levels, leading to unnecessarily long waits for urgent patients. In data from a partner healthcare organization, we found in some departments that urgent patients were inadvertently waiting longer for an appointment than non-urgent patients. This study develops a capacity allocation optimization methodology that reserves appointment slots based on urgency in a complicated, integrated care environment where multiple specialties serve multiple types of patients. This optimization reallocates network capacity to limit access delays (indirect waiting times) for initial and downstream appointments differentiated by urgency. We formulate this problem as a queueing network optimization and approximate it via deterministic linear optimization to simultaneously smooth workloads and guarantee access delay targets. In a case study of our industry partner we demonstrate the ability to (i) reduce urgent patient mean access delay by 27% with only a 7% increase in mean access delay for non-urgent patients, and (ii) increase throughput by 31% with the same service levels and overtime.

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - In community health programs implemented in underserved areas, community healthcare workers (CHWs) prevent, diagnose, and treat the most common diseases. To ensure continuous in-service training of CHWs, some countries have mentored highly skilled CHWs to become supervisors. Designing a network in such a context implies determining the number of CHWs and supervisors, as well as the routing of the supervisors. This can be defined as a location-routing covering problem (LRCP), a variant of the location-routing and the covering tour problems. To solve the LRCP, we propose set-partitioning formulations and a procedure to generate only non-dominated variables without losing optimality, which also allows to break the symmetry between variables. Finding the most appropriate mathematical model is important to solve real-life instances, improve the quality of the solution, and reduce the total computation time. Therefore, we develop tools to assist with the design and analysis of a community healthcare network in order to increase health coverage for underserved areas. Results are presented for an application in Liberia, including sensitivity analyses on various parameters and managerial insights.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Operations management provides many exciting opportunities for improving the delivery of healthcare services. Much of the existing literature has focused on the efficient and cost effective delivery of good-quality care. Recently, there has been a growing demand for a more direct consideration of the wants, needs, and preferences of individual patients. This drive for patient-centric care coincides with and is fed by a dramatic explosion in the availability of data and analytics tools. The 12 papers in this special issue build on these important themes, focusing on data-driven, patient-focused approaches to care provision.

AB  - Hospitals in the United States (U.S.), and the healthcare industry as a whole, are experiencing major transformations that will likely affect every facet of our society. One such example is a federal regulation known as the Value-based Purchasing (VBP) program, which shifts hospital reimbursements for services rendered away from a fee-for-service model to a value-based model. This change requires hospitals to more accurately track and document resources/assets utilized in the delivery of care, in addition to appropriate health outcomes. Hence, the focus of this study is on assessing the effect of the joint use of RFID and EDI on hospital performance, namely supply chain cost efficiency, personnel expenses, and hospital readmission rates. The findings, based on secondary, longitudinal data on more than 3300 US hospitals spanning eight years, suggest that hospitals bundling RFID and EDI experience an initial decrease in supply chain cost efficiency and increase in personnel expenses, with no immediate impact on readmission rates. However, over time, better supply chain cost efficiency, lower personnel expenses, and a consistent reduction in readmission rates accrue from the long-term and consistent leveraging of the RFID-EDI bundle. Thus, the overarching contribution of this study is the elucidation of how and along what measures the bundled leveraging of RFID and EDI improves hospital performance, as well as which measures of hospital performance are time (in)variant. We round out this study with a discussion of our findings, their implications, and offer directions for future research.

AB  - Decision models representing the clinical situations where treatment options entail a significant risk of morbidity or mortality should consider the variations in risk preferences of individuals. In this study, we develop a stochastic modeling framework that optimizes risk-sensitive diagnostic decisions after a mammography exam. For a given patient, our objective is to find the utility maximizing diagnostic decisions where we define the utility over quality-adjusted survival duration. We use real data from a private mammography database to numerically solve our model for various utility functions. Our choice of utility functions for the numerical analysis is driven by actual patient behavior encountered in clinical practice. We find that invasive diagnostic procedures such as biopsies are more aggressively used than what the optimal risk-neutral policy would suggest, implying a far-sighted (or equivalently risk-seeking) behavior. When risk preferences are incorporated into the clinical practice, policy makers should bear in mind that a welfare loss in terms of survival duration is inevitable as evidenced by our structural and empirical results.

AB  - Health information exchanges (HIEs) are expected to improve poor information coordination in emergency departments (EDs); however, whether and when HIEs are associated with better operational outcomes remains poorly understood. In this work, we study HIE and length of stay (LOS) relationship using a large dataset from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project consisting of about 7.4 million treat-and-release visits made to 63 EDs in Massachusetts. Overall, we find that HIE adoption is associated with a 10.2% reduction in LOS and the percentage reduction increases to 14.8% when the hospital is part of an integrated health system or to 21.0% when a patient has a previous visit to an HIE-carrying hospital. We further find that (i) teaching hospitals benefit more from HIE adoption compared with non-teaching hospitals, (ii) patients with severe or multiple comorbid conditions spend less time in the ED under HIE presence. Together, these results imply that (i) HIE adoption reduces overall ED LOS, (ii) wider HIE adoption would scale up the benefits for individual hospitals, (iii) magnitude of the association between HIE and LOS is higher when financial incentives for HIE adoption are stronger (e.g., integrated health systems), and (iv) the size of the reduction depends on certain contextual moderating factors. Given that HIEs are a key component of healthcare delivery and ongoing reforms, we believe that our findings have important implications and may inform policymakers regarding the nationwide HIE adoption.

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - We analyze not-for-profit Medical Surplus Recovery Organizations (MSROs) that manage the recovery of surplus (unused or donated) medical products to fulfill the needs of underserved healthcare facilities in the developing world. Our work is inspired by an award-winning North American non-governmental organization (NGO) that matches the uncertain supply of medical surplus with the receiving parties' needs. In particular, this NGO adopts a recipient-driven resource allocation model, which grants recipients access to an inventory database, and each recipient selects products of limited availability to fill a container based on its preferences. We first develop a game theoretic model to investigate the effectiveness of this approach. This analysis suggests that the recipient-driven model may induce competition among recipients and lead to a loss in value provision through premature orders. Further, contrary to the common wisdom from traditional supply chains, full inventory visibility in our setting may accelerate premature orders and lead to loss of effectiveness. Accordingly, we identify operational mechanisms to help MSROs deal with this problem. These are: (i) appropriately selecting container capacities while limiting the inventory availability visible to recipients and increasing the acquisition volumes of supplies, (ii) eliminating recipient competition through exclusive single-recipient access to MSRO inventory, and (iii) focusing on learning recipient needs as opposed to providing them with supply information, and switching to a provider-driven resource allocation model. We use real data from the NGO by which the study was inspired and show that the proposed improvements can substantially increase the value provided to recipients.

TI  - Improving Societal Outcomes in the Organ Donation Value Chain
AU  - Arora, Priyank

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - In the context of the mismatch between organ demand and supply, a statistic worth noting is that across the donor service areas in the United States, the average (median) percentage of eligible potential donors from whom no organs are recovered is 28.3% (29%). The socially suboptimal quantity and quality of recovered organs form the context of our study, which takes the perspective of the social planner that has an overall quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) improvement objective. We model the operational decisions of two key supply-side entities in a cadaver organ donation value chain (ODVC)-the organ procurement organization (OPO), and the hospital (trauma center) where potential donors arrive. We consider the OPO's effort level in seeking authorization for organ donation, the hospital's effort level in identifying and referring potential donors to the OPO, and the hospital's priority scheme for scheduling organ recovery and other procedures in its operating room (OR). We develop an analytical model to study the effects of contextual factors (including reimbursement rates for the hospital, shared OR capacity between organ recovery and other procedures, donor heterogeneity, and increments in QALYs for organ recipients and the hospital's other patients), and the decisions of the OPO and the hospital, on their respective payoffs and on societal outcomes. Our analysis identifies possible misalignments in the objectives of the social planner, the OPO, and the hospital, and we recommend contracts that can help the ODVC achieve socially-optimal QALY performance while ensuring that neither the OPO nor the hospital would be worse off.

TI  - Critical Care Capacity Management: Understanding the Role of a Step Down Unit
AU  - Armony, Mor

AU  - Zhu, Bo
T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - In hospitals, Step Down Units (SDUs) provide an intermediate level of care between the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and the general medical-surgical wards. Because SDUs are less richly staffed than ICUs, they are less costly to operate; however, they also are unable to provide the level of care required by the sickest patients. There is an ongoing debate in the medical community as to whether and how SDUs should be used. On one hand, an SDU alleviates ICU congestion by providing a safe environment for post-ICU patients before they are stable enough to be transferred to the general wards. On the other hand, an SDU can take capacity away from the already over-congested ICU. In this work, we propose a queueing model of patient flow through the ICU and SDU in order to determine when an SDU is needed, what size it should be, and what are the main drivers influencing these decisions. Using first- and second-order analysis, we examine the tradeoff between reserving capacity in the ICU for the most critical patients and gaining additional capacity achieved by allocating nurses to the SDU due to the lower staffing requirement. We find that under some circumstances the optimal size of the SDU is zero, while in other cases, having a sizable SDU may be beneficial. Moreover, we identify two parameters which play a prominent role in the SDU sizing decision: <italic>p</italic>, which captures the demand for SDU beds, and <italic>ν</italic>, which captures the supply gains by moving nurses to the SDU. The insights from our work provide rigorous justification for the variation in SDU use seen in practice as well as highlight which factors should be considered when making such sizing decisions for critical care.

AU  - Parker, Rodney P.
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The deceased-donor kidney allocation system suffers from a severe shortage of available organs. We illustrate a mechanism which can increase the supply of cadaveric kidneys in the United States. This supply increase exploits the fact that under the current organ allocation policy, some kidneys remain unprocured in some procurement areas but would be highly sought in other areas. The current kidney allocation policy procures within a donor service area (DSA) and offers these kidneys first to patients in the DSA; if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered within the region (a cluster of DSAs); if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered nationally. A deceased-donor organ is procured if there is the belief that the offered organ will be transplanted (known as "intent"). We conduct an empirical analysis of the donor and recipient data (at the DSA level) which reveals that the intent increases significantly with organ quality, the median waiting time for a transplant, and higher competition. In particular, it shows that lower quality organs are likely to be procured at a higher rate in DSAs with longer waiting times. Motivated by a new kidney allocation system, we conduct a counterfactual study which shows that geographically broader sharing the bottom 15% quality kidneys leads to stronger intent for the organ, thus increasing the supply of procured organs available for transplantation. The expected increase in procured organs ranges from 58 (an increase of 0.4% of all procured kidneys) to 174 (an increase of 1.2%), depending on regional or national sharing.

TI  - Incentive Programs for Reducing Readmissions when Patient Care is Co-Produced
AU  - Andritsos, Dimitrios A.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - To reduce preventable readmissions, many healthcare systems are transitioning from fee-for-service (FFS) to other reimbursement schemes such as pay-for-performance (P4P) or bundled payment (BP) so that the funder of a healthcare system can transfer to the hospital some of the financial risks associated with patient rehospitalizations. To examine the effectiveness of different schemes (FFS, P4P, and BP), we develop a "health co-production" model in which the patient's readmissions can be "jointly controlled" by the efforts exerted by both the hospital and the patient. Our analysis of the equilibrium outcomes reveals that FFS cannot entice the hospital and the patient to exert readmission-reduction efforts. Relative to BP, we find that P4P is more effective in reducing readmissions over a wider range of scenarios. However, BP tends to be more effective in keeping lower combined patient costs and funder payments to the hospital. Finally, we find that some patient cost-sharing can be optimal for the funder under both P4P and BP.

AB  - This forum study examines the past and the future of Operations Management (OM) research. First, we investigate the evolution of OM research from 1997 to 2018 by using machine learning tools to analyze all OM papers published in five journals (JOM, MS, M&SOM, POM, and OR), and find that the number of information/financial flow-focused OM research papers has increased steadily over the years. Second, we present three research topics motivated by the US-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, and postulate that future OM research is likely to involve all three flows: material, information, and financial flows. Finally, we argue that, to achieve operational efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in the Industry 4.0 era, firms should build (or strengthen) three new capabilities: Connectivity, Clarity, and Continuity. As firms develop new ways to build these new capabilities, more innovative OM research ideas will ensue.

We now see OM as a vibrant community and an ecosystem in steady state. Yet, are many opportunities ahead to revitalize our field and to expand our influence. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we propose that we focus our major efforts on accelerating the following four developments: First, having greatly expanded the domain of operations management, we should continue to expand its boundaries. Second, after a visible increase in exploratory studies, our community should accelerate our pursuit of such research. Third, we encourage OM faculty to develop programs that enable Ph.D. students to carry out part of their work in actual organizational settings. Fourth, we should further strengthen our interactions with the business community and create mechanisms to systematically disseminate our research to its members.

AB  - We are living in an era in which data is generated in huge volume with high velocity and variety. Big Data and technology are reshaping our life and business. Our research inevitably needs to catch up with these changes. In this essay, we focus on two aspects of supply chain management, namely, demand management and manufacturing. We feel that, while rapidly growing research on these two areas is contributed by scholars in computer science and engineering, the developments made by production and operations management society have been insufficient. We believe that our field has the expertise and talent to push for advancements in the theory and practice of demand management and manufacturing (of course, among many other areas) along unique dimensions. We summarize some relevant concepts emerged with Big Data and present several prototype models to demonstrate how these concepts can lead to rethinking of our research. Our intention is to generate interests and guide directions for new research in production and operations management in the era of Big Data.

AB  - This study discusses how the tremendous volume of available data collected by firms has been transforming the service industry. The focus is primarily on services in the following sectors: finance/banking, transportation and hospitality, and online platforms (e.g., subscription services, online advertising, and online dating). We report anecdotal evidence borrowed from various collaborations and discussions with executives and data analysts who work in management consulting or finance, or for technology/startup companies. Our main goals are (i) to present an overview of how big data is shaping the service industry, (ii) to describe several mechanisms used in the service industry that leverage the potential information hidden in big data, and (iii) to point out some of the pitfalls and risks incurred. On one hand, collecting and storing large amounts of data on customers and on past transactions can help firms improve the quality of their services. For example, firms can now customize their services to unprecedented levels of granularity, which enables the firms to offer targeted personalized offers (sometimes, even in real-time). On the other hand, collecting this data may allow some firms to utilize the data against their customers by charging them higher prices. Furthermore, data-driven algorithms may often be biased toward illicit discrimination. The availability of data on sensitive personal information may also attract hackers and gives rise to important cybersecurity concerns (e.g., information leakage, fraud, and identity theft).

AB  - There is a natural order to most events in life: Everything from learning to read to DNA sequences in molecular biology follows some predetermined, structured methodology that has been refined to yield improved results. Likewise, it would seem that firms could benefit by adopting and implementing technologies in some logical way so as to increase their overall performance. In this study of 555 hospitals, we investigate the order in which medical technologies are transformed into information technologies through a process of converting them from stand-alone technologies to interoperable, integrated information systems and whether certain configurations of sequences of integration yield additional value. We find that sequence does matter and that hospitals that integrated foundational technologies first-which in this case are known to be more complex-tend to perform better. Theoretical and practical implications of this finding and others are discussed.

TI  - Linking Process Quality and Resource Usage: An Empirical Analysis
AU  - Andritsos, Dimitrios A.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Motivated by an increasing adoption of evidence-based medical guidelines in the delivery of medical care, we examine whether increased adherence to such guidelines (typically referred to as higher process quality) is associated with reduced resource usage in the course of patient treatment. In this study, we develop a sample of US hospitals and use cardiac care as our context to empirically examine our questions. To measure a patient's resource usage, we use the total length of stay, which includes any additional inpatient stay necessitated by unplanned readmissions within thirty days after initial hospitalization. We find evidence that higher process quality, and more specifically its clinical (as opposed to its administrative) dimensions, are associated with a reduction in resource usage. Moreover, the standardization of care that is achieved via the implementation of medical guidelines, makes this effect more pronounced in less focused environments: higher process quality is more beneficial when the cardiac department's patient population is distributed across a wider range of medical conditions. We explore the implications of these findings for process-oriented pay-for-performance programs, which tie the reimbursement of hospitals to their adherence to evidence-based medical guidelines.

AU  - McCoy, Jessica H.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Inefficiency and inequity are two challenges that plague humanitarian operations and health delivery in resource-limited regions. Increasing capacity in humanitarian and health delivery supply chains is one option that has the potential to improve equity while maintaining efficiency. For example, the nonprofit organization Riders for Health has worked to increase capacity by providing reliable transportation to health workers in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa; with more motorcycle hours at their disposal, health workers can perform more outreach to outlying communities. We develop a model using a family of fairness function to quantify the efficiency and equity of health delivery as capacity is increased via development programs. We present optimal resource allocations under utilitarian, proportionally fair, and egalitarian objectives and extend the model to include dual modes of transport and diminishing returns of subsequent outreach visits. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply our model at a regional level to provide support for humanitarian decision makers such as Riders for Health. We use data from the baseline phase of our evaluation trial of Riders for Health in Zambia to quantify efficiency and equity for one real-world scenario.

TI  - Clinic Capacity Management: Planning Treatment Programs that Incorporate Adherence
AU  - McCoy, Jessica H.
AU  - Johnson, M. Eric
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - For infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV, treatment adherence plays an important role in treatment effectiveness and epidemic control. Studies of some infectious diseases indicate that patients who live closer to their health facilities maintain higher adherence; however, most models ignore the heterogeneity of patients' adherence. Clinics must balance knowledge about adherence with epidemic growth when creating successful treatment programs. We develop an optimization model that integrates a clinic's capacity decisions with population health outcomes. We find that incorporating adherence into clinic planning models can lead to decisions that significantly improve outcomes. For example, in a realistic case study of the HIV epidemic in Zambia, we find that decision makers who ignore decreasing adherence make suboptimal decisions and overestimate the effectiveness of their treatment programs by as much as 94%. Our model is a first step toward understanding the relationship between adherence and health delivery.

AU  - Cayirli, Tugba

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This study introduces a universal 'Dome' appointment rule that can be parameterized through a planning constant for different clinics characterized by the environmental factors-no-shows, walk-ins, number of appointments per session, variability of service times, and cost of doctor's time to patients' time. Simulation and nonlinear regression are used to derive an equation to predict the planning constant as a function of the environmental factors. We also introduce an adjustment procedure for appointment systems to explicitly minimize the disruptive effects of no-shows and walk-ins. The procedure adjusts the mean and standard deviation of service times based on the expected probabilities of no-shows and walk-ins for a given target number of patients to be served, and it is thus relevant for any appointment rule that uses the mean and standard deviation of service times to construct an appointment schedule. The results show that our Dome rule with the adjustment procedure performs better than the traditional rules in the literature, with a lower total system cost calculated as a weighted sum of patients' waiting time, doctor's idle time, and doctor's overtime. An open-source decision-support tool is also provided so that healthcare managers can easily develop appointment schedules for their clinical environment.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - In this study, we propose a methodological framework to provide a road map to clinicians and system planners in developing chronic disease management strategies, and designing community-based care. We extend the analytical epidemiologic model by utilizing a patient flow approach, in order to model the multiple care-provider visit patterns of patients with a specific chronic illness. The patterns of care received by a group of patients are represented in compact form by means of a Markov model that is based on a disease-specific state space. Our framework also reflects the case-mix biases as well as the care-provider level clustering of the patients. By using this approach, we identify the patterns of care, determine the care provider and patient characteristics associated with optimal management of care, and estimate the potential influence of various interventions. The framework is applied to the data of 4000+ stroke patients discharged from the acute care hospitals of Quebec to their homes. Our findings provide a basis for designing community-based care initiatives for stroke survivors in the province. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This paper examines the effect of the common practice of reserving slots for urgent patients in a primary health care practice on two service quality measures: the average number of urgent patients that are not handled during normal hours (either handled as overtime, referred to other physicians, or referred to the emergency room) and the average queue of non-urgent or routine patients. We formulate a stochastic model of appointment scheduling in a primary care practice. We conduct numerical experiments to optimize the performance of this system accounting for revenue and these two service quality measures as a function of the number of reserved slots for urgent patients. We compare traditional methods with the advanced-access system advocated by some physicians, in which urgent slots are not reserved, and evaluate the conditions under which alternative appointment scheduling mechanisms are optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of patient arrival dynamics to their relative performance finding that encouraging routine patients to call for same-day appointments is a key ingredient for the success of advanced-access.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - In outpatient healthcare clinics, capacity, patient flow, and scheduling are rarely managed in an integrated fashion, so a question of interest is whether clinic performance can be improved if the policies that guide these decisions are set jointly. Despite the potential importance of this issue, we find surprisingly few studies that look at how the allocation of capacity, paired with various appointment scheduling policies and different patient flow configurations, affects patient flow and clinical efficiency. In this paper, we develop an empirically based discrete-event simulation to examine the interactions between patient appointment policies and capacity allocation policies (i.e., the number of available examination rooms) and how they jointly affect various performance measures, such as resource utilization and patient waiting time. Findings suggest that scheduling lower-variance, shorter appointments earlier in the clinic (and, conversely, higher-variance, longer appointments later) results in less overall patient waiting without reducing physician utilization or increasing clinic duration. Additionally, exam rooms exhibited classic bottleneck behavior: there was no effect on physician utilization by adding exam rooms beyond a certain threshold, but too few exam rooms were devastating to clinic throughput. Some significant interactions between these variables were observed, but were not influential to the level of managerial concern. Clinicians' intuition about managing capacity in healthcare settings may differ substantially from best policies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - When operating room schedules in hospitals are produced, the constraints and preferences of surgeons and hospital workers are a primary consideration. The downstream impact on post-operative bed availability is often ignored. This can lead to the boarding of patients overnight in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) because intensive care unit beds are unavailable. In this paper, we apply integer programming and simulation to develop improved surgical scheduling assignments. We want to balance new surgeries with hospital discharges in order to reduce the variability of occupied beds from one day to the next and, as a result, to reduce boarding in the PACU.

AB  - High surgical bed occupancy levels often result in heightened staff stress, frequent surgical cancellations, and long surgical wait times. This congestion is in part attributable to surgical scheduling practices, which often focus on the efficient use of operating rooms but ignore resulting downstream bed utilization. This paper describes a transparent and portable approach to improve scheduling practices, which combines a Monte Carlo simulation model and a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. For a specified surgical schedule, the simulation samples from historical case records and predicts bed requirements assuming no resource constraints. The MIP model complements the simulation model by scheduling both surgeon blocks and patient types to reduce peak bed occupancies. Scheduling guidelines were developed from the optimized schedules to provide surgical planners with a simple and implementable alternative to the MIP model. This approach has been tested and delivered to planners in a health authority in British Columbia, Canada. The models have been used to propose new surgical schedules and to evaluate the impact of proposed system changes on ward congestion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Uncertainty in the duration of surgical procedures can cause long patient wait times, poor utilization of resources, and high overtime costs. We compare several heuristics for scheduling an Outpatient Procedure Center. First, a discrete event simulation model is used to evaluate how 12 different sequencing and patient appointment time-setting heuristics perform with respect to the competing criteria of expected patient waiting time and expected surgical suite overtime for a single day compared with current practice. Second, a bi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine if better solutions can be obtained for this single day scheduling problem. Third, we investigate the efficacy of the bi-criteria GA when surgeries are allowed to be moved to other days. We present numerical experiments based on real data from a large health care provider. Our analysis provides insight into the best scheduling heuristics, and the trade-off between patient and health care provider-based criteria. Finally, we summarize several important managerial insights based on our findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We consider the problem of optimal capacity allocation in a hospital setting, where patients pass through a set of units, for example intensive care and acute care (AC), or AC and post-acute care. If the second stage is full, a patient whose service at the first stage is complete is blocked and cannot leave the first stage. We develop a new heuristic for tandem systems to efficiently evaluate the effects of such blocking on system performance and we demonstrate that this heuristic performs well when compared with exact solutions and other approaches presented in the literature. In addition, we show how our tandem heuristic can be used as a building block to model more complex multi-stage hospital systems with arbitrary patient routing, and we derive insights and actionable capacity strategies for a real hospital system where such blocking occurs between units.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Variability in hospital occupancy negatively impacts the cost and quality of patient care delivery through increased emergency department (ED) congestion, emergency blockages and diversions, elective cancelations, backlogs in ancillary services, overstaffing, and understaffing. Controlling inpatient admissions can effectively reduce variability in hospital occupancy to mitigate these problems. Currently there are two major gateways for admission to a hospital: the ED and scheduled elective admission. Unfortunately, in highly utilized hospitals, excessive wait times make the scheduled gateway undesirable or infeasible for a subset of patients and doctors. As a result, this group often uses the ED gateway as a means to gain admission to the hospital. To better serve these patients and improve overall hospital functioning, we propose creating a third gateway: an expedited patient care queue. We first characterize an optimal admission threshold policy using controls on the scheduled and expedited gateways for a new Markov decision process model. We then present a practical policy based on insight from the analytical model that yields reduced emergency blockages, cancelations, and off-unit census via simulation based on historical hospital data.

TI  - Access to Long-Term Care: The True Cause of Hospital Congestion?
AU  - Patrick, Jonathan
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Much attention has been paid to lengthy wait times in emergency departments (EDs) and much research has sought to improve ED performance. However, ED congestion is often caused by the inability to move patients into the wards while the wards in turn are often congested primarily due to patients waiting for a bed in a long-term care (LTC) facility. The scheduling of clients to LTC is a complex problem that is compounded by the variety of LTC beds (different facilities and room accommodations), the presence of client choice and the competing demands of the hospital and community populations. We present a Markov decision process (MDP) model that determines the required access in order for the census of patients waiting for LTC in the hospitals to remain below a given threshold. We further present a simulation model that incorporates both hospital and community demand for LTC in order to predict the impact of implementing the policy derived from the MDP on the community client wait times and to aid in capacity planning for the future. We test the MDP policy vs. current practice as well as against a number of other proposed policy changes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Price-volume agreements are commonly negotiated between drug manufacturers and third-party payers for drugs. In one form a drug manufacturer pays a rebate to the payer on a portion of sales in excess of a specified threshold. We examine the optimal design of such an agreement under complete and asymmetric information about demand. We consider two types of uncertainty: information asymmetry, defined as the payer's uncertainty about mean demand; and market uncertainty, defined as both parties' uncertainty about true demand. We investigate the optimal contract design in the presence of asymmetric information. We find that an incentive compatible contract always exists; that the optimal price is decreasing in expected market size, while the rebate may be increasing or decreasing in expected market size; that the optimal contract for a manufacturer with the highest possible demand would include no rebate; and, in a special case, if the average reservation profit is non-decreasing in expected market size, then the optimal contract includes no rebates for all manufacturers. Our analysis suggests that price-volume agreements with a rebate rate of 100% are not likely to be optimal if payers have the ability to negotiate prices as part of the agreement.

AB  - The question of when to initiate HIV treatment is considered the most important question in HIV care today. Benefits of delaying therapy include avoiding the negative side effects and toxicities associated with the drugs, delaying selective pressures that induce the development of resistant strains of the virus, and preserving a limited number of treatment options. On the other hand, the risks of delayed therapy include the possibility of irreversible damage to the immune system, development of AIDS-related complications, and death. We use Markov decision processes to develop the first HIV optimization models that aim to maximize the expected lifetime or quality-adjusted lifetime of a patient. We prove conditions that establish structural properties of the optimal solution and compare them to our data and results. Model solutions, based on clinical data, support a strategy of treating HIV earlier in its course as opposed to recent trends toward treating it later.

TI  - Optimal Capacity Overbooking for the Regular Treatment of Chronic Conditions
AU  - Lee, Donald K. K.
AU  - Zenios, Stefanos A.
T2  - Operations Research
AB  - Patients suffering from a chronic condition often require periodic treatment. For example, patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) require dialysis three times a week. These patients are also frequently hospitalized for complications from their treatment, resulting in idle capacity at the clinic. These temporary patient absences make overbooking at the clinic attractive. This paper develops a semiclosed migration network to capture patient flow into the clinic and between the clinic and hospital. We consider a simple class of stationary control policies for patient admissions and provide algorithms for selecting one that maximizes long-run average earnings. Local diffusion approximations were constructed to provide square-root loading formulas for the optimal capacity level and patient overbooking level: as the total patient arrival rate increases, the deviation between the optimal and fluid-limit capacity and overbooking levels scale up with the square root of the total arrival rate. We find that high hospitalization rates and long inpatient stays allow for more overbooking. Numerical examples based on the typical dialysis clinic in the United States suggest an increase in earnings of 11%-14% over policies derived from traditional M/M/N models that do not account for hospitalizations and do not allow overbooking, while keeping the probability of capacity shortage arbitrarily small.

AB  - We consider the problem of designing an efficient system for allocating donated livers to patients waiting for transplantation. The trade-off between medical urgency and efficiency is at the heart of the liver allocation problem. We model the transplant waiting list as a multiclass fluid model of overloaded queues, which captures the disease evolution by allowing the patients to switch between classes, i.e., health levels. We consider the bicriteria objective of minimizing total number of patient deaths while waiting for transplantation (NPDWT) and maximizing total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) through a weighted combination. On one hand, under the objective of minimizing NPDWT, the current policy of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) emerges as the optimal policy, providing a theoretical justification for the current practice. On the other hand, under the metric of maximizing QALYs, the optimal policy is an intuitive dynamic index policy that ranks patients based on their marginal benefit from transplantation, i.e., the difference in benefit with versus without transplantation. Finally, we perform a detailed simulation study to compare the performances of our proposed policies and the current UNOS policy along the following metrics: total QALYs, NPDWT, number of patient deaths after transplantation, number of total patient deaths, and number of wasted livers. Numerical experiments show that our proposed policy for maximizing QALYs outperforms the current UNOS policy along all metrics except the NPDWT.

TI  - Design and Optimization Methods for Elective Hospital Admissions
AU  - Helm, Jonathan E.

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - Hospitals typically lack effective enterprise level strategic planning of bed and care resources, contributing to bed census levels that are statistically "out of control." This system dysfunction manifests itself in bed block, surgical cancelation, ambulance diversions, and operational chaos. This is the classic hospital admission scheduling and control (HASC) problem, which has been addressed in its entirety only through inexact simulation-based search heuristics. This paper develops new analytical models of controlled hospital census that can, for the first time, be incorporated into a mixed-integer programming model to optimally solve the strategic planning/scheduling portion of the HASC. Our new solution method coordinates elective admissions with other hospital subsystems to reduce system congestion. We formulate a new Poissonarrival- location model (PALM) based on an innovative stochastic location process that we developed and call the patient temporal resource needs model. We further extend the PALM approach to the class of deterministic controlled-arrivallocation models (d-CALM) and develop linearizing approximations to stochastic blocking metrics. This work provides the theoretical foundations for an efficient scheduled admissions planning system as well as a practical decision support methodology to stabilize hospital census.

TI  - Fairness, Efficiency, and Flexibility in Organ Allocation for Kidney Transplantation
AU  - Bertsimas, Dimitris

AU  - Trichakis, Nikolaos
T2  - Operations Research
AB  - We propose a scalable, data-driven method for designing national policies for the allocation of deceased donor kidneys to patients on a waiting list in a fair and efficient way. We focus on policies that have the same form as the one currently used in the United States. In particular, we consider policies that are based on a point system that ranks patients according to some priority criteria, e.g., waiting time, medical urgency, etc., or a combination thereof. Rather than making specific assumptions about fairness principles or priority criteria, our method offers the designer the flexibility to select his desired criteria and fairness constraints from a broad class of allowable constraints. The method then designs a point system that is based on the selected priority criteria and approximately maximizes medical efficiency--i.e., life-year gains from transplant--while simultaneously enforcing selected fairness constraints. Among the several case studies we present employing our method, one case study designs a point system that has the same form, uses the same criteria, and satisfies the same fairness constraints as the point system that was recently proposed by U.S. policy makers. In addition, the point system we design delivers an 8% increase in extra life-year gains. We evaluate the performance of all policies under consideration using the same statistical and simulation tools and data as the U.S. policy makers use. Other case studies perform a sensitivity analysis (for instance, demonstrating that the increase in extra life-year gains by relaxing certain fairness constraints can be as high as 30%) and also pursue the design of policies targeted specifically at remedying criticisms leveled at the recent point system proposed by U.S. policy makers.

AU  - Thompson, Steven

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - Many hospitals face the problem of insufficient capacity to meet demand for inpatient beds, especially during demand surges. This results in quality degradation of patient care due to large delays from admission time to the hospital until arrival at a floor. In addition, there is loss of revenue because of the inability to provide service to potential patients. A solution to the problem is to proactively transfer patients between floors in anticipation of a demand surge. Optimal reallocation poses an extraordinarily complex problem that can be modeled as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on the optimization model, a decision-support system has been developed and implemented at Windham Hospital in Willimantic, Connecticut. Projections from an initial trial period indicate very significant financial gains of about 1% of their total revenue, with no negative impact on any standard quality of care or staffing effectiveness indicators. In addition, the hospital showed a marked improvement in quality of care because of a resulting decrease of almost 50% in the average time that an admitted patient has to wait from admission until being transferred to a floor.

AB  - In the United States, patients with end-stage liver disease must join a waiting list to be eligible for cadaveric liver transplantation. Due to privacy concerns, the details of the composition of this waiting list are not publicly available. This paper considers the benefits associated with creating a more transparent waiting list. We study these benefits by modeling the organ accept/reject decision faced by these patients as a Markov decision process in which the state of the process is described by patient health, quality of the offered liver, and a measure of the rank of the patient in the waiting list. We prove conditions under which there exist structured optimal solutions, such as monotone value functions and control-limit optimal policies. We define the concept of the patient's price of privacy, namely, the number of expected life days lost due to the lack of complete waiting list information. We conduct extensive numerical studies based on clinical data, which indicate that this price of privacy is typically on the order of 5% of the optimal solution value.

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - Motivated by the rising popularity of electronic appointment booking systems, we develop appointment scheduling models that take into account the patient preferences regarding when they would like to be seen. The service provider dynamically decides which appointment days to make available for the patients. Patients arriving with appointment requests may choose one of the days offered to them or leave without an appointment. Patients with scheduled appointments may cancel or not show up for the service. The service provider collects a "revenue" from each patient who shows up and incurs a "service cost" that depends on the number of scheduled appointments. The objective is to maximize the expected net "profit" per day. We begin by developing a static model that does not consider the current state of the scheduled appointments. We give a characterization of the optimal policy under the static model and bound its optimality gap. Building on the static model, we develop a dynamic model that considers the current state of the scheduled appointments, and we propose a heuristic solution procedure. In our computational experiments, we test the performance of our models under the patient preferences estimated through a discrete choice experiment that we conduct in a large community health center. Our computational experiments reveal that the policies we propose perform well under a variety of conditions.

AB  - The only available therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease is organ transplantation. In the United States, patients with end-stage liver disease are placed on a waiting list and offered livers based on location and waiting time, as well as current and past health. Although there is a shortage of cadaveric livers, 45% of all cadaveric liver offers are declined by the first transplant surgeon and/or patient to whom they are offered. We consider the decision problem faced by these patients: Should an offered organ of a given quality be accepted or declined? We formulate a Markov decision process model in which the state of the process is described by patient state and organ quality. We use a detailed model of patient health to estimate the parameters of our decision model and implicitly consider the effects of the waiting list through our patient state-dependent definition of the organ arrival probabilities. We derive structural properties of the model, including a set of intuitive conditions that ensure the existence of  control-limit optimal policies. We use clinical data in our computational experiments, which confirm that the optimal policy is typically of control-limit type.

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - This paper studies the problem of simultaneously locating trauma centers and helicopters. The standard approach to locating helicopters involves the use of helicopter busy fractions to model the random availability of helicopters. However, busy fractions cannot be estimated a priori in our problem because the demand for each helicopter cannot be determined until the trauma center locations are selected. To overcome this challenge, we endogenize the computation of busy fractions within an optimization problem. The resulting formulation has nonconvex bilinear terms in the objective, for which we develop an integrated method that iteratively solves a sequence of problem relaxations and restrictions. Specifically, we devise a specialized algorithm, called the shifting quadratic envelopes algorithm, that (1) generates tighter outer approximations than linear McCormick envelopes and (2) outperforms a Benders-like cut generation scheme. We apply our integrated method to the design of a nationwide trauma care system in Korea. By running a trace-based simulation on a full year of patient data, we find that the solutions generated by our model outperform several benchmark heuristics by up to 20%, as measured by an industry-standard metric: the proportion of patients successfully transported to a care facility within one hour. Our results have helped the Korean government to plan its nationwide trauma care system. More generally, our method can be applied to a class of optimization problems that aim to find the locations of both fixed and mobile servers when service needs to be carried out within a certain time threshold.

AB  - We consider the problem of minimizing daily expected resource usage and overtime costs across multiple parallel resources such as anesthesiologists and operating rooms, which are used to conduct a variety of surgical procedures at large multispecialty hospitals. To address this problem, we develop a two-stage, mixed-integer stochastic dynamic programming model with recourse. The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. We develop a data-driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality. We validate and implement this model as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This system effectively incorporates the flexibility in the resources and uncertainty in surgical durations, and explicitly trades off resource usage and overtime costs. This has increased the average daily utilization of the anesthesiologists by 3.5% and of the operating rooms by 3.8%. This has led to an average daily cost savings of around 7% or estimated to be $2.2 million on an annual basis. In addition, the insights based on this model have significantly influenced decision making at the operating services department at this hospital. The e-companion is available at .

AB  - We analyzed the planning problem for HIV screening, testing, and care. This problem consists of determining the optimal fraction of patients to be screened in every period as well as the optimum staffing level at each part of the healthcare system to maximize the total health benefits to the patients measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. We modeled this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer programming program comprising disease progression (the transition of the patients across health states), system dynamics (the flow of patients in different health states across various parts of the healthcare delivery system), and budgetary and capacity constraints. We applied the model to the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) station in the Veterans Health Administration system. We found that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine screening policy in which all patients visiting the system are screened for HIV irrespective of risk factors may not be feasible because of budgetary constraints. Consequently, we used the model to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current risk based screening policy of screening only high risk patients. Our computational analysis showed that the GLA station can achieve substantial increase (20% to 300%) in the QALYs gained by using these policies over risk based screening. The GLA station has already adapted two of these policies that could yield better patient health outcomes over the next few years. In addition, our model insights have influenced the decision making process at this station.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. women. Although mammography is the most effective modality for breast cancer screening, it has several potential risks, including high false-positive rates. Therefore, the balance of benefits and risks, which depend on personal characteristics, is critical in designing a mammography screening schedule. In contrast to prior research and existing guidelines that consider population-based screening recommendations, we propose a personalized mammography screening policy based on the prior screening history and personal risk characteristics of women. We formulate a finite-horizon, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for this problem. Our POMDP model incorporates two methods of detection (self or screen), age-specific unobservable disease progression, and age-specific mammography test characteristics. We solve this POMDP optimally after setting transition probabilities to values estimated from a validated microsimulation model. Additional published data is used to specify other model inputs such as sensitivity and specificity of test results. Our results show that our proposed personalized screening schedules outperform the existing guidelines with respect to the total expected quality-adjusted life years, while significantly decreasing the number of mammograms and false-positives. We also report the lifetime risk of developing undetected invasive cancer associated with each screening scenario.

TI  - Revenue Management for a Primary-Care Clinic in the Presence of Patient Choice
AU  - Gupta, Diwakar
AU  - Lei Wang
T2  - Operations Research
AB  - In addition to having uncertain patient arrivals, primary-care clinics also face uncertainty arising from patient choices. Patients have different perceptions of the acuity of their need, different time-of-day preferences, as well as different degrees of loyalty toward their designated primary-care provider (PCP). Advanced access systems are designed to reduce wait and increase satisfaction by allowing patients to choose either a same-day or a scheduled future appointment. However, the clinic must carefully manage patients' access to physicians' slots to balance the needs of those who book in advance and those who require a same-day appointment. On the one hand, scheduling too many appointments in advance can lead to capacity shortages when same-day requests arrive. On the other hand, scheduling too few appointments increases patients' wait time, patient-PCP mismatch, and the possibility of clinic slots going unused. The capacity management problem facing the clinic is to decide which appointment requests to accept to maximize revenue. We develop a Markov decision process model for the appointment-booking problem in which the patients' choice behavior is modeled explicitly. When the clinic is served by a single physician, we prove that the optimal policy is a threshold-type policy as long as the choice probabilities satisfy a weak condition. For a multiple-doctor clinic, we partially characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We propose several heuristics and an upper bound. Numerical tests show that the two heuristics based on the partial characterization of the optimal policy are quite accurate. We also study the effect on the clinic's optimal profit of patients' loyalty to their PCPs, total clinic load, and load imbalance among physicians.

AB  - We present a risk-group oriented chronic disease progression model embedded within a metaheuristic-based optimization of the policy variables. Policy-makers are provided with Pareto-optimal screening schedules for risk groups by considering cost and effectiveness outcomes as well as budget constraints. The quality of the screening technology depends on risk group, disease stage, and time. As the metaheuristic solution technique, we use the Pareto ant colony optimization (P-ACO) algorithm for multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems, which is based on the ant colony optimization paradigm. Our approach is illustrated by a numerical example for breast cancer. For a 10-year time horizon, we provide cost-effective screening schedules for selected annual and total budgets. We then discuss policy implications of 16 mammography screening scenarios varying the screening schedule (annual, biennial, triennial, quadrennial) and the rate of women tested (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). Due to the model's flexible structure, interventions for multiple chronic diseases can be considered simultaneously.

AB  - We present a method to dynamically schedule patients with different priorities to a diagnostic facility in a public health-care setting. Rather than maximizing revenue, the challenge facing the resource manager is to dynamically allocate available capacity to incoming demand to achieve wait-time targets in a cost-effective manner. We model the scheduling process as a Markov decision process. Because the state space is too large for a direct solution, we solve the equivalent linear program through approximate dynamic programming. For a broad range of cost parameter values, we present analytical results that give the form of the optimal linear value function approximation and the resulting policy. We investigate the practical implications and the quality of the policy through simulation.

AU  - Bambos, Nicholas
AU  - Escobar, Gabriel J.
T2  - Operations Research
AB  - This work examines the impact of discharge decisions under uncertainty in a capacity-constrained high-risk setting: the intensive care unit (ICU). New arrivals to an ICU are typically very high-priority patients and, should the ICU be full upon their arrival, discharging a patient currently residing in the ICU may be required to accommodate a newly admitted patient. Patients so discharged risk physiologic deterioration, which might ultimately require readmission; models of these risks are currently unavailable to providers. These readmissions in turn impose an additional load on the capacity-limited ICU resources. We study the impact of several different ICU discharge strategies on patient mortality and total readmission load. We focus on discharge rules that prioritize patients based on some measure of criticality assuming the availability of a model of readmission risk. We use empirical data from over 5,000 actual ICU patient flows to calibrate our model. The empirical study suggests that a predictive model of the readmission risks associated with discharge decisions, in tandem with simple index policies of the type proposed, can provide very meaningful throughput gains in actual ICUs while at the same time maintaining, or even improving upon, mortality rates. We explicitly provide a discharge policy that accomplishes this. In addition to our empirical work, we conduct a rigorous performance analysis for the family of discharge policies we consider. We show that our policy is optimal in certain regimes, and is otherwise guaranteed to incur readmission related costs no larger than a factor of ρ̂ +1 of an optimal discharge strategy, where is a certain natural measure of system utilization.

AU  - Ziya, Serhan
T2  - Operations Research
AB  - In the aftermath of a disaster, emergency responders must transport a large number of patients to medical facilities, using limited transportation resources (such as ambulances). Decisions about where to send the patients are typically made in an ad hoc manner by responders on the scene. Using a Markov decision process formulation, we develop two heuristic policies that use limited information such as mean travel times and congestion levels to determine (a) how to allocate ambulances to patient locations and (b) which medical facility should be the destination for those ambulances. In a simulation study, we incorporate patient survival rates and service times for different types of traumatic injuries, and show that the proposed heuristics can provide substantial improvement in the expected number of survivors compared to the common practice of transporting to the nearest facility, even when the decision maker has only limited up-todate information about the system state. In particular, a myopic approach that considers only what is best for the next patient to be transported increases the expected number of survivors in almost all scenarios considered. Using a more sophisticated one-step policy improvement approach provides further improvement when the event involves patients who do not deteriorate rapidly, especially when the transportation is not the bottleneck and the casualties are spread over many locations.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics on a case study of a hypothetical earthquake, where casualty data is generated using computer software developed by the U.S. government.

AB  - Ambulance redeployment is the practice of repositioning ambulance fleets in real time in an attempt to reduce response times to future calls. When redeployment decisions are based on real-time information on the status and location of ambulances, the process is called system-status management. An important performance measure is the long-run fraction of calls with response times over some time threshold. We construct a lower bound on this performance measure that holds for nearly any ambulance redeployment policy through comparison methods for queues. The computation of the bound involves solving a number of integer programs and then simulating a multiserver queue. This work originated when one of the authors was asked to analyze a response to a request-for-proposals (RFP) for ambulance services in a county in North America.

AB  - This paper proposes a new classification technique, called support feature machine (SFM), for multidimensional time-series data. The proposed technique was applied to the classification of abnormal brain activity represented in electroencephalograms (EEGs). First, the dynamical properties of EEGs from each electrode were extracted. These dynamical profiles were put in SFM, which is an optimization model that maximizes classification accuracy by selecting electrodes (features) that correctly classify unlabeled EEG samples based on the nearest-neighbor classification rule. The empirical studies were performed on the EEG data sets collected from 10 subjects. The performance of SFM was assessed and compared with the ones achieved by the traditional k-nearest-neighbor classifier and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that SFM achieved, on average, over 90% correct classification and outperformed other classification techniques. In the validation step, SFM correctly classified unseen preseizure and normal EEGs with over 73% accuracy.

AB  - Improving Ambulance Response Times in Developing Urban Centers The lack of emergency medical transportation is viewed as the main barrier to the access and availability of emergency medical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Designing emergency response systems for urban centers in LMICs presents several unique challenges not encountered in high-income countries. For example, it is not the cultural norm and often not physically possible because of congestion for motorists to yield for emergency vehicles. In Ambulance Emergency Response Optimization in Developing Countries, Boutilier and Chan develop a prediction-optimization framework tailored for emergency response optimization in developing urban centers and provide an in-depth investigation into various policy questions. To do this, they traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the largest cities in the world, to conduct field research and collect data. The data were initially used to develop machine learning models that estimate the spatial-temporal demand and travel times through the city-a first in a developing urban center. The predictions were then leveraged to create uncertainty sets as part of a robust-optimization model that provides a unified framework for emergency response optimization under travel time and demand uncertainty. Our policy experiments found that the performance of the current system can realized with one third of the current resources and that a fleet of small motorcycle-style ambulances can capture three times more demand and reduce response times by up to 35%. The lack of emergency medical transportation is viewed as the main barrier to the access and availability of emergency medical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this paper, we present a robust optimization approach to optimize both the location and routing of emergency response vehicles, accounting for uncertainty in travel times and spatial demand characteristic of LMICs. We traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely populated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the collection of two unique data sets that inform our approach. These data are leveraged to estimate demand for emergency medical services in an LMIC setting and to predict the travel time between any two locations in the road network for different times of day and days of the week. We combine our prediction-optimization framework with a simulation model and real data to provide an in-depth investigation into three policy-related questions. First, we demonstrate that outpost locations optimized for weekday rush hour lead to good performance for all times of day and days of the week. Second, we find that the performance of the current system could be replicated using one third of the current outpost locations and one half of the current number of ambulances. Finally, we show that a fleet of small ambulances has the potential to significantly outperform traditional ambulance vans. In particular, they are able to capture approximately three times more demand while reducing the median average response time by roughly 10%-18% over the entire week and 24%-35% during rush hour because of increased routing flexibility offered by more nimble vehicles on a larger road network. Our results provide practical insights for emergency response optimization that can be leveraged by hospital-based and private ambulance providers in Dhaka and other urban centers in developing countries.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in prison systems is about 10 times higher than in the community. As such, prison systems offer a unique opportunity to control the HCV epidemic. New HCV-treatment drugs are very effective, but providing treatment to all inmates is prohibitively expensive unless prices fall. Current practice is to prioritize treatment based on disease severity and puts less emphasis on other factors such as the remaining sentence length and injection drug use behavior. In "Prioritizing Hepatitis C Treatment in U.S. Prisons," T. Ayer, C. Zhang, A. Bonifonte, A. Spaulding, and J. Chhatwal analyze optimal approaches for treatment prioritization under resource constraints by developing a restless bandit modeling framework. They present an easy-to-implement closed-form index policy to support hepatitis C treatment prioritization decisions in U.S. prisons. They also test their proposed policy using a detailed, realistic agent-based simulation model and shed light on several controversial health policy decisions related to hepatitis C treatment prioritization. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in prison systems is 10 times higher than in the general population, and hence prison systems offer a unique opportunity to control the HCV epidemic. New HCV treatment drugs are very effective, but providing treatment to all inmates is prohibitively expensive, which precludes universal HCV treatment in prison systems. As such, current practice recommends prioritizing treatment based on clinical and incarceration-related factors, including disease staging, remaining sentence length, and injection drug use (IDU) status. However, there is controversy about how these factors should be incorporated because of the complicated trade-offs. In this study, we propose a restless bandit modeling framework to support hepatitis C treatment prioritization decisions in U.S. prisons. We first prove indexability for our problem and derive several structural properties of the well-known Whittle's index, based on which we derive a closed-form expression of the Whittle's index for patients with advanced liver disease. From the interpretation of this closed-form expression, we anticipate that the performance of the Whittle's index would degrade as the treatment capacity increases, and to address this limitation, we propose a capacity-adjusted closed-form index policy. We parameterize and validate our model using real-world data and published studies and test the performance of our proposed policy against several benchmark policies using a realistic agent-based simulation model. Our results shed light on several controversial health policy issues in hepatitis C treatment prioritization: (1) prioritization based on only liver health status, a commonly practiced policy, is suboptimal compared with many other policies; further, considering remaining sentence length of inmates and IDU status in addition to liver health status in prioritization decisions can lead to a significant performance improvement; (2) while usually prioritizing patients with longer sentence lengths is the right choice, prioritizing patients with shorter remaining sentence lengths may be preferable if the treatment capacity inside the prison system is not very tight and the linkage-to-care level outside the prison system is low; and (3) among patients with advanced liver disease, IDUs should not be prioritized unless their reinfection is very well controlled.

AU  - Junfei Huang

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - We consider the control of patient flow through physicians in emergency departments (EDs). The physicians must choose between catering to patients right after triage, who are yet to be checked, and those who are in process (IP) and are occasionally returning to be checked. Physician capacity is thus modeled as a queueing system with multiclass customers, where some of the classes face deadline constraints on their time-till-first-service, whereas the other classes feedback through service while incurring congestion costs. We consider two types of such costs: first, costs that are incurred at queue-dependent rates and second, costs that are functions of IP sojourn time. The former is our base model, which paves the way for the latter (perhaps more ED realistic). In both cases, we propose and analyze scheduling policies that, asymptotically in conventional heavy traffic, minimize congestion costs while adhering to all deadline constraints. Our policies have two parts: the first chooses between triage and IP patients; assuming triage patients are chosen, the physicians serve the one who is closest to violating the deadline; alternatively, IP patients are served according to a Gcμ rule, in which μ is simply modified to account for feedbacks. For our proposed policies, we establish asymptotic optimality, and develop some congestion laws (snapshot principles) that support forecasting of waiting and sojourn times. Simulation then shows that these policies outperform some commonly used ones. It also validates our laws and demonstrates that some ED features, the complexity of which reaches beyond our model (e.g., time-varying arrival rates, leave without being seen (LWBS) or leave against medical advice (LAMA)), do not lead to significant performance degradation.

AB  - In managing chronic diseases such as glaucoma, the timing of periodic examinations is crucial, as it may significantly impact patients' outcomes. We address the question of when to monitor a glaucoma patient by integrating a dynamic, stochastic state space system model of disease evolution with novel optimization approaches to predict the likelihood of progression at any future time. Information about each patient's disease state is learned sequentially through a series of noisy medical tests. This information is used to determine the best time to next test based on each patient's individual disease trajectory as well as population information. We develop closed-form solutions and study structural properties of our algorithm. While some have proposed that fixed-interval monitoring can be improved upon, our methodology validates a sophisticated model-based approach to doing so. Based on data from two large-scale, 10+ years clinical trials, we show that our methods significantly outperform fixed-interval schedules and age-based threshold policies by achieving greater accuracy of identifying progression with fewer examinations. Although this work is motivated by our collaboration with glaucoma specialists, the methodology developed is applicable to a variety of chronic diseases.

T2  - Operations Research
AB  - The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to incentive providers to reduce costs while maintaining quality of care. In this paper, the authors propose a predictive analytics approach to redesigning the MSSP contract with the goal of better aligning incentives and improving financial outcomes from the MSSP. The authors leverage a data set containing the financial performance of providers enrolled in the MSSP, which together accounts for 7 million beneficiaries and more than $70 billion in Medicare spending. It is estimated that introducing performance-based subsidies to the MSSP can boost Medicare savings by up to 40% without compromising provider participation in the MSSP. This work highlights the promise that data analytics hold in the design of incentive contracts. The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to control escalating Medicare spending by incentivizing providers to deliver healthcare more efficiently. Medicare providers that enroll in the MSSP earn bonus payments for reducing spending to below a risk-adjusted financial benchmark that depends on the provider's historical spending. To generate savings, a provider must invest to improve efficiency, which is a cost that is absorbed entirely by the provider under the current contract. This has proven to be challenging for the MSSP, with a majority of participating providers unable to generate savings owing to the associated costs. In this paper, we propose a predictive analytics approach to redesigning the MSSP contract with the goal of better aligning incentives and improving financial outcomes from the MSSP. We formulate the MSSP as a principal-agent model and propose an alternate contract that includes a performance-based subsidy to partially reimburse the provider's investment. We prove the existence of a subsidy-based contract that dominates the current MSSP contract by producing a strictly higher expected payoff for both Medicare and the provider. We then propose an estimator based on inverse optimization for estimating the parameters of our model. We use a data set containing the financial performance of providers enrolled in the MSSP, which together accounts for 7 million beneficiaries and more than $70 billion in Medicare spending. We estimate that introducing performance-based subsidies to the MSSP can boost Medicare savings by up to 40% without compromising provider participation in the MSSP. We also find that the subsidy-based contract performs well in comparison with a fully flexible nonparametric contract.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Public health budget constraints force policy makers to prioritize resources toward those interventions that yield the highest perceived benefits. Intuitively, it appears optimal to focus resources on affordable interventions against prevalent diseases. However, due to the dynamics of infectious disease eradication, policies focusing on a static perception of priorities may lead to economically suboptimal outcomes. Using a hypothetical two-disease dynamic transmission model, we explore several different decision rules with respect to vaccination policy for eradicable diseases. The simulations show that cost-effectiveness decreases as the extent of priority shifting increases. This model suggests the need for a longer-term dynamic perspective to appropriately recognize costs and benefits of different policies for eradicable diseases.

T2  - Journal of Consumer Research
AB  - With rapid biotechnological advances in specialty drugs and direct-to-consumer advertising, consumers are under tremendous pressure to look, perform, feel, and live better. This is often accomplished through the use of life-enhancing products, sometimes referred to as performance-enhancing products, which can be accessed only through a gatekeeper, such as a physician. Integrating consumer and medical research, this article investigates how physicians make trade-offs between objective medical and nonmedical factors to determine consumers' access to life-enhancing products by examining US pediatric endocrinologists' prescription decisions for growth hormone (GH) for healthy but short children. The results of a conjoint study indicate that consumer medical criteria have less impact on a physician's decision to prescribe GH if the consumer requests a prescription or the physician believes in the intangible product benefits, and more impact when the product is more expensive. A physician's length of experience increases the impact of consumer medical criteria and decreases the influence of a consumer's preference for a prescription on the decision to prescribe. Overall, this research shows that not all consumers have equal access to lifeenhancing products; their access depends on a complex combination of medical and nonmedical factors related to the consumer, product, and the physician.

We examine individuals facing real or hypothetical decisions to discontinue their infants' life support who either choose personally or have physicians choose for them. Findings from a multidisciplinary approach consisting of a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews and three laboratory studies reveal that perceived personal causality for making tragic decisions generates more negative feelings than having the same choices externally made. Tragic decisions also undermine coping abilities, weakening the desire for autonomy. Consequently, participants disliked making decisions but also resented relinquishing their option to choose.

T2  - Journal of Consumer Research
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A-3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect , a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers' unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.

AU  - Cox, Anthony D
AU  - Cox, Dena
AU  - Mantel, Susan Powell
T2  - Journal of Marketing
AB  - Risk disclosure is an essential element of the marketing of prescription drugs and other medical products. This study examines how consumers respond to verbal information about the frequency and severity of medical-product risks and how media-induced affect can moderate such responses. The study finds that consumers tend to overestimate the actual likelihood of adverse events described with words such as "common" or "rare" (compared with the probabilities such terms are typically intended to convey) and that consumers tend to give little weight to such probability language when forming product use intentions. However, consumers in positive media-induced moods seem to engage in more nuanced evaluation of product risk information, weighing both frequency and severity information and using such information to make inferences about other product attributes (e.g., product efficacy). These findings suggest that medical marketers and regulators need to devise more effective means of communicating risk probability to consumers and that positive mood induction (e.g., by placing advertisements in upbeat media environments) can enhance consumers' ability to process product risk information.

AB  - Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10-20 (13-24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients' demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%-96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.

Intuition and cognitive shortcuts can lead to suboptimal decisions and, especially in high-stakes decisions, to legitimate welfare concerns. In this paper, we propose an extension of a Bayesian learning model that allows us to quantify the impact of salience--the fact that some pieces of information are easier to retrieve from memory than others--on physician learning. We show, using data on actual prescriptions for real patients, that physicians' belief formation is strongly influenced by salience effects. Feedback from switching patients--the ones the physician decided to switch to a clinically equivalent treatment--receives considerably more weight than feedback from other patients. In the category we study, salience effects slowed down physicians' speed of learning and the adoption of a new treatment, which raises welfare concerns. For managers, our findings suggest that firms that are able to eliminate, or at least reduce, salience effects to a greater extent than their competitors can speed up the adoption of new treatments. We explore the implications of these results and suggest alternative applications of our model that are relevant for policy makers and managers.

TI  - Smoking Cessation: A Model of Planned vs. Actual Behavior for Time-Inconsistent Consumers
AU  - Machado, Fernando S.

T2  - Marketing Science
AB  - We offer a simple model of intertemporal choice to characterize how planned versus actual behaviors evolve for time-inconsistent smokers. Our results suggest that smokers participation and cessation decisions are governed by the interplay between three effects. The cessation effect leads smokers to advance their plans to quit smoking, whereas the procrastination effect leads them to consecutively revise their planned quitting age upwards. Consequently, the duration of smoking is effectively governed by which one of these two effects is dominant. Finally, for certain consumer segments, a threshold effect causes an "all or nothing" type of extreme smoking behavior based on certain critical values of present-biased preferences. Our results provide some preliminary evidence that both marketing efforts by tobacco firms and public policy initiatives can have a significant influence on smoking behavion In particular, we find that reductions in the age at which individuals start smoking may not only vastly extend their duration of smoking, but also convert potential "never smokers" into lifetime smokers. Finally, we estimate a hazard model using survey data from over 800 smokers to provide evidence in support of our theoretical model.

AB  - We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) and show that information asymmetry about the expert's diagnostic ability may result in undertesting in the equilibrium. We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) that may be based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability or supplemented by a diagnostic test-conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) tools alike-revealing the client's true condition. The expert's diagnostic ability (or type) is private information. The expert is impurely altruistic in that the expert cares about both the client's utility and the expert's own reputational payoff that depends on the peer perception of the expert's diagnostic ability. The decision of whether to perform the test, which is costly for the client, provides the expert with an opportunity to influence that perception. We show a unique separating equilibrium exists in which the high-type expert does not resort to diagnostic testing and offers a diagnosis based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability, whereas the low-type expert performs the test. Furthermore, we establish that high-type expert may skip necessary diagnostic tests to separate them from the low-type expert. Interestingly, the effect of reputational payoff on undertesting is nonmonotonic, and the desire to appear of high type leads to undertesting only when the reputational payoff is intermediate. Our results also suggest a more altruistic expert may be more likely to engage in undertesting. Furthermore, efforts to encourage testing by providing financial incentives or by raising malpractice lawsuit concerns may, surprisingly, help fuel undertesting in the equilibrium. Our paper sheds new light on barriers to the adoption of AI tools aimed at enhancing physicians' diagnostic decision making.

AU  - Gino, Francesca
T2  - Management Science
AB  - Many models in operations management involve dynamic decision making that assumes optimal updating in response to information revelation. However, behavioral theory suggests that rather than updating their beliefs, individuals may persevere in their prior beliefs. In particular, we examine how individuals' prior experiences and the experiences of those around them alter their belief perseverance in operational decisions after the revelation of negative news. We draw on an exogenous announcement of negative news by the Food and Drug Administration and explore how it affects interventional cardiologists deciding between two types of cardiac stents. Analyzing 147,000 choices over six years, we find that individuals do respond to negative news by using the focal production tool less often. However, we find that both individuals' own experiences and others' experiences alter their responses. Moreover, although individual and other experience act as substitutes before negative news, we find that this substitution significantly curtails following the negative announcement. Finally, we find that experience leads doctors to discount negative news more rapidly over time. Two lab studies replicate our main findings and show that behavioral biases due to differences in perceptions of expertise drive the effect. Our research contributes not only to operations research but also to the practice of healthcare and operations.

T2  - Management Science
AB  - Currently available medication for treating many chronic diseases is often effective only for a subgroup of patients, and biomarkers accurately assessing whether an individual belongs to this subgroup typically do not exist. In such settings, physicians learn about the effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation-i.e., by initiating treatment and monitoring the patient's response. Precise guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left entirely to the physician's discretion. We introduce a framework for developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases. Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient, but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that the timing and severity of such events provide critical information for treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis, which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.

TI  - Heuristic Thinking in Patient Care
AU  - Kc, Diwas Singh
T2  - Management Science
AB  - This paper studies heuristic thinking and cognitive bias using a natural experiment from the field. The setting for the study is a set of acute care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient's suitability for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the heuristic is challenging, as patient readiness for discharge is often correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) [14.6%, 23.8%]) of patients incur an increased length of stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment; postmidnight patients on average cost $512 (95% CI [$100, $923]) more but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106, eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

AB  - The only therapy for a patient with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is liver transplantation, which is performed by using either a cadaveric liver from a deceased donor or a portion of a living-donor's liver. This study addresses the following decision problem for an ESLD patient with an available living donor. Should she have a transplantation now or wait? If she decides to have the transplantation now, should she use her living-donor liver or a cadaveric liver for transplantation? We formulate this problem as a discrete-time, infinite-horizon Markov decision process model and solve it using clinical data. Because living donors are typically related to the recipient, we incorporate a disutility associated with using the living-donor liver as opposed to using a cadaveric liver. We perform a structural analysis of the model, including a set of intuitive conditions that ensure the existence of structured policies such as an at-most-three-region (AM3R) optimal policy. Our computational experiments confirm that the optimal policy is typically of AM3R type.

AU  - Roberts, Mark S.
T2  - Management Science
AB  - In the United States, end-stage liver disease patients join a waiting list and then make accept/reject decisions for transplantation as deceased-donor organs are offered to them over time. These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice

AB  - When a cardiac lead fails, physicians implant a new lead and may opt to extract the failed lead and/or any previously abandoned leads. Because the risk of extraction increases in lead age, physicians may extract leads to reduce the future risk of mandatory extraction, due to either infection or limited space in the vein. We develop discrete-time semi-Markov decision process models for various types of cardiac devices to determine patient-specific, lifetime-maximizing extraction policies as a function of patient age and the age of every implanted lead.We use clinical data to calibrate these models and present insightful numerical results, including comparisons to policies commonly used in practice. Our numerical experiments suggest that extracting failed leads only when forced to because of space limitations is usually a good rule of thumb, but that following the optimal policy, as opposed to the commonly used heuristic policies, can extend an average patient's expected lifetime by up to 1.2 years and decrease the likelihood of device-related death by up to 94% in some cases.

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - Which vascular access to use is considered one of the most important questions in the care of patients on hemodialysis (HD). An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is often considered the gold standard for delivering HD due to better patient survival, higher quality of life, and fewer complications. However, AVFs have some limitations: they require surgery, it takes approximately three months to know whether the surgery was successful, and a majority of these surgeries end in failure. Conversely, another common vascular access, the central venous catheter, can be inserted via a simple procedure and used immediately after placement. In this research, we address the question of whether and when to perform AVF surgery on incident and established HD patients, with the aim of finding individualized policies that maximize a patient's probability of survival and remaining quality-adjusted life expectancy. Using a continuous-time dynamic programming model and under certain data-driven assumptions, we establish structural properties of the optimal policy for each objective. We provide further insights for policy makers through our numerical experiments.

AB  - This paper seeks an efficient way to screen a population of patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma when (1) each patient's disease evolves stochastically and (2) there are limited screening resources shared by the population. Recent medical discoveries have shown that biological information can be learned at each screening to differentiate patients into varying levels of risk for cancer. We investigate how to exploit this knowledge to choose which patients to screen to maximize early-stage cancer detections while limiting resource usage. We model the problem as a family of restless bandits, with each patient's disease progression evolving as a partially observable Markov decision process. We derive an optimal policy for this problem and discuss managerial insights into what characterizes more effective screening. To provide numerical evidence, we use two independent data sets of over 800 patients, one to train the optimal policy, and the other to build a computer simulation to act as a test bed for said policy. We are able to show that our policy detects 22 percent more early-stage cancers than current practice, while using the same amount of resource expenditure. We provide insights into the structure underlying our policy and discuss the implications of our findings.

TI  - Does Multitasking Improve Performance? Evidence from the Emergency Department
AU  - KC, Diwas Singh
T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - This paper examines the effect of multitasking on overall worker performance, as measured by processing time, throughput rate, and output quality using microlevel operational data from the field. Specifically, we study the multitasking behavior of physicians in a busy hospital emergency department (ED). By drawing on recent findings in the experimental psychology literature and the nascent work in cognitive neuroscience, we develop several hypotheses for the effect of multitasking on worker performance. We first examine how multitasking affects a physician's processing time. We find that the total time taken to discharge a given number of patients has a U-shaped response to the level of physician multitasking; that is, multitasking initially helps to reduce the time taken, but only up to a certain threshold level, after which it increases in the level of multitasking. In addition, multitasking significantly impacts quality of care. Although lower levels of multitasking are associated with improved quality of care, at higher levels, additional multitasking leads to a smaller number of detected diagnoses and an increased likelihood of a 24-hour revisit rate to the ED. These findings have important implications for the design and organization of work in general and for the delivery of critical care in particular.

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - Motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the United States, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians' decisions about ordering imaging tests. Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients' waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients' waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician's decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. Our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.

AB  - In recent years, many urban areas have established healthcare coalitions (HCCs) composed of autonomous (and often competing) hospitals, with the goal of improving emergency preparedness and response. We study the role of such coalitions in the specific context of response to multiple-casualty incidents in an urban setting, where on-scene responders must determine how to send casualties to medical facilities. A key function in incident response is multi-agency coordination. When this coordination is provided by an HCC, responders can use richer information about hospital capacities to decide where to send casualties. Using bed availability data from an urban area and a suburban area in the United States, we analyze the response capability of healthcare infrastructures under different levels of coordination, and we develop a stress test to identify areas of weakness. We find that improved coordination efforts should focus on decision support using information about inpatient resources, especially in urban areas with high inter-hospital variability in resource availability. We also find that coordination has the largest benefit in small incidents. This benefit is a new value proposition for HCCs, which were originally formed to improve preparedness for large disasters.

AB  - Problem definition: Organ-transplanted patients typically receive high amounts of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus) as a mechanism to reduce their risk of organ rejection. However, because of the diabetogenic effect of these drugs, this practice exposes them to a greater risk of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), and hence, becoming insulin dependent. We study and develop effective medication management strategies to address the common conundrum of balancing the risk of organ rejection versus that of NODAT. Academic/practical relevance: Our research contributes to the healthcare operations management literature by developing a robust stochastic decision-making framework that allows for incorporating (1) false-positive and false-negative errors of medical tests, (2) inevitable estimation errors when data sets are used, (3) variability among physician' attitudes toward ambiguous outcomes, and (4) dynamic and patient risk-profile-dependent progression of health conditions. Methodology: We apply an ambiguous partially observable Markov decision process (APOMDP) approach where dynamic optimization with respect to a "cloud" of possible models allows us to make decisions that are robust to potential misspecifications of risks. Results: We first provide various structural results that facilitate characterizing the optimal medication policies. Utilizing a clinical data set, we then compare the performance of the optimal medication policies obtained from our APOMDP model with the policies currently used in the medical practice. We observe that, in one year after transplant, our proposed policies can improve the life expectancy of each patient up to 4.58%, while reducing the medical expenditures up to 11.57%. Managerial implications: Balancing the risks of organ rejection and diabetes complications and considering factors such as physicians' attitudes toward ambiguous outcomes, partial observability of medical tests, and patient-specific risk factors are shown to result in more cost-effective strategies for management of post-transplant medications compared with the current medical practice. Finally, simultaneous management of medications can facilitate the care coordination process between transplantation/nephrology and endocrinology departments of a hospital that are typically in charge of administering such medications.

AB  - The global fight against HIV/AIDS is hindered by a lack of drugs in the developing world. When patients in these countries initiate treatment, they typically remain on it until death; thus, policy makers and physicians follow nonabandonment policies. However, treated patients develop resistance to treatment, so in many cases untreated patients might benefit more from the drugs. In this paper we quantify the opportunity cost associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies. For this, we use an approximate dynamic programming framework to bound the benefit from allowing premature treatment termination. Our results indicate that in sub-Saharan Africa, the price associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies lies between 404% and 801% of the total treatment benefit. We also derive superior treatment allocation policies, which shed light on the role behavior and health progression play in prioritizing treatment initiation and termination. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Millions of Americans undergo colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and surveillance every year. The efficiency of colonoscopy operations depends on how often patients are screened, which is a complex and controversial decision, as reflected by the discrepancy between clinical practice and guidelines. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process to optimize colonoscopy screening policies for the objective of maximizing total quality-adjusted life years. Our model incorporates age, gender, and risk of having CRC into the screening decisions and therefore provides a novel framework for personalized CRC screening. In addition to deriving the maximum attainable benefit from colonoscopy screening, which reflects the opportunity cost of following current guidelines, our results have several policy implications. Using clinical data, we show that the optimal colonoscopy screening policies may be more aggressive than the guidelines under some conditions. Optimal screening policies recommend that females with CRC history undergo colonoscopy more frequently than males. In contrast, females without CRC history should be screened less frequently than males. This result, which was not recognized before, signifies the role of gender in optimal CRC screening decisions.

AB  - Available clinical evidence is inconclusive on whether radiologists should use the patient risk profile information when interpreting mammograms. On the one hand, risk profile information is informative and can improve radiologists' performance, but on the other hand, it may impair their judgment by introducing biases in mammography interpretation. Therefore, it is important to assess whether and when profile information use translates into improved outcomes. We model the use of profile information in mammography, using a decision theoretic approach and explore the value of profile information using three process design choices: mammography only, unbiased, and biased reading. We estimate the parameters of our model using clinical data and find that using profile information along with the mammography information can achieve a better performance than not using the profile information. However, the better performance is contingent on the weight assigned to the profile information as well as the extent of bias due to profile information. Translating our findings into clinical practice would require properly designed experiments aiming to quantify the effect of the timing and the use of profile information on performance while accounting for radiologist and patient characteristics. When conducting an experiment is not feasible, a uniform operational sequence for interpreting mammograms and related guidelines may be a useful starting point to improve the quality of mammography operations.

AB  - This study is based on the analysis of field data on the revenues and patient flows that we collected on all adult emergency department (ED) visits to a level-1 trauma, tertiary referral center. Our objective was to provide researchers in operations a rich overview of the processes, resources, and metrics of financial and operations performance in the ED. We analyze how patients, physicians, hospitals/physician employer groups, and payers are party to the value created and financial workflow of the ED. A waterfall model for professional services revenue is developed that highlights the impacts of changes in processes, resources, scale, complexity, and mix of patients treated in the ED. We also discuss future implications of new compensation models and potential scenarios that will focus upon controlling costs while maximizing population health and patient satisfaction. These models will necessitate re-engineering of operations in the ED from a strategic perspective. Four major thrusts for selecting the capacity portfolio in the ED operations to align the interests of all the stakeholders are recommended. New avenues for research are also identified.

AB  - To manage chronic disease patients effectively, clinicians must know (i) how to monitor each patient (i.e., when to schedule the next visit and which tests to take), and (ii) how to control the disease (i.e., what levels of controllable risk factors will sufficiently slow progression). Our research addresses these questions simultaneously and provides the optimal solution to a novel linear quadratic Gaussian state space model. For the objective of minimizing the relative change in state over time (i.e., disease progression), which is necessary for managing irreversible chronic diseases while also considering the cost of tests and treatment, we show that the classical two-way separation of estimation and control holds. This makes a previously intractable problem solvable by decomposition into two separate, tractable problems while maintaining optimality. The resulting optimization is applied to the management of glaucoma. Based on data from two large randomized clinical trials, we validate our model and demonstrate how our decision support tool can provide actionable insights to the clinician caring for a patient with glaucoma. This methodology can be applied to a broad range of irreversible chronic diseases to devise patient-specific monitoring and treatment plans optimally.

AB  - Breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer death for women, can be detected at earlier stages through mammography screening. Therefore, most developed countries implemented population-based mammography screening programs. However, cost of mammography and limited resources in terms of number of trained personnel and diagnostic machines prevent mammography screening to be adopted by many other countries. In fact, even in resource-rich countries, there is a growing concern about cost of mammography screening. In this study, we investigate the optimal allocation of limited mammography resources to screen a population. We propose a constrained partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP) model that maximizes total expected quality-adjusted life years of the patients when they are allowed only a limited number of mammography screenings. We use a variable resolution grid-based approximation scheme to convert the CPOMDP model into a mixed-integer linear program and conduct several numerical experiments using breast cancer epidemiology data. We observe that as mammography screening capacity decreases, patients in the 40-49 age group should be given the least priority with respect to screening. We further find that efficient allocation of available resources between patients with different risk levels leads to significant quality-adjusted life year gains, especially for the patients with higher breast cancer risk.

AB  - We develop a finite-horizon discrete-time constrained Markov decision process (MDP) to model diagnostic decisions after mammography where we maximize the total expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of a patient under resource constraints. We use clinical data to estimate the parameters of the MDP model and solve it as a mixed-integer program. By repeating optimization for a sequence of budget levels, we calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios attributable to consecutive levels of funding and compare actual clinical practice with optimal decisions. We prove that the optimal value function is concave in the allocated budget. Comparing to actual clinical practice, using optimal thresholds for decision making may result in approximately 22% cost savings without sacrificing QALYs. Our analysis indicates short-term follow-ups are the immediate target for elimination when budget becomes a concern. Policy change is more drastic in the older age group with the increasing budget, yet the gains in total expected QALYs related to larger budgets are predominantly seen in younger women along with modest gains for older women.

T2  - Manufacturing & Service Operations Management
AB  - We submit this editorial on the day after the Supreme Court announced its decision on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Clearly, healthcare is one of the major issues of our time, and it will be one of the key issues impacting the Presidential Election of 2012.
Over the last dozen or so years, more and more of us in operations research and operations management have devoted a portion of our efforts to the analysis of a wide variety of topics in the field of healthcare operations management. The number of healthcare talks at INFORMS, POMS, and M&SOM meetings has increased dramatically. In addition, the quality of the work presented has improved over the same time period. Twenty years ago, OR/OM scholars would borrow tools from the manufacturing literature and apply these to healthcare problems. More recently, researchers are focusing their energies, first and foremost, on the healthcare environment (e.g., spending time at a hospital) and developing original insights.
There are a number of reasons for this transition. First, the U.S. healthcare system is broken. Healthcare professionals are actively looking for help. Second, there are more healthcare data available than ever before. INFORMS members know that careful analysis of healthcare data can lead to smarter decisions, better quality healthcare, and cost savings. Third, a larger number of healthcare decision makers have M.B.A.'s or, at least, some business training than ever before. They understand that we can help.
This special issue documents 11 high-quality applications of operations management to healthcare. Collectively, the papers illustrate the substantial progress made in healthcare operations management in recent years. We now present brief summaries of the papers in this issue. 
"Physician Workload and Hospital Reimbursement: Overworked Physicians Generate Less Revenue per Patient"
Powell, Savin, and Savva examine a detailed data set from the trauma department at a major urban hospital. The data set spans the years from 2006 to 2010 and yields more than 6,000 observations. Using an econometric analysis, the authors show that when workload is high, physicians' discharge notes are more likely to be less than complete, resulting in undercoding, which translates to a reduction in revenue.
"Optimization of Prostate Biopsy Referral Decisions"
Zhang et al. study prostate cancer biopsy referral decisions. They take patient age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test results into account. The PSA test is a simple test, but a high PSA score is not always a good predictor for cancer. The authors develop a partially observable Markov decision process model to determine when it makes sense to recommend a biopsy be performed. They carried out parameter estimation using data from nearly 12,000 patients from Minnesota.
"Process Management Impact on Clinical and Experiential Quality: Managing Tensions Between Safe and Patient-Centered Healthcare"
Chandrasekaran, Senot, and Boyer collected about a year's worth of data on clinical quality (i.e., patient safety) and experiential quality (i.e., responsiveness to patient concerns) from 2009 to 2010. Their data involved 273 acute-care hospitals from 43 states. Hospitals would ideally like to score highly with respect to both measures, but there is often a tension between the two objectives. Four important implications arise from the authors' empirical research.
 
"Integrated Block Sharing: A Win-Win Strategy for Hospitals and Surgeons"
In managing operating rooms in hospitals, surgeons want predictable and reliable access (known as block time), whereas hospital administrators want the operating rooms to be fully utilized. These are two competing objectives. Day, Garfinkel, and Thompson intro- duce the notion of shared block time. Using integer programming and simulation (and data from a hospital in Richmond, Virginia), the authors demonstrate the benefits of the new approach, which has been suc cessfully implemented in the last few years.
"A Queueing Model to Evaluate the Impact of Patient 'Batching' on Throughput and Flow Time in a Medical Teaching Facility"
The research by Dobson et al. examines the common practice of batching patients for initial exams at emergency rooms affiliated with teaching hospitals. Using tandem queues with finite buffers, the authors point out that when maximum throughput is the objective, it can be optimal for resident physicians not to take on new patients, even when there are beds available, but to remain idle in order to be available for a conference with an attending physician. Their analysis proves that the structure of the throughput-optimal policy does not depend on whether the bottleneck resource is the attending physician or the resident physician's resource pool.
"The Effect of Budgetary Restrictions on Breast Cancer Diagnostic Decisions"
This paper presents a new framework for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of certain procedures in the context of breast cancer diagnostic decisions following mammography. Clinical data are used by Ayvaci, Alagoz, and Burnside to calibrate their Markov decision process that aims at maximizing the total expected quality-adjusted life years of a patient under a global budgetary resource constraint. Their results indicate that small changes with respect to follow-up exams can lead to savings of over 20%, without com- promising overall patient utility.
"Accumulating a Portfolio of Experience: The Effect of Focal and Related Experience on Surgeon Performance"
This study by KC and Staats examines the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience in the learning of cardiothoracic surgeons who conduct a class of minimally invasive cardiac procedures known as off-pump coronary artery bypass. Statistical analysis of the data shows that not all types of experience contribute equally to improving outcomes; there- fore, selecting the mix of procedure types (based on both focal and related tasks as well as subtask variety) can play an important role in improving surgeon performance.
"Information Hang-overs in Healthcare Service Systems"
This paper by Lahiri and Seidmann is motivated by a long-term empirical study of a medical imaging practice. The authors develop a queueing model of the clinical interpretation step by the radiologists, and show that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround times of the diagnostic reports. This paper also explains how information systems should be designed to solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and optimally relocating that task upstream in the work flow.
"Performance-Based Contracts for Outpatient Medical Services"
Performance-based approaches to contracting for outpatient services are used in the United Kingdom by the National Health Service (NHS) to control both capacity and cost and an expected waiting-time tar- get. Jiang, Pang, and Savin model the appointment dynamics under these contracts as an M /D/1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches assuming adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. They also provide a case study of a small NHS trust in Scotland to illustrate the nature of the solutions for allocating out- patient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients.
"Appointment Scheduling Under Patient No-Shows and Service Interruptions"
Luo, Kulkarni, and Ziya study an appointment- based service system (e.g., an outpatient clinic). Appointments are scheduled in advance, but some patients do not show up for their appointments. In addition, the schedule can be interrupted by emergency (higher priority) patients. The authors use stochastic optimization to determine optimal appointment policies under a variety of assumptions.
"Fee-For-Service Contracts in Pharmaceutical Distribution Supply Chains: Design, Analysis, and Management"
Zhao et al. study fee-for-service (FFS) contracts and investment buying (IB) with respect to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain environment. (IB is buying now in anticipation of future drug price increases.) The authors formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and distributor under the FFS and IB models. They show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit, to be split between the manufacturer and distributor.
In addition to the articles mentioned above, we invited Linda Green, a long-time contributor to the healthcare operations management literature, to pre- pare a perspectives piece on where the field is now and possible future research directions for healthcare operations management. Next, we invited four commentaries in order to allow other scholars to expand upon Linda's vision.
This special issue has taken several years to complete. We are pleased with the result. Moreover, we hope that readers enjoy the issue and are encouraged by it to contribute to the growth, success, and visibility of healthcare operations management.

AB  - Ethics has long been, and continues to be, a central topic among marketing scholars and practitioners. When providing complex services-multiple interactions over time that are predicated on the evolving needs of customers-service providers face ethical dilemmas, which are often resolved by engaging an ethics committee (EC). Despite the prevalence of ECs, research on service providers' preference to engage with an EC is sparse. This study examines whether the role that health care providers play, as either task manager or relationship manager, makes a difference in their preference for engaging with and utilizing an EC for resolving ethical dilemmas. Results based on 1,440 observations collected from health care service providers show that service providers' task or relationship management role, as well as prior experience with an ethics consultation, influences their preference both for engaging an EC and for having the EC prescribe a specific outcome to resolve an ethical dilemma. This study extends prior work on conceptual models examining ethical decision-making processes in marketing.

TI  - Incentive-Compatible Prehospital Triage in Emergency Medical Services
AU  - Webb, Eric M.
AU  - Mills, Alex F.
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The emergency medical services (EMS) system is designed to handle life-threatening emergencies, but a large and growing number of non-emergency patients are accessing hospital-based health care through EMS. A national survey estimated that 17% of ambulance trips to hospital emergency departments (EDs) were medically unnecessary, and these unnecessary trips make up an increasing proportion of all EMS trips. These non-emergency patients are a controllable arrival stream that can be redirected to an appropriate care provider, reducing congestion in EDs, reducing costs to patients and health care payers, and improving patient health, but prehospital triage to identify these patients is almost never implemented by EMS providers in the United States. Using a decision model, we show that prehospital triage is unlikely to occur under the current structure of fee-for-service reimbursements, regardless of how effective the triage process might be, unless low-acuity patients are unprofitable and a hospital is willing to coordinate with EMS. We demonstrate several mechanisms a payer, such as Medicare, could use to promote prehospital triage: reforming fee-for-service reimbursements or offering a value-based payment, such as bundled payments or shared savings contracts. Using data from a national survey and levels of triage effectiveness demonstrated in the literature, we conservatively estimate that Medicare alone could save between $3 and $70 million per year (depending on triage effectiveness) by providing incentives for prehospital triage. Between 26,500 and 628,000 non-emergency patients could be diverted to more appropriate care options, making prehospital triage a practical step to address hospital emergency department crowding.

TI  - Offering Discretionary Healthcare Services with Medical Consumption

T2  - Production and Operations Management
AB  - This study studies discretionary healthcare services with consumption of medical goods (e.g., tests, drugs). Specifically, we focus on a setting where the service provider obtains revenue from the medical consumption, and the perceived service value improves while the amount of medical consumption decreases in the service time (e.g., due to more thorough inquiry and examination). We find that the equilibrium service and demand rates both decrease if the service provider's share of revenue from the medical consumption decreases, or if the medical goods become more expensive. Moreover, the consumption of goods can reverse some well-known results in models without goods: the service provider may reduce the service time when the perceived service value depends more heavily on the service time. From a policy perspective, we find that service price caps--often put in place to control medical costs--can lead to shorter service times and increased medical consumption. This effect is more severe when the service provider retains less revenue from the medical goods or when they are less expensive. Furthermore, without service price caps, facing a smaller market size, the service provider generally offers a longer service time inducing less medical consumption; however, this can be reversed with service price caps. Thus, in discretionary healthcare services accompanied by medical goods, price regulations may lead to wasteful consumption; extra attention is needed for certain market scenarios.

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Scheduling patients involves a trade-off between the productivity of the service provider and customer service. This study considers how outpatient medical facilities can improve their appointment scheduling by incorporating individual patient information in the scheduling process. Specifically, we obtain data on patient characteristics and examination durations from a health clinic, describe how that data can be used to predict patient examination durations in the clinic's appointment scheduling system, and evaluate the benefit of using individual patient characteristics over a conventional classification method. Computational results illustrate this method of patient scheduling reduces an overall cost function comprised of patient wait time, physician idle time, and over time by up to 24.2%, particularly when patients are sequenced with short duration patients being scheduled first. Several environmental characteristics are found to play critical roles in determining the magnitude of the benefit, including patient punctuality, no-show probability, the clinic duration, the appointment rule used for scheduling, and the ratio of the physician's idle time cost to the patient wait cost. We also detail and evaluate a practical procedure for using heterogeneous scheduling under a fixed schedule.

TI  - Panel Size and Overbooking Decisions for Appointment-Based Services under Patient No-Shows
AU  - Liu, Nan
AU  - Ziya, Serhan
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - Many service systems that work with appointments, particularly those in healthcare, suffer from high no-show rates. While there are many reasons why patients become no-shows, empirical studies found that the probability of a patient being a no-show typically increases with the patient's appointment delay, i.e., the time between the call for the appointment and the appointment date. This paper investigates how demand and capacity control decisions should be made while taking this relationship into account. We use stylized single server queueing models to model the appointments scheduled for a provider, and consider two different problems. In the first problem, the service capacity is fixed and the decision variable is the panel size; in the second problem, both the panel size and the service capacity (i.e., overbooking level) are decision variables. The objective in both cases is to maximize some net reward function, which reduces to system throughput for the first problem. We give partial or complete characterizations for the optimal decisions, and use these characterizations to provide insights into how optimal decisions depend on patient's no-show behavior in regards to their appointment delay. These insights especially provide guidance to service providers who are already engaged in or considering interventions such as sending reminders in order to decrease no-show probabilities. We find that in addition to the magnitudes of patient show-up probabilities, patients' sensitivity to incremental delays is an important determinant of how demand and capacity decisions should be adjusted in response to anticipated changes in patients' no-show behavior.

TI  - When to Switch? Index Policies for Resource Scheduling in Emergency Response
AU  - Li, Dong

AU  - Connor, Stephen
T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - This study considers the scheduling of limited resources to a large number of jobs (e.g., medical treatment) with uncertain lifetimes and service times, in the aftermath of a mass casualty incident. Jobs are subject to triage at time zero, and placed into a number of classes. Our goal is to maximize the expected number of job completions. We propose an effective yet simple index policy based on Whittle's restless bandits approach. The problem concerned features a finite and uncertain time horizon that is dependent upon the service policy, which also determines the decision epochs. Moreover, the number of job classes still competing for service diminishes over time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Whittle's index policies to such problems. Two versions of Lagrangian relaxation are proposed in order to decompose the problem. The first is a direct extension of the standard Whittle's restless bandits approach, while in the second the total number of job classes still competing for service is taken into account; the latter is shown to generalize the former. We prove the indexability of all job classes in the Markovian case, and develop closed-form indices. Extensive numerical experiments show that the second proposal outperforms the first one (that fails to capture the dynamics in the number of surviving job classes, or bandits) and produces more robust and consistent results as compared to alternative heuristics suggested from the literature, even in non-Markovian settings.

TI  - Delivering Long-Term Surgical Care in Underserved Communities: The Enabling Role of International NPOs as Partners

T2  - Production & Operations Management
AB  - The efforts of not-for-profit organizations (NPOs) toward enabling health care delivery in underserved communities across the globe are well-acknowledged. To date, little is known about the workings and sustenance of NPO-enabled long-term health care delivery in underserved communities, and even less about NPO-enabled surgical care delivery. Further, health care delivery in underserved communities is a context that is often characterized by primitive and poor record keeping, data scarcity, and poor data quality. Therefore, conducting research on health care delivery in such contexts is particularly challenging. The central question motivating this study is: How can international NPOs enable the long-term delivery of surgical care in underserved communities? To overcome the data challenges, we use multi-method triangulation as the research design to conduct this study. Specifically, we adopt a grounded theory approach with small sample statistical analysis for empirical validation. We triangulate insights from qualitative and quantitative data analyses to develop and validate an integrative framework for an international NPO-enabled long-term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The setting for this study is Children's HeartLink, an international medical non-profit organization based in the United States, which partners with health care delivery organizations in developing countries to enable the diagnosis and treatment of children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The focus of this study is the Children HeartLink's partnership with the First Hospital of Lanzhou University (FHLU) located in the underserved and impoverished Gansu province of China. In Gansu province, the CHD incidence rate is six times China's average. The time period of this study is 11 years, 1998-2008. The key contribution of this study is the integrative framework for an international NPO-enabled long-term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The framework demonstrates how an international NPO's efforts related to affordability, provider awareness, and physical access are interdependent, and how the efforts interact and impact the surgical care delivery outcome. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the framework provides new and nuanced insights such as the following: (i) an international NPO's efforts related to affordability (e.g., funding) or provider awareness (e.g., knowledge transfer) alone has limited direct impact on long-term surgical care outcome; (ii) instead of having a direct impact on the volume of surgeries, an international NPO's effort related to affordability moderates (positively interacts with) the positive association between its efforts related to provider awareness and physical access to surgical care delivery infrastructure, thus impacting the volume of surgeries; and (iii) an international NPO's efforts related to provider awareness and physical access are complementary for long-term surgical care delivery--i.e., the effort related to provider awareness moderates by way of strengthening the positive association between the effort related to physical access and the volume of surgeries. Limitations of the study--e.g., small sample size for empirical validation of the grounded theory research findings and issues of generalizability--are acknowledged, and the directions of future research to address the limitations are discussed.

AB  - In this study, we examine the hospital's ability to admit patients from its emergency department. From a medical perspective, the number of patients being admitted should depend solely on the patients' clinical conditions. Using a large-scale econometric study that includes detailed operational and clinical data on all cardiac patient encounters from a set of 128 hospitals over a period of four years, we show that this is not the case. In particular, we find that independent of their medical condition, many emergency patients are denied hospital admission because of a lack of inpatient beds. Our analysis suggests that having one more inpatient bed at the start of a day can increase the likelihood of an emergency room patient admission by around 3% on average. We examine two policies--active discharge and demand smoothing--that can help hospitals improve patient access. We find that some hospitals actively discharge inpatients when beds become scarce; hospitals that follow such an active discharge protocol are, on average, able to admit more patients. We also investigate to what extent the hospital's ability to smooth its surgical schedule impacts hospital admissions. Hospitals tend to schedule their elective patients early in the week (Mondays and Tuesdays), and discharge them by the weekend in order to minimize weekend staffing, effectively maximizing bed occupancy during the middle of the week. This "weekend effect" artificially induces variability, and reduces effective system capacity. We find that by scheduling patients more uniformly over the week, hospitals can dramatically increase patient access, obviating the need for active discharges or additional capacity investment. Our analysis quantifies these effects, and can help hospitals make effective capacity management decisions in order to improve patient flow.

AB  - In this study, we develop an analytical framework for personalizing the anticoagulation therapy of patients who are taking warfarin. Consistent with medical practice, our treatment design consists of two stages: (i) the initiation stage, modeled using a partially-observable Markov decision process, during which the physician learns through systematic belief updates about the unobservable patient sensitivity to warfarin, and (ii) the maintenance stage, modeled using a Markov decision process, during which the physician relies on his formed belief about patient sensitivity to determine the stable, patient-specific, warfarin dose to prescribe. We develop an expression for belief updates in the POMDP, establish the optimality of the myopic policy for the MDP, and derive conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a myopically optimal dose. We validate our models using a real-life patient data set gathered at the Hematology Clinic of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. The proposed analytical framework and case study enable us to develop useful clinical insights, for example, concerning the length of the initiation period and the importance of correctly assessing patient sensitivity.

AB  - We study the widespread practice of assigning a single surgeon to two operating rooms (ORs), which is known as overlapping surgery. We first describe the fundamental trade-offs that motivate hospitals to employ the practice. Then, we conduct a mathematical analysis for the completion of a set of elective operations under an overlapping surgery policy and a more traditional, serial scheduling policy. We use this analysis, along with a cost function that considers surgeon idle time and total OR time, to derive two models for predicting environments where overlapping surgery is preferable. We use insights from our modeling efforts to provide objective evidence that supports or opposes claims made in the medical trade literature regarding the use of overlapping surgery. In particular, we show that contrary to claims in the medical trade literature, overlapping surgery does not allow a hospital to increase total surgical volume. Finally, we show that hospitals interested in employing overlapping surgery are best served by focusing efforts aimed at reducing time requirement uncertainty on turnover times instead of procedure times.

AB  - The population of truck drivers plays a key role in the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Truck drivers thereby affect the health and lives of many, but also suffer from poor health and significantly reduced life expectancy themselves. Due to professional circumstances, their health service needs are generally not well addressed. Therefore, the non-governmental organization North Star Alliance builds a network of healthcare facilities along the largest trucking routes in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper studies the problem where to place additional facilities, and which health service packages to offer at each facility. The objective combines the maximization of the patient volume at these facilities and the maximization of the effectiveness of the health service delivery to the population served. The latter criterion is modeled through three novel access measures which capture the needs for effective service provisioning. The resulting optimization problem is essentially different from previously studied healthcare facility location problems because of the specific mobile nature of health service demand of truck drivers. Applying our model to the network of major transport corridors in South-East Africa, we investigate several prominent questions managers and decision-makers face. We show that the present network expansion strategy, which primarily focuses on patient volumes, may need to be reconsidered: substantial gains in effectiveness can be made when allowing a small reduction in patient volumes. We furthermore show that solutions are rather robust to data impreciseness and that long-term network planning can bring substantial benefits, particularly in greenfield situations.

AB  - We investigate the scheduling practices of a medical school that must assign a cohort of students to a series of clinical rotations, while respecting both operational and quality-of-service requirements. Students become available to start clerkship progressively throughout the year and can complete rotations at hospitals in different geographic regions. Each hospital may offer a subset of the clinical rotations, with different start dates, capacities, and cost rates. We propose a novel network-flow model based on decision diagrams, a graphical structure that compresses the state space of a dynamic program, to model feasible schedules. We demonstrate that our network model has several interesting structural features, is computationally superior as compared to a classical mixed-integer linear program, and can be used to generate useful insights that can aid in managerial decision-making. Using a dataset collected from the American University of the Caribbean, we perform a counterfactual analysis which shows that had our scheduling approach been implemented, a cost reduction of approximately 19% on average could have been achieved. To understand how assignment decisions can affect future costs, we develop a discrete-event simulation of the licensing examination and clerkship scheduling process. We then compare our exact scheduling approach with current practice and achieve an average cost reduction of 25%. We also show that this cost reduction is robust with respect to estimation and forecast uncertainty, specifically, the licensing exam failure rate and the future cohort size.

AB  - Hospital emergency departments (EDs) provide around-the-clock medical care, and as such are generally modeled as nonterminating queues. However, from the care provider's point of view, ED care is not a never-ending process, but rather occurs in discrete work shifts and may require passing unfinished work to the next care provider at the end of the shift. We use data from a large, academic medical center ED to show that the patients' rate of service completion varies over the course of the physician shift. Furthermore, patients that have experienced a physician handoff have a higher rate of service completion than nonhanded off patients. As a result, a patient's expected treatment time is impacted by when the physician's shift treatment begins. We also show that patients that have been handed off are more likely to revisit the ED within three days, suggesting that patient handoffs lower clinical quality. Lastly, we use simulation to show that shift length and new-patient cutoff rules can be used to reduce handoffs, but at the expense of system throughput.

AB  - We consider a patient admission problem to a hospital with multiple resource constraints (e.g., OR and beds) and a stochastic evolution of patient care requirements across multiple resources. There is a small but significant proportion of emergency patients who arrive randomly and have to be accepted at the hospital. However, the hospital needs to decide whether to accept, postpone, or even reject the admission from a random stream of non-emergency elective patients. We formulate the control process as a Markov decision process to maximize expected contribution net of overbooking costs, develop bounds using approximate dynamic programming, and use them to construct heuristics. We test our methods on data from the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and find that our intuitive newsvendor-based heuristic performs well across all scenarios.
