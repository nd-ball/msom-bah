Jr and Bihorac, Azra",JAMA surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making. OBSERVATIONS: Surgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.",2020,10.1001/jamasurg.2019.4917,155,2,148-158,eng,2168-6262 2168-6254,"Emotions and Uncertainty and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Time Factors and Intuition and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Surgical Procedures, Operative and *Artificial Intelligence/ethics",NA,NA,2020/02/01/,JAMA Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cook_2015_ThBrjoofsu,JOUR,The rise of big clinical databases,"Cook, J. A. and Collins, G. S.",The British journal of surgery,"BACKGROUND: The routine collection of large amounts of clinical data, 'big data', is becoming more common, as are research studies that make use of these data source. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the uses of data from large multi-institution clinical databases for research. METHODS: This article considers the potential benefits, the types of data source, and the use to which the data is put. Additionally, the main challenges associated with using these data sources for research purposes are considered. RESULTS: Common uses of the data include: providing population characteristics; identifying risk factors and developing prediction (diagnostic or prognostic) models; observational studies comparing different interventions; exploring variation between healthcare providers; and as a supplementary source of data for another study. The main advantages of using such big data sources are their comprehensive nature, the relatively large number of patients they comprise, and the ability to compare healthcare providers. The main challenges are demonstrating data quality and confidently applying a causal interpretation to the study findings. CONCLUSION: Large clinical database research studies are becoming ubiquitous and offer a number of potential benefits. However, the limitations of such data sources must not be overlooked; each research study needs to be considered carefully in its own right, together with the justification for using the data for that specific purpose.",2015,10.1002/bjs.9723,102,2,e101-e93,eng,1365-2168 0007-1323,"Humans and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Research Design and Patient Outcome Assessment and Risk Assessment/methods and Information Dissemination/methods and Biomedical Research/methods and Data Collection/methods and Databases, Factual/standards/*statistics & numerical data and Delivery of Health Care/standards and Observational Studies as Topic/methods",NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,Br J Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Simianu_2016_JAMAsurg,JOUR,Number of Diverticulitis Episodes Before Resection and Factors Associated With Earlier Interventions,"Simianu, Vlad V. and Fichera, Alessandro and Bastawrous, Amir L. and Davidson, Giana H. and Florence, Michael G. and Thirlby, Richard C. and Flum, David R.",JAMA surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Despite professional recommendations to delay elective colon resection for patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, early surgery (after <3 preceding episodes) appears to be common. Several factors have been suggested to contribute to early surgery, including increasing numbers of younger patients, a lower threshold to operate laparoscopically, and growing recognition of ""smoldering"" (or nonrecovering) diverticulitis episodes. However, the relevance of these factors in early surgery has not been well tested, and most prior studies have focused on hospitalizations, missing outpatient events and making it difficult to assess guideline adherence in earlier interventions. OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of episodes of diverticulitis before surgery and factors associated with earlier interventions using inpatient, outpatient, and antibiotic prescription claims. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigation was a nationwide retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2012. The dates of the analysis were July 2014 to May 2015. Participants were immunocompetent adult patients (age range, 18-64 years) with incident, uncomplicated diverticulitis. EXPOSURE: Elective colectomy for diverticulitis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inpatient, outpatient, and antibiotic prescription claims for diverticulitis captured in the MarketScan (Truven Health Analytics) databases. RESULTS: Of 87<e2><80><af>461 immunocompetent patients having at least 1 claim for diverticulitis, 6.4% (n = 5604) underwent a resection. The final study cohort comprised 3054 nonimmunocompromised patients who underwent elective resection for uncomplicated diverticulitis, of whom 55.6% (n = 1699) were male. Before elective surgery, they had a mean (SD) of 1.0 (0.9) inpatient claims, 1.5 (1.5) outpatient claims, and 0.5 (1.2) antibiotic prescription claims related to diverticulitis. Resection occurred after fewer than 3 episodes in 94.9% (2897 of 3054) of patients if counting inpatient claims only, in 80.5% (2459 of 3054) if counting inpatient and outpatient claims only, and in 56.3% (1720 of 3054) if counting all types of claims. Based on all types of claims, patients having surgery after fewer than 3 episodes were of similar mean age compared with patients having delayed surgery (both 47.7 years, P = .91), were less likely to undergo laparoscopy (65.1% [1120 of 1720] vs 70.8% [944 of 1334], P = .001), and had more time between the last 2 episodes preceding surgery (157 vs 96 days, P < .001). Patients with health maintenance organization or capitated insurance plans had lower rates of early surgery (50.1% [247 of 493] vs 57.4% [1429 of 2490], P = .01) than those with other insurance plan types. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After considering all types of diverticulitis claims, 56.3% (1720 of 3054) of elective resections for uncomplicated diverticulitis occurred after fewer than 3 episodes. Earlier surgery was not explained by younger age, laparoscopy, time between the last 2 episodes preceding surgery, or financial risk-bearing for patients.

However, the effect of increasing use of laparoscopy on overall health care utilization and costs, especially in the long term, has not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of laparoscopic vs open colectomy on short- and long-term health care utilization and costs.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications cause a 2-fold increase in the 30-day mortality and cost, and are associated with long-term consequences. The ability to precisely forecast the risk for major complications before surgery is limited. METHODS: In a single-center cohort of 51,457 surgical patients undergoing major inpatient surgery, we have developed and validated an automated analytics framework for a preoperative risk algorithm (MySurgeryRisk) that uses existing clinical data in electronic health records to forecast patient-level probabilistic risk scores for 8 major postoperative complications (acute kidney injury, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, intensive care unit admission >48 hours, mechanical ventilation >48 hours, wound, neurologic, and cardiovascular complications) and death up to 24 months after surgery. We used the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) and predictiveness curves to evaluate model performance. RESULTS: MySurgeryRisk calculates probabilistic risk scores for 8 postoperative complications with AUC values ranging between 0.82 and 0.94 [99% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.81-0.94]. The model predicts the risk for death at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months with AUC values ranging between 0.77 and 0.83 (99% CI 0.76-0.85).

Knowles_2021_Joofvasu,JOUR,Data analysis of vascular surgery instrument trays yielded large cost and efficiency savings,"Knowles, Martyn and Gay, Samuel S. and Konchan, Sarah K. and Mendes, Robert and Rath, Sandeep and Deshpande, Vinayak and Farber, Mark A. and Wood, Benjamin C.",Journal of vascular surgery,"BACKGROUND: Surgical procedures account for 50% of hospital revenue and <e2><88><bc>60% of operating costs. On average, <20% of surgical instruments will be used during a case, and the expense for resterilization and assembly of instrument trays ranges from $0.51 to $3.01 per instrument. Given the complexity of the surgical service supply chain, physician preferences, and variation of procedures, a reduction of surgical cost has been extremely difficult and often ill-defined. A data-driven approach to instrument tray optimization has implications for efficiency and cost savings in sterile processing, including reductions in tray assembly time and instrument repurchase, repair, and avoidable depreciation. METHODS: During a 3-month period, vascular surgery cases were monitored using a cloud-based technology product (OpFlow, Operative Flow Technologies, Raleigh, NC) as a part of a hospital-wide project. Given the diversity of the cases evaluated, we focused on two main vascular surgery trays: vascular and aortic. An assessment was performed to evaluate the exact instruments used by the operating surgeons across a variety of cases. The vascular tray contained 131 instruments and was used for the vast majority of vascular cases, and the aortic tray contained 152 instruments. Actual instrument usage data were collected, a review and analysis performed, and the trays optimized. RESULTS: During the 3-month period, 168 vascular surgery cases were evaluated across six surgeons. On average, the instrument usage per tray was 30 of 131 instruments (22.9%) for the vascular tray and 19 of 152 (12.5%) for the aortic tray. After review, 45.8% of the instruments were removed from the vascular tray and 62.5% from the aortic tray, for 1255 instruments removed from the versions of both trays. An audit was performed after the removal of instruments, which showed that none of the removed instruments had required reinstatement. The instrument reduction from these two trays alone yielded an estimated costs savings of $97,781 for repurchase and $97,444 in annual resterilization savings. Annually, the removal of the instruments is projected to save 316.2 hours of personnel time. The time required for operating room table setup decreased from a mean of 7:44 to 5:02 minutes for the vascular tray (P < .0001) and from 8:53 to 4:56 minutes for the aortic tray (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Given increasing cost constraints in healthcare, sterile processing remains an untapped resource for surgical expense reduction.

With the advancement of laparoscopy since the 1990s, we have seen vast improvements in faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays and less post-operative narcotic use, to name a few. OBJECTIVE: The key aims of this review were to measure the impact of minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery on health care utilization, cost, and work place absenteeism in the patients undergoing inpatient incisional/ventral hernia (IVH) repair. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan((R)) Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. Total of 2557 patients were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the patient that underwent IVH surgery, 24.5% (n = 626) were done utilizing minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques and 75.5% (n = 1931) were done open.

BACKGROUND: Prediction of surgical risk preoperatively is important for clinical shared decision-making and planning of health resources such as ICU beds. The current growth of electronic medical records coupled with machine learning presents an opportunity to improve the performance of established risk models. METHODS: All patients aged 18 years and above who underwent noncardiac and nonneurological surgery at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) between 1 January 2012 and 31 October 2016 were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory results, and surgery details were obtained from their electronic medical records. Seventy percent of the observations were randomly selected for training, leaving 30% for testing. Baseline models were CARES and ASA-PS. Candidate models were trained using random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). RESULTS: A total of 90,785 patients were included, of whom 539 (0.6%) died within 30 days and 1264 (1.4%) required ICU admission >24 hours postoperatively. Baseline models achieved high AUROCs despite poor sensitivities by predicting all negative in a predominantly negative dataset. Gradient boosting was the best performing model with AUPRCs of 0.23 and 0.38 for mortality and ICU admission outcomes respectively.

Little is known about which factors may be associated with increased risk of long-term postoperative super-utilization. OBJECTIVE: To identify clusters of patients with distinct constellations of clinical and comorbid patterns who may be associated with an elevated risk of super-utilization in the year following elective surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 1<e2><80><af>049<e2><80><af>160 patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass graft, colectomy, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or lung resection were identified from the 100% Medicare inpatient and outpatient Standard Analytic Files at all inpatient facilities performing 1 or more of the evaluated surgical procedures from 2013 to 2015. Data from 2012 to 2016 were used to evaluate expenditures in the year preceding and following surgery. Using a machine learning approach known as Logic Forest, comorbidities and interactions of comorbidities that put patients at an increased chance of becoming a super-utilizer were identified. All comorbidities, as defined by the Charlson (range, 0-24) and Elixhauser (range, 0-29) comorbidity indices, were used in the analysis. Higher scores indicated higher comorbidity burden. Data analysis was completed on November 16, 2018. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Super-utilization of health care in the year following surgery. RESULTS: In total, 1<e2><80><af>049<e2><80><af>160 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the analytic cohort.

Although the difference in overall expenditures per person between super-utilizers ($4049) and low users ($2148) was relatively modest prior to surgery, the difference in expenditures between super-utilizers ($79<e2><80><af>698) vs low users ($2977) was marked in the year following surgery. Risk factors associated with super-utilization of health care included hemiplegia/paraplegia (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.4-6.2), weight loss (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.2), and congestive heart failure with chronic kidney disease stages I to IV (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0-3.9). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Super-utilizers comprised only a small fraction of the surgical population yet were responsible for a disproportionate amount of Medicare expenditure.

Anderson_2015_JAMAsurg,JOUR,Using electronic health records for surgical quality improvement in the era of big data,"Anderson, Jamie E. and Chang, David C.",JAMA surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Risk adjustment is an important component of quality assessment in surgical health care. However, data collection places an additional burden on physicians. There is also concern that outcomes can be gamed depending on the information recorded for each patient. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a number of machine-collected data elements could perform as well as a traditional full-risk adjustment model that includes other physician-assessed and physician-recorded data elements. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: All general surgery patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, were included. Separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed using either all 66 preoperative risk variables or only 25 objective variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each regression using objective preoperative risk variables was compared with its corresponding regression with all preoperative variables. Subset analyses were performed among patients who received certain operations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality or any surgical complication captured by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, both inpatient and within 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Data from a total of 745 053 patients were included. More than 15.8% of patients had at least 1 complication and the mortality rate was 2.8%. When examining inpatient mortality, the AUC was 0.9104 with all 66 variables vs 0.8918 with all 25 objective variables. The difference in AUC comparing models with all variables with objective variables ranged from -0.0073 to 0.1944 for mortality and 0.0198 to 0.0687 for complications. In models predicting mortality, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, pancreatic resection, colectomy, and appendectomy. In models predicting complications, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with pancreatic resection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colectomy, and appendectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rigorous risk-adjusted surgical quality assessment can be performed solely with objective variables. By leveraging data already routinely collected for patient care, this approach allows for wider adoption of quality assessment systems in health care. Identifying data elements that can be automatically collected can make future improvements to surgical outcomes and quality analyses.",2015,10.1001/jamasurg.2014.947,150,1,24-29,eng,2168-6262 2168-6254,"United States and Humans and Quality Assurance, Health Care and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Logistic Models and Multivariate Analysis and Databases, Factual and Cohort Studies and Medical Records Systems, Computerized and Area Under Curve and Survival Analysis and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and Hospital Mortality/*trends and *Quality Improvement and *General Surgery and Surgical Procedures, Operative/adverse effects/methods/*mortality",NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,JAMA Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical specialty introduces bias in recommendations for multimodality treatment of STS. DESIGN: Electronic survey. SETTING: Database of active members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Society of Surgical Oncology, and the Connective Tissue Oncology Society. PARTICIPANTS: Members of specialty oncology societies with an active interest in STS. EXPOSURE: Physician specialty. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survey responses regarding the multidisciplinary management of STS were scored on a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 320 of 490 potential respondents (65%), including medical (18%), radiation (8%), orthopedic (22%), and surgical oncologists (45%). Respondents concurred on the use of radiation therapy for margins positive for tumor, for high-grade tumors, for improvement in local control, for tumors larger than 10 cm, and for tumors in close proximity to a neurovascular bundle. Respondents diverged on the use of radiation therapy for tumors 5 to 10 cm in size, for low-grade tumors, for radiation-associated STS, and for survival benefit. Only radiation oncologists felt that radiation therapy was underutilized as a treatment modality (mean [SEM] Likert scale score, 2.44 [0.12]; P < .001). There was agreement on the use of chemotherapy for synovial sarcoma, for high-grade tumors, for tumors larger than 10 cm, for patients younger than 50 years of age, and for survival benefit. Medical oncologists were more likely to recommend chemotherapy for margins positive for tumor (mean [SEM] score, 3.12 [0.12]; P = .03) and for improvement in local control (mean [SEM] score, 2.91 [0.12] P = .08). Surgical oncologists placed the least emphasis on chemotherapy in the overall treatment plan (mean [SEM] score, 2.60 [0.07]; P = .001).

The inaugural Patient-Reported Outcomes in Surgery (PROS) Conference brought together stakeholders in PROs research in surgery with the aim of creating a research agenda to help determine future directions and advance cross-disciplinary collaboration. OBJECTIVE: To create a research agenda to help determine future directions and advance cross-disciplinary collaboration on the use of PROs in surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An iterative web-based interface was used to create a conference-based, modified Delphi survey for registrants at the PROS Conference (January 29-30, 2015), including surgeons, PRO researchers, payers, and other stakeholders. In round 1, research items were generated from qualitative review of responses to open-ended prompts. In round 2, items were ranked using a 5-point Likert scale; attendees were also asked to submit any new items. In round 3, the top 30 items and newly submitted items were redistributed for final ranking using a 3-point Likert scale. The top 20 items by mean rating were selected for the research agenda. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An expert-generated research agenda on PROs in surgery. RESULTS: Of the 143 people registered for the conference, 137 provided valid email addresses. There was a wide range of attendees, with the 3 most common groups being plastic surgeons (28 [19.6%]), general surgeons (19 [13.3%]), and researchers (25 [17.5%]). In round 1, participants submitted 459 items, which were reduced through qualitative review to 53 distinct items across 7 themes of PROs research. A research agenda was formulated after 2 successive rounds of ranking. The research agenda identified 3 themes important for future PROs research in surgery: (1) PROs in the decision-making process, (2) integrating PROs into the electronic health record, and (3) measuring quality in surgery with PROs.

OBJECTIVE: To inform decision making regarding duty hour policies, the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) Trial is being conducted to evaluate whether changing resident duty hour policies to permit greater flexibility in work hours affects patient postoperative outcomes, resident education, and resident well-being. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pragmatic noninferiority cluster-randomized trial of general surgery residency programs with 2 study arms. Participating in the study are Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-approved US general surgery residency programs (n = 118), their affiliated hospitals (n = 154), surgical residents and program directors, and general surgery patients from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, with additional patient safety outcomes collected through June 30, 2016. The data collection platform for patient outcomes is the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP), thus only hospitals participating in the ACS NSQIP were included. INTERVENTIONS: In the usual care arm, programs adhered to current ACGME resident duty hour standards. In the intervention arm, programs were allowed to deviate from current standards regarding maximum shift lengths and minimum time off between shifts through an ACGME waiver. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death or serious morbidity within 30 days of surgery measured through ACS NSQIP, as well as resident satisfaction and well-being measured through a survey delivered at the time of the 2015 American Board of Surgery in Training Examination (ABSITE). RESULTS: A total of 118 general surgery residency programs and 154 hospitals were enrolled in the FIRST Trial and randomized. Fifty-nine programs (73 hospitals) were randomized to the usual care arm and 59 programs (81 hospitals) were randomized to the intervention arm. Intent-to-treat analysis will be used to estimate the effectiveness of assignment to the intervention arm on patient outcomes, resident education, and resident well-being compared with the usual care arm. Several sensitivity analyses will be performed to determine whether there were differential effects when examining only inpatients, high-risk patients, and emergent/urgent cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, the FIRST Trial is the first national randomized clinical trial of duty hour policies. Results of this study may be informative to policymakers and other stakeholders engaged in restructuring graduate medical training to enhance the quality of patient care and resident education.

A Mock Page program has been developed and adopted into a national surgical resident preparatory curriculum to prepare senior medical students for this important skill. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess standardized mock page cases as a valid construct to assess clinical decision making and interprofessional communication skills. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Mock page cases (n = 16) were administered to 213 senior medical students from 12 medical schools participating in a national surgical resident preparatory curriculum in 2013 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making and interprofessional communication were measured by case-specific assessments evaluating these skills which have undergone rigorous standard-setting to determine pass/fail cut points. RESULTS: Students' performance improved in general for both communication and clinical decision making over the 4-week course. Cases have been identified that seem to be best suited for differentiating high- from low-performing students.

However, a gap exists in translating this knowledge to bedside decision making. We introduced a novel measure of patient-centered surgical risk assessment: morphometric age. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between morphometric age and posttransplant survival. DATA SOURCES: Medical records of recipients of deceased-donor liver transplants (study population) and kidney donors/trauma patients (morphometric age control population). STUDY SELECTION: A retrospective cohort study of 348 liver transplant patients and 3313 control patients. We assessed medical records for validated morphometric characteristics of aging (psoas area, psoas density, and abdominal aortic calcification). We created a model (stratified by sex) for a morphometric age equation, which we then calculated for the control population using multivariate linear regression modeling (covariates). These models were then applied to the study population to determine each patient's morphometric age. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: All analytic steps related to measuring morphometric characteristics were obtained via custom algorithms programmed into commercially available software. An independent observer confirmed all algorithm outputs. Trained assistants performed medical record review to obtain patient characteristics. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that morphometric age was a significant independent predictor of overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.03 per morphometric year [95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P < .001]) after liver transplant. Chronologic age was not a significant covariate for survival (hazard ratio, 1.02 per year [95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P = .21]). Morphometric age stratified patients at high and low risk for mortality. For example, patients in the middle chronologic age tertile who jumped to the oldest morphometric tertile have worse outcomes than those who jumped to the youngest morphometric tertile (74.4% vs 93.2% survival at 1 year [P = .03]; 45.2% vs 75.0% at 5 years [P = .03]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Morphometric age correlated with mortality after liver transplant with better discrimination than chronologic age.

M. and Fairfield, C. J. and Harrison, E. M.",The British journal of surgery,"BACKGROUND: Technological advances have led to the generation of large amounts of data, both in surgical research and practice. Despite this, it is unclear how much originates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and what barriers exist to the use of such data in improving surgical care. The aim of this review was to capture the extent and impact of programmes that use large volumes of patient data on surgical care in LMICs. METHODS: A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review of PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar was performed in August 2018. Prospective studies collecting large volumes of patient-level data within LMIC settings were included and evaluated qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies were included from 71 LMICs, involving 708 032 patients. The number of patients in included studies varied widely (from 335 to 428 346), with 25 reporting data on 3000 or more LMIC patients. Patient inclusion in large-data studies in LMICs has increased dramatically since 2015. Studies predominantly involved Brazil, China, India and Thailand, with low patient numbers from Africa and Latin America. Outcomes after surgery were commonly the focus (33 studies); very few large studies looked at access to surgical care or patient expenditure. The use of large data sets specifically to improve surgical outcomes in LMICs is currently limited.

OBJECTIVE: To identify patient preferences for risks, benefits, and other attributes of treatment options available to individuals who are candidates for bariatric surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This discrete choice experiment of weight loss procedures was performed as an internet-based survey administered to patients recruited from bariatric surgery information sessions in the State of Michigan. Each procedure was described by the following set of attributes: (1) treatment method, (2) recovery and reversibility, (3) time that treatment has been available, (4) expected weight loss, (5) effect on other medical conditions, (6) risk of complication, (7) adverse effects, (8) changes to diet, and (9) out-of-pocket costs. Participants chose between surgical profiles by comparing attributes. Survey data were collected from May 1, 2015, through January 30, 2016, and analyzed from February 1 to June 30, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated relative value of risks and benefits for leading weight-loss surgical options and marginal willingness to pay for procedure attributes. A latent class analysis identified respondent subgroups. RESULTS: Among the 815 respondents (79.9% women; mean [SD] age, 44.5 [12.0] years), profiles of hypothetical procedures that included resolution of medical conditions (coefficient for full resolution, 0.229 [95% CI, 0.177 to 0.280; P < .001]; coefficient for no resolution, -0.207 [95% CI, -0.254 to -0.159; P < .001]), higher total weight loss (coefficient for each additional 20% loss, 0.185 [95% CI, 0.166 to 0.205; P < .001]), and lower out-of-pocket costs (coefficient for each additional $1000, -0.034 [95% CI, -0.042 to -0.025; P < .001]) were most likely to be selected. Younger respondents were more likely than older respondents to choose treatments with higher weight loss (coefficient for loss of 80% excess weight 0.543 [95% CI, 0.435-0.651] vs 0.397 [95% CI, 0.315-0.482]) and were more sensitive to out-of-pocket costs (coefficient for $100 out-of-pocket costs, 0.346 [95% CI, 0.221-0.470] vs 0.262 [95% CI, 0.174 to 0.350]; coefficient for $15 000 in out-of-pocket costs, -0.768 [95% CI, -0.938 to -0.598] vs -0.384 [95% CI, -0.500 to -0.268]). Marginal willingness to pay indicated respondents would pay $5470 for losing each additional 20% of excess body weight and $12 843 for resolution of existing medical conditions, the most desired procedure attributes. Latent class analysis identified the following 3 unobserved subgroups: cost-sensitive (most concerned with costs); benefit-focused (most concerned with excess weight loss and resolution of medical conditions); and procedure-focused (most concerned with how the treatment itself worked, including recovery and reversibility).

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors driving end-of-life decisions in vascular surgery patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, medical records were reviewed for all vascular surgery patients at a tertiary care university hospital who died during their hospitalization from 2005 to 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient, family, and hospitalization variables potentially important to influencing end-of-life decisions. RESULTS: Of 111 patients included (67 [60%] male; median age, 75 [range, 24-94] years), 81 (73%) were emergent vs 30 (27%) elective admissions. Only 15 (14%) had an advance directive. Of the 81 (73%) patients placed on comfort care, 31 (38%) had care withheld or withdrawn despite available medical options, 15 (19%) had an advance directive, and 28 (25%) had a palliative care consultation. The median time from palliative care consultation to death was 10 hours (interquartile range, 3.36-66 hours). Comparing the 31 patients placed on comfort care despite available medical options with an admission diagnosis-matched cohort, we found that more than 5 days admitted to the intensive care unit (odds ratio [OR], 4.11; 95% CI, 1.59-10.68; P < .001), more than 5 days requiring ventilator support (OR, 9.45; 95% CI, 3.41-26.18; P < .001), new renal failure necessitating dialysis (OR, 14.48; 95% CI, 3.69-56.86; P < .001), and new respiratory failure necessitating tracheostomy (OR, 23.92; 95% CI, 2.80-204; P < .001) correlated with transition to comfort care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Palliative care consultations may be underused at the end of life. A large percentage of patients were transitioned to comfort measures despite available treatment, yet few presented with advance directives.

This is the first study designed to obtain quantitative patient-preference evidence to inform regulatory approval decisions by the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health. METHODS: Five-hundred and forty United States adults with body mass index (BMI) <e2><89><a5> 30 kg/m(2) evaluated tradeoffs among effectiveness, safety, and other attributes of weight-loss devices in a scientific survey. Discrete-choice experiments were used to quantify the importance of safety, effectiveness, and other attributes of weight-loss devices to obese respondents. A tool based on these measures is being used to inform benefit-risk assessments for premarket approval of medical devices. RESULTS: Respondent choices yielded preference scores indicating their relative value for attributes of weight-loss devices in this study. We developed a tool to estimate the minimum weight loss acceptable by a patient to receive a device with a given risk profile and the maximum mortality risk tolerable in exchange for a given weight loss. For example, to accept a device with 0.01 % mortality risk, a risk tolerant patient will require about 10 % total body weight loss lasting 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patient preference evidence was used make regulatory decision making more patient-centered. In addition, we captured the heterogeneity of patient preferences allowing market approval of effective devices for risk tolerant patients.

METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO using predefined inclusion criteria, up to June 2014. All study types were considered eligible. The primary endpoint was validity for improving situational awareness in the surgical theatre at individual or team level. RESULTS: Nine articles were considered eligible. These evaluated surgical team crisis training in simulated environments for minimally invasive surgery (4) and open surgery (3), and training courses focused at training non-technical skills (2). Two studies showed that simulation-based surgical team crisis training has construct validity for assessing situational awareness in surgical trainees in minimally invasive surgery. None of the studies showed effectiveness of surgical crisis training on situational awareness in open surgery, whereas one showed face validity of a 2-day non-technical skills training course. CONCLUSION: To improve safety in the operating theatre, more attention to situational awareness is needed in surgical training. Few structured curricula have been developed and validation research remains limited. Strategies to improve situational awareness can be adopted from other industries.",2015,10.1002/bjs.9643,102,1,16-23,eng,1365-2168 0007-1323,"Humans and Decision Making and Teaching Materials and Operating Rooms and Medical Errors/*prevention & control and Clinical Competence/*standards and Awareness and Education, Medical, Graduate/*methods and Medical Staff, Hospital/education and Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/education and Specialties, Surgical/*education and Teaching/methods",NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,Br J Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is not clear how best to screen for frailty in preoperative surgical populations. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), a 14-item instrument used to measure surgical frailty. It can be calculated prospectively (RAI-C), using a clinical questionnaire, or retrospectively (RAI-A), using variables from the surgical quality improvement databases (Veterans Affairs or American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-site, prospective cohort from July 2011 to September 2015 at the Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Heath Care System, a Level 1b Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The study included all patients presenting to the medical center for elective surgery. EXPOSURES: We assessed the RAI-C for all patients scheduled for surgery, linking these scores to administrative and quality improvement data to calculate the RAI-A and the modified Frailty Index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receiver operator characteristics and C statistics for each measure predicting postoperative mortality and morbidity. RESULTS: Of the participants, the mean (SD) age was 60.7 (13.9) years and 249 participants (3.6%) were women. We assessed the RAI-C 10<e2><80><af>698 times, from which we linked 6856 unique patients to mortality data. The C statistic predicting 180-day mortality for the RAI-C was 0.772. Of these 6856 unique patients, we linked 2785 to local Veterans Affairs Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects data and calculated the C statistic for both the RAI-A (0.823) and RAI-C (0.824), along with the correlation between the 2 scores (r = 0.478; P < .001). Of these 2785 patients, there were sufficient data to calculate the modified Frailty Index for 1021, in which the C statistics were 0.865 (RAI-A), 0.797 (RAI-C), and 0.811 (modified Frailty Index). The correlation between the RAI-A and RAI-C was 0.547, and the correlations of the modified Frailty Index to the RAI-A and RAI-C were 0.301 and 0.269, respectively (all P < .001). A cutoff of RAI-C of at least 21 classified 18.3% patients as ""frail"" with a sensitivity of 0.50 and specificity of 0.82, whereas the RAI-A was less sensitive (0.25) and more specific (0.97), classifying only 3.7% as ""frail."" CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The RAI-C and RAI-A represent effective tools for measuring frailty in surgical populations with predictive ability on par with other frailty tools. Moderate correlation between the measures suggests convergent validity. The RAI-C offers the advantage of prospective, preoperative assessment that is proved feasible for large-scale screening in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Surgical outcome abstraction remains laborious and a barrier to the sustainment of quality improvement registries like ACS-NSQIP. A supervised machine learning algorithm developed for detecting SSi using structured and unstructured electronic health record data was tested to perform semi-automated SSI abstraction. METHODS: A Lasso-penalized logistic regression model with 2011-3 data was trained (baseline performance measured with 10-fold cross-validation). A cutoff probability score from the training data was established, dividing the subsequent evaluation dataset into ""negative"" and ""possible"" SSI groups, with manual data abstraction only performed on the ""possible"" group. We evaluated performance on data from 2014, 2015, and both years. RESULTS: Overall, 6188 patients were in the 2011-3 training dataset and 5132 patients in the 2014-5 evaluation dataset. With use of the semi-automated approach, applying the cut-off score decreased the amount of manual abstraction by >90%, resulting in < 1% false negatives in the ""negative"" group and a sensitivity of 82%. A blinded review of 10% of the ""possible"" group, considering only the features selected by the algorithm, resulted in high agreement with the gold standard based on full chart abstraction, pointing towards additional efficiency in the abstraction process by making it possible for abstractors to review limited, salient portions of the chart. CONCLUSION: Semi-automated machine learning-aided SSI abstraction greatly accelerates the abstraction process and achieves very good performance. This could be translated to other post-operative outcomes and reduce cost barriers for wider ACS-NSQIP adoption.",2022,10.1097/SLA.0000000000004354,276,1,180-185,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,Humans and Electronic Health Records and Quality Improvement and Algorithms and *Machine Learning and *Surgical Wound Infection/diagnosis,NA,NA,2022/07/01/,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current evaluation methods are not adequate for estimating lymph node metastasis (LNM) in EGC. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prediction model based on a fully quantitative collagen signature in the tumor microenvironment to estimate the individual risk of LNM in EGC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study was conducted from August 1, 2016, to May 10, 2018, at 2 medical centers in China (Nanfang Hospital and Fujian Provincial Hospital). Participants included a primary cohort (n = 232) of consecutive patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy and received a T1 gastric cancer diagnosis from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012. Patients with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy were excluded. An additional consecutive cohort (n = 143) who received the same diagnosis from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, was enrolled to provide validation. Baseline clinicopathologic data of each patient were collected. Collagen features were extracted in specimens using multiphoton imaging, and the collagen signature was constructed. An LNM prediction model based on the collagen signature was developed and was internally and externally validated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the prediction model and decision curve were analyzed for estimating LNM. RESULTS: In total, 375 patients were included. The primary cohort comprised 232 consecutive patients, in whom the LNM rate was 16.4% (n = 38; 25 men [65.8%] with a mean [SD] age of 57.82 [10.17] years). The validation cohort consisted of 143 consecutive patients, in whom the LNM rate was 20.9% (n = 30; 20 men [66.7%] with a mean [SD] age of 54.10 [13.19] years). The collagen signature was statistically significantly associated with LNM (odds ratio, 5.470; 95% CI, 3.315-9.026; P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the depth of tumor invasion, tumor differentiation, and the collagen signature were independent predictors of LNM. These 3 predictors were incorporated into the new prediction model, and a nomogram was established. The model showed good discrimination in the primary cohort (AUROC, 0.955; 95% CI, 0.919-0.991) and validation cohort (AUROC, 0.938; 95% CI, 0.897-0.981). An optimal cutoff value was selected in the primary cohort, which had a sensitivity of 86.8%, a specificity of 93.3%, an accuracy of 92.2%, a positive predictive value of 71.7%, and a negative predictive value of 97.3%. The validation cohort had a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 90.3%, an accuracy of 90.2%, a positive predictive value of 71.1%, and a negative predictive value of 97.1%. Among the 375 patients, a sensitivity of 87.3%, a specificity of 92.1%, an accuracy of 91.2%, a positive predictive value of 72.1%, and a negative predictive value of 96.9% were found.

A systematic review of the articles was performed. RESULTS: Eleven articles were identified, published between 1993 and 2007. The situations that lend themselves best to analysis by ANNs are complex multifactorial relationships, medical decisions when a second opinion is needed and when automated interpretation is required, for example in a situation of an inadequate number of experts.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND: ACS-ERRA is an online formative assessment that uses a key features approach to measure clinical decision-making skills and focuses on cases encountered at the beginning of residency. Results can be used to develop learning plans to address areas that may need reinforcement. METHODS: A national panel of 16 content experts, 3 medical educators, and a psychometrician developed 98 short, key features cases. Each case required medical knowledge to be applied appropriately at challenging decision points during case management. Four pilot testing studies were conducted sequentially to gather validity evidence. RESULTS: Residents from programs across the United States participated in the studies (n = 58, 20, 87, 154, respectively). Results from the pilot studies enabled improvements after each pilot test. For the psychometric pilot (final pilot test), 2 parallel test forms of the ACS-ERRA were administered, each containing 40 cases, resulting in overall mean testing time of 2 hours 2 minutes (SD = 43 min). The mean test score was 61% (SD = 9%) and the G-coefficient reliability was 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: Results can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in residents' decision-making skills and yield valuable information to create individualized learning plans.

BACKGROUND: The ""fix-it"" model characterizes disease as an isolated abnormality that can be restored to normal form and function through medical intervention. This mental model is familiar to patients and physicians, but it is ineffective for chronic conditions and treatments that cannot achieve normalcy. Overuse may lead to permissive decision making favoring intervention. Efforts to improve surgical decision making will need to consider how mental models function in clinical practice, including ""fix-it."" METHODS: We observed surgeons who routinely perform high-risk surgery during preoperative discussions with patients. We used qualitative content analysis to explore the use of ""fix-it"" in 48 audio-recorded conversations. RESULTS: Surgeons used the ""fix-it"" model for 2 separate purposes during preoperative conversations: (1) as an explanatory tool to facilitate patient understanding of disease and surgery, and (2) as a deliberation framework to assist in decision making. Although surgeons commonly used ""fix-it"" as an explanatory model, surgeons explicitly discussed limitations of the ""fix-it"" model as an independent rationale for operating as they deliberated about the value of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of ""fix-it"" is familiar for explaining medical information to patients, surgeons recognize that the model can be problematic for determining the value of an operation.

Defining the indication and timing for intestinal transplantation (ITx) is challenging. OBJECTIVES: To determine the limitations of conventional surgery and to facilitate the decision making for transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected prospectively and obtained by retrospective review of medical records from all patients with CD who were assessed for ITx in Oxford, United Kingdom, and Berlin, Germany, from October 10, 2003, through July 31, 2013. Patients were considered suitable for ITx if a diagnosis of irreversible IF was established and life-threatening complications under HPN were unresolvable. Twenty patients with CD and IF, established on HPN, were evaluated for ITx. The mean (SD) age at CD onset was 17.8 (9.8) years. On first diagnosis, most patients had a stricturing CD. By the time of referral, most had a combination of stricturing and fistulizing disease. INTERVENTIONS: New scoring system: a modification of the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines for ITx. Modifications are related to CD-specific issues that potentially lead to a poorer outcome and are based on the findings of the study to determine the expected benefit from ITx. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A scoring system that would alert the physician to the severity of the patient's CD and trigger early referral for ITx. This system may translate into better long-term outcomes for patients with CD. In addition, the Karnofsky performance status score was used to compare pretransplantation and posttransplantation outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent ITx, 4 were on the waiting list, and 4 were unavailable for follow-up. One patient was taken off the waiting list because of severe deterioration. One patient underwent conventional stricturoplasty and did not need transplantation. Among the transplant recipients, 17 (85%) had a stoma or enterocutaneous fistula, and the mean (SD) residual bowel length was 71.5 (38) cm. A total of 80% of transplant recipients had life-threatening catheter infections, and 13 (65%) had a significant decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. At a mean (SD) follow-up of 27.6 (36.1) months for transplant recipients, the patient and graft survival is 80%, and their Karnofsky performance status score increased by a mean of 18.6%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intestinal transplantation is a suitable treatment option for patients with CD and IF. It should be considered before any additional attempts at conventional surgery, which may cause eligible patients to miss this opportunity through perioperative complications. The suggested scoring system enables the physician to identify patients who may benefit from transplantation before HPN-associated secondary organ failure.",2014,10.1001/jamasurg.2014.1072,149,10,1060-1066,eng,2168-6262 2168-6254,England and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Retrospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Referral and Consultation and Severity of Illness Index and Survival Rate and Germany and Intestines/*transplantation and Crohn Disease/*complications/*surgery and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use,NA,NA,2014/10//undefined,JAMA Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Use of a core outcome set may improve the situation. The BRAVO study developed a core outcome set for reconstructive breast surgery. METHODS: A long list of outcomes identified from systematic reviews and stakeholder interviews was used to inform a questionnaire survey. Key stakeholders defined as individuals involved in decision-making for reconstructive breast surgery, including patients, breast and plastic surgeons, specialist nurses and psychologists, were sampled purposively and sent the questionnaire (round 1). This asked them to rate the importance of each outcome on a 9-point Likert scale from 1 (not important) to 9 (extremely important). The proportion of respondents rating each item as very important (score 7-9) was calculated. This was fed back to participants in a second questionnaire (round 2). Respondents were asked to reprioritize outcomes based on the feedback received. Items considered very important after round 2 were discussed at consensus meetings, where the core outcome set was agreed. RESULTS: A total of 148 items were combined into 34 domains within six categories.

METHODS: Using the ECST risk prediction model, three scenarios of patients with a low (less than 10 per cent), moderate (20-25 per cent) and high (40-45 per cent) 5-year risk of stroke were devised and validated. Invitations to complete an online survey were sent by e-mail to vascular surgeons and stroke physicians, with responses gathered. The questionnaire was then repeated with the addition of the ECST risk score. RESULTS: Two hundred and one completed surveys were analysed (21<c2><b7>5 per cent response rate): 107 by stroke physicians and 94 by vascular surgeons. The high-risk scenario after the introduction of the ECST risk score showed an increased use of CEA (66<c2><b7>7 versus 80<c2><b7>1 per cent; P = 0<c2><b7>009). The low-risk scenario after risk score analysis demonstrated a swing towards best medical therapy (23<c2><b7>4 versus 57<c2><b7>2 per cent; P < 0<c2><b7>001). CEA was preferred in the moderate-risk scenario and this was not altered significantly by introduction of the risk score (71<c2><b7>6 versus 75<c2><b7>6 per cent; P = 0<c2><b7>609). Vascular surgeons exhibited a preference towards CEA compared with stroke physicians in both low- and moderate-risk scenarios (P < 0<c2><b7>001 and P = 0<c2><b7>003 respectively). CONCLUSION: The addition of a risk score appeared to influence clinicians in their decision-making towards CEA in high-risk patients and towards best medical therapy in low-risk patients.",2014,10.1002/bjs.9461,101,5,475-480,eng,1365-2168 0007-1323,"Humans and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Risk Factors and Reproducibility of Results and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Satisfaction and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Risk Assessment/methods and *Neurology and *Vascular Surgical Procedures and Carotid Stenosis/*surgery and Stroke/prevention & control",NA,NA,2014/04//undefined,Br J Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kukar_2015_JAMAsurg,JOUR,Role of Repeat 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Examination in Predicting Pathologic Response Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma,"Kukar, Moshim and Alnaji, Raed M. and Jabi, Feraas and Platz, Timothy A. and Attwood, Kristopher and Nava, Hector and Ben-David, Kfir and Mattson, David and Salerno, Kilian and Malhotra, Usha and Kanehira, Kazunori and Gannon, James and Hochwald, Steven N.",JAMA surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Predicting complete pathologic response (CPR) preoperatively can significantly affect surgical decision making. There are conflicting data regarding positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT) characteristics and the ability of PET CT to predict pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma because most existing studies that include squamous histology have limited numbers and use nonstandardized PET CT imaging. OBJECTIVE: To determine if PET CT characteristics are associated with CPR in patients undergoing trimodality treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted at a large tertiary cancer center from a prospectively maintained database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 2 standardized PET CT studies done at our institution (pre-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy) for review. Data collected included clinical, pathologic, imaging, and treatment characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary study outcome was the association of PET CT characteristics with histologic confirmed pathologic response. RESULTS: Of the total participants, 77 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two patients (28.6%) had CPR vs 55 patients (71.4%) who had incomplete pathologic response. The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, tumor grade, chemotherapy, and radiation regimen and days between the 2 PET CTs. The mean prestandardized uptake variable (SUV; 14.5 vs 11.2; P = .05), <ce><b4> SUV (10.3 vs 5.4; P = .02), and relative <ce><b4> SUV (0.6 vs 0.4; P = .02) were significantly higher in those with CPR vs incomplete pathologic response. Using the Youden Index, a <ce><b4> SUV value less than 45% was predictive of residual disease with a positive predictive value of 91.7% (95% CI, 73-99; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the largest study examining the role of PET CT characteristics in esophageal adenocarcinoma for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy that demonstrates that <ce><b4> SUV of less than 45% is associated with patients with residual disease but not CPR. Based on the findings from our study, the current recommendation is still surgical resection regardless of the posttherapy PET SUV in the primary tumor. However, our study highlights the ability to detect patients with residual disease and the need to critically evaluate these patients for consideration of additional therapies.",2015,10.1001/jamasurg.2014.3867,150,6,555-562,eng,2168-6262 2168-6254,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods and *Chemoradiotherapy and *Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 and *Neoadjuvant Therapy and *Positron-Emission Tomography/methods and *Radiopharmaceuticals and Adenocarcinoma/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology/*therapy and Esophageal Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology/*therapy",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,JAMA Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Han, H. and Paige, J. and Ponsky, T. and Schlachta, C. M. and Dunkin, B. and Mellinger, J.",Surgical endoscopy,"BACKGROUND: Surgical telementoring (ST) was introduced in the sixties, promoting videoconferencing to enhance surgical education across large distances. Widespread use of ST in the surgical community is lacking. Despite numerous surveys assessing ST, there remains a lack of high-level scientific evidence demonstrating its impact on mentorship and surgical education. Despite this, there is an ongoing paradigm shift involving remote presence technologies and their application to skill development and technique dissemination in the international surgical community. Factors facilitating this include improved access to ST technology, including ease of use and data transmission, and affordability. Several international research initiatives have commenced to strengthen the scientific foundation documenting the impact of ST in surgical education and performance. METHODS: International experts on ST were invited to the SAGES Project Six Summit in August 2015. Two experts in surgical education prepared relevant questions for discussion and organized the meeting (JP and HH). The questions were open-ended, and the discussion continued until no new item appeared. The transcripts of interviews were recorded by a secretary from SAGES. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a summary of the work performed by the SAGES Project 6 Education Working Group. We summarize the existing evidence regarding education in ST, identify and detail conceptual educational frameworks that may be used during ST, and present a structured framework for an educational curriculum in ST. CONCLUSIONS: The educational impact and optimal curricular organization of ST programs are largely unexplored. We outline the critical components of a structured ST curriculum, including prerequisites, teaching modalities, and key curricular components. We also detail research strategies critical to its continued evolution as an educational tool, including randomized controlled trials, establishment of a quality registry, qualitative research, learning analytics, and development of a standardized taxonomy.",2017,10.1007/s00464-017-5690-y,31,10,3836-3846,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"Curriculum and Humans and Telemedicine and Health policy and Clinical Competence and Telemedicine/*methods and Education, Medical/*methods and Surgical training and General Surgery/*education and *Mentors and Surgical education and Surgical technology and Telementoring",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alejandro and Wright, Andrew S.",Surgical endoscopy,"BACKGROUND: Facebook is a popular online social networking platform increasingly used for professional collaboration. Literature regarding use of Facebook for surgeon professional development and education is limited. The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) has established a Facebook group dedicated to discussion of surgery of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine-the ""SAGES Foregut Surgery Masters Program."" The aim of this study is to examine how this forum is used for professional development, education, and quality improvement. METHODS: Member and post statistics were obtained from https://grytics.com , a Facebook group analytics service. All posts added to the Foregut forum since its creation in April 2015 through December 2016 were reviewed and categorized for content and topic. Posts were reviewed for potential identifiable protected health information. RESULTS: As of December 2016, there were 649 total members in the group. There have been a total of 411 posts and 4116 comments with a median of 10.1 comments/post (range 0-72). Posts were categorized as operative technique (64%), patient management (52%), continuing education (10%), networking (10%), or other (6%). Video and/or photos were included in 53% of posts with 4% of posts depicting radiologic studies and 13% with intraoperative photos or videos. An additional 40 posts included links to other pages, such as YouTube, journal articles, or the SAGES website. One post (0.2%) contained identifiable protected health information and was deleted once recognized by the moderators of the group. CONCLUSION: Social media is a unique, real-time platform where surgeons can learn, discuss, and collaborate towards the goal of optimal treatment of surgical disease.

During emergencies, surgeons work in interprofessional teams and are required to perform certain procedures. To obtain proficiency in these skills, residents must be trained. OBJECTIVE: To educate surgical residents in leadership, teamwork, effective communication, and infrequently performed emergency surgical procedures with the use of interprofessional simulations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SimMan 3GS was used to simulate high-risk clinical scenarios (15-20 minutes), followed by debriefings with real-time feedback (30 minutes). A modified Oxford Non-Technical Skills scale (score range, 1-4) was used to assess surgical resident performance during the first half of the academic year (July-December 2012) and the second half of the academic year (January-June 2013). Anonymous online surveys were used to solicit participant feedback. Simulations were conducted in the operating room, intensive care unit, emergency department, ward, and simulation center. A total of 43 surgical residents (postgraduate years [PGYs] 1 and 2) participated in interdisciplinary clinical scenarios, with other health care professionals (nursing, anesthesia, critical care, medicine, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy; mean number of nonsurgical participants/session: 4, range 0-9). Thirty seven surgical residents responded to the survey. EXPOSURES: Simulation of high-risk clinical scenarios: postoperative pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, anaphylaxis with a difficult airway, and pulseless electrical activity arrest. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Evaluation of resident skills: communication, leadership, teamwork, problem solving, situation awareness, and confidence in performing emergency procedures (eg, cricothyroidotomy). RESULTS: A total of 31 of 35 (89%) of the residents responding found the sessions useful. Additionally, 28 of 33 (85%) reported improved confidence doing procedures and 29 of 37 (78%) reported knowing when the procedure should be applied. Oxford Non-Technical Skills evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in PGY 2 resident performance assessed during the 2 study periods: communication score increased from 3 to 3.71 (P=.01), leadership score increased from 2.77 to 3.86 (P<.001), teamwork score increased from 3.15 to 3.86 (P=.007), and procedural ability score increased from 2.23 to 3.43 (P=.03). There were no statistically significant improved scores in PGY 2 decision making or situation awareness. No improvements in skills were seen among PGY 1 participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The PGY 2 residents improved their skills, but the PGY 1 residents did not.

Malhotra_2012_Surgendo,JOUR,Conscious monitoring and control (reinvestment) in surgical performance under pressure,"Malhotra, Neha and Poolton, Jamie M. and Wilson, Mark R. and Ngo, Karen and Masters, Rich S. W.",Surgical endoscopy,"BACKGROUND: Research on intraoperative stressors has focused on external factors without considering individual differences in the ability to cope with stress. One individual difference that is implicated in adverse effects of stress on performance is ""reinvestment,"" the propensity for conscious monitoring and control of movements. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of reinvestment on laparoscopic performance under time pressure. METHODS: Thirty-one medical students (surgery rotation) were divided into high- and low-reinvestment groups. Participants were first trained to proficiency on a peg transfer task and then tested on the same task in a control and time pressure condition. Outcome measures included generic performance and process measures. Stress levels were assessed using heart rate and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: High and low reinvestors demonstrated increased anxiety levels from control to time pressure conditions as indicated by their STAI scores, although no differences in heart rate were found. Low reinvestors performed significantly faster when under time pressure, whereas high reinvestors showed no change in performance times. Low reinvestors tended to display greater performance efficiency (shorter path lengths, fewer hand movements) than high reinvestors. CONCLUSION: Trained medical students with a high individual propensity to consciously monitor and control their movements (high reinvestors) displayed less capability (than low reinvestors) to meet the demands imposed by time pressure during a laparoscopic task. The finding implies that the propensity for reinvestment may have a moderating effect on laparoscopic performance under time pressure.",2012,10.1007/s00464-012-2193-8,26,9,2423-2429,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"Humans and *Decision Making and Students, Medical/*psychology and *Clinical Competence and Consciousness and *Stress, Psychological and Laparoscopy/*education/*standards",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite its appeal, continued promotion of the field is necessary to recruit and retain the best and brightest candidates. Recruitment of medical students and residents may be limited by the lifestyle inherent to vascular surgery and the length of residency training. The young adults of the current applicant and resident pool differ from prior generations in their desire for hands-on mentoring, aspirations to affect change daily, a penchant for technology, and strong emphasis on work-life balance. Furthermore, the percentage of women pursuing careers in vascular surgery is not representative of the eligible workforce. Women are now the majority of graduates in all of higher education, and thus, vascular surgery may need to make a concerted effort to appeal to women in order to attract the most talented young professionals to the field.

Burger_2007_Anofsu,JOUR,Disclosure of individual surgeon's performance rates during informed consent: ethical and epistemological considerations,"Burger, Ingrid and Schill, Kathryn and Goodman, Steven",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the paper is to examine the ethical arguments for and against disclosing surgeon-specific performance rates to patients during informed consent, and to examine the challenges that generating and using performance rates entail. METHODS: Ethical, legal, and statistical theory is explored to approach the question of whether, when, and how surgeons should disclosure their personal performance rates to patients. The main ethical question addressed is what type of information surgeons owe their patients during informed consent. This question comprises 3 related, ethically relevant considerations that are explored in detail: 1) Does surgeon-specific performance information enhance patient decision-making? 2) Do patients want this type of information? 3) How do the potential benefits of disclosure balance against the risks? RESULTS: Calculating individual performance measures requires tradeoffs and involves inherent uncertainty. There is a lack of evidence regarding whether patients want this information, whether it facilitates their decision-making for surgery, and how it is best communicated to them. Disclosure of personal performance rates during informed consent has the potential benefits of enhancing patient autonomy, improving patient decision-making, and improving quality of care. The major risks of disclosure include inaccurate and misleading performance rates, avoidance of high-risk cases, unjust damage to surgeon's reputations, and jeopardized patient trust. CONCLUSION: At this time, we think that, for most conditions, surgical procedures, and outcomes, the accuracy of surgeon- and patient-specific performance rates is illusory, obviating the ethical obligation to communicate them as part of the informed consent process. Nonetheless, the surgical profession has the duty to develop information systems that allow for performance to be evaluated to a high degree of accuracy. In the meantime, patients should be informed of the quantity of procedures their surgeons have performed, providing an idea of the surgeon's experience and qualitative idea of potential risk.",2007,10.1097/01.sla.0000242713.82125.d1,245,4,507-513,eng,0003-4932 1528-1140,"United States and Humans and Personal Autonomy and *Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/ethics and *Clinical Competence and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Disclosure/*ethics and General Surgery/*ethics/*standards",NA,NA,2007/04//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Novices are hypothesized to use conscious analysis (effortful DM) leading to activation across the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas experts are expected to use unconscious automation (habitual DM) in which decisions are recognition-primed and prefrontal cortex independent. METHODS: A total of 22 subjects (10 medical student novices, 7 residents, and 5 attendings) reviewed simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, determined the next safest operative maneuver upon video termination (10 s), and reported decision confidence. Video paradigms either declared (""primed"") or withheld (""unprimed"") the next operative maneuver. Simultaneously, changes in cortical oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin inferring prefrontal activation were recorded using Optical Topography. Decision confidence, consistency (primed vs unprimed), and quality (script concordance) were assessed. RESULTS: Attendings and residents were significantly more certain (P < 0.001), and decision quality was superior (script concordance: attendings = 90%, residents = 78.3%, and novices = 53.3%). Decision consistency was significantly superior in experts (P < 0.001) and residents (P < 0.05) than novices (P = 0.183). During unprimed DM, novices showed significant activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas this activation pattern was not observed among residents and attendings. During primed DM, significant activation was not observed in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Expert DM is characterized by improved quality, consistency, and confidence. The findings imply attendings use a habitual decision system, whereas novices use an effortful approach under uncertainty.

Therefore, preoperative risk assessment is needed to identify high-risk patients and anticipate postoperative adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To provide external validation of the Estimation of Physiologic Ability and Surgical Stress (E-PASS) risk model in a Western PHC cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The E-PASS variables were obtained from a database that included 156 consecutive patients who underwent resection for suspected PHC between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The accuracy of E-PASS using intraoperative variables and its modified form that can be used before surgery (mE-PASS) in predicting mortality was assessed by area under the curve analysis (discrimination) and by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (calibration). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality, severe morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grade<e2><89><a5>III), and a high Comprehensive Complication Index. RESULTS: Among 156 patients included in the study, the median age was 63 years, and 62.8% (n = 98) were male. Of them, 85.3% (n = 133) underwent major liver resection. Severe morbidity occurred in 51.3% (n = 80), and in-hospital mortality was 13.5% (n = 21). Both E-PASS and mE-PASS had adequate discriminative performance, with areas under the curve of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70-0.89), respectively, while E-PASS showed better calibration (P = .33 vs P = .02, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test). The ratios of observed to expected mortality were 1.31 for E-PASS and 1.24 for mE-PASS. Both models were able to distinguish groups with low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk, with observed mortality rates of 0.0% to 3.6%, 8.3% to 9.0%, and 25.0% to 28.3%, respectively. Severe morbidity and a high Comprehensive Complication Index were more frequently observed among high-risk patients.

Anthony and Mansour, M. Ashraf and Mastracci, Tara M. and Mell, Matthew and Murad, M. Hassan and Nguyen, Louis L. and Oderich, Gustavo S. and Patel, Madhukar S. and Schermerhorn, Marc L. and Starnes, Benjamin W.",Journal of vascular surgery,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity. METHODS: The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations. RESULTS: Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair.

It is likely that no more than 5.5% of persons with advanced asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) will now benefit from a carotid procedure during their lifetime. However, some question the adequacy of medical intervention alone for such persons and propose using markers of high stroke risk to intervene with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and/or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS). Our aim was to examine the scientific validity and implications of this proposal. METHODS: We reviewed the evidence for using medical intervention alone or with additional CEA or CAS in persons with ACS. We also reviewed the evidence regarding the validity of using commonly cited makers of high stroke risk to select such persons for CEA or CAS, including markers proposed by the European Society for Vascular Surgery in 2017. RESULTS: Randomized trials of medical intervention alone versus additional CEA showed a definite statistically significant CEA stroke prevention benefit for ACS only for selected average surgical risk men aged less than 75 to 80 years with 60% or greater stenosis using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. However, the most recent measurements of stroke rate with ACS using medical intervention alone are overall lower than for those who had CEA or CAS in randomized trials. Randomized trials of CEA versus CAS in persons with ACS were underpowered. However, the trend was for higher stroke and death rates with CAS. There are no randomized trial results related to comparing current optimal medical intervention with CEA or CAS. Commonly cited markers of high stroke risk in relation to ACS lack specificity, have not been assessed in conjunction with current optimal medical intervention, and have not been shown in randomized trials to identify those who benefit from a carotid procedure in addition to current optimal medical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Medical intervention has an established role in the current routine management of persons with ACS. Stroke risk stratification studies using current optimal medical intervention alone are the highest research priority for identifying persons likely to benefit from adding a carotid procedure.",2020,10.1016/j.jvs.2019.04.490,71,1,257-269,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Aged and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Combined Modality Therapy and Patient Selection and Asymptomatic Diseases and Stents and Clinical Decision-Making and *Risk Reduction Behavior and Stroke prevention and *Counseling and Cardiovascular Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use and Asymptomatic carotid stenosis and Carotid endarterectomy and Carotid Stenosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapy and Carotid stenting and Endarterectomy, Carotid and Endovascular Procedures/instrumentation and Medical intervention and Stroke/epidemiology/physiopathology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to investigate medical oncologists' and surgeons' assessment of resectability and indication for chemotherapy, and the effect of an educational intervention on such assessment. METHODS: Medical histories of 30 patients with CRLM were presented to ten experienced medical oncologists and 11 surgeons at an initial virtual tumour board meeting (TB1). Treatment recommendations were obtained from each participant by voting for standardized answers. Following lectures on the potential of chemotherapy and surgery, assessment was repeated at a second virtual tumour board meeting (TB2), using the same patients and participants. RESULTS: Overall, 630 answers (21 * 30) were obtained per tumour board meeting. At TB1, resectability was expected more frequently by surgeons. Participants changed 56<c2><b7>8 per cent of their individual answers at TB2. Assessment shifted from potentially resectable to resectable CRLM in 81 of 161 and from unresectable to (potentially) resectable CRLM in 29 of 36 answers.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Having a reliable and valid measure of trust is important to assess the quality of the patient-surgeon relationship when decisions about surgical procedures are made. METHODS: A previously published 10-item trust scale was qualitatively tested with patients, and a revised set of 14 items was tested using a web-based survey of 300 people who had hip, knee or back surgery in the past 2 years. The 14 items were evaluated using patterns of correlations and relevance to medical decision making to create a 5-item version. A 5-item subset was compared to the 14-item version to assess reliability and validity of patient's trust in the surgical decision making process. RESULTS: Of the 300 participants, 32% had hip surgery, 33% had knee surgery, and 34% back surgery. Mean age was 53 years, 45% female, 80% White, and 36% had a high school degree or less. The item intercorrelations for the 14 items were 0.43-0.72 and 0.58-0.71 for the 5 items. Correlation between the versions was 0.96 (P < 0.01). The 14- and 5-item versions were positively correlated with participants' shared decision making process scores (0.42 and 0.41, both P = 0.01), internal consistency reliability scores were 0.95 and 0.89, respectively, and were negatively correlated with their Decision Regret scores (-0.51 and -0.48, both P = 0.01).

Brothers_2007_Joofvasu,JOUR,Prospective decision analysis for peripheral vascular disease predicts future quality of life,"Brothers, Thomas E. and Robison, Jacob G. and Elliott, Bruce M.",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Decision making for peripheral vascular disease can be quite complex as a result of pre-existing compromise of patient functional status, anatomic considerations, uncertainty of favorable outcome, medical comorbidities, and limitations in life expectancy. The ability of prospective decision-analysis models to predict individual quality of life in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease was tested. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. The settings were university and Veterans Administration vascular surgery practices. All 214 patients referred with symptomatic lower extremity arterial disease of any severity over a 2-year period were screened, and 206 were enrolled. A Markov model was compared with standard clinical decision-making. Utility assessment and generalized (Short Form-36; SF-36) and disease-specific (Walking Impairment Questionnaire; WIQ) quality of life were derived before treatment. Estimates of treatment outcome probabilities and intended and actual treatment plans were provided by attending vascular surgeons. The main outcome measures were generalized (SF-36) and disease-specific (WIQ) variables at study entry and at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: Primary intervention consisted of amputation for 9, bypass for 42, angioplasty for 8, and medical treatment for 147 patients. Considering all patients, no improvement in mean overall patient quality of life measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Score (27 +/- 8 vs 28 +/- 8; P = .87) or WIQ (39 +/- 22 vs 39 +/- 23; P = .13) was noted 12 months after counseling and treatment by the vascular surgeons. Individually considered SF-36 categories were improved only for Bodily Pain (40 +/- 23 vs 49 +/- 25; P = .03), with the most significant improvement observed among patients with the most severe pain (68 +/- 25 vs 37 +/- 23; P = .02) and among those undergoing bypass (60 +/- 29 vs 31 +/- 22; P = .02). It is noteworthy that when the treatment chosen was incongruent with the Markov model, patients were more likely to report a poorer quality of life at 1 year (Physical Component Score, 25 +/- 8 vs 29 +/- 8; P < .001). The quality of life predicted at baseline by the Markov model correlated positively with the Physical Component Score (r = 0.23), Bodily Pain (r = 0.33), and Fatigue (r = 0.44) and negatively with WIQ (r = -0.08) observed 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective application of an individualized decision Markov model in patients with vascular disease was predictive of patient quality of life at 1 year. The patient's outcome was worse when the treatment received did not follow the model's recommendation. This decision analysis model may be useful to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes with standard clinical decision making.",2007,10.1016/j.jvs.2007.05.045,46,4,701-708; discussion 708,eng,0741-5214,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Markov Chains and Aged and Angioplasty and *Quality of Life and *Decision Support Techniques and Amputation and Locomotion and Lower Extremity/*blood supply/surgery and Peripheral Vascular Diseases/*surgery and Vascular Surgical Procedures,NA,NA,2007/10//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Communication between surgeons, patients, and surrogates about goals of treatment plays an important and understudied role in determining the surgical interventions elderly patients with serious illness receive. Communication breakdowns may lead to nonbeneficial procedures in acute events near the end of life. METHODS: We review the available literature on factors that lead to communication challenges and nonbeneficial surgery at the end of life. We use this review to identify solutions for navigating surgical decision making for seriously ill elderly patients with acute surgical conditions. RESULTS: Surgeon, patient, surrogate, and systemic factors-including time constraints, inadequate provider communication skills and training, uncertainty about prognosis, patient and surrogate anxiety and fear of inaction, and limitations in advance care planning-contribute to communication challenges and nonbeneficial surgery at the end of life. Surgeons could accomplish more effective communication with seriously ill elderly patients if they had a structured, standardized approach to exploring patients' preferences and to integrating those preferences into surgical decisions in the acute setting.

Singh_2011_Joofvasu,JOUR,New paradigms for physician-industry relations: overview and application for SVS members,"Singh, Niten and Bush, Ruth and Dalsing, Michael and Shortell, Cynthia K.",Journal of vascular surgery,"Relationships between physicians and their industry partners have ranged from spectacular collaborations that produce extraordinary advances in patient care, such as endovascular aneurysm repair, to humiliating scandals such as extravagant trips and bogus ""consulting"" agreements resulting in legal actions. It is the latter which have led many to call for the end of all physician-industry relationships, and the former which mandate their preservation. While these two examples are representative of extremes at each end of the spectrum of this issue, in reality the majority of physician-industry relationships are far more complex, and the line between appropriate and inappropriate, and ethical and unethical, is hard to draw. The benefits of our relationships with industry are many: partnering to develop new therapies and technologies, educating and training physicians around new therapies and technologies, support of continuing medical education (CME), fellowship training, and patient education. The pitfall and danger of this relationship is that support from industry, be it a meal, a pen, an educational grant, or flattery, may unduly and inappropriately influence physician decision making around a specific company's product. While it is clear that free trips are not within the realm of proper interaction, what about unrestricted educational grants to institutions, or support of CME activities, professional society meetings, and new device training? As a result of the intense scrutiny of relationships between physicians and industry recently, multiple diverse entities (Association of American Medical Colleges, American Medical Association, Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, professional medical associations, academic medical centers, industry, and government) have generated guidelines and policies with very different perspectives, reflective of their different missions. These policies range from vague and lenient, with only basic limitation of the physician-industry relationship, to extremely rigid and strict, with only minimal interaction and mission support permitted. Given the many changes in oversight and expectations for the relationship between physicians and industry, it is important for vascular surgeons to be aware of the background behind these modifications, the evidence that they are needed, and the positions of the diverse organizations and institutions that have already defined their policies on this issue.",2011,10.1016/j.jvs.2011.06.016,54,3 Suppl,26S-30S,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Diffusion of Innovation and Cooperative Behavior and Health Policy and Government Regulation and Guidelines as Topic and Gift Giving and Conflict of Interest and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Fees and Charges and Codes of Ethics and *Health Care Sector/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards and *Interinstitutional Relations and *Interprofessional Relations/ethics and *Quality of Health Care/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards and *Societies, Medical/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards and *Vascular Surgical Procedures/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards and Scientific Misconduct",NA,NA,2011/09//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of our study was to compare the clinical outcomes between surgical and non-surgical treatment of colonoscopic perforation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with colonoscopic perforation, which was treated between January 2005 and December 2014. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they received non-surgical (conservative management or endoscopic clipping) or surgical (primary closure, bowel resection and anastomosis, and/or faecal diversion) initial treatment for the perforation. Conversion was defined as the change from a non-surgical to surgical procedure after treatment failure. RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were analysed. Surgical treatment was more common following diagnostic than therapeutic colonoscopic procedures (74.5 vs. 53.7 %, P = 0.023). Of 55 patients in the non-surgical group, 11 patients required conversion to surgery. The surgical group comprised 54 patients. The complication rate (P = 0.001), and the length of hospital stay (P < 0.001) were significantly greater in the patients requiring conversion than in the surgical group. Multivariate analysis showed that old age, American Society for Anesthesiologists score <e2><89><a5> 3, and conversion were independent predictors of poor outcomes (P = 0.048, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively). Only perforation size was associated with conversion in multivariate analysis (P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: It is important to select an appropriate treatment in patients with colonoscopic perforation. To avoid non-surgical treatment failure, surgery should be considered in patients with a large perforation.

Zhou_2011_Joofvasu,JOUR,Radiation exposure of vascular surgery patients beyond endovascular procedures,"Zhou, Wei",Journal of vascular surgery,BACKGROUND: Medical imaging evaluations provide valuable information and are often imperative in the care of our patients. Radiation exposure in patients who undergo medical imaging procedures is not routinely monitored and the associated risks are often underestimated. METHODS: Radiation exposure associated with computed tomography (CT) angiography and coronary intervention is reviewed. RESULTS: Vascular surgeons are often involved in the decision-making process in roughly 30% of CT scans performed that are believed to be unnecessary. Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) practice guidelines for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms recommended eliminating a 6-month contrast surveillance CT if no endoleak was observed at 1 month after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Ultrasound and aortic duplex can help eliminate some of the CT scans. CONCLUSION: Vascular surgeons must remain vigilant in monitoring radiation exposure for their patients who have potential for coronary and vascular imaging with radiation. Judicious use of alternative imaging modalities when possible and maintaining the dose as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) is the responsibility of vascular surgeons.,2011,10.1016/j.jvs.2010.06.176,53,1 Suppl,39S-43S,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Risk Factors and Radiation Dosage and *Vascular Surgical Procedures and Angiography/*adverse effects and Coronary Angiography/adverse effects and Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology and Radiation Injuries/etiology and Radiation Monitoring and Radiography, Interventional/*adverse effects and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects and Vascular Diseases/*diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,2011/01//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Coded data drive hospital reimbursement and are used for audit and research, and benchmarking and outcomes management purposes. METHODS: We undertook a 2-center audit of coding accuracy across surgery. Clinician-auditor multidisciplinary teams reviewed the coding of 30,127 patients and assessed accuracy at primary and secondary diagnosis and procedure levels, morbidity level, complications assignment, and financial variance. Postaudit data of a randomly selected sample of 400 cases were reaudited by an independent team. RESULTS: At least 1 coding change occurred in 15,402 patients (51%). There were 3911 (13%) and 3620 (12%) changes to primary diagnoses and procedures, respectively. In 5183 (17%) patients, the Health Resource Grouping changed, resulting in income variance of <c2><a3>3,974,544 (+6.2%). The morbidity level changed in 2116 (7%) patients (P < 0.001). The number of assigned complications rose from 2597 (8.6%) to 2979 (9.9%) (P < 0.001). Reaudit resulted in further primary diagnosis and procedure changes in 8.7% and 4.8% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The coded data are a key engine for knowledge-driven health care provision. They are used, increasingly at individual surgeon level, to benchmark performance. Surgical clinical coding is prone to subjectivity, variability, and error (SVE).

Multinu_2018_JAMAsurg,JOUR,Practice Patterns and Complications of Benign Hysterectomy Following the FDA Statement Warning Against the Use of Power Morcellation,"Multinu, Francesco and Casarin, Jvan and Hanson, Kristine T. and Angioni, Stefano and Mariani, Andrea and Habermann, Elizabeth B. and Laughlin-Tommaso, Shannon K.",JAMA surgery,"IMPORTANCE: In November 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning against the use of power morcellation for excision of uterine fibroids to decrease the risk of disseminating malignant cells and worsening survival outcomes of patients with unexpected malignant neoplasms. After the FDA statement was issued, studies showed decreased rates of minimally invasive surgery and increased rates of open abdominal hysterectomy. However, there are limited and controversial data on the association of these changed rates with 30-day hysterectomy complications. OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in the rates of 30-day major and minor complications of hysterectomy for benign gynecologic indications following the FDA-issued statement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and included 603 hospitals participating between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015. Thirty-day posthysterectomy complications were compared before and after the FDA-issued warning. Women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecologic indications (n = 75<e2><80><af>487), including hysterectomies with indication of uterine fibroids (n = 25<e2><80><af>571), were included. Complication rates and procedure distributions between the periods were compared with <cf><87>2 tests and multivariable logistic regression controlling for patient and operative factors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major and minor 30-day complication rates before (from 2013 through the first quarter of 2014) and after (from the fourth quarter of 2014 through 2015) the FDA-issued warning. RESULTS: Of 75<e2><80><af>487 women (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [10.7] years) who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecologic indications, 32<e2><80><af>186 (42.6%) were treated before and 43<e2><80><af>301 (57.4%) after the FDA-issued warning. Non-Hispanic white women comprised most (59.4%) of the total population, followed by African American women (15.1%). Overall, major and minor complications remained stable before and after the FDA-issued warning. By contrast, among a subset of 25<e2><80><af>571 women (33.9%) who underwent hysterectomy for uterine fibroids, major complications significantly increased after the FDA-issued warning from 1.9% to 2.4% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.47; P = .02), and minor complications significantly increased from 2.7% to 3.3% (adjusted OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40; P = .01). In this subgroup, the rate of open abdominal surgery increased from 37.2% to 43.0%, and the rate of minimally invasive surgery (total laparoscopic hysterectomy, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy, and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy) decreased from 56.1% to 49.7% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Major and minor 30-day complication rates among women undergoing hysterectomy for uterine fibroids increased following the FDA-issued statement. This increased risk corresponding with a decreased use of minimally invasive surgery should be balanced against the potential harms of morcellation during a shared decision-making process between clinician and patient.

OBJECTIVE: To compare 30-day postoperative mortality in patients with HIV infection receiving ART with the rates in uninfected individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of nationwide electronic medical record data from the US Veterans Health Administration Healthcare System, October 1, 1996, to September 30, 2010. Common inpatient surgical procedures were grouped using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Clinical Classification System to match HIV-infected and uninfected patients in a 1:2 ratio. Data on 1641 patients with HIV infection receiving combination ART who were undergoing inpatient surgery were compared with data on 3282 procedure-matched, uninfected comparators. Poisson regression models of 30-day postoperative mortality were adjusted for procedure year, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, hemoglobin level, albumin level, HIV infection, CD4 cell count, and HIV-1 RNA level. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The most common procedures in both groups were cholecystectomy (10.5%), hip arthroplasty (10.5%), spine surgery (9.8%), herniorrhaphy (7.4%), and coronary artery bypass grafting (7.0%). In patients with HIV infection, CD4 cell distributions were 80.0% with 200/<ce><bc>L or more, 16.3% with 50/<ce><bc>L to 199/<ce><bc>L, and 3.7% with less than 50/<ce><bc>L; 74.1% of patients with HIV infection had undetectable HIV-1 RNA. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was associated with higher 30-day postoperative mortality compared with the mortality in uninfected patients (3.4% [56 patients]) vs 1.6% [53]); incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.41-3.17; P < .001). CD4 cell count was inversely associated with mortality, but HIV-1 RNA provided no additional information. After adjustment, patients with HIV infection had increased mortality compared with uninfected patients at all CD4 cell count strata (<e2><89><a5>500/<ce><bc>L: IRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.02-3.60; P = .04; 200-499/<ce><bc>L: IRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.20-2.98; P = .01; 50-199/<ce><bc>L: IRR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.29-5.47; P = .01; and <50/<ce><bc>L: IRR, 6.21; 95% CI, 3.55-10.85; P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current postoperative mortality rates among individuals with HIV infection who are receiving ART are low and are influenced as much by hypoalbuminemia and age as by CD4 cell status.

Madani_2017_Anofsu,JOUR,What Are the Principles That Guide Behaviors in the Operating Room?: Creating a Framework to Define and Measure Performance,"Madani, Amin and Vassiliou, Melina C. and Watanabe, Yusuke and Al-Halabi, Becher and Al-Rowais, Mohammed S. and Deckelbaum, Dan L. and Fried, Gerald M. and Feldman, Liane S.",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the core principles that guide expert intraoperative behaviors and to use these principles to develop a universal framework that defines intraoperative performance. BACKGROUND: Surgical outcomes are associated with intraoperative cognitive skills. Yet, our understanding of factors that control intraoperative judgment and decision-making are limited. As a result, current methods for training and measuring performance are somewhat subjective-more task rather than procedure-oriented-and usually not standardized. They thus provide minimal insight into complex cognitive processes that are fundamental to patient safety. METHODS: Cognitive task analyses for 6 diverse surgical procedures were performed using semistructured interviews and field observations to describe the thoughts, behaviors, and actions that characterize and guide expert performance. Verbal data were transcribed, supplemented with content from published literature, coded, thematically analyzed using grounded-theory by 4 independent reviewers, and synthesized into a list of items. RESULTS: A conceptual framework was developed based on 42 semistructured interviews lasting 45 to 120 minutes, 5 expert panels and 51 field observations involving 35 experts, and 135 sources from the literature. Five domains of intraoperative performance were identified: psychomotor skills, declarative knowledge, advanced cognitive skills, interpersonal skills, and personal resourcefulness. Within the advanced cognitive skills domain, 21 themes were perceived to guide the behaviors of surgeons: 18 for surgical planning and error prevention, and 3 for error/injury recognition, rescue, and recovery. The application of these thought patterns was highly case-specific and variable amongst subspecialties, environments, and individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive definition of intraoperative expertise, with greater insight into the complex cognitive processes that seem to underlie optimal performance. This framework provides trainees and other nonexperts with the necessary information to use in deliberate practice and the creation of effective thought habits that characterize expert performance. It may help to identify gaps in performance, and to isolate root causes of surgical errors with the ultimate goal of improving patient safety.",2017,10.1097/SLA.0000000000001962,265,2,255-267,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"Humans and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Patient Safety and Interprofessional Relations and Task Performance and Analysis and Psychomotor Performance and Operating Rooms and *Cognition and *Decision Making and *Judgment and *Clinical Competence and Surgeons/*psychology and Medical Errors/prevention & control/psychology and Surgical Procedures, Operative/*psychology",NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

One scan was excluded as all reviewers felt it to be of insufficient quality to assess. Improved surgical technique and better chemotherapeutic manipulation of metastatic disease has increased the number of patients eligible for potentially curative resection of colorectal liver metastases. The rapid evolution in this field suggests that non-specialist decision-making may lead to inappropriate management. This study aimed to assess the management of colorectal liver metastases by non-liver surgeons. METHODS: All patients who underwent chemotherapy with palliative intent for metastatic colorectal cancer at a regional oncology centre between 1 January and 31 December 2009 were identified from a prospectively maintained local database. Six resectional liver surgeons blinded to patient management and outcome reviewed pretreatment imaging and assigned each scan a score based on their own management choice. A consensus decision was reached on the appropriateness of palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS: One hundred and ten patients were treated with palliative chemotherapy, of whom 53 had liver-only disease and had not been reviewed by a specialist liver surgeon. One scan was excluded as all reviewers felt it to be of insufficient quality to assess [corrected].

Park_2015_Surgendo,JOUR,Raising the quality of hernia care: Is there a need?,"Park, Adrian E. and Zahiri, Hamid Reza and Pugh, Carla M. and Vassiliou, Melina and Voeller, Guy",Surgical endoscopy,"INTRODUCTION: With a focus on raising the quality of hernia care through creation of educational programs, SAGES formed the Hernia Task Force (HTF). This study used needs assessment survey to target opportunities for improving surgical training and thus patient outcomes and experience. METHODS: This qualitative study included structured interviews and online surveys of key stakeholders: HTF members, surgeons, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, healthcare payers and medical suppliers. Questions included perceptions of recurrence and complication rates, their etiologies, perceived deficits in current hernia care and the most effective and training modalities. RESULTS: A total of 841 participants included 665 surgeons, 66 patient care team members, 12 hospital administrators and 14 medical supply providers. Assessment of technical approach revealed that nearly 26 % of surgeons apply the same, limited range of techniques to all patients without evaluation of patient-specific factors. The majority (71 %) of surgeon respondents related hernia recurrence rates nearing 25 % or more. HTF members implicated surgeon factors (deficits in knowledge/technique, etc.) as primary determinants of recurrences, whereas nurses, medical supply providers and hospital administrators implicated patient health factors. Surgeons preferred attending conferences (82 %), reading periodicals/publications (71 %), watching videos (59 %) and communicating with peers (57 %) for learning and skill improvement. Topics of the greatest interest were advanced techniques for hernia repairs (71 %), preoperative and intraoperative decision making (56 %) and patient outcomes (64 %). Eighty-six percent of nurses felt that there was room for improvement in hernia patient safety and teamwork in the OR. Only 24 % believed that the patients had adequate preoperative education. CONCLUSIONS: Major reported deficits in hernia care include: lack of standardization in training and care, ""one size fits all"" technical approach and inadequate patient follow-up/outcome measures. There is a need for a comprehensive, flexible and tailored educational program to equip surgeons and their teams to raise the quality of hernia care and bring greater value to their patients.",2015,10.1007/s00464-015-4309-4,29,8,2061-2071,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"United States and Humans and Patient Care Team and Surveys and Questionnaires and Needs Assessment and Interviews as Topic and Postoperative Complications and Recurrence and *Benchmarking and Hernia, Abdominal/*surgery and Herniorrhaphy/adverse effects/*standards and Laparoscopy/adverse effects/standards",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Salim_2020_Anofsu,JOUR,The Construction of Surgical Trust: How Surgeons Judge Residents' Readiness for Operative Independence,"Salim, Saad Y. and Govaerts, Marjan and White, Jonathan",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how trust was constructed between surgeons and residents in the operating room. BACKGROUND: Entrustment is increasingly being used as a key element to assess trainees' competence in the clinical workplace. However, the cognitive process involved in the formulation of surgical trust remains poorly understood. METHODS: In semistructured interviews, 9 general surgeons discussed their experiences in making entrustment decisions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Template analysis methodology was employed to develop an explanatory model. RESULTS: Surgeons described the construction of trust as a stepwise process taking place before, during, and after the procedure. The main steps were as follows: (1) an initial propensity to trust based on the perceived risk of the case and trustworthiness of the resident; (2) a decision to initiate trust in the resident to begin the surgery; (3) close observation of preliminary steps; (4) an evolving decision based on whether the surgery is ""on-track"" or ""off-track""; (5) intervention if the surgery was ""off-track"" (withdrawal of trust); (6) re-evaluation of trust for future cases. The main reasons described for withdrawing trust were: inability to follow instructions, failure to progress, and unsafe manoeuvres. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that surgical trust is constructed through an iterative process involving gathering and valuing of information, decision-making, close observation, and supervisory intervention. There were strong underlying themes of control and responsibility, and trust was noted to increase over time and over repeated observations. The model presented here may be useful in improving judgements on competence in the surgical workplace.",2020,10.1097/SLA.0000000000003125,271,2,391-398,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Interviews as Topic and *Trust and *Internship and Residency and *Interprofessional Relations and *Clinical Competence and Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic/*education and Faculty, Medical/*psychology",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether normalization of hypercalcaemia with short-term medical treatment can be used to predict the effects of parathyroidectomy and guide in surgical decision-making. METHODS: This observational study included patients who received calcimimetic treatment for 4 weeks before parathyroidectomy (30-60 mg daily). A panel of tests was used to assess various aspects of quality of life (European Organisation and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 core questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Positive State of Mind questionnaire), cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and muscle strength (timed-stands test). The tests were carried out at baseline, after 4 weeks of calcimimetic treatment, and at 6 weeks and 6 months after parathyroidectomy. The predictive values of changes during calcimimetic treatment were determined for each test. RESULTS: The study included 110 patients of median age 62 years (91 women). Calcimimetic treatment resulted in normalization of calcium levels and improvements in quality-of-life parameters. The time spent on the timed-stands test was significantly shortened. Eleven of 38 participants with a baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment score below 26, indicating mild cognitive impairment, reached scores of at least 26 during treatment with calcimimetic. Improvements during treatment with calcimimetic correlated well with postoperative outcomes (positive predictive values 74-96 per cent).

Lilley_2018_Anofsu,JOUR,Palliative Care in Surgery: Defining the Research Priorities,"Lilley, Elizabeth J. and Cooper, Zara and Schwarze, Margaret L. and Mosenthal, Anne C.",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the existing science of palliative care in surgery within three priority areas and expose specific gaps within the field. BACKGROUND: Given the acute and often life-limiting nature of surgical illness, as well as the potential for treatment to induce further suffering, surgical patients have considerable palliative care needs. Yet these patients are less likely to receive palliative care than their medical counterparts and palliative care consultations often occur when death is imminent, reflecting poor quality end-of-life care. METHODS: The National Institutes of Health and the National Palliative Care Research Center convened researchers from several medical subspecialties to develop a national agenda for palliative care research. The surgeon work group reviewed the existing surgical literature to identify critical knowledge gaps. RESULTS: To date, evidence to support the role of palliative care in surgical practice is sparse and palliative care research in surgery is encumbered by methodological challenges and entrenched cultural norms that impede appropriate provision of palliative care. Priorities for future research on palliative care in surgery include: 1) measuring outcomes that matter to patients, 2) communication and decision making, and 3) delivery of palliative care to surgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients would likely benefit from early palliative care delivered alongside surgical treatment to promote goal-concordant decision making and to improve patients' physical, emotional, social and spiritual well-being and quality of life.

The Society commissioned the Knowledge and Encounter Research Unit of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, to systematically review the available evidence in three main areas provided by the panel: timing of referral to access surgeons, type of access placed, and effectiveness of surveillance. The panel then formulated practice guidelines in seven areas: timing of referral to the access surgeon, operative strategies to maximize the placement of autogenous arteriovenous accesses, first choice for the autogenous access, choice of arteriovenous access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a forearm autogenous access, the role of monitoring and surveillance in arteriovenous access management, conversion of a prosthetic arteriovenous access to a secondary autogenous arteriovenous access, and management of the nonfunctional or failed arteriovenous access. For each of the guidelines, the panel stated the recommendation or suggestion, discussed the evidence or opinion upon which the recommendation or suggestion was made, detailed the values and preferences that influenced the group's decision in formulating the relevant guideline, and discussed technical remarks related to the particular guideline.

Tan_2007_Surgendo,JOUR,The role of diagnostic laparoscopy in micropremmies with suspected necrotizing enterocolitis,"Tan, H. L. and Tantoco, J. G. and Ee, M. Z.",Surgical endoscopy,"BACKGROUND: The timely diagnosis of perforations or dead gut can be extremely difficult in micropremmies with necrotizing enterocolitis. A negative laparotomy is just as detrimental as failure to recognize early perforation in this group of patients. We have been exploring the role of microlaparoscopy using a needlescope to determine if this modality is feasible and useful in the surgical management of these patients. We report our technique and initial experience with needlescopic diagnosis. METHODS: Four patients (weight >500 to <1000 g) with abdominal distension and clinical sepsis not responsive to aggressive medical treatment were included in this study. None had radiologic evidence of pneumatosis or perforation. There was no absolute surgical indication for laparotomy except for strong suspicion of a surgical cause. Needlescopic diagnosis was performed in all these patients. RESULTS: There was no evidence of perforation or bile in the abdominal cavity in one patient. This patient improved on medical management, avoiding a laparotomy. The rest had bile or fibrin in the abdominal fluid with a localized perforation, and in each case we performed a microlaparotomy directly over the site of perforation to create a stoma. CONCLUSIONS: Needlescopic diagnosis is feasible and appears to be safe, even in critically ill micropremmies less than 1000 g. The technique can provide useful information for surgical decision-making and allows for precise placement of a microlaparotomy incision over the site of perforation, thus minimizing the trauma from open surgery in this special group of patients.

We sought to determine the clinical utility of the algorithms compared with our clinical decision making and outcomes for management of rAAA during a 10-year period. METHODS: Patients admitted with a diagnosis rAAA at a large university hospital were identified from 2005 to 2014. The Glasgow Aneurysm Score, Hardman Index, Vancouver Score, Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score, University of Washington Ruptured Aneurysm Score, Vascular Study Group of New England rAAA Risk Score, and the Artificial Neural Network Score were analyzed for accuracy in predicting mortality. Among patients quantified into the highest-risk group (predicted mortality >80%-85%), we compared the predicted with the actual outcome to determine how well these scores predicted futility. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 64 patients. Of those, 24 (38%) underwent open repair, 36 (56%) underwent endovascular repair, and 4 (6%) received only comfort care. Overall mortality was 30% (open repair, 26%; endovascular repair, 24%; no repair, 100%). As assessed by the scoring systems, 5% to 35% of patients were categorized as high-mortality risk. Intersystem agreement was poor, with <ce><ba> values ranging from 0.06 to 0.79. Actual mortality was lower than the predicted mortality (50%-70% vs 78%-100%) for all scoring systems, with each scoring system overestimating mortality by 10% to 50%. Mortality rates for patients not designated into the high-risk cohort were dramatically lower, ranging from 7% to 29%. Futility, defined as 100% mortality, was predicted in five of 63 patients with the Hardman Index and in two of 63 of the University of Washington score. Of these, surgery was not offered to one of five and one of two patients, respectively. If one of these two models were used to withhold operative intervention, the mortality of these patients would have been 100%. The actual mortality for these patients was 60% and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical algorithms for predicting mortality after rAAA were not useful for predicting futility. Most patients with rAAA were not classified in the highest-risk group by the clinical decision models.

We sought to understand the sources of patients' pre-existing knowledge about AAA to better inform treating physicians about patients' needs for preoperative counseling. METHODS: We performed a multicenter survey of patients facing AAA repair at 20 Veterans Affairs hospitals across the United States as part of the Preferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAA study. A validated survey instrument was administered to examine the sources of information available and commonly used by patients to learn about their repair options. The survey was administered by study personnel before the patient had any interaction with the vascular surgeon because survey data were collected before the vascular clinic visit. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis of data from 99 patients showed that our cohort was primarily male (99%) and elderly (mean age 73 years). Patients commonly had a history of hypertension (86%), prior myocardial infarction (32%), diabetes (32%), and were overweight (58%). Patients arrived at their surgeon's office appointment with limited information. A majority of patients (52%) reported that they had not talked to their primary care physician at all about their options for AAA repair, and one-half (50%) reported that their view of the different surgical options had not been influenced by anyone.

Mehaffey_2018_Joofvasu,JOUR,Preoperative dementia is associated with increased cost and complications after vascular surgery,"Mehaffey, J. Hunter and Hawkins, Robert B. and Tracci, Margaret C. and Robinson, William P. and Cherry, Kenneth J. and Kern, John A. and Upchurch, Gilbert R. Jr",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Dementia represents a major risk factor for medical complications and has been linked to higher rates of complication after surgery. Given the systemic nature of vascular disease, medical comorbidities significantly increase cost and complications after vascular surgery. We hypothesize that the presence of dementia is an independent predictor of increased postoperative complications and higher health care costs after vascular surgery. METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried for all patients undergoing vascular surgery at a single academic medical center from 2012 to 2017. All modules were included (open abdominal aortic aneurysm, suprainguinal bypass, lower extremity bypass, amputation, carotid endarterectomy, endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, and peripheral endovascular intervention). An institutional clinical data repository was queried to identify patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for dementia as well as total hospital cost and long-term survival using Social Security records from the Virginia Department of Health. Hierarchical logistic and linear regression models were fit to assess risk-adjusted predictors of any complication and inflation-adjusted cost. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2318 patients underwent vascular surgery and were captured by the Vascular Quality Initiative during the past 5 years, with 88 (3.8%) having a diagnosis of dementia. Patients with dementia were older and had higher rates of medical comorbidities, and the most common procedure was major amputation. In addition, dementia patients had a significantly higher rate of any complication (52% vs 16%; P < .0001) and increased 90-day mortality (14% vs 4.8%; P = .0002). Furthermore, dementia was associated with significant resource utilization, including preoperative length of stay (LOS), postoperative LOS, intensive care unit LOS, and inflation-adjusted total hospital cost (all P < .0001). Hierarchical modeling demonstrated that dementia was the strongest preoperative predictor for any complication (odds ratio, 8.64; P < .0001) and had the largest risk-adjusted impact on total hospital cost ($22,069; P < .0001). Finally, survival analysis demonstrated that dementia is independently associated with reduced survival after vascular surgery (hazard ratio, 1.37; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that dementia is one of the strongest predictors of any complication and increased hospital cost after vascular surgery.

Meghoo_2012_Joofvasu,JOUR,Diagnosis and management of evacuated casualties with cervical vascular injuries resulting from combat-related explosive blasts,"Meghoo, Colin A. and Dennis, James W. and Tuman, Caroline and Fang, Raymond",Journal of vascular surgery,"BACKGROUND: Explosive blasts are common in the modern military environment. These blasts incorporate a concussive component (primary blast injury) and a penetrating component (secondary blast injury). Penetrating injuries are the leading cause of death and injury in these attacks. This review characterizes the vascular injuries associated with penetrating blast injuries to the neck and provides recommendations on the early management of these casualties for the surgeon unfamiliar with these injuries. METHODS: The Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry was queried for admissions from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, coded for a penetrating injury to the neck caused by a blast mechanism. Medical records were abstracted from the patient's initial presentation and care through the deployed military medical system. We recorded the vascular injuries, diagnostic studies, operative events, and early postinjury course for all identified patients. RESULTS: Query of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry initially identified 252 patients, of which 53 were excluded because their injuries arose from other mechanisms or were only superficial. Among the remaining 199 patients, 38 (19.1%) sustained 44 vascular injuries requiring treatment. Compelling physical examination findings (""hard signs"") were present in 15 (7.5%), who underwent immediate neck exploration. Another 12 patients also underwent neck exploration without any prior imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) or CT angiography (CTA) examinations were done in 172 patients without hard-sign physical examination findings. Of these, the result of the imaging study was negative in 106 patients, and no further investigation or treatment for cervical vascular trauma was initiated. Of 66 patients who underwent CT/CTA before operative neck exploration, CT/CTA identified a vascular injury in 26 that was later confirmed on neck exploration. The combination of physical examination and CT/CTA resulted in a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 97.2% in diagnosing cervical vascular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Penetrating cervical wounds from war-related blast trauma are associated with potentially life-threatening vascular injuries. The presenting physical examination, availability of CT/CTA, local surgical expertise, and tactical combat situation all contribute to surgical decision making in these patients. In patients without hard signs of vascular trauma and a normal CT/CTA of the neck, there is no evidence to support mandatory surgical neck explorations or further immediate diagnostic studies to exclude cervical vascular injury.",2012,10.1016/j.jvs.2011.11.125,55,5,1329-36; discussion 1336-1337,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"United States and Humans and Male and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Sensitivity and Specificity and Treatment Outcome and Predictive Value of Tests and Afghan Campaign 2001- and Iraq War, 2003-2011 and Registries and Germany and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Endovascular Procedures and Physical Examination and Anticoagulants/therapeutic use and *Patient Transfer and Vascular Surgical Procedures and *Explosions and Blast Injuries/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy and Hospitals, Military and Neck/*blood supply and Vascular System Injuries/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy and Wounds, Penetrating/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY/BACKGROUND: Only few areas in medicine have seen so many novel therapeutic options over the past decades as for liver tumors. Significant variations may therefore exist regarding the choices of treatment, even among experts, which may confuse both the medical community and patients. METHODS: Ten cases of CRLM with different levels of complexity were presented to 43 expert liver surgeons from 23 countries and 4 continents. Experts were defined as experienced surgeons with academic contributions to the field of liver tumors. Experts provided information on their medical education and current practice in liver surgery and transplantation. Using an online platform, they chose their strategy in treating each case from defined multiple choices with added comments. Inter-rater agreement among experts and cases was calculated using free-marginal multirater kappa methodology. A similar, but adjusted survey was presented to 60 general surgeons from Asia, Europe, and North America to test their attitude in treating or referring complex patients to expert centers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (88%) experts completed the evaluation. Most of them are in leading positions (92%) with a median clinical experience of 25 years. Agreement on therapeutic strategies among them was none to minimal in more than half of the cases with kappa varying from 0.00 to 0.39. Many general surgeons may not refer the complex cases to expert centers, including in Europe, where they also engage in complex liver surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable inconsistencies of decision-making exist among expert surgeons when choosing a therapeutic strategy for CRLM. This might confuse both patients and referring physicians and indicate that an international high-level consensus statements and widely accepted guidelines are needed.",2020,10.1097/SLA.0000000000004331,272,5,715-722,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Consensus and *Decision Making and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology and Hepatectomy/*methods and Liver Neoplasms/*secondary/*surgery",NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this evidence summary we discuss some of the most clinically relevant features of the disease. The true incidence of TAAs is likely to be higher than currently reported because of the inherently silent nature of TAAs. However, TAAs can become rapidly lethal once dissection or rupture occurs, highlighting the need for more robust screening. The impressive discovery of familial patterns and novel genetic loci for TAAs challenges the idea that most TAAs are simply sporadic. Although the aorta grows in an indolent manner, its rate of growth and its current diameter both have important clinical implications. Biomechanical studies have supported clinical findings of 6.0 cm as a dangerous threshold. Surgical extirpation of TAAs is currently the mainstay of effective treatment. Although endovascular TAA repair is becoming increasingly common, long-term safety remains unproven. We still need more data to support the concept that any medical therapy is effective.",2012,10.1016/j.jvs.2012.04.053,56,2,565-571,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Pedigree and *Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology/surgery and Aneurysm, Dissecting/diagnosis/pathology and Aorta, Thoracic/pathology and Aortic Rupture/diagnosis/pathology and Dilatation, Pathologic",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhuge_2011_Anofsu,JOUR,Is there still a glass ceiling for women in academic surgery?,"Zhuge, Ying and Kaufman, Joyce and Simeone, Diane M. and Chen, Herbert and Velazquez, Omaida C.",Annals of surgery,"Despite the dramatically increased entry of women into general surgery and surgical subspecialties, traditionally male-dominated fields, there remains a gross under-representation of women in the leadership positions of these departments. Women begin their careers with fewer academic resources and tend to progress through the ranks slower than men. Female surgeons also receive significantly lower salaries than their male counterparts and are more vulnerable to discrimination, both obvious and covert. Although some argue that female surgeons tend to choose their families over careers, studies have actually shown that women are as eager as men to assume leadership positions, are equally qualified for these positions as men, and are as good as men at leadership tasks.Three major constraints contribute to the glass-ceiling phenomenon: traditional gender roles, manifestations of sexism in the medical environment, and lack of effective mentors. Gender roles contribute to unconscious assumptions that have little to do with actual knowledge and abilities of an individuals and they negatively influence decision-making when it comes to promotions. Sexism has many forms, from subtle to explicit forms, and some studies show that far more women report being discriminately against than do men. There is a lack of same-sex mentors and role models for women in academic surgery, thereby isolating female academicians further. This review summarizes the manifestation of the glass-ceiling phenomenon, identifies some causes of these inequalities, and proposes different strategies for continuing the advancement of women in academic surgery and to shatter the glass ceiling.",2011,10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182111120,253,4,637-643,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Workforce and Needs Assessment and Academic Medical Centers and Task Performance and Analysis and Career Choice and Clinical Competence and *Leadership and *Prejudice and *General Surgery and Career Mobility and Faculty, Medical/organization & administration and Physicians, Women/*organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

It must be assumed that this situation will not stay under the sole control of surgeons; mechanical systems will assist them. Certain segments of the work flow will likely have to be taken over by a machine in an automatized or autonomous mode. METHODS: In addition to the analysis of our own surgical practice, a literature search of the Medline database was performed to identify important aspects, methods, and technologies for increased operating room (OR) autonomy. RESULTS: Robotic surgical systems can help to increase OR autonomy by camera control, application of intelligent instruments, and even accomplishment of automated surgical procedures. However, the important step from simple task execution to autonomous decision making is difficult to realize. Another important aspect is the adaption of the general technical OR environment. This includes adaptive OR setting and context-adaptive interfaces, automated tool arrangement, and optimal visualization. Finally, integration of peri- and intraoperative data consisting of electronic patient record, OR documentation and logistics, medical imaging, and patient surveillance data could increase autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: To gain autonomy in the OR, a variety of assistance systems and methodologies need to be incorporated that endorse the surgeon autonomously as a first step toward the vision of cognitive surgery.

However, it may be difficult to make a diagnosis or plan treatment strategy with endoscopic visualization alone. The addition of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has the potential to improve the ability to establish the diagnosis and develop a treatment strategy. The present study was conducted to assess the feasibility and usefulness of EUS with DBE. METHODS: EUS with DBE was performed in 31 of 891 patients who underwent DBE from July 2004 to March 2011 at Jichi Medical University Hospital. We analyzed the EUS findings for lesions and evaluated the usefulness of EUS considering the following three factors: qualitative diagnostic value for lesions, depth grading of lesions, and evaluation of the structure of severe strictures prior to endoscopic balloon dilation. RESULTS: EUS was performed for 31/32 lesions (97%) in 31 patients. EUS findings were informative for 29/32 lesions (91%). EUS findings were useful for establishing a qualitative diagnosis in 15/25 lesions (60%). EUS findings for depth grading provided useful information for determining the therapeutic strategy in 11/13 lesions (85%). EUS with DBE was useful in the evaluation of strictures for all six lesions (100%). The overall usefulness of EUS with DBE on decision making was 72% (23/32) in this study.

Robotic surgery is still at its infancy, and there is a great potential in sophisticated electromechanical systems to perform complex surgical tasks when these systems evolve. 2. To date, in the vast majority of clinical settings, there is little or no advantage in using robotic systems in general surgery in terms of clinical outcome. Dedicated parameters should be addressed, and high quality research should focus on quality of care instead of routine parameters, where a clear advantage is not to be expected. 3. Preliminary data demonstrates that robotic system have a clinical benefit in performing complex procedures in confined spaces, especially in those that are located in unfavorable anatomical locations. 4. There is a severe lack of high quality data on robotic surgery, and there is a great need for rigorously controlled, unbiased clinical trials. These trials should be urged to address the cost-effectiveness issues as well. 5. Specific areas of research should include complex hepatobiliary surgery, surgery for gastric and esophageal cancer, revisional surgery in bariatric and upper GI surgery, surgery for large adrenal masses, and rectal surgery. All these fields show some potential for a true benefit of using current robotic systems. 6. Robotic surgery requires a specific set of skills, and needs to be trained using a dedicated, structured training program that addresses the specific knowledge, safety issues and skills essential to perform this type of surgery safely and with good outcomes. It is the responsibility of the corresponding professional organizations, not the industry, to define the training and credentialing of robotic basic skills and specific procedures. 7. Due to the special economic environment in which robotic surgery is currently employed special care should be taken in the decision making process when deciding on the purchase, use and training of robotic systems in general surgery. 8. Professional organizations in the sub-specialties of general surgery should review these statements and issue detailed, specialty-specific guidelines on the use of specific robotic surgery procedures in addition to outlining the advanced robotic surgery training required to safely perform such procedures.",2015,10.1007/s00464-014-3916-9,29,2,253-288,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"Humans and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Europe and Societies, Medical and Laparoscopy/methods and *Robotics/economics/methods and Cholecystectomy/methods and Conversion to Open Surgery/statistics & numerical data and Endoscopy/economics/*methods and Hepatectomy/methods and Pancreatectomy/methods",NA,NA,2015/02//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hanna_2011_Joofvasu,JOUR,Conflict of interest issues pertinent to Veterans Affairs Medical Centers,"Hanna, Jennifer and Simiele, Ernest and Lawson, D. Curtis and Tyler, Douglas",Journal of vascular surgery,"Conflicts of interest exist when an arrangement potentially exerts inappropriate influence on decision making or professional judgment, or is perceived to do so, and can thus damage the public trust and undermine the integrity of those decisions. Concerns regarding financial conflicts of interest in the medical arena have reached their height as of late, given that physicians now function in a milieu of complex and delicate relationships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Even when such relationships do not correlate with actual compromise of judgment or patient care, it threatens the credibility of both the health care professional and the institution because of the social perception of the effect of these relationships. Although most institutions in the Western world set forth a code of ethics and conflict-of-interest policies to be followed under threat of termination, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) presents itself as a unique environment in which conflicts of interest are subject to governmental laws, violation of which may not only result in employment-related discipline, but may be sanctioned by civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these provisions are developed by a national authoritative organization rather than being institution-specific guidelines. Given that many academic physicians working within the VHA may also have a component of their practice in a University setting, it becomes important to understand the differences in policy between these contexts so as not to threaten the public trust in the veracity of decisions made and, therefore, maintain the integrity of the relationship between physician and patient.

METHODS: Pre- and post-operative cases were built in the virtual world of Second Life<e2><84><a2> according to a linear string design method. All pre- and post-operative cases were storyboarded by a colorectal surgeon in accordance with guidelines in both ERP and colorectal surgery, and reviewed by an expert in colorectal surgery. RESULTS: Four pre-operative and five post-operative cases of VP undergoing colorectal surgery were designed, including both simple and complex cases. Comments were provided through case progression to allow autonomic practice (such as ""prescribed"", ""this is not useful"" or ""the consultant does not agree with your decision""). Pre-operative cases involved knowledge in colorectal diseases and ERP such as pre-operative counseling, medical review, absence of bowel preparation in colonic surgery, absence of fasting, minimal length incision, and discharge plan. Post-operative cases involved uneventful and complicated outcomes in order to train in both simple implementation of ERP (absence of nasogastric tube, epidural analgesia, early use of oral analgesia, perioperative nutrition, early mobilization) and decision making for more complex cases.

Sr",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the new Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing. METHODS: A total of 201 consecutive patients with threatened limbs treated from 2010 to 2011 in an academic medical center were analyzed. These patients were stratified into clinical stages 1 to 4 on the basis of the SVS WIfI classification. The SVS objective performance goals of major amputation, 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS) rate, and wound healing time (WHT) according to WIfI clinical stages were compared. RESULTS: The mean age was 58 years (79% male, 93% with diabetes). Forty-two patients required major amputation (21%); 159 (78%) had limb salvage. The amputation group had a significantly higher prevalence of advanced stage 4 patients (P < .001), whereas the limb salvage group presented predominantly as stages 1 to 3. Patients in clinical stages 3 and 4 had a significantly higher incidence of amputation (P < .001), decreased AFS (P < .001), and delayed WHT (P < .002) compared with those in stages 1 and 2. Among patients presenting with stage 3, primarily as a result of wound and ischemia grades, revascularization resulted in accelerated WHT (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the underlying concept of the SVS WIfI, that an appropriate classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing. As the clinical stage progresses, the risk of major amputation increases, 1-year AFS declines, and WHT is prolonged.

METHODS: A systematic search of MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Central was completed to identify original articles reporting injury characteristics and outcomes in patients with BTAI managed nonoperatively during their index hospitalization. Article title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data abstraction were performed in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Of 2162 identified studies, 74 were included and reported on 8606 patients with BTAI who were managed nonoperatively between 1970 and 2016. Only one study was prospective. The median nonoperative sample size per study was 11 patients. The characterization of aortic injury grade differed across studies. Follow-up varied widely from 1 day to 118 months. Injury healing or improvement on follow-up imaging occurred in 34% (226 of 673 patients; reported in 37 studies), most often in the context of grade I intimal injury. Injury progression or requirement for a thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair for injury progression was 7.6% (66 of 873 patients; reported in 46 studies). A total of 37 studies reported aortic-related death, with an overall rate of 4.5% (37 of 827 patients) and a rate of 1% in grade I and II injuries (1 of 153 patients) and 18% in grade III and IV (9 of 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of reports support nonoperative management of grade I intimal injury, consistent with Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.

Results of these trials when analyzed on intent-to-treat basis often fail to resolve the issue at which they were directed. The authors have observed this in trials of abdominal aortic aneurysms with this design and use these to exemplify the dilemmas RCTs of such design create, with crossovers ranging from 27% to over 60% (EVAR II, UKSAT, ADAM, PIVOTAL). Results of these trials are frequently used as level I medical evidence and their potential impact on clinical decision making and reimbursement can be quite significant and long-lasting.

Schmitz_2009_Anofsu,JOUR,Career decisions and the structure of training: an American Board Of Colon and Rectal Surgery survey of colorectal residents,"Schmitz, Constance C. and Rothenberger, David A. and Trudel, Judith L. and Wolff, Bruce G.",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential impacts of restructuring general surgery training on colorectal (CR) surgery recruitment and expertise. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In response to the American Surgical Association Blue Ribbon Committee report on surgical education (2004), the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery, working with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Board of Surgery, established a committee (2006) to review residency training curricula and study new pathways to certification as a CR surgeon. To address concerns related to shortened general surgery residency, the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery committee surveyed recent, current, and entering CR residents on the timing and factors associated with their career choice and opinions regarding restructuring. METHODS: A 10-item, online survey of 189 CR surgeons enrolled in the class years of 2005, 2006, and 2007 was administered and analyzed May to July 2007. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five CR residents responded (77%); results were consistent across class years and types of general surgery training program. Seventy percent of respondents had rotated onto a CR service by the end of their PGY-2 year. Most identified CR as a career interest in their PGY-3 or PGY-4 year. Overall interest in CR surgery, the influence of CR mentors and teachers, and positive exposure to CR as PGY-3, PGY-4, or PGY-5 residents were the top cited factors influencing choice decisions. Respondents were opposed to restructuring by a 2:1 ratio, primarily because of concerns about inadequate training and lack of time to develop technical expertise. CONCLUSIONS: Shortening general surgery residency would not necessarily limit exposure to CR rotations and mentors unless such rotations are cut. The details of proposed restructuring are critical.",2009,10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181ad64f1,250,1,62-67,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"Education and Humans and Data Collection and Time Factors and Decision Making and Attitude of Health Personnel and Clinical Competence and Internship and Residency and *Career Choice and Mentors and Education, Medical, Graduate/*standards and Colorectal Surgery/*education and Specialties, Surgical/education",NA,NA,2009/07//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper reviews the key capabilities of AI to help surgeons understand and critically evaluate new AI applications and to contribute to new developments. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: AI is composed of various subfields that each provide potential solutions to clinical problems. Each of the core subfields of AI reviewed in this piece has also been used in other industries such as the autonomous car, social networks, and deep learning computers. METHODS: A review of AI papers across computer science, statistics, and medical sources was conducted to identify key concepts and techniques within AI that are driving innovation across industries, including surgery. Limitations and challenges of working with AI were also reviewed. RESULTS: Four main subfields of AI were defined: (1) machine learning, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) natural language processing, and (4) computer vision. Their current and future applications to surgical practice were introduced, including big data analytics and clinical decision support systems. The implications of AI for surgeons and the role of surgeons in advancing the technology to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed.

One of its most significant features is the anomalous vasculature, with a number of accessory renal arteries originating from the aorta, the mesenteric arteries, and even the iliac arteries supplying both the renal kidneys and the renal isthmus. METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify and to present the most recent data regarding classification and imaging evaluation of HSK concomitant with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of both open surgical and endovascular repair is made for management of this rare medical condition. RESULTS: The anomalous renal vasculature of HSK has led to the introduction of a number of classification systems, with Eisendrath's being currently the most commonly used. The concomitant presence of HSK in patients suffering from AAA plays a major role in preoperative planning, with a number of factors taken into consideration in deciding on either an open repair or an endovascular approach. Open repair requires careful decision-making between a transperitoneal and a left retroperitoneal approach to reach the aneurysm sac. In addition, technical points include the decision to divide the renal isthmus or not and the necessity of salvage or reimplantation of anomalous renal vessels. On the other hand, an endovascular approach requires careful preoperative imaging and evaluation of both the renal function and vasculature to decide on catheterization and salvage of accessory renal arteries or their exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant presence of AAA and HSK poses a challenge for the modern vascular surgeon, who must possess all required technical skills-both endovascular and open repair-to deal accordingly with this rarely encountered medical condition. Preoperative determination of the perfusion pattern is necessary for the treatment strategy.",2019,10.1016/j.jvs.2018.10.009,69,4,1257-1267,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Abdominal aortic aneurysm and *Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects and *Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects and Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*surgery and Endovascular and Fused Kidney/*complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and Horseshoe kidney and Open surgical repair and Renal Circulation",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The majority of surgical adverse events involve technical errors, but little is known about the nature and causes of these events. We examined characteristics of technical errors and common contributing factors among closed surgical malpractice claims. METHODS: Surgeon reviewers analyzed 444 randomly sampled surgical malpractice claims from four liability insurers. Among 258 claims in which injuries due to error were detected, 52% (n = 133) involved technical errors. These technical errors were further analyzed with a structured review instrument designed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of the technical errors caused permanent disability; an additional 16% resulted in death. Two-thirds (65%) of the technical errors were linked to manual error, 9% to errors in judgment, and 26% to both manual and judgment error. A minority of technical errors involved advanced procedures requiring special training (""index operations""; 16%), surgeons inexperienced with the task (14%), or poorly supervised residents (9%). The majority involved experienced surgeons (73%), and occurred in routine, rather than index, operations (84%). Patient-related complexities-including emergencies, difficult or unexpected anatomy, and previous surgery-contributed to 61% of technical errors, and technology or systems failures contributed to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Most technical errors occur in routine operations with experienced surgeons, under conditions of increased patient complexity or systems failure. Commonly recommended interventions, including restricting high-complexity operations to experienced surgeons, additional training for inexperienced surgeons, and stricter supervision of trainees, are likely to address only a minority of technical errors. Surgical safety research should instead focus on improving decision-making and performance in routine operations for complex patients and circumstances.",2007,10.1097/SLA.0b013e31815865f8,246,5,705-711,eng,0003-4932,Humans and Female and Male and Insurance Claim Review and Risk Factors and Injury Severity Score and Clinical Competence and United States/epidemiology and Intraoperative Complications/*epidemiology/*prevention & control and Malpractice/*statistics & numerical data and Medical Errors/legislation & jurisprudence/*prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Beck_2009_Joofvasu,JOUR,Predicting 1-year mortality after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"Beck, Adam W. and Goodney, Philip P. and Nolan, Brian W. and Likosky, Donald S. and Eldrup-Jorgensen, Jens and Cronenwett, Jack L.",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Benefit of prophylactic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair requires sufficient survival to overcome operative risk. Since death within 1 year of elective open or endovascular (EVAR) infrarenal AAA repair likely indicates ineffective treatment, we developed a prediction model for 1-year mortality to aid clinical decision-making. METHODS: We used a prospective registry of 1387 consecutive patients who had undergone elective AAA repair from 2003 to 2007 by 50 surgeons from 11 hospitals in Northern New England. Cox proportional hazards were used to analyze potential risk factors for 1-year mortality, including medical comorbidities, aortic clamp site, preoperative risk factor modification (eg, beta-blockade), and aneurysm diameter. RESULTS: Thirty-day and 1-year mortality after open repair (n = 748) was 2.3% and 5.8%, and after EVAR (n = 639) was 0.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Factors associated with death within 1-year after open repair were: age >/= 70 (P = .007; hazard ratio [HR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-6.3), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P < .0001; HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-7.0), chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine >/= 1.8) (P = .008; HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.2) and suprarenal aortic clamp site (P < .0001; HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.9-7.5). Depending on the number of risk factors present, predicted 1-year mortality after open repair varied from 1% in patients with no risk factors to 67% in patients with four risk factors. Our model demonstrated excellent correlation between observed and expected deaths (r = 0.97). For EVAR, identified risk factors for death within 1 year included a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) (P = .002; HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.5), and aneurysm diameter >/=6.5 cm (P = .04 95% CI 1.0-4.8). Depending on the number of risk factors present, predicted mortality ranged from 3.6% to 23%. A model using CHF and aneurysm diameter correlated well with actual mortality rates, with an observed to expected ratio of 0.96. CONCLUSION: Predictors of 1-year mortality can identify patients less likely to benefit from elective AAA repair. These factors differ for open repair vs EVAR and should be considered in individual patient decision-making. Our EVAR model had less impact on 1-year survival, even if CHF and large AAA diameter were present. However, a combination of age, COPD, renal insufficiency, and need for suprarenal clamping have significant impact on 1-year mortality after open AAA repair. Consideration of these variables should assist decision-making for elective AAA repair, especially in borderline cases.",2009,10.1016/j.jvs.2008.10.067,49,4,43; discussion 843-844-838,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Decision Support Techniques and Age Factors and Proportional Hazards Models and Registries and Patient Selection and Elective Surgical Procedures/mortality and Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/complications/*mortality/pathology/*surgery and Constriction and Heart Failure/complications/mortality and New England/epidemiology and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/complications/mortality and Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/mortality and Vascular Surgical Procedures/*mortality",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Itoga_2019_Joofvasu,JOUR,Association of opioid use and peripheral artery disease,"Itoga, Nathan K. and Sceats, Lindsay A. and Stern, Jordan R. and Mell, Matthew W.",Journal of vascular surgery,"BACKGROUND: Prescription opioids account for 40% of all U.S. opioid overdose deaths, and national efforts have intensified to reduce opioid prescriptions. Little is known about the relationship between peripheral artery disease (PAD) and high-risk opioid use. The objectives of this study were to evaluate this relationship and to assess the impact of PAD treatment on opiate use. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the Truven Health MarketScan database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, Mich), a deidentified national private insurance claims database, was queried to identify patients with PAD (two or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes of PAD <e2><89><a5>2 months apart, with at least 2 years of continuous enrollment) from 2007 to 2015. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was defined as the presence of rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene. The primary outcome was high opioid use, defined as two or more opioid prescriptions within a 1-year period. Multivariable analysis was used to determine risk factors for high opioid use. RESULTS: A total of 178,880 patients met the inclusion criteria, 35% of whom had CLI. Mean <c2><b1> standard deviation follow-up time was 5.3 <c2><b1> 2.1 years. An average of 24.7% of patients met the high opioid use criteria in any given calendar year, with a small but significant decline in high opioid use after 2010 (P < .01). During years of high opioid use, 5.9 <c2><b1> 5.5 yearly prescriptions were filled. A new diagnosis of PAD increased high opioid use (21.7% before diagnosis vs 27.3% after diagnosis; P < .001). A diagnosis of CLI was also associated with increased high opioid use (25.4% before diagnosis vs 34.5% after diagnosis; P < .001). Multivariable analysis identified back pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84-1.93; P < .001) and illicit drug use (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.72-2.03; P < .001) as the highest predictors of high opioid use. A diagnosis of CLI was also associated with higher risk (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.57-1.64; P < .001). A total of 43,443 PAD patients (24.3%) underwent 80,816 PAD-related procedures. After exclusion of periprocedural opioid prescriptions (4.9% of all opioid prescriptions), the yearly percentage of high opioid users increased from 25.8% before treatment to 29.6% after treatment (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD are at increased risk for high opioid use, with nearly one-quarter meeting described criteria. CLI and treatment for PAD additionally increase high opioid use.

We describe the process of creating an evidence-based selection system and examine its impact on screening efficiency, faculty perceptions, and improving representation of underrepresented minorities. METHODS: The program partnered with an expert in organizational science to identify fellowship position requirements and associated competencies. Situational judgment tests, personality profiles, structured interviews, and technical skills assessments were used to measure these competencies. The situational judgment test and personality profiles were administered online and used to identify candidates to invite for on-site structured interviews and skills testing. A final rank list was created based on all data points and their respective importance. All faculty completed follow-up surveys regarding their perceptions of the process. Candidate demographic and experience data were pulled from the application website. RESULTS: Fifty-five of 72 applicants met eligibility requirements and were invited to take the online assessment, with 50 (91%) completing it. Average time to complete was 42 <c2><b1> 12 minutes. Eighteen applicants (35%) were invited for on-site structured interviews and skills testing-a greater than 50% reduction in number of invites compared to prior years.

This study was undertaken to elucidate factors influencing career choice for these 2 groups. METHODS: All US allopathic surgery residency graduates from 2009 to 2013 (n = 5512) were surveyed by the American Board of Surgery regarding confidence, autonomy, and reasons for career selection between GS and SS. Surveys were distributed by mail in November 2013, with follow-up mailings to initial nonrespondents. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (3354) of graduates completed the survey; 26% pursued GS, and 74% SS. GS expressed greater levels of confidence than SS across the common surgical procedures queried. Confidence increased with each year after completion of residency for GS but not SS. The decision to pursue GS or SS was made during residency by 77% and 74%, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of those who chose GS indicated that a GS mentor significantly influenced their decision. GS rated procedural variety, opportunity for practice autonomy, choice of practice location, and influence of a mentor as reasons to pursue GS practice. SS listed control over scope of practice, prestige, salary, and specialty interest as reasons to pursue SF. Both groups expressed a high degree of satisfaction with their career choice (GS, 94%; SS, 90%). CONCLUSIONS: Most graduates who pursue GS practice are confident and content. The decision to pursue GS is strongly influenced by a GS mentor. Lack of confidence may be a more significant factor for choosing SS.

This study examined the availability, applicability, and overall clinical efficacy of adjunct endovascular interventions performed alongside CBT surgery and their potential in clinical decision making and clinical practice. METHODS: Studies reporting the feasibility, applicability, and clinical efficacy of adjunct endovascular interventions in the surgical management of CBTs were thoroughly searched using the Medline database from January 1967 to August 2013. RESULTS: There were no randomized studies on the efficacy of endovascular interventions in CBT surgery. Sixty studies met our inclusion criteria, reporting 465 patients (526 CBTs) with a mean age of 39.8 years. The treated CBTs were a mean size of 4.9 cm.

The relationship between non-technical teamwork skills and technical errors was studied using a behavioural marker system validated in aviation and adapted for use in surgery. METHOD: 26 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies were observed. Simultaneous assessments were made of surgical technical errors, by observation clinical human reliability assessment (OCHRA) task analysis, and non-technical performance, using the surgical NOTECHS behavioural marker system. NOTECHS assesses four categories: (1) leadership and management, (2) teamwork cooperation, (3) problem-solving and decision-making, (4) situation awareness. Each subteam (nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists) was scored separately on each of the four dimensions. Two observers - one surgical trainee and one human factors expert - were used to assess intra-rater reliability. RESULTS: The mean NOTECHS team score was 35.5 (95% C.I. +/- 1.88). The mean subteam scores for surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses were 13.3 (95% C.I. +/- 0.64), 11.4 (95% C.I. +/- 1.05), and 10.8 (95% C.I. +/- 0.87), respectively, with a significant difference between surgeons and anaesthetists (U = 197, p = 0.009), and surgeons and nurses (U = 0.134, p <or= 0.001). Inter-rater reliability was found to be strong (alpha = 0.88). There were between zero and six technical errors per operation, with a mean of 2.62 (95% C.I. +/- 0.55), which were negatively correlated with the surgeons situational awareness scores (rho = -0.718, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Non-technical skills are an important component of surgical skill, particularly in relation to the development and maintenance of a surgeon's situational awareness. Experience from other industries suggests that it may be possible to improve the ability of surgeons to manage their own situation awareness, through training, intraoperative briefings and intraoperative workload management.

In response to the question ""Would you perform a laparoscopic fundoplication in a patient with medically refractory GERD and a BMI of 'X'?"" surgeons were less likely to offer fundoplication at a higher body mass index (BMI). The majority of respondents felt that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was the best option (91 %), followed by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (6 %). Many had a morbidly obese patient with a primary surgical indication of GERD denied a bariatric procedure by their insurance company (57 %), and 35 % of those surgeons chose to do nothing rather than subject the patient to a fundoplication. Respondents uniformly felt that bariatric surgery should be recognized as a standard surgical option for treating GERD in the obese (96 %). CONCLUSION: When surgical treatment of GERD is indicated in an obese patient, bariatric surgery is the optimal approach, in the opinion of surgeons responding to our survey. Unfortunately, third-party payers often decline to provide benefits for a bariatric procedure for this indication. Additional data is necessary to confirm our belief that the opinions elicited through this survey are consistent with the standard of care as defined by the medical community.",2014,10.1007/s00464-013-3343-3,28,5,1500-1504,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Body Mass Index and Clinical Competence and *Drug Resistance and Proton Pump Inhibitors/*therapeutic use and Laparoscopy/*methods and Fundoplication/*methods and Gastric Bypass/*methods and Gastroesophageal Reflux/complications/drug therapy/*surgery and Obesity, Morbid/*complications/surgery",NA,NA,2014/05//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA

K. and Smink, D. S. and Yule, S.",The British journal of surgery,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons' non-technical skills are important for patient safety. The Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons assessment tool was developed in the UK and recently adapted to the US surgical context (NOTSS-US). The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and distribution of non-technical skill ratings given by attending (consultant) surgeons who underwent brief online training. METHODS: Attending surgeons across six specialties at a large US academic medical centre underwent a 10-min online training, then rated 60-s standardized videos of simulated operations. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and mean(s.d.) values for NOTSS-US ratings were determined for each non-technical skill category (score range 1-5, where 1 indicates poor, 3 average and 5 excellent) and for total NOTSS-US score (range 4-20; sum of 4 category scores). Outcomes were adjusted for rater characteristics including sex, specialty and clinical experience. RESULTS: A total of 8889 ratings were submitted by 81 surgeon raters on 30 simulated intraoperative videos. The mean(s.d.) total NOTSS-US score for all videos was 9<c2><b7>5(4<c2><b7>8) of 20. The within-video ICC for total NOTSS-US score was 0<c2><b7>64 (95 per cent c.i. 0<c2><b7>57 to 0<c2><b7>70).

The greater complexity of emergency surgery patients may bias outcome comparisons between elective and emergency cases. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an established risk modelling tool, the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) predicts mortality comparably for emergency and elective cases. METHODS: From the ACS-NSQIP 2011-2012 patient user files, we selected core emergency surgical cases also common to elective scenarios (gastrointestinal, vascular, and hepato-biliary-pancreatic). After matching strategy for Common Procedure Terminology (CPT) and year, we compared the accuracy of ACS-NSQIP predicted mortality probabilities using the observed-to-expected ratio (O:E), c-statistic, and Brier score. RESULTS: In all, 56,942 emergency and 136,311 elective patients were identified as having a common CPT and year. Using a 1:1 matched sample of 37,154 emergency and elective patients, the O:E ratios generated by ACS-NSQIP models differ significantly between the emergency [O:E = 1.031; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.028-1.033] and elective populations (O:E = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.77-0.80, P < 0.0001) and the c-statistics differed significantly (emergency c-statistic = 0.927; 95% CI = 0.921-0.932 and elective c-statistic = 0.887; 95% CI = 0.861-0.912, P = 0.003). The Brier score, tested across a range of mortality rates, did not differ significantly for samples with mortality rates of 6.5% and 9% (eg, emergency Brier score = 0.058; 95% CI = 0.048-0.069 versus elective Brier score = 0.057; 95% CI = 0.044-0.07, P = 0.87, among 2217 patients with 6.5% mortality).

Ouyang_2016_Surgendo,JOUR,Multiplanar MDCT measurement of esophageal hiatus surface area: association with hiatal hernia and GERD,"Ouyang, Wei and Dass, Chandra and Zhao, Huaqing and Kim, Cynthia and Criner, Gerard",Surgical endoscopy,"BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of esophageal hiatus size is clinically important, especially when antireflux surgery is planned. We present a novel method for in vivo measurement of esophageal hiatal surface area using MDCT multiplanar reconstruction. We aimed to determine whether large hiatal area is associated with hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed subjects prospectively enrolled in the COPDGene((R)) project. We created two test groups, one with hiatal hernia on chest CT and one with GERD on medical treatment identified by history without hernia. Matched control groups were formed. We performed CT postprocessing to define the double-oblique plane of the esophageal hiatus, on which the hiatal surface area is manually traced. RESULTS: Subjects with hernia (n = 48) had larger mean hiatus areas than matched controls (6.9 vs. 2.5 cm(2), p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have GERD (42 vs. 10 %, p < 0.0005). Subjects with mixed (type III) hernias had larger hiatuses compared to subjects with sliding (type I) hernias, who, in turn, had larger hiatuses than subjects without hernia (p < 0.0001). Hernia-negative subjects with GERD (n = 55) did not have significantly larger mean hiatal areas compared to matched controls (3.0 vs. 2.5 cm(2), p = 0.12). Twenty measurements obtained by two radiologists showed correlation of 0.93, with mean difference of 0.5 cm(2) (p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: We devised a method to measure in vivo esophageal hiatal surface area using MDCT reconstruction and established the normal size range for the first time. This methodology has the potential to guide decision-making in antireflux surgery technique preoperatively, and assess surgical result postoperatively. The presence of hernia correlated with large hiatuses and GERD. However, hiatal area failed to identify those with GERD in the absence of hiatal hernia.",2016,10.1007/s00464-015-4499-9,30,6,2465-2472,eng,1432-2218 0930-2794,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Case-Control Studies and ROC Curve and Organ Size and Multidetector Computed Tomography/*methods and Multidetector computed tomography and Diaphragm and Diaphragm/anatomy & histology/*diagnostic imaging and Esophageal hiatus and Esophagus/anatomy & histology/*diagnostic imaging and Gastroesophageal reflux disease and Gastroesophageal Reflux/*diagnostic imaging/surgery and Hernia, Hiatal/*diagnostic imaging and Hiatal hernia and Hiatal surface area",NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,Surg Endosc,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Assessing real-time entrustability is inherent in attending surgeons' determinations of residents' intraoperative autonomy in the operating room. To promote residents' autonomy, it is necessary to understand how attending surgeons evaluate residents' performance and support opportunities for independent practice based on the assessment of their entrustability. METHODS: We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 43 expert surgical teachers from 21 institutions across 4 regions of the United States, using purposeful and snowball sampling. Participants represented a range of program types, program size, and clinical expertise. We applied the Framework Method of content analysis to iteratively analyze interview transcripts and identify emergent themes. RESULTS: We identified a 3-phase process used by most expert surgical teachers in determining whether to take over intraoperatively or entrust the resident to proceed, including 1) monitoring performance and ""red flags,"" 2) assessing entrustability, and 3) granting autonomy. Factors associated with individual surgeons (eg, level of comfort, experience, leadership role) and the context (eg, patient safety, case, and time) influenced expert surgical teachers' determinations of entrustability and residents' final autonomy. CONCLUSION: Expert surgical teachers' 3-phase process of decisions on take-over provides a potential framework that may help surgeons identify appropriate opportunities to develop residents' progressive autonomy by engaging the resident in the determination of entrustability before deciding to take over.",2019,10.1097/SLA.0000000000002717,269,6,1080-1086,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Trust and *Internship and Residency and *Clinical Competence and *Professional Autonomy and Specialties, Surgical/*education and Faculty, Medical/*psychology",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of our study was to assess trends in the level of evidence (LOE) of abstracts presented at the Vascular Annual Meeting from 2012 to 2016. METHODS: All Vascular Annual Meeting abstracts for 2012 to 2016 were obtained through the Journal of Vascular Surgery. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts for eligibility. Research with a nonclinical focus was excluded from the study. Data extracted from eligible abstracts included study type (therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic), study size, country of academic institution of primary author, presentation type, and whether the sample was recruited or from a database. Abstracts were assigned an LOE using the 2011 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine classification scheme based on study design (eg, case series, randomized controlled trial). A <cf><87>(2) test and analysis of variance test were conducted to assess nonrandom changes in LOE during the study period. RESULTS: Of the 1403 abstracts screened, 1147 were included. Inter-rater agreement was high (<ce><ba> value for abstract screening was 0.93; <ce><ba> value for data extraction was 0.89). Therapeutic studies were the most common study type (58%), followed by prognostic studies (37%), then diagnostic studies (5%). The majority of abstracts (75.0%) were submitted from North American institutions. Overall, 0.35% of the presentations were level I evidence, 3.1% level II, 52.8% level III, 38.0% level IV, and 5.7% level V. The average LOE per year fluctuated between 3.54 and 3.32, with a mean LOE of 3.45. The proportion of high-quality evidence (level I and level II) increased in the years 2015 and 2016, representing 78% of all level I and level II abstracts presented in the 5-year period. A <cf><87>(2) test between LOE and year yielded a P value of .0084, indicating significant nonrandom change in LOE between 2012 and 2016. The majority of high LOE research was presented in poster sessions (37.5%), plenary sessions (27.5%), and international forum sessions/talks (25%) at the meeting. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, average LOE remained relatively consistent between 2012 and 2016, with most abstracts classified as level III or level IV. There was a gradual, albeit minor, increase in the proportion of level I and level II evidence in 2015 and 2016, potentially indicating the increasing commitment to producing and disseminating high-level research in vascular surgery. Furthermore, a lack of a classification tool specific to vascular surgery research occasionally presented a challenge in assigning LOE, perhaps indicating a need for such a tool in this specialty.",2018,10.1016/j.jvs.2017.10.053,67,3,951-959,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Time Factors and Chi-Square Distribution and *Information Dissemination and Vascular Surgical Procedures/*trends and Evidence-Based Medicine/*trends and Congresses as Topic/*trends and Research Design/*trends and Societies, Medical/*trends",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Complex TAADs without a feasible conventional surgical repair were prospectively evaluated by vascular surgeons of the same public health service (National Health System) located in a huge area of 22,994 km(2) with 3.7 million inhabitants and 11 tertiary hospitals. Surgeons evaluated computed tomography scans and clinical details that were placed on a web platform (Google Drive; Google, Mountain View, Calif) and shared by all surgeons. Patients gave informed consent for the teleconsultation. The surgeon who submits a case discusses in detail his or her case and proposes a possible therapeutic strategy. The other surgeons suggest other solutions and options in terms of grafts, techniques, or access to be used. Computed tomography angiography, angiography, and clinical outcomes of cases are then presented at the following telemeetings, and a final agreement of the operative strategy is evaluated. Teleconsultation is performed using a web conference service (WebConference.com; Avaya Inc, Basking Ridge, NJ) every month. An inter-rater agreement statistic was calculated, and the <ce><ba> value was interpreted according to Altman's criteria for computed tomography angiography measurements. RESULTS: The rate of participation was constant (mean number of surgeons, 11; range, 9-15). Twenty-four complex TAAD cases were discussed for planning and operation during the study period. The interobserver reliability recorded was moderate (<ce><ba> = 0.41-0.60) to good (<ce><ba> = 0.61-0.80) for measurements of proximal and distal sealing and very good (<ce><ba> = 0.81-1) for detection of any target vessel angulation >60 degrees, significant calcification (circumferential), and thrombus presence (>50%). The concordance for planning and therapeutic strategy among all participants was complete in 16 cases. In one case, the consultation was decisive for creating an innovative therapeutic strategy; in the remaining seven cases, the strategy proposed by the patient's surgeon was changed completely after the discussion. Technical success was the same (100%) if concordance in planning was present initially or not. Overall 6-month mortality was 4%, 0% for those patients with initial concordance in planning vs 12% for those without initial concordance (P = .33). Surgery was always performed in a tertiary hospital by local surgeons, and in two cases (8%) external surgeons joined the local surgical team. CONCLUSIONS: Such a regional service of teleconsultation may be of value in standardizing the treatment and derived costs of complex TAADs in a huge region under the same health provider.

Risk prediction models can provide valuable information on surgical risks, guide clinical decision making, and help identify patients who should not be operated on to prevent futile surgery. Finally, they can be used to evaluate clinical outcome. Different aneurysm scores are available. New ones (with only four parameters) are being developed, such as the Dutch Aneurysm Score (DAS). This study analyzed and compared these scoring models. METHODS: The study selected consecutive patients who presented with RAAA in two large vascular centers (Medisch Centrum Alkmaar and St. Antonius Nieuwegein) between 2005 and 2015. Variables necessary to retrospectively evaluate the scoring systems were registered in the patients' medical files. The discriminatory power and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow <cf><87>(2) test. RESULTS: The study included 347 consecutive patients with RAAA. There were 298 men (85.9%), and the mean <c2><b1> standard deviation age was 72.6 <c2><b1> 8.1 years. The receiver operating characteristic curves were developed for the DAS, Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score, Vancouver Scoring System (VSS), and Hardman Index. The area under the curve was better for the VSS (0.716; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.647-0.786) than for the other scoring systems. Areas under the curve for the DAS (0.664; 95% CI, 0.592-0.736), Hardman Index (0.664; 95% CI, 0.592-0.736), Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score (0.621; 95% CI, 0.543-0.700), and GAS (0.591; 95% CI, 0.517-0.665) were slightly smaller, although only the difference between the VSS and GAS was statistically significant. Calibration showed a good fit for all models. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the tested models for the prediction of mortality in RAAA patients was comparable, with only a statistically significant difference between the VSS and the GAS in favor of the VSS.

Totally extraperitoneal ventral hernia repair (TEVHR) facilitates dissection of the hernia sac without entering the peritoneal cavity. This study evaluates our experience of TEVHR, addressing technique, decision-making, and outcomes. METHODS: This is an IRB-approved retrospective review of open TEVHR performed between January 2012 and December 2016. Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, operative details, postoperative outcomes, hospital readmissions, and reoperations. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients underwent TEVHR (84 males, 82 females) with a mean BMI range of 30-39. Eighty-six percent of patients underwent repair for primary or first-time recurrent hernia, and 89% CDC wound class I. Median hernia defect size was 135 cm(2). Hernia repair techniques included Rives-Stoppa (34%) or transversus abdominis release (57%). Median operative time was 175 min, median blood loss 100 mL, and median length of stay 4 days. There were no unplanned bowel resections or enterotomies. Four cases required intraperitoneal entry to explant prior mesh. Wound complication rate was 27%: 9% seroma drainage, 18% superficial surgical site infection (SSI), and 2% deep space SSI. Five patients (3%) required reoperation for wound or mesh complications. Over the study, four patients were hospitalized for postoperative small bowel obstruction and managed non-operatively. Of the 166 patients, 96%, 54%, and 44% were seen at 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups, respectively. Recurrences were observed in 2% of patients at 12-month follow-up. One patient developed an enterocutaneous fistula 28 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: TEVHR is a safe alternative to traditional transabdominal approaches to ventral hernia repair.

Rothenberg_2020_Joofvasu,JOUR,Frailty as measured by the Risk Analysis Index is associated with long-term death after carotid endarterectomy,"Rothenberg, Kara A. and George, Elizabeth L. and Barreto, Nicolas and Chen, Rui and Samson, Kaeli and Johanning, Jason M. and Trickey, Amber W. and Arya, Shipra",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) continues to be debated in the age of optimal medical therapy, particularly for patients with limited life expectancy. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) measures frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve, which increases vulnerability to adverse outcomes. The RAI better predicts surgical complications, nonhome discharge, and death than age or comorbidities alone. We sought to measure the association of frailty, as measured by the RAI, with postoperative in-hospital stroke, long-term stroke, and long-term survival after CEA. We also sought to determine how postoperative stroke interacts with frailty to alter survival trajectory after CEA. METHODS: We queried the Vascular Quality Initiative CEA procedure and long-term data sets (2003-2017) for elective CEAs with complete RAI case information. For all analyses, the cohort was divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis. Scoring was defined as not frail (RAI <30), frail (RAI 30-34), and very frail (RAI <e2><89><a5>35). Mortality information through December 2017 was obtained from the Social Security Death Index. Multivariable models (logistic and Cox proportional hazards regressions) were used to study the association of frail and very frail patients with the outcomes of interest. In a post hoc analysis, we created Kaplan-Meier curves to analyze patient mortality after CEA as well as after postoperative stroke. RESULTS: Of the 42,869 included patients, 17,092 (39.9%) were female, and 38,395 (89.6%) were white. There were 25,673 (59.9%) patients assigned to the asymptomatic stenosis group and 17,196 (40.1%) patients in the symptomatic stenosis group. Frailty was not associated with perioperative or long-term postoperative stroke. The risk of long-term mortality was significantly higher for frail (hazard ratio, 1.9 [1.7-2.3]) and very frail (hazard ratio, 3.1 [2.6-3.7]) asymptomatic patients; symptomatic frail and very frail patients also had a two to three times increased risk of long-term mortality. Frail and very frail patients had two to three times the risk for long-term mortality compared with patients who were not frail. Postoperative stroke negatively affected the mortality trajectory for all patients in the cohort, regardless of frailty status. CONCLUSIONS: RAI score is not associated with postoperative stroke; however, frail and very frail status is associated with decreased long-term survival in an incremental fashion based on increasing RAI.

We examined our experience with nonoperative BTAI treatment (anti-impulse, blood pressure) and evaluated for determinants of successful outcomes. METHODS: We performed a review of our institutional prospective trauma registry database for all BTAI patients from 1999 to 2015. Computed tomography angiography was used to classify aortic injuries on the basis of severity: grade I, intimal tear; grade II, intramural hematoma; grade III, aortic pseudoaneurysm; and grade IV, free rupture. Grade IV injuries were excluded from nonoperative management. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and follow-up lesion resolution were compared within the medically managed cohort and between surgical and nonoperative groups using univariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Among 338 BTAI patients admitted between 1999 and 2015, 67 BTAI patients were managed nonoperatively; 26 (54%) had grade I BTAI, 22 (46%) had grade II, and 2 (4%) had grade III. Both grade III injuries required a late thoracic endovascular aortic repair after initial medical management and were excluded from analysis. In all, 48 were managed with initial medical therapy, and the remaining 19 died on admission or before definitive treatment. Among the 48 medically managed, the median age was 34 years, and 14 (29%) were female. Six of the 48 (12%) were transferred from other facilities. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics or early outcomes between BTAI grades. Median injury resolution time was 39 days for grade I and 62 days for grade II (P = .03). Compared with a surgical cohort, BTAI grade and Abbreviated Injury Scale score for the chest were the only significant determinants of propensity to operate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these limited data, it appears that patients with minimal aortic injuries (grades I and II) may be managed medically, with the majority resolving within 8 weeks. Minimal aortic injury is associated with low mortality and excellent intermediate-term outcomes. Further prospective studies are required to validate these findings.",2018,10.1016/j.jvs.2017.07.111,67,2,389-398,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Logistic Models and Hospital Mortality and Multivariate Analysis and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Texas and Injury Severity Score and Proportional Hazards Models and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and Registries and Propensity Score and Clinical Decision-Making and Computed Tomography Angiography and Aneurysm, Dissecting/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy and Aneurysm, False/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy and Aorta, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/*injuries and Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy and Aortic Rupture/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy and Aortography/methods and Vascular System Injuries/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy and Wounds, Nonpenetrating/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The value of team skills in reducing adverse events in the operating room is presently receiving considerable attention. Current work has not yet identified in detail how the teamwork and communication skills of surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses affect the course of an operation. METHODS: Twenty-six laparoscopic cholecystectomies and 22 carotid endarterectomies were studied using direct observation methods. For each operation, teams' skills were scored for the whole team, and for nursing, surgical, and anesthetic subteams on 4 dimensions (leadership and management [LM]; teamwork and cooperation; problem solving and decision making; and situation awareness). Operating time, errors in surgical technique, and other procedural problems and errors were measured as outcome parameters for each operation. The relationships between teamwork scores and these outcome parameters within each operation were examined using analysis of variance and linear regression. RESULTS: Surgical (F(2,42) = 3.32, P = 0.046) and anesthetic (F(2,42) = 3.26, P = 0.048) LM had significant but opposite relationships with operating time in each operation: operating time increased significantly with higher anesthetic but decreased with higher surgical LM scores. Errors in surgical technique had a strong association with surgical situation awareness (F(2,42) = 7.93, P < 0.001) in each operation. Other procedural problems and errors were related to the intraoperative LM skills of the nurses (F(5,1) = 3.96, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analysis of team interactions and dimensions is feasible and valuable, yielding important insights into relationships between nontechnical skills, technical performance, and operative duration. These results support the concept that interventions designed to improve teamwork and communication may have beneficial effects on technical performance and patient outcome.",2008,10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181642ec8,247,4,699-706,eng,0003-4932,"Communication and Humans and Leadership and Cooperative Behavior and Decision Making and Physician's Role and Treatment Outcome and Interprofessional Relations and Clinical Competence and Nurse's Role and *Task Performance and Analysis and *Medical Errors and *Patient Care Team/standards and *Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic/adverse effects/standards and *Endarterectomy, Carotid/adverse effects/standards",NA,NA,2008/04//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to evaluate and quantify AAA-specific knowledge in patients under AAA surveillance and in patients who have undergone AAA repair. METHODS: In 2013, 1373 patients from 6 U.S. institutions were mailed an AAA-specific quality of life and knowledge survey. Of these patients, 1008 (73%) returned completed surveys for analysis. The knowledge domain of the survey consisted of nine questions. An AAA knowledge score was calculated for each patient based on the proportion of questions answered correctly. The score was then compared according to sex, race, and education level. Surveillance and repaired patients were also compared. RESULTS: Among 1008 survey respondents, 351 were under AAA surveillance and 657 had AAA repair (endovascular repair, 414; open, 179; unknown, 64). The majority of patients (85%) reported that their ""doctor's office"" was their most important source of AAA information. The ""Internet"" and ""other written materials"" were each reported as the most important source of information 5% of the time with ""other patients"" reported 2% of the time. The mean AAA knowledge score was 47% (range 0%-100%; standard deviation, 23%) with a broad variation in percentage correct between questions. Thirty-two percent of respondents did not know that larger AAA size increases rupture risk, and 64% did not know that AAA runs in families. Only 15% of patients answered six or more of the nine questions correctly, and 23% of patients answered two or fewer questions correctly. AAA knowledge was significantly greater in men compared with women, whites compared with nonwhites, high school graduates compared with nongraduates, and surveillance compared with repaired patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a national survey of AAA-specific knowledge, patients demonstrated poor understanding of their condition. This may contribute to anxiety and uninformed decision making.

Furthermore, the specialty of the operating surgeon and the role of clinical decision-making are not well studied. This study compares the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) vs carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a real-world setting when the procedure is performed by fellowship-trained vascular surgeons. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all consecutive patients undergoing CEA and CAS performed by vascular surgeons in a large rural tertiary health care system from 2004 to 2014. Postoperative outcomes of stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and death were analyzed at 30 days and during the long term (median follow-up of 5.5 years for CEA and 4.8 years for CAS). Standard statistical analysis was performed. Differences in long-term outcomes were expressed as cumulative incidence functions for nondeath outcomes (stroke and AMI), which account for the high death rate in this population of vascular patients, and as Kaplan-Meier curves for death itself. RESULTS: From January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, there were 2331 carotid interventions performed (CEA, 1853; CAS, 478), all by fellowship-trained vascular surgeons. The average age of the patients was 71 years, and 63% were male, with more men in the CAS group (61.5% vs 67.8%; P = .011). Preoperatively, 30% of patients were symptomatic, and 77% of patients had high-grade stenosis in the 70% to 99% range. CEA patients were more likely to have preoperative hypertension (89.7% vs 86.2%; P = .029) and were less likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease (53.4% vs 59.4%; P = .018). There were no significant differences in 30-day outcomes between CEA and CAS (stroke, 1.1% vs 1.3% [P = .743]; AMI, 2.2% vs 1.7% [P = .474]; death, 0.7% vs 0.6% [P = .859]) or long-term outcomes (stroke, 6.8% vs 7.7% [P = .321]; AMI, 22.7% vs 21.0% [P = .886]; death, 28.4% vs 28.2% [P = .122]).

In many cases, patients are symptomatic. In symptomatic cases, management consists of angioplasty and stenting. Although therapy is often initially successful, factors associated with long-term outcome have been poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with stent patency. METHODS: The medical records of all patients who underwent iliac vein percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting from January 1996 to December 2006 for symptomatic IVCS were reviewed retrospectively. There were 50 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 42 years (median, 39 years; range, 17-71 years). Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were determined. Patient characteristics and clinical variables were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis to determine association with vein patency. RESULTS: Symptoms consisted of lower extremity swelling (81%) and lower extremity pain (67%). Iliac vein obstruction was treated with pharmacologic thrombolysis (31% of patients) and mechanical thrombus fragmentation (17% of patients). The primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of angioplasty/stenting were 74.1%, 79.7%, and 85.8% at 1 year and 38.1%, 62.8%, and 73.8% at 5 years, respectively. Using a Cox proportional risk model, male sex (hazard ratio, 6.5; P = .001), recent trauma (hazard ratio, 5.3; P = .001), and age younger than 40 years (hazard ratio, 3.8; P = .015) were associated with decreased primary patency. In the absence of any risk factors, primary patency was 94.4% at 1 year and 63.0% at 5 years, decreasing to 28.6% and 0% for two or more risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patency rates for iliac vein percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in patients with IVCS can potentially be predicted on the basis of a multivariate model. Assessing risk factors allows for patient stratification and appropriate clinical decision making. Prospective validation of these variables is necessary.",2007,10.1016/j.jvs.2007.05.048,46,4,743-749,eng,0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Survival Analysis and Stents and Angioplasty, Balloon and *Iliac Vein and Constriction, Pathologic/diagnosis/therapy and Peripheral Vascular Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*therapy",NA,NA,2007/10//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Sleep-deprived and fatigued doctors pose a safety risk to themselves and their patients. Yet, because of the around-the-clock nature of medical practice, doctors frequently care for patients after periods of extended wakefulness or during circadian troughs. Studies suggest that a group of substances may be capable of safely and effectively reversing the effects of fatigue. However, little work has been done to investigate their role within our profession. METHODS: We conducted a parallel, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of pharmacological enhancement on performance doctors. Thirty-nine healthy male resident doctors received either lactose placebo (n = 19) or modafinil 200 mg (n = 20) after 1 night of sleep deprivation. A selection of CANTAB neuropsychological tests was used to assess higher cognitive function. Clinical psychomotor performance was assessed using the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer Virtual Reality. Assessments were carried out between 6.00 AM and approximately 8.00 AM. RESULTS: Modafinil improved performance on tests of higher cognitive function; participants in the modafinil group worked more efficiently when solving working memory (F1,38 = 5.24, P = 0.028) and planning (F1,38 = 4.34, P = 0.04) problems, were less-impulsive decision makers (F1,37 = 6.76, P = 0.01), and were more able to flexibly redirect their attention (F1,38 = 4.64, P = 0.038). In contrast, no improvement was seen in tests of clinical psychomotor performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that fatigued doctors might benefit from pharmacological enhancement in situations that require efficient information processing, flexible thinking, and decision making under time pressure. However, no improvement is likely to be seen in the performance of basic procedural tasks.",2012,10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182306c99,255,2,222-227,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,Humans and Male and Adult and Analysis of Variance and Computer Simulation and Double-Blind Method and Physicians/psychology and Modafinil and Cognition/*drug effects and *Internship and Residency and Work Schedule Tolerance and Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects and Decision Making/drug effects and Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Central Nervous System Stimulants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Sleep Deprivation/*drug therapy,NA,NA,2012/02//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aside from clinical factors, this decision may be associated with surgeon and patient characteristics. We investigated the effect of surgeon characteristics on the BCS rate. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify women >65 years, diagnosed with stages I-II BC, between 1991 and 2002, and used the Physician Unique Identification Number linked to the American Medical Association Masterfile to obtain information on surgeons. We investigated the association of patient demographic, tumor, and surgeon-related factors with receipt of BCS, using Generalized Estimating Equations to control for clustering. RESULTS: Of 56,768 women with breast cancer, 30,006 (53%) underwent BCS, whereas 26,762 (47%) underwent mastectomy. Between 1991 and 2002, the proportion of patients undergoing BCS increased from 35% to 60%. In a multivariate analysis, patients who received BCS were younger, of higher SES, and had more favorable tumor characteristics. They were also more likely to be black and live in metropolitan areas. Women who underwent BCS were more likely to have surgeons who were female (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.25-1.55), US-trained (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02-1.22), with a larger patient panel (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.21-1.39), and completed training after 1975 (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08-1.25), than surgeons of patients who underwent mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon characteristics, such as gender, training, year of graduation, and volume, are small but significant independent predictor of BCS.

We developed a registry to track patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in an integrated health care system, leveraging an electronic medical record (EMR) to evaluate clinical practices, device performance, surgical complications, and medium-term outcomes. This study describes the registry design, data collection, outcomes validation, and ongoing surveillance, highlighting the unique integration with the EMR. METHODS: EVARs in six geographic regions of Kaiser Permanente were entered in the registry. Cases were imported using a screening algorithm of inpatient codes applied to the EMR. Standard note templates containing data fields were used for surgeons to enter preoperative, postoperative, and operative data as part of normal workflows in the operating room and clinics. Clinical content experts reviewed cases and entered any missing data of operative details. Patient comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, implant details, and surgical outcomes were captured. Patients entered in the registry are followed up for life, and all relevant events are captured. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and June 2013, 2112 procedures were entered in the registry. Surgeon compliance with data entry ranges from 60% to 90% by region but has steadily increased over time. Mean aneurysm size was 5.9 cm (standard deviation, 1.3). Most patients were male (84%), were hypertensive (69%), or had a smoking history (79%). The overall reintervention rate was 10.8%: conversion to open repair (0.9%), EVAR revision (2.6%), other surgical intervention (7.3%). Of the reinterventions, 27% were for endoleaks (I, 34.3%; II, 56.9%; III, 8.8%; IV and V, 0.0%), 10.5% were due to graft malfunction, 3.4% were due to infection, and 2.3% were due to rupture. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging an EMR provides a robust platform for monitoring short-term and midterm outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Use of standardized templates in the EMR allows data entry as part of normal workflow, improving compliance, accuracy, and data capture using limited but expert personnel. Assessment of patient demographics, device performance, practice variation, and postoperative outcomes benefits clinical decision-making by providing complete and adjudicated event reporting.

Jason and Singh, Michael J. and Veeraswamy, Ravi K. and Wang, Grace J.",Journal of vascular surgery,"Thoracic aortic diseases, including disease of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA), are significant causes of death in the United States. Open repair of the DTA is a physiologically impactful operation with relatively high rates of mortality, paraplegia, and renal failure. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has revolutionized treatment of the DTA and has largely supplanted open repair because of lower morbidity and mortality. These Society for Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines are applicable to the use of TEVAR for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) as well as for other rarer pathologic processes of the DTA. Management of aortic dissections and traumatic injuries will be discussed in separate Society for Vascular Surgery documents. In general, there is a lack of high-quality evidence across all TAA diseases, highlighting the need for better comparative effectiveness research. Yet, large single-center experiences, administrative databases, and meta-analyses have consistently reported beneficial effects of TEVAR over open repair, especially in the setting of rupture. Many of the strongest recommendations from this guideline focus on imaging before, during, or after TEVAR and include the following: In patients considered at high risk for symptomatic TAA or acute aortic syndrome, we recommend urgent imaging, usually computed tomography angiography (CTA) because of its speed and ease of use for preoperative planning. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). If TEVAR is being considered, we recommend fine-cut (<e2><89><a4>0.25 mm) CTA of the entire aorta as well as of the iliac and femoral arteries. CTA of the head and neck is also needed to determine the anatomy of the vertebral arteries. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). We recommend routine use of three-dimensional centerline reconstruction software for accurate case planning and execution in TEVAR. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning at 1 month and 12 months after TEVAR and then yearly for life, with consideration of more frequent imaging if an endoleak or other abnormality of concern is detected at 1 month. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). Finally, based on our review, in patients who could undergo either technique (within the criteria of the device's instructions for use), we recommend TEVAR as the preferred approach to treat elective DTA aneurysms, given its reduced morbidity and length of stay as well as short-term mortality. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). Given the benefits of TEVAR, treatment using a minimally invasive approach is largely based on anatomic eligibility rather than on patient-specific factors, as is the case in open TAA repair. Thus, for isolated lesions of the DTA, TEVAR should be the primary method of repair in both the elective and emergent setting based on improved short-term and midterm mortality as well as decreased morbidity.",2021,10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.076,73,1S,55S-83S,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Treatment Outcome and Clinical Decision-Making and Societies, Medical/*standards and Specialties, Surgical/*standards and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/standards and Aftercare/methods/*standards and Aorta, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnosis/*surgery and Elective Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods/standards and Emergency Treatment/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods/standards and Endoleak/diagnosis/etiology and Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods/*standards",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This analysis is intended to support decision making on the size of future fellowships in pediatric surgery. METHODS: The model used in the study is an adaptation of the FutureDocs physician supply and need tool developed to anticipate future supply and need for all physician specialties. Data from national inventories of physicians by specialty, age, sex, activity, and location are combined with data from residency and fellowship programs and accrediting bodies in an agent-based or microsimulation projection model that considers movement into and among specialties. Exits from practice and the geographic distribution of physician and the patient population are also included in the model. Three scenarios for the annual entry into pediatric surgery fellowships (28, 34, and 56) are modeled and their effects on supply through 2030 are presented. RESULTS: The FutureDocs model predicts a very rapid growth of the supply of surgeons who treat pediatric patients-including general pediatric surgeon and focused subspecialties. The supply of all pediatric surgeons will grow relatively rapidly through 2030 under current conditions. That growth is much faster than the rate of growth of the pediatric population. The volume of complex surgical cases will likely match this population growth rate meaning there will be many more surgeons trained for those procedures. The current entry rate into pediatric surgery fellowships (34 per year) will result in a slowing of growth after 2025, a rate of 56 will generate a continued growth through 2030 with a likely plateau after 2035. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of entry into pediatric surgery will continue to exceed population growth through 2030 under two likely scenarios. The very rapid anticipated growth in focused pediatric subspecialties will likely prove challenging to surgeons wishing to maintain their skills with complex cases as a larger and more diverse group of surgeons will also seek to care for many of the conditions and patients which the general pediatric surgeons and general surgeons now see. This means controlling the numbers of pediatric surgery fellowships in a way that recognizes problems with distribution, the volume of cases available to maintain proficiency, and the dynamics of retirement and shifts into other specialty practice.",2017,10.1097/SLA.0000000000001810,265,3,609-615,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Forecasting and Predictive Value of Tests and Models, Statistical and Career Choice and Health Services Needs and Demand/*trends and Education, Medical, Graduate/organization & administration and Specialties, Surgical/education and Pediatrics/*education/trends and Surgeons/*education/*supply & distribution",NA,NA,2017/03//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Identifying patients at risk of regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) is crucial for long-term survival after local resection. METHODS: Patients after oncological resection of T1 rectal cancer were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results register 2004-2012. Potential predictors of LNM and its impact on cancer-specific survival were assessed in logistic and Cox regression with and without multivariable adjustment. RESULTS: In total, 1593 patients with radical resection of T1 rectal cancer and a minimum of 12 retrieved regional lymph nodes were identified. The overall LNM rate was 16.3 % (N = 260). A low risk of LNM was observed for small tumor size (P = 0.002), low tumor grade (P = 0.002) and higher age (P = 0.012) in multivariable analysis. The odds ratio for a tumor size exceeding 1.5 cm was 1.49 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.13], for G2 and G3/G4 carcinomas 1.69 (95 % CI 1.07-2.82) and 2.72 (95 % CI 1.50-5.03), and for 65- to 79-year-old and over 80-year-old patients 0.65 (95 % CI 0.43-0.96) and 0.39 (95 % CI 0.18-0.77), respectively. Five-year cancer-specific survival for patients with LNM was 90.0 % (95 % CI 85.3-95.0 %) and for patients without LNM 97.1 % (95 % CI 95.9-98.2 %, hazard ratio = 3.21, 95 % CI 1.82-5.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based analysis, favorable cancer-specific survival rates were observed in nodal-negative and nodal-positive T1 rectal cancer patients after primary radical resection.

Among endovascular treatment options for FPOD, covered stent placement has become increasingly used. We sought to examine the influence of clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics on the clinical performance of these devices. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of consecutively treated limbs that underwent Viabahn (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) stent graft placement for FPOD from 2005 to 2010. Clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics were obtained from review of medical records and angiograms. End points were occurrence of any reintervention, major adverse limb event (eg, major amputation, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, or open bypass surgery), or thrombolysis/thrombectomy treatment alone. Univariate predictors were calculated and multivariate models constructed for each clinical end point using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The study cohort included 87 limbs in 77 unique patients, with a median follow-up time of 382 days. The indication for intervention was claudication in 56%. In 25 cases (29%), the index procedure was a secondary intervention for FPOD, including treatment of in-stent restenosis in 22 cases (25%). Lesions treated included 45% TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II D and 58% chronic total occlusions. The observed Kaplan-Meier 1-year event rates for reintervention, major adverse limb event (MALE), and thrombolysis were 43%, 28%, and 17%, respectively. MALE occurred in 18 patients, nine of whom presented with acute limb ischemia; no patient underwent major amputation. Univariate predictors of negative outcomes included lack of dual-antiplatelet usage, advanced TASC II classification, smaller implant diameter, increased number of devices used, longer total implant length, and coverage of a patent distal collateral vessel. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of dual-antiplatelet usage was protective against all three outcomes, 5-mm device diameter was a risk factor for both reintervention and MALE, and the use of multiple devices and distal collateral coverage were significant risk factors for thrombolysis events. CONCLUSIONS: Reintervention is common in the first year after Viabahn placement for FPOD, with more than half of the events being a MALE. Procedural factors such as antiplatelet therapy, stent graft diameter, implant length/number, and distal collateral coverage are strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. These factors should be carefully considered to optimize patient selection and intraoperative decision making for this procedure.",2012,10.1016/j.jvs.2012.03.010,56,4,"1006, 1007.e1; discussion 1006-1007-998",eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Treatment Failure and *Stents and *Femoral Artery and *Popliteal Artery and Arterial Occlusive Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*therapy and Graft Occlusion, Vascular/etiology and Vascular Grafting/adverse effects/*instrumentation",NA,NA,2012/10//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently the standard of care for staging the axilla in patients with clinical T1-T2, N0 breast cancer. AUS is a noninvasive alternative to SLNB for staging the axilla. METHODS: Patients were identified using a prospectively maintained database. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by comparing AUS findings to pathology results. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient and/or tumor characteristics associated with false negative (FN) AUS. A blinded review of FN and matched true negative cases was performed by 2 independent medical oncologists to compare treatment recommendations and actual treatment received. Recurrence-free survival was described using Kaplan-Meier product limit methods. RESULTS: A total of 647 patients with clinical T1-T2, N0 breast cancer underwent AUS between January 2008 and March 2013. AUS had a sensitivity of 70%, NPV of 84%, and PPV of 56% for the detection of ALN disease. For detection of clinically significant disease (>2.0 mm), AUS had a sensitivity of 76% and NPV of 89%. FN AUS did not significantly impact adjuvant medical decision making. Patients with FN AUS had recurrence-free survival equivalent to patients with pathologic N0 disease. CONCLUSIONS: AUS accurately excludes clinically significant ALN disease in patients with clinical T1-T2, N0 breast cancer.

This study highlights the effect of CKD on outcomes after endovascular AAA (EVAR) and OAR in contemporary practice. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use File (2005-2008) was queried by Current Procedural Terminology (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) code to identify EVAR or OAR patients, who were grouped by CKD class as having mild (CKD class 1 or 2), moderate (CKD class 3), or severe (CKD class 4 or 5) renal disease. Propensity score analysis was performed to match OAR and EVAR patients with mild CKD with those with moderate or severe CKD. Comparative analysis of mortality and clinical outcomes was performed based on CKD strata. RESULTS: We identified 8701 patients who were treated with EVAR (n = 5811) or OAR (n = 2890) of intact AAAs. Mild, moderate, and severe CKD was present in 63%, 30%, and 7%, respectively. CKD increased (P < .01) overall mortality, with rates of 1.7% (mild), 5.3% (moderate), and 7.7% (severe) in unmatched patients undergoing EVAR or OAR. Operative mortality rates in patients with severe CKD were as high as 6.2% for EVAR and 10.3% for OAR. Severity of CKD was associated with increasing frequency of risk factors; therefore, propensity matching to control for comorbidities was performed, resulting in similar baseline clinical and demographic features of patients with mild compared with those with moderate or severe disease. In propensity-matched cohorts, moderate CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (1.9% mild vs 3.2% moderate; P = .013) and OAR (3.1% mild vs 8.4% moderate; P < .0001). Moderate CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (8.3% mild vs 12.8% moderate; P < .0001) or OAR (25.2% mild vs 32.4% moderate; P = .001). Similarly, severe CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (2.6% mild vs 5.7% severe; P = .0081) and OAR (4.1% mild vs 9.9% severe; P = .0057). Severe CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (10.6% mild vs 19.2% severe; P < .0001) or OAR (31.1% mild vs 39.6% severe; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of moderate or severe CKD in patients considered for AAA repair is associated with significantly increased mortality and therefore should figure prominently in clinical decision making. The high mortality of AAA repair in patients with severe CKD is such that elective repair in such patients is not advised, except in extenuating clinical circumstances.",2012,10.1016/j.jvs.2012.04.037,56,5,1206-1213,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Severity of Illness Index and Postoperative Complications/*mortality and Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/*complications/*surgery and Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*complications",NA,NA,2012/11//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study sought to identify predictors of SSI after LEB for arterial occlusive disease and also potential modifiable factors to improve outcomes. METHODS: Data from a statewide cardiovascular consortium of 35 hospitals were used to obtain demographic, procedural, and hospital risk factors for patients undergoing elective or urgent open LEB between January 2012 and June 2015. Bivariate comparisons and targeted maximum likelihood estimation were used to identify independent risk factors of SSI. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, and hospital-level factors. RESULTS: Our study population included 3033 patients who underwent 703 femoral-femoral bypasses, 1431 femoral-popliteal bypasses, and 899 femoral-distal vessel bypasses. An SSI was diagnosed in 320 patients (10.6%) <e2><89><a4>30 days after the index operation. Adjusted patient and procedural predictors of SSI included renal failure currently requiring dialysis (OR, 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.45-5.47; P < .001), hypertension (OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 2.74-6.72; P < .001), body mass index <e2><89><a5>25 kg/m(2) (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.23-2.57; P = .002), procedural time >240 minutes (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.89-4.62; P < .001), and iodine-only skin preparation (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.91; P = .04).

N.",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: An evidence-based consensus for a female-specific intervention threshold for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is missing. This study aims to analyze sex-related differences in the epidemiology of ruptured AAA to establish an intervention threshold for women. METHODS: The Dutch Surgical Aneurysm Audit (DSAA) is a compulsory, nation-wide registry of AAA repairs in The Netherlands. All patients with emergency or elective AAA repair between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, were included in the analysis. The main outcomes were age, sex, AAA diameter at time of rupture, and 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1561 ruptured AAA repairs (14.7% women) and 7063 cases of elective AAA repair (13.7% women) were included in the analysis. Women had significantly smaller mean <c2><b1> standard deviation AAA diameter at time of rupture than men; 70.5 <c2><b1> 14.4 mm and 78.6 <c2><b1> 17.5 mm, respectively. In male patients, 8% of ruptures occurred at diameters below the 55 mm intervention threshold. The female equivalent of this eighth percentile is 52 mm. Female patients had significantly higher 30-day mortality after emergency repair, namely, 33% for women versus 24.2% for men, but were also significantly older, mean <c2><b1> standard deviation age 76.7 <c2><b1> 7.1 years and 73.9 <c2><b1> 8.3 years for women and men, respectively. Correcting for age reduced the 30-day mortality risk for women after ruptured AAA repair from 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.04) to 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.73). Outcome after open elective repair was significantly worse for women compared with men, with a 30-day mortality of 7.97% 30 for women and 4.27% for men (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The equivalent of the 55-mm intervention threshold for elective endovascular AAA repair in men is 52 mm in women. The almost doubled mortality risk for elective open repair in women implies that the optimal point for open repair is at higher diameters, very possibly at least 55 mm.",2018,10.1016/j.jvs.2017.07.123,67,3,735-739,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Sex Factors and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Medical Audit and Registries and Patient Selection and Netherlands and Emergencies and Elective Surgical Procedures and Clinical Decision-Making and *Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/mortality and *Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/mortality and Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery and Aortic Rupture/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hassan and Powell, Richard J. and Reed, Amy B. and Schanzer, Andres and Sidawy, Anton N.",Journal of vascular surgery,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.",2015,10.1016/j.jvs.2014.12.009,61,3 Suppl,2S-41S,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,Humans and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Severity of Illness Index and Patient Selection and Asymptomatic Diseases and Lower Extremity/*blood supply and Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/*standards and Intermittent Claudication/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapy and Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapy and Vascular Patency and Vascular Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/*standards,NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched, along with reference lists of relevant articles, without language restriction, to September 2012. Original studies were selected that reported the performance of procalcitonin alone or in combination with CRP or WBC in diagnosing appendicitis. Test performance characteristics were summarized using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and bivariable random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven qualifying studies (1011 suspected cases, 636 confirmed) from seven countries were identified. Bivariable pooled sensitivity and specificity were 33 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 21 to 47) and 89 (78 to 95) per cent respectively for procalcitonin, 57 (39 to 73) and 87 (58 to 97) per cent for CRP, and 62 (47 to 74) and 75 (55 to 89) per cent for WBC. ROC curve analysis showed that CRP had the highest accuracy (area under ROC curve 0<c2><b7>75, 95 per cent c.i. 0<c2><b7>71 to 0<c2><b7>78), followed by WBC (0<c2><b7>72, 0<c2><b7>68 to 0<c2><b7>76) and procalcitonin (0<c2><b7>65, 0<c2><b7>61 to 0<c2><b7>69). Procalcitonin was found to be more accurate in diagnosing complicated appendicitis, with a pooled sensitivity of 62 (33 to 84) per cent and specificity of 94 (90 to 96) per cent. CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin has little value in diagnosing acute appendicitis, with lower diagnostic accuracy than CRP and WBC. However, procalcitonin has greater diagnostic value in identifying complicated appendicitis.

To further inform diagnostic evaluation and decision making, we evaluated anatomic findings, procedural management, and amputation-free survival in an institutional cohort of patients with AFI. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral upper extremity angiography for AFI were identified. Clinical, laboratory, and procedural data were collected retrospectively from medical records, and arteriograms were reviewed to characterize anatomic findings. Telephone interviews were used to determine long-term outcomes, and additional symptomatic assessments (Symptom Severity and Functional Status scale, the Cold Sensitivity Severity scale, and the McGill Pain Severity Scale) were available in a subgroup of patients. Outcomes included anatomic findings, use of thrombolysis, complications, and amputation-free survival. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were used to evaluate results. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (54% women) were analyzed with a median follow-up of 13.7 months. Symptom duration at time of presentation ranged from 1 to 28 days, and seven patients had tissue loss or gangrene, or both. Mean age was 47.7 <c2><b1> 12.2 years. Baseline characteristics included smoking in 22 (65%), connective tissue disorder in 11 (31%), and history of repetitive hand trauma in 10 (29%). The most frequent anatomic location of arterial pathology identified during angiography was distal to the wrist (n = 32), including eight ulnar/radial aneurysms; upper arm (n = 3) and forearm (n = 8) lesions were less common. Sixteen patients were treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis, of which eight (50%) had interval anatomic improvement on repeat angiography. Procedure-related adverse events associated with angiography included bleeding (n = 3) and pseudoaneurysm (n = 1). Eleven of 35 patients had subsequent surgical revascularization at a median of 15 days after angiography. Estimated (standard error) amputation-free survival was 0.88 (0.07) at 1 month and 0.84 (0.08) at 6 months among patients without tissue loss or gangrene. Estimated 60-day amputation-free survival was 0.84 (standard error, 0.08). Overall amputation-free survival was similar between patients managed with vs without thrombolysis (P = .61), but subgroup analysis of those patients without tissue loss or gangrene at the time of presentation revealed a trend toward improved amputation-free survival with use of thrombolysis, with 60-day amputation-free survival of 0.92 vs 0.75 (P = .12). Persistent late symptoms were present in 17 patients (48.6%) at the last follow-up and were generally characterized as mild by functional and pain scale assessments.

This study assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy compared with appendicectomy in patients with non-perforated appendicitis. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted for randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy in patients with non-perforated appendicitis. Key outcomes were analysed using random-effects meta-analysis, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Five studies including 1116 patients reported major complications in 25 (4<c2><b7>9 per cent) of 510 patients in the antibiotic and 41 (8<c2><b7>4 per cent) of 489 in the appendicectomy group: risk difference -2<c2><b7>6 (95 per cent c.i. -6<c2><b7>3 to 1<c2><b7>1) per cent (low-quality evidence). Minor complications occurred in 11 (2<c2><b7>2 per cent) of 510 and 61 (12<c2><b7>5 per cent) of 489 patients respectively: risk difference -7<c2><b7>2 (-18<c2><b7>1 to 3<c2><b7>8) per cent (very low-quality evidence).

Within 1 year, appendicitis recurred in 114 of 510 patients in the antibiotic group: pooled estimate 22<c2><b7>6 (15<c2><b7>6 to 30<c2><b7>4) per cent (high-quality evidence). For every 100 patients with non-perforated appendicitis, initial antibiotic therapy compared with prompt appendicectomy may result in 92 fewer patients receiving surgery within the first month, and 23 more experiencing recurrent appendicitis within the first year.

An expected 5-year postoperative survival is one of the main selection criteria. The aim of this study was the development of a score for predicting survival of asymptomatic patients after CEA. METHODS: Our score was derived from a retrospective analysis of 648 consecutive asymptomatic patients from a single hospital. External validation of the score was then performed on a second cohort of 334 asymptomatic patients from two different hospitals in the same area. Factors associated with reduced postoperative survival within the derivation cohort (DC) were identified and tested for statistical significance. Each selected factor was assigned a score proportional to its <ce><b2> coefficient: 1 point for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and lack of statin treatment; 4 points for age 70 to 79 years and creatinine concentration <e2><89><a5>1.5 mg/dL; 8 points for age <e2><89><a5>80 years and dialysis. The DC was divided into four groups based on individual scores: group 1, 0 to 3 points; group 2, 4 to 7 points; group 3, 8 to 11 points; and group 4, <e2><89><a5>12 points. Group-specific survival curves were calculated. The validation cohort (VC) was stratified according to the score. Survival of each of the four risk groups within the VC was compared with its analogue from the DC. RESULTS: Median follow-up of the DC and VC was, respectively, 56 and 65 months. Intercohort comparison of 5-year survival was 84.7% <c2><b1> 1.7% vs 85.2% <c2><b1> 2% (P = .41). Group-specific 5-year survival within the DC was 97% <c2><b1> 1.5% (group 1), 88.4% <c2><b1> 2.2% (group 2), 69.6% <c2><b1> 4.7% (group 3), and 48.1% <c2><b1> 13.5% (group 4; P < .0001).

BACKGROUND: Surgeons generally believe they confirm the patient's commitment to an operation and all ensuing postoperative care, before surgery. How surgeons get buy-in and whether patients participate in this agreement is unknown. METHODS: We used purposive sampling to identify 3 surgeons from different subspecialties who routinely perform high-risk operations at each of 3 distinct medical centers (Toronto, Ontario; Boston, Massachusetts; Madison, Wisconsin). We recorded preoperative conversations with 3 to 7 patients facing high-risk surgery with each surgeon (n = 48) and used content analysis to analyze each preoperative conversation inductively. RESULTS: Surgeons conveyed the gravity of high-risk operations to patients by emphasizing the operation is ""big surgery"" and that a decision to proceed invoked a serious commitment for both the surgeon and the patient. Surgeons were frank about the potential for serious complications and the need for intensive care. They rarely discussed the use of prolonged life-supporting treatment, and patients' questions were primarily confined to logistic or technical concerns. Surgeons regularly proceeded through the conversation in a manner that suggested they believed buy-in was achieved, but this agreement was rarely forged explicitly. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons who perform high-risk operations communicate the risks of surgery and express their commitment to the patient's survival. However, they rarely discuss prolonged life-supporting treatments explicitly and patients do not discuss their preferences.

BACKGROUND: FAST and CT scans undertaken by attending radiologists contribute to surgical decision making for battlefield casualties at the Joint Force, Role 3 Medical Treatment Facility at Camp Bastion (R3), Afghanistan. METHODS: Registry data for abdominally injured casualties treated at R3 from July to November 2012 were matched to radiological and surgical records to determine diagnostic accuracy for FAST and CT and their influence on casualty management. RESULTS: A total of 468 casualties met inclusion criteria, of whom 85.0% underwent FAST and 86.1% abdominal CT; 159 (34.0%) had abdominal injuries. For detection of intra-abdominal injury, FAST sensitivity (Sn) was 0.56, specificity (Sp) 0.98, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.87, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.90, and accuracy (Acc) 0.89. For CT, Sn was 0.99, Sp 0.99, PPV 0.96, NPV 1.00, and Acc 0.99. Forty-six solid organ injuries were identified in 38 patients by CT; 17 were managed nonoperatively.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of patients who had undergone surgery for renovascular hypertension from 2010 to 2018 at our center under the care of a multidisciplinary team. The operative interventions included mesenteric artery growth improves circulation (MAGIC), tissue expander-stimulated lengthening of arteries (TESLA), aortic bypass using polytetrafluorethylene, renal artery reimplantation, and autotransplantation. The MAGIC procedure uses the meandering mesenteric artery as a free conduit for aortic bypass. The TESLA procedure is based on lengthening the normal distal aorta and iliac arteries by gradual filling of a retroaortic tissue expander for several weeks, followed by resection of the stenotic aorta and subsequent primary reconstruction. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were identified, 10 with isolated renal artery stenosis, 26 with MAS, and 3 with systemic inflammatory vasculitis. The median age at presentation and surgery was 6.4 years (range, 0-16.3 years) and 9.3 years (range, 0-9.2 years), respectively. The MAS-associated syndromes included neurofibromatosis type 1 (15.4%) and Williams syndrome (5.1%), although most cases were idiopathic. At surgery, 33.3% had had stage 1 hypertension (HTN), 53.8% stage 2 HTN, and 12.8% normal blood pressure with a median of three antihypertensive medications. Follow-up of 37 patients at a median of 2.5 years demonstrated normal blood pressure in 86.1%, stage 1 HTN in 8.3%, and stage 2 HTN in 5.6%, with a median of one antihypertensive medication for the entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of vascular involvement leading to renovascular hypertension in children are variable and complex, requiring thoughtful multidisciplinary planning and surgical decision-making.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: RB has been suggested as a method to improve patient comprehension when obtaining informed consent. In this technique, patients are asked to recount what they have been told in the informed consent discussion. Despite preliminary data, this practice has not been evaluated in any large scale study. METHODS: This study was conducted in 7 Veterans Health Administration Medical Centers where informed consent is obtained using iMedConsent, the VA's computer based platform. Patients scheduled for elective surgeries were randomized to RB (a module added to the iMedConsent package) or standard iMedConsent (no RB). Comprehension was tested after the informed consent using procedure-specific questionnaires. Time stamps in the iMedConsent program estimated the time spent completing the informed consent process. Provider and patient satisfaction were measured using 5-point Likert scales. Statistical comparisons of groups were performed using t-tests and chi tests. RESULTS: A total of 575 patients were enrolled. In the RB group, providers spent 2.6 minutes longer (P < 0.0001) obtaining informed consent. The mean comprehension score was significantly higher in the RB group (71.4%) versus the no RB group (68.2%, P = 0.03); the effect was greatest in carotid endarterectomy patients (RB = 73.4% vs. no RB = 67.7%, P = 0.02). Quality of decision making was rated similarly. Providers were neutral to slightly favorable regarding RB.

The purpose of this project was to create a nationally endorsed consensus statement for CPM in women with unilateral breast cancer using modified Delphi consensus methodology. METHODS: A nationally representative expert panel of 19 general surgeons, 2 plastic surgeons, 2 medical oncologists, 2 radiation oncologists, and 1 psychologist was invited to participate in the generation of a consensus statement. Thirty-nine statements were created in 5 topic domains: predisposing risk factors for breast cancer, tumor factors, reconstruction/symmetry issues, patient factors, and miscellaneous factors. Panelists were asked to rate statements on a 7-point Likert scale. Two electronic rounds of iterative rating and feedback were anonymously completed, followed by an in-person meeting. Consensus was reached when there was at least 80% agreement. RESULTS: Our panelists did not recommend for average risk women with unilateral breast cancer. The panel recommended CPM for women with a unilateral breast cancer and previous Mantle field radiation or a BrCa1/2 gene mutation. The panel agreed that CPM could be considered by the surgeon on an individual basis for: women with unilateral breast cancer and a genetic mutation in the CHEK2/PTEN/p53/PALB2/CDH1 gene, and in women who may have significant difficulty achieving symmetry after unilateral mastectomy.

X. and Swerdlow, Nicholas J. and Li, Chun and Wyers, Mark C. and Schermerhorn, Marc L.",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has emerged as an alternative to transfemoral carotid artery stenting (tfCAS). We investigated the proportion of carotid arteries undergoing revascularization procedures that would be eligible for TCAR based on anatomic criteria and how many arteries at high anatomic risk for tfCAS would be amenable to TCAR. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting between 2012 and 2015. Patients were excluded if computed tomography angiography of the neck was not performed within 6 months of the procedure. We assessed TCAR eligibility on the basis of the instructions for use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System (Silk Road Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif) and high anatomic risk for tfCAS on the basis of anatomic factors known to make carotid cannulation more difficult or hazardous. RESULTS: Of the 118 patients and 236 carotid arteries identified, 12 carotid arteries were excluded for presence of an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA). Of the remaining 224 carotid arteries, 72% were eligible for TCAR on the basis of the instructions for use criteria; 100% had 4- to 9-mm ICA diameters, 100% had <e2><89><a5>6-mm common carotid artery (CCA) diameter, 75% had <e2><89><a5>5-cm clavicle to carotid bifurcation distance, and 96% lacked significant CCA puncture site plaque. In addition, 7% of carotid arteries had bifurcation anatomy unfavorable for stenting; thus, of the entire cohort of arteries examined, 68% were eligible for TCAR. Hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-26; P < .01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.3; P < .01), and older age (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1; P < .01) were independently associated with TCAR ineligibility, whereas white race (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0; P = .048) and beta-blocker use (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P < .01) were independently associated with TCAR eligibility. In addition, 24% of carotid arteries were considered to be at high risk for tfCAS for the presence of a type III aortic arch (7.6%), severe aortic calcification (3.3%), tandem CCA lesions (7.1%), moderate to severe stenosis at the carotid ostium (8.9%), and tortuous distal ICA precluding embolic filter placement (4.5%).

It has also been suggested that repair of large-diameter AAAs may incur worse outcomes. We sought to examine differences in patient selection, operative outcomes, and survival after elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) based on AAA diameter thresholds. METHODS: Elective EVARs for asymptomatic AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative were studied from 2003 to 2017. AAAs were classified by diameter as small (<5 cm in women, <5.5 cm in men), medium (5-6.5 cm in women, 5.5-6.5 cm in men), and large (<e2><89><a5>6.5 cm). Patient characteristics and operative factors were compared using univariate analyses and established risk prediction models. Effects of AAA diameter on reintervention and mortality were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 22,975 patients undergoing EVAR, 41% (9353), 47% (10,842), and 12% (2780) had small, medium, and large AAAs, respectively. Patients with small AAAs were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Consequently, patients with small AAAs were more likely to have low predicted operative mortality risk and 5-year mortality risk based on risk models (P < .001 for both). For operative outcomes, 30-day mortality was significantly different across diameter categories (small, 0.4%; medium, 0.9%; large, 1.6%; P < .001). EVAR for large AAAs had the highest rates of multiple medical complications, including myocardial infarction (P < .001), respiratory complications (P = .001), and renal complications (P < .001). In contrast, EVAR for small AAAs had the lowest rates of type I endoleak at completion and reoperation during index hospitalization, shortest operative times, and shortest hospital length of stay (P < .001 for all). Aneurysm diameter was associated with differential 1-year reintervention-free survival (92% small vs 89% medium vs 82% large; P < .001) and 5-year overall survival (88% small vs 81% medium vs 75% large; P < .001). Multivariable models showed that compared with medium AAAs, small AAAs had an independent protective effect against 1-year reintervention or death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; P = .003) and 5-year mortality (HR, 0.78; P = .001). Conversely, compared with medium AAAs, large AAAs carried an independent increased risk of 1-year reintervention or death (HR, 1.75; P < .001) and 5-year mortality (HR, 1.50; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Small AAAs represent >40% of elective EVARs in the Vascular Quality Initiative. Patients with small AAAs selected for repair are younger and have fewer comorbidities. Consequently, EVAR for small AAAs carries lower risk of operative and 5-year mortality. Aneurysm diameter is independently associated with reinterventions and mortality after EVAR, suggesting that AAA diameter may have an important clinical effect on outcomes.",2019,10.1016/j.jvs.2019.02.053,70,5,1446-1455,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Patient selection and Aged, 80 and over and Age Factors and Follow-Up Studies and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and Reference Values and Outcomes and *Patient Selection and Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Reoperation/statistics & numerical data and Abdominal aortic aneurysm and Aorta, Abdominal/diagnostic imaging/pathology and Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/mortality/pathology/*surgery and Asymptomatic Diseases/therapy and Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/*methods and Elective Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods and Endoleak/epidemiology/etiology and Endovascular aneurysm repair and Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/*methods",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patients were divided into two cohorts: the historical cohort (HC) included patients who underwent ABFB for AOD from 1985 to 1999 and the contemporary cohort (CC) who underwent ABFB for AOD from 2000 to 2015. Medical and demographic data, procedural information, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were extracted. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations with the end point of primary patency. A similar analysis was performed for major adverse limb events (MALEs; the composite of above-ankle amputation, major reintervention, graft revision, or new bypass graft of the index limb) in the subset of patients with critical limb ischemia. RESULTS: There were a total of 359 cases: 226 in the HC and 133 in the CC. The CC had more women (56.4% vs 43.8%; P = .02), smokers (87.2% vs 67.7%; P = .001), and patients who failed prior aortoiliac endovascular intervention (17.3% vs 4.8%; P = .0001), but fewer patients with coronary artery disease (32.3% vs 47.3%; P = .005). Thirty-day mortality was less than 1% in both cohorts, but 10-year survival was higher in the CC (67.7% vs 52.6%; P = .02). Five-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency were higher in the HC (93.3% vs 82.2%; P = .005; 93.8% vs 85.7%; P = .02; 97.5% vs 90.4%; P = .02, respectively). CC membership, decreasing age, prior aortic surgery, and decreasing graft diameter were significant independent predictors of loss of primary patency after adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 7.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.80-17.63; P < .0001; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96; P < .0001; HR, 18.80; 95% CI, 5.94-59.58; P < .0001; and HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; P = .02, respectively). Similarly, CC membership, prior aortic surgery, and decreasing graft diameter were significant independent predictors of MALE in the critical limb ischemia cohort after adjustment (HR, 21.13; 95% CI, 4.20-106.40; P = .0002; HR, 40.40; 95% CI, 3.23-505.61; P = .004; and HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.86; P = .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the pre-endovascular era, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients undergoing ABFB for AOD in the CC have changed. Although long-term patency is slightly lower among patients in the CC during which a substantial subset of AOD patients are being treated primarily via the endovascular approach, durability remains excellent and limb salvage unchanged. After adjustment, the time period of index ABFB independently predicted primary patency and MALE, as did graft diameter and prior aortic surgery. These changing characteristics should be considered when counseling patients and benchmarking for reintervention rates and other outcomes.",2018,10.1016/j.jvs.2018.01.067,68,6,1796-1804.e2,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Databases, Factual and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Patient Selection and Clinical Decision-Making and Progression-Free Survival and Postoperative Complications/mortality and Limb Salvage and Vascular Patency and Aortic Diseases/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*surgery and Aortobifemoral bypass and Arterial Occlusive Diseases/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*surgery and Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/mortality/*trends and Endovascular Procedures/trends and Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*surgery and Peripheral arterial disease",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Caleb",Annals of surgery,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons may be reluctant to withdraw postoperative life support after a poor outcome. METHODS: A cross-sectional random sample was taken from a US mail survey of 2100 surgeons who routinely perform high-risk operations. We used a hypothetical vignette of a specialty-specific operation complicated by a hemiplegic stroke and respiratory failure. On postoperative day 7, the patient and family requested withdrawal of life-supporting therapy. We experimentally modified the timing and role of surgeon error to assess their influence on surgeons' willingness to withdraw life-supporting care. RESULTS: The adjusted response rate was 56%. Sixty-three percent of respondents would not honor the request to withdraw life-supporting treatment. Willingness to withdraw life-support was significantly lower in the setting of surgeon error (33% vs 41%, P < 0.008) and elective operations rather than in emergency cases (33% vs 41%, P = 0.01). After adjustment for specialty, years of experience, geographic region, and gender, odds of withdrawing life-supporting therapy were significantly greater in cases in which the outcome was not explicitly from error during an emergency operation as compared to iatrogenic injury in elective cases (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence intervals 1.26-3.01). Surgeons who did not withdraw life-support were significantly more likely to report the importance of optimism regarding prognosis (79% vs 62%, P < 0.0001) and concern that the patient could not accurately predict future quality of life (80% vs 68%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons are more reluctant to withdraw postoperative life-supporting therapy for patients with complications from surgeon error in the elective setting. This may also be influenced by personal optimism and a belief that patients are unable to predict the value of future health states.",2012,10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182580de5,256,1,10-15,eng,1528-1140 0003-4932,Humans and Female and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Multivariate Analysis and Prognosis and Health Care Surveys and Elective Surgical Procedures and Withholding Treatment/*statistics & numerical data and *Life Support Care and *General Surgery and *Medical Errors,NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Ann Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

T. and Fleming, Fergal J.",Annals of surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze recent trends in the rate of nonelective surgery and corresponding mortality for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients since the rise of biologic use. BACKGROUND: Modern biologic therapy has improved outcomes for IBD, but little is known about the impact on mortality rates after nonelective surgery. METHODS: New York's Statewide Planning & Research Cooperative System was queried for hospital admissions for ulcerative colitis (UC) with concurrent colectomy and Crohn disease (CD) with concurrent small bowel resection or colectomy from 2000 to 2013. Mixed-effects analyses assessed patient, surgeon, and hospital-level factors and hospital-level variation associated with 30-day mortality after nonelective surgery. RESULTS: Between 2000 to 2006 and 2007 to 2013, the number of unscheduled IBD-related admissions increased by 50% for UC and 41% for CD, but no change in the proportion of nonelective surgery cases was observed (UC=38% vs 38%; CD=45% vs 42%) among 15,837 intestinal resections (UC=5,297; CD=10,540). Nonelective surgery mortality rates between 2000 to 2006 and 2007 to 2013 were high and increased for UC (10.2% vs 15%) but decreased for CD (3.3% vs 2.2%). Nonelective surgery in 2007 to 2013 was associated with an 82% increased risk of 30-day mortality in UC cases (odds ratio: 1.82; confidence interval: 1.19-2.62). After controlling for patient-level factors, large hospital-level variation was observed with 23-fold difference in mortality for both UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Although nonelective IBD surgery rates have remained stable, associated 30-day mortality for UC has doubled in recent years despite advances in medical management.

BACKGROUND: Quality criteria have been developed for clinical injury care, but not patient- and family-centered injury care. METHODS: Using a modified Research AND Development Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methodology, a panel of 16 patients, family members, injury and quality of care experts serially rated and revised criteria for patient- and family-centered injury care identified from patient and family focus groups. The criteria were then sent to 384 verified trauma centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 46 criteria were rated and revised by the panel over 4 rounds of review producing 14 criteria related to clinical care (n = 4; transitions of care, pain management, patient safety, provider competence), communication (n = 3; information for patients/families; communication of discharge plans to patients/families, communication between hospital and community providers), holistic care (n = 4; patient hygiene, kindness and respect, family access to patient, social and spiritual support) and end-of-life care (n = 3; decision making, end-of-life care, family follow-up).

So differentiating infection from SIRS can be challenging. Precision diagnostic assays could limit unnecessary antibiotic use, improving outcomes. METHODS: After surveying human leukocyte cytokine production responses to sterile damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and bacteria we created a multiplex assay for 31 cytokines. We then studied plasma from patients with bacteremia, septic shock, ""severe sepsis,"" or trauma (ISS <e2><89><a5>15 with circulating DAMPs) as well as controls. Infections were adjudicated based on post-hospitalization review. Plasma was studied in infection and injury using univariate and multivariate means to determine how such multiplex assays could best distinguish infective from noninfective SIRS. RESULTS: Infected patients had high plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1<ce><b1>, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) compared to controls [false discovery rates (FDR) <0.01, <0.01, <0.0001]. Conversely, injury suppressed many mediators including MDC (FDR <0.0001), TREM-1 (FDR <0.001), IP-10 (FDR <0.01), MCP-3 (FDR <0.05), FLT3L (FDR <0.05), Tweak, (FDR <0.05), GRO-<ce><b1> (FDR <0.05), and ENA-78 (FDR <0.05). In univariate studies, analyte overlap between clinical groups prevented clinical relevance. Multivariate models discriminated injury and infection much better, with the 2-group random-forest model classifying 11/11 injury and 28/29 infection patients correctly in out-of-bag validation. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating cytokines in traumatic SIRS differ markedly from those in health or sepsis. Variability limits the accuracy of single-mediator assays but machine learning based on multiplexed plasma assays revealed distinct patterns in sepsis- and injury-related SIRS. Defining biomarker release patterns that distinguish specific SIRS populations might allow decreased antibiotic use in those clinical situations.

Kitpanit_2021_Joofvasu,JOUR,Risk factors for spinal cord injury and complications of cerebrospinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair,"Kitpanit, Napong and Ellozy, Sharif H. and Connolly, Peter H. and Agrusa, Christopher J. and Lichtman, Adam D. and Schneider, Darren B.",Journal of vascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating complications of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) is routinely used to prevent and to treat SCI during open TAAA repair. However, the risks and benefits of CSFD during fenestrated-branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/B-EVAR) are unclear. This study aimed to determine the risk of SCI after F/B-EVAR and to assess the risks and benefits of CSFD. METHODS: We analyzed 106 consecutive patients with TAAAs treated with F/B-EVAR from 2014 to 2019 in a prospective physician-sponsored investigational device exemption study (G130193). Data were collected prospectively and audited by an independent external monitor. All patients were treated with Cook manufactured patient-specific F/B-EVAR devices or the Cook t-Branch devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind). CSFD was used at the discretion of the principal investigator. Risk factors for SCI were identified, and CSFD complications were assessed. RESULTS: Prophylactic CSFD was used in 78 patients (73.6%), and 28 patients (26.4%) underwent F/B-EVAR without CSFD. Four patients (3.8%) with prophylactic CSFD developed SCI, including two patients (1.9%) with permanent paraplegia (Tarlov grade 1-2) and two patients (1.9%) with paraparesis (Tarlov grade 3). Multivariate analysis revealed that greater extent of thoracic aortic coverage (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.11; P = .02) and intraoperative blood loss (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.002; P = .04) were the significant risk factors for SCI. Six patients (7.6% [6/78]) experienced major CSFD-related complications, including subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2.6% (2), spinal hematoma in 2.6% (2), cerebellar hemorrhage in 1.3% (1), and spinal drain fracture requiring surgical laminectomy in 1.3% (1). Minor CSFD-related complications occurred in 20 patients (25.6% [20/78]), including paresthesia during CSFD insertion (10), minimal bloody cerebrospinal fluid (7), drain malfunction (2), and reflex hypotension (1). Technical difficulties during CSFD catheter placement were noted in seven patients (9.0%). Excluding four patients with SCI, intensive care unit stay was 3.3 <c2><b1> 4.0 days in the CSFD group vs 1.2 <c2><b1> 0.9 days in the no-CSFD group (P = .007). Total hospital length of stay was 6.0 <c2><b1> 4.9 days in the CSFD group vs 3.5 <c2><b1> 1.9 days in the no-CSFD group (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SCI after F/B-EVAR with selective CSFD was low, and risk factors for SCI were greater with extent of thoracic aortic coverage and intraoperative blood loss. However, the incidence of major CSFD-related complications exceeded the incidence of SCI, and CSFD significantly increased both intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay. Therefore, routine prophylactic CSFD may not be justified, and a prospective randomized trial of CSFD in patients undergoing F/B-EVAR seems appropriate.",2021,10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.070,73,2,399-409.e1,eng,1097-6809 0741-5214,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Databases, Factual and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Length of Stay and Clinical Decision-Making and Spinal cord injury and Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/*adverse effects/mortality and Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery and Branched endovascular aneurysm repair and Drainage/*adverse effects/mortality and Endovascular Procedures/*adverse effects/mortality and Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair and Spinal Cord Injuries/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control and Spinal cord ischemia and Spinal Cord Ischemia/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control and Thoracoabdominal aneurysm",NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Vasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation do not concentrate upon expert multidisciplinary teams. Moreover, their focus is confined to a single clinical setting, thereby not considering the complex interactions across multiple hospital departments. METHODS: A total of 288 participants (Attending surgeons, anesthesiologists, physicians, and nurses) completed this largest simulation study to date, set in the UK Defence Medical Services' Hospital Simulator and the conflict zone in Afghanistan. The simulator termed ""Hospital Exercise"" (HOSPEX) is a fully immersive live-in simulation experience that covers the entire environment of a military hospital with all departments. Participants undertook a 3-day training program within HOSPEX before deployment to war zones. Primary outcome measures were assessed with IMPAcT (the Imperial Military Personnel Assessment Tool). IMPAcT measures crisis management, trauma care, hospital environment, operational readiness, and transfer of skills to civilian practice. Reliability, skills learning, and retention in the conflict zone were assessed statistically. RESULTS: Reliability in skills assessment was excellent (Cronbach <ce><b1>: nontechnical skills = 0.87-0.94; environment/patient skills = 0.83-0.95). Pre/post-HOSPEX comparisons revealed significant improvements in decision making (M = 4.98, SD = 1.20 to M = 5.39, SD = 0.91; P = 0.03), situational awareness (M = 5.44, SD = 1.04 to M = 5.74, SD = 0.92; P = 0.01), trauma care (M = 5.53, SD = 1.23 to M = 5.85, SD = 1.09; P = 0.05), and knowledge of hospital environment (M = 5.19, SD = 1.17 to M = 5.42, SD = 0.97; P = 0.04). No skills decayed over time when assessed several months later in the real conflict zone. All skills transferred to civilian clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians rely on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index to quantify the risk of cardiac complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Because mortality from noncardiac causes accounts for many perioperative deaths, there is also a need for a simple bedside risk index to predict 30-day all-cause mortality after noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 298,772 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery during 2005 to 2007 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. RESULTS: The 9-point S-MPM (Surgical Mortality Probability Model) 30-day mortality risk index was derived empirically and includes three risk factors: ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status, emergency status, and surgery risk class. Patients with ASA physical status I, II, III, IV or V were assigned either 0, 2, 4, 5, or 6 points, respectively; intermediate- or high-risk procedures were assigned 1 or 2 points, respectively; and emergency procedures were assigned 1 point. Patients with risk scores less than 5 had a predicted risk of mortality less than 0.50%, whereas patients with a risk score of 5 to 6 had a risk of mortality between 1.5% and 4.0%. Patients with a risk score greater than 6 had risk of mortality more than 10%. S-MPM exhibited excellent discrimination (C statistic, 0.897) and acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic 13.0, P = 0.023) in the validation data set.

Using novel machine-learning techniques, we sought to design an interactive, nonlinear risk calculator for Emergency Surgery (ES). Methods: All ES patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) 2007 to 2013 database were included (derivation cohort). Optimal Classification Trees (OCT) were leveraged to train machine-learning algorithms to predict postoperative mortality, morbidity, and 18 specific complications (eg, sepsis, surgical site infection). Unlike classic heuristics (eg, logistic regression), OCT is adaptive and reboots itself with each variable, thus accounting for nonlinear interactions among variables. An application [Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER)] was then designed as the algorithms' interactive and user-friendly interface. POTTER performance was measured (c-statistic) using the 2014 ACS-NSQIP database (validation cohort) and compared with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Emergency Surgery Score (ESS), and ACS-NSQIP calculators' performance. Results: Based on 382,960 ES patients, comprehensive decision-making algorithms were derived, and POTTER was created where the provider's answer to a question interactively dictates the subsequent question. For any specific patient, the number of questions needed to predict mortality ranged from 4 to 11. The mortality c-statistic was 0.9162, higher than ASA (0.8743), ESS (0.8910), and ACS (0.8975). The morbidity c-statistics was similarly the highest (0.8414). Conclusion: POTTER is a highly accurate and user-friendly ES risk calculator with the potential to continuously improve accuracy with ongoing machine-learning. POTTER might prove useful as a tool for bedside preoperative counseling of ES patients and families.",2018,NA,268,4,574-583,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018///,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
