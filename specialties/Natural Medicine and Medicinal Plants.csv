Caesar_2019_Natuprodrepo,JOUR,Synergy and antagonism in natural product extracts: when 1 + 1 does not equal 2,"Caesar, Lindsay K. and Cech, Nadja B.",Natural product reports,"Covering: 2000 to 2019 According to a 2012 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 18% of the U.S. population uses natural products (including plant-based or botanical preparations) for treatment or prevention of disease. The use of plant-based medicines is even more prevalent in developing countries, where for many they constitute the primary health care modality. Proponents of the medicinal use of natural product mixtures often claim that they are more effective than purified compounds due to beneficial ""synergistic"" interactions. A less-discussed phenomenon, antagonism, in which effects of active constituents are masked by other compounds in a complex mixture, also occurs in natural product mixtures. Synergy and antagonism are notoriously difficult to study in a rigorous fashion, particularly given that natural products chemistry research methodology is typically devoted to reducing complexity and identifying single active constituents for drug development. This report represents a critical review with commentary about the current state of the scientific literature as it relates to studying combination effects (including both synergy and antagonism) in natural product extracts. We provide particular emphasis on analytical and Big Data approaches for identifying synergistic or antagonistic combinations and elucidating the mechanisms that underlie their interactions. Specific case studies of botanicals in which synergistic interactions have been documented are also discussed. The topic of synergy is important given that consumer use of botanical natural products and associated safety concerns continue to garner attention by the public and the media. Guidance by the natural products community is needed to provide strategies for effective evaluation of safety and toxicity of botanical mixtures and to drive discovery in botanical natural product research.",2019,10.1039/c9np00011a,36,6,869-888,eng,1460-4752 0265-0568,"Humans and Drug Combinations and Drug Synergism and Drug Antagonism and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods and Echinacea/microbiology and Endotoxins/pharmacology and Metabolomics/methods and Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology and Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry",NA,NA,2019/06/19/,Nat Prod Rep,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jansen_2021_Joofet,JOUR,"Medicine in motion: Opportunities, challenges and data analytics-based solutions for traditional medicine integration into western medical practice","Jansen, C. and Baker, J. D. and Kodaira, E. and Ang, L. and Bacani, A. J. and Aldan, J. T. and Shimoda, L. M. N. and Salameh, M. and Small-Howard, A. L. and Stokes, A. J. and Turner, H. and Adra, C. N.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional pharmacopeias have been developed by multiple cultures and evaluated for efficacy and safety through both historical/empirical iteration and more recently through controlled studies using Western scientific paradigms and an increasing emphasis on data science methodologies for network pharmacology. Traditional medicines represent likely sources of relatively inexpensive drugs for symptomatic management as well as potential libraries of new therapeutic approaches. Leveraging this potential requires hard evidence for efficacy that separates science from pseudoscience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a review of non-Western medical systems and developed case studies that illustrate the epistemological and practical translative barriers that hamper their transition to integration with Western approaches. We developed a new data analytics approach, in silico convergence analysis, to deconvolve modes of action, and potentially predict desirable components of TM-derived formulations based on computational consensus analysis across cultures and medical systems. RESULTS: Abstraction, simplification and altered dose and delivery modalities were identified as factors that influence actual and perceived efficacy once a medicine is moved from a non-Western to Western setting. Case studies on these factors highlighted issues with translation between non-Western and Western epistemologies, including those where epistemological and medicinal systems drive markets that can be epicenters for zoonoses such as the novel Coronavirus. The proposed novel data science approach demonstrated the ability to identify and predict desirable medicinal components for a test indication, pain. CONCLUSIONS: Relegation of traditional therapies to the relatively unregulated nutraceutical industry may lead healthcare providers and patients to underestimate the therapeutic potential of these medicines. We suggest three areas of emphasis for this field: First, vertical integration and embedding of traditional medicines into healthcare systems would subject them to appropriate regulation and evidence-based practice, as viable integrative implementation mode. Second, we offer a new Bradford-Hill-like framework for setting research priorities and evaluating efficacy, with the goal of rescuing potentially valuable therapies from the nutraceutical market and discrediting those that are pseudoscience. Third, data analytics pipelines offer new capacity to generate new types of TMS-inspired medicines that are rationally-designed based on integrated knowledge across cultures, and also provide an evaluative framework against which to test claims of fidelity and efficacy to TMS made for nutraceuticals.",2021,10.1016/j.jep.2020.113477,267,NA,113477,eng,1872-7573 0378-8741,"Medicine and Humans and Pain and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Phytotherapy and *Data Science and COVID-19/therapy and Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/*organization & administration/*trends and Healthcare economics and Indigenous medicine and Medicine, Traditional/*trends and Network pharmacology and Phytomedicine and Traditional medicine",NA,NA,2021/03/01/,J Ethnopharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lev_2008_Joofet,JOUR,"""Fossils"" of practical medical knowledge from medieval Cairo","Lev, Efraim and Amar, Zohar",Journal of ethnopharmacology,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To asses the scientific value of the practical medical fragments found in the Cairo Genizah (10th century), as a useful source for ethnopharmacological purposes (in exposing rare and usually inaccessible original medieval practical knowledge of medicinal substances to present-day researchers), and to reconstruct the practical drugs and their uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A methodology distinguishing between theoretical (about 1500 fragments) and practical medical knowledge (about 230 fragments) was created and used. The information regarding the practical medicinal substances was extracted from prescriptions (140), lists of drugs (70) and few letters of physicians. RESULTS: The reconstructed lists of practical (278) and theoretical (414) drugs allow us to recognize and quantify the gap between them in medieval times (136). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the data obtained from ancient prescriptions is comparable to ethnopharmacological surveys. The finding of plants such as myrobalan, saffron, licorice, spikenard and lentisk, all of which have scientifically proven anti-microbial/bacterial and anti-fungal activity, sheds a helpful light on the medical decision-making of the medieval practitioners in respect of the plants they applied as drugs. With the wealth of information meticulously assembled from these time capsules we expect to make a significant contribution to contemporary efforts at locating modern drugs in ancient roots and gauging their feasibility.",2008,10.1016/j.jep.2008.05.042,119,1,24-40,eng,0378-8741,"Humans and Egypt and Drug Prescriptions/history and History, Medieval and Manuscripts, Medical as Topic/history and Materia Medica/*history and Medicine, Traditional/*history and Phytotherapy/*history and Plants, Medicinal/chemistry",NA,NA,2008/09/02/,J Ethnopharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pedrollo_2016_Joofet,JOUR,"Medicinal plants at Rio Jauaperi, Brazilian Amazon: Ethnobotanical survey and environmental conservation","Pedrollo, Camilo Tomazini and Kinupp, Valdely Ferreira and Shepard, Glenn Jr and Heinrich, Michael",Journal of ethnopharmacology,"STUDY BACKGROUND: The Amazon basin is a mosaic of different environments. Flooded riparian and upland forests play a significant role for the establishment of human settlements. Riparian communities in the Amazon have evolved depending on the use of plants applied for therapeutic purposes, thus developing important knowledge about their management and preparation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This paper describes and analyzes the use and management of medicinal plants in order to establish links to environmental conservation. The categorization of habitats of occurrence and categories of diseases were held in five riparian communities at Rio Jauaperi, in the border between Roraima and Amazonas states in Brazil. The study sight is poorly investigated in terms of scientific research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative ethnobotanical field inquiries and analytical methods including observations, individual and focus group discussions, individual interviews, preference ranking by free listing tasks, guided tours and community mapping were applied. Sutrop's cognitive salience index was applied in order to check the most important ethnospecies and diseases. The survey was conducted from February to December 2012. RESULTS: A total of 62 informants were interviewed, resulting in 119 botanical species documented. The most salient medicinal species are usually wide distributed and recognized transculturally. Arboreal habit was the most important corresponding to 47% of total species used. The most frequent accessed environments were terra-firme (upland forest), vargeado (flooded forest), poultry (regenerating forest) and restinga (seasonally flooded forest) which together provides 59% of the total medicinal plant species. Exotic species played a secondary role with only 20% of the total. Thirty seven percent of the species were cultivated. Plants at homegardens are usually associated with children's or women's disease. Xixuau is the community with improved ability to environmental preservation using more forestry species. The most worrying disease was malaria. Biomedical assistance is precarious in the region and many diseases and healing rituals are culturally built. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants can indicate the level of biodiversity conservation and human health by integrating social and ecological analytical elements. Considering a predominance of management for subsistence, the higher richness of native medicinal species availability indicates that biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge are better preserved. The methods applied here might contribute for the decision-making process regarding conservation public policies and medical assistance in remote areas of the Amazon basin.",2016,10.1016/j.jep.2016.03.055,186,NA,111-124,eng,1872-7573 0378-8741,"Humans and Agriculture and Brazil and *Conservation of Natural Resources and *Environmental Monitoring and *Medicine, Traditional and *Ethnobotany and Biodiversity conservation and Ethnobotany and Ethnopharmacological field studies and Plants, Medicinal/*classification and Traditional medicine South America",NA,NA,2016/06/20/,J Ethnopharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
