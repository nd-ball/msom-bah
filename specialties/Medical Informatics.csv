Koziol.McLain_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Participant Recruitment and Engagement in Automated eHealth Trial Registration: Challenges and Opportunities for Recruiting Women Who Experience Violence,"Koziol-McLain, Jane and McLean, Christine and Rohan, Maheswaran and Sisk, Rose and Dobbs, Terry and Nada-Raja, Shyamala and Wilson, Denise and Vandal, Alain C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Automated eHealth Web-based research trials offer people an accessible, confidential opportunity to engage in research that matters to them. eHealth trials may be particularly useful for sensitive issues when seeking health care may be accompanied by shame and mistrust. Yet little is known about people's early engagement with eHealth trials, from recruitment to preintervention autoregistration processes. A recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of an eHealth safety decision aid for New Zealand women in the general population who experienced intimate partner violence (isafe) provided the opportunity to examine recruitment and preintervention participant engagement with a fully automated Web-based registration process. The trial aimed to recruit 340 women within 24 months. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine participant preintervention engagement and recruitment efficiency for the isafe trial, and to analyze dropout through the registration pathway, from recruitment to eligibility screening and consent, to completion of baseline measures. METHODS: In this case study, data collection sources included the trial recruitment log, Google Analytics reports, registration and program metadata, and costs. Analysis included a qualitative narrative of the recruitment experience and descriptive statistics of preintervention participant engagement and dropout rates. A Koyck model investigated the relationship between Web-based online marketing website advertisements (ads) and participant accrual. RESULTS: The isafe trial was launched on September 17, 2012. Placement of ads in an online classified advertising platform increased the average number of recruited participants per month from 2 to 25. Over the 23-month recruitment period, the registration website recorded 4176 unique visitors. Among 1003 women meeting eligibility criteria, 51.55% (517) consented to participate; among the 501 women who enrolled (consented, validated, and randomized), 412 (82.2%) were accrued (completed baseline assessments). The majority (n=52, 58%) of the 89 women who dropped out between enrollment and accrual never logged in to the allocated isafe website. Of every 4 accrued women, 3 (314/412, 76.2%) identified the classified ad as their referral source, followed by friends and family (52/412, 12.6%). Women recruited through a friend or relative were more likely to self-identify as indigenous Maori and live in the highest-deprivation areas. Ads increased the accrual rate by a factor of 74 (95% CI 49-112). CONCLUSIONS: Print advertisements, website links, and networking were costly and inefficient methods for recruiting participants to a Web-based eHealth trial. Researchers are advised to limit their recruitment efforts to Web-based online marketplace and classified advertising platforms, as in the isafe case, or to social media. Online classified advertising in ""Jobs-Other-volunteers"" successfully recruited a diverse sample of women experiencing intimate partner violence. Preintervention recruitment data provide critical information to inform future research and critical analysis of Web-based eHealth trials.

Shah_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Exacerbations in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Identification and Prediction Using a Digital Health System,"Shah, Syed Ahmar and Velardo, Carmelo and Farmer, Andrew and Tarassenko, Lionel",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, chronic respiratory disease with a significant socioeconomic burden. Exacerbations, the sudden and sustained worsening of symptoms, can lead to hospitalization and reduce quality of life. Major limitations of previous telemonitoring interventions for COPD include low compliance, lack of consensus on what constitutes an exacerbation, limited numbers of patients, and short monitoring periods. We developed a telemonitoring system based on a digital health platform that was used to collect data from the 1-year EDGE (Self Management and Support Programme) COPD clinical trial aiming at daily monitoring in a heterogeneous group of patients with moderate to severe COPD. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were as follows: first, to develop a systematic and reproducible approach to exacerbation identification and to track the progression of patient condition during remote monitoring; and second, to develop a robust algorithm able to predict COPD exacerbation, based on vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter. METHODS: We used data from 110 patients, with a combined monitoring period of more than 35,000 days. We propose a finite-state machine-based approach for modeling COPD exacerbation to gain a deeper insight into COPD patient condition during home monitoring to take account of the time course of symptoms. A robust algorithm based on short-period trend analysis and logistic regression using vital signs derived from a pulse oximeter is also developed to predict exacerbations. RESULTS: On the basis of 27,260 sessions recorded during the clinical trial (average usage of 5.3 times per week for 12 months), there were 361 exacerbation events. There was considerable variation in the length of exacerbation events, with a mean length of 8.8 days. The mean value of oxygen saturation was lower, and both the pulse rate and respiratory rate were higher before an impending exacerbation episode, compared with stable periods. On the basis of the classifier developed in this work, prediction of COPD exacerbation episodes with 60%-80% sensitivity will result in 68%-36% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter (pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) are predictive of COPD exacerbation events, with oxygen saturation being the most predictive, followed by respiratory rate and pulse rate. Combination of these vital signs with a robust algorithm based on machine learning leads to further improvement in positive predictive accuracy.

Pantziaras_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Training with virtual patients in transcultural psychiatry: do the learners actually learn?,"Pantziaras, Ioannis and Fors, Uno and Ekblad, Solvig",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in the number of patients with diverse ethnic backgrounds and previous exposure to severe mental trauma dictates the need for improvement in the quality of transcultural psychiatric health care through the development of relevant and effective training tools. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of training with a virtual patient on the learner's knowledge of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, clinical management, and basic communication skills. METHODS: The authors constructed an interactive educational tool based on virtual patient methodology that portrayed a refugee with severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. A total of 32 resident psychiatrists tested the tool and completed a pre-interaction and post-interaction knowledge test, including skills, at the time and several weeks later. RESULTS: All of the participants (N=32) completed the pre-interaction and post-interaction test, and 26 (81%) of them completed the online follow-up test. The mean pre-interaction score was 7.44 (male: 7.08, female: 7.65, no statistical significance). The mean post-interaction score was 8.47, which was significantly higher (P<.001) than the pre-interaction score (mean score 7.44). The mean score for the follow-up test several weeks later was 8.38, higher than the pre-interaction score by 0.69 points but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that virtual patients can successfully facilitate the acquisition of core knowledge in the field of psychiatry, in addition to developing skills such as clinical reasoning, decision making, and history taking. Repeated training sessions with virtual patients are proposed in order to achieve sustainable educational effects.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3497,17,2,e46,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Patient Simulation and *User-Computer Interface and Adult and education and Educational Measurement and Ethnopsychology/*education/*methods and Female and Humans and Learning and Male and medical informatics and Medical Informatics and mental health and Middle Aged and patient simulation and PTSD and Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diagnosis/ethnology/*therapy and transcultural psychiatry and virtual systems",NA,NA,2015/02/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jones_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Privacy-Preserving Methods for Feature Engineering Using Blockchain: Review, Evaluation, and Proof of Concept","Jones, Michael and Johnson, Matthew and Shervey, Mark and Dudley, Joel T. and Zimmerman, Noah",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The protection of private data is a key responsibility for research studies that collect identifiable information from study participants. Limiting the scope of data collection and preventing secondary use of the data are effective strategies for managing these risks. An ideal framework for data collection would incorporate feature engineering, a process where secondary features are derived from sensitive raw data in a secure environment without a trusted third party. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare current approaches based on how they maintain data privacy and the practicality of their implementations. These approaches include traditional approaches that rely on trusted third parties, and cryptographic, secure hardware, and blockchain-based techniques. METHODS: A set of properties were defined for evaluating each approach. A qualitative comparison was presented based on these properties. The evaluation of each approach was framed with a use case of sharing geolocation data for biomedical research. RESULTS: We found that approaches that rely on a trusted third party for preserving participant privacy do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees that sensitive data will not be exposed in modern data ecosystems. Cryptographic techniques incorporate strong privacy-preserving paradigms but are appropriate only for select use cases or are currently limited because of computational complexity. Blockchain smart contracts alone are insufficient to provide data privacy because transactional data are public. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) may have hardware vulnerabilities and lack visibility into how data are processed. Hybrid approaches combining blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and TEEs provide promising frameworks for privacy preservation. For reference, we provide a software implementation where users can privately share features of their geolocation data using the hybrid approach combining blockchain with TEEs as a supplement. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable the development of new privacy-preserving feature engineering methods by obviating dependence on trusted parties and providing immutable, auditable data processing workflows. The overlap between blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and secure hardware technologies are promising fields for addressing important data privacy needs. Hybrid blockchain and TEE frameworks currently provide practical tools for implementing experimental privacy-preserving applications.",2019,10.2196/13600,21,8,e13600,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*blockchain and *confidentiality and *cryptography and *data collection and *feature engineering and *geolocation and *machine learning and *mobile health and *privacy and *Privacy and *Proof of Concept Study and *smart contract and *trusted execution environment and blockchain and Blockchain/*standards and Computer Security/*standards and confidentiality and cryptography and data collection and feature engineering and geolocation and Humans and machine learning and mobile health and privacy and smart contract and trusted execution environment,NA,NA,2019/08/14/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Larsen_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Digital Recruitment and Acceptance of a Stepwise Model to Prevent Chronic Disease in the Danish Primary Care Sector: Cross-Sectional Study,"Larsen, Lars Bruun and Sondergaard, Jens and Thomsen, Janus Laust and Halling, Anders and Sonderlund, Anders Larrabee and Christensen, Jeanette Reffstrup and Thilsing, Trine",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: During recent years, stepwise approaches to health checks have been advanced as an alternative to general health checks. In 2013, we set up the Early Detection and Prevention project (Tidlig Opsporing og Forebyggelse, TOF) to develop a stepwise approach aimed at patients at high or moderate risk of a chronic disease. A novel feature was the use of a personal digital mailbox for recruiting participants. A personal digital mailbox is a secure digital mailbox provided by the Danish public authorities. Apart from being both safe and secure, it is a low-cost, quick, and easy way to reach Danish residents. OBJECTIVE: In this study we analyze the association between the rates of acceptance of 2 digital invitations sent to a personal digital mailbox and the sociodemographic determinants, medical treatment, and health care usage in a stepwise primary care model for the prevention of chronic diseases. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the rates of acceptance of 2 digital invitations sent to randomly selected residents born between 1957 and 1986 and residing in 2 Danish municipalities. The outcome was acceptance of the 2 digital invitations. Statistical associations were determined by Poisson regression. Data-driven chi-square automatic interaction detection method was used to generate a decision tree analysis, predicting acceptance of the digital invitations. RESULTS: A total of 8814 patients received an invitation in their digital mailbox from 47 general practitioners. A total of 40.22% (3545/8814) accepted the first digital invitation, and 30.19 % (2661/8814) accepted both digital invitations. The rates of acceptance of both digital invitations were higher among women, older patients, patients of higher socioeconomic status, and patients not diagnosed with or being treated for diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the rates of acceptance of digital invitations to participate in a stepwise model for prevention of chronic diseases. More studies of digital invitations are needed to determine if the acceptance rates seen in this study should be expected from future studies as well. Similarly, more research is needed to determine whether a multimodal recruitment approach, including digital invitations to personal digital mailboxes will reach hard-to-reach subpopulations more effectively than digital invitations only.",2019,10.2196/11658,21,1,e11658,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*clinical decision support systems and *cross-sectional studies and *promotion of health and Chronic Disease/*prevention & control and clinical decision support systems and cross-sectional studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Denmark and Female and Health Promotion/*methods and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care/*standards and promotion of health,NA,NA,2019/01/21/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of RL applications in the critical care setting. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to survey the literature on RL applications for clinical decision support in critical care and to provide insight into the challenges of applying various RL models. METHODS: We performed an extensive search of the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Studies published over the past 10 years (2010-2019) that have applied RL for critical care were included. RESULTS: We included 21 papers and found that RL has been used to optimize the choice of medications, drug dosing, and timing of interventions and to target personalized laboratory values. We further compared and contrasted the design of the RL models and the evaluation metrics for each application. CONCLUSIONS: RL has great potential for enhancing decision making in critical care. Challenges regarding RL system design, evaluation metrics, and model choice exist.

Liaw_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Nurse-Physician Communication Team Training in Virtual Reality Versus Live Simulations: Randomized Controlled Trial on Team Communication and Teamwork Attitudes,"Liaw, Sok Ying and Ooi, Sim Win and Rusli, Khairul Dzakirin Bin and Lau, Tang Ching and Tam, Wilson Wai San and Chua, Wei Ling",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Interprofessional team training is needed to improve nurse-physician communication skills that are lacking in clinical practice. Using simulations has proven to be an effective learning approach for team training. Yet, it has logistical constraints that call for the exploration of virtual environments in delivering team training. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a team training program using virtual reality vs conventional live simulations on medical and nursing students' communication skill performances and teamwork attitudes. METHODS: In June 2018, the authors implemented nurse-physician communication team training using communication tools. A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 120 undergraduate medical and nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake team training using virtual reality or live simulations. The participants from both groups were tested on their communication performances through team-based simulation assessments. Their teamwork attitudes were evaluated using interprofessional attitude surveys that were administered before, immediately after, and 2 months after the study interventions. RESULTS: The team-based simulation assessment revealed no significant differences in the communication performance posttest scores (P=.29) between the virtual and simulation groups. Both groups reported significant increases in the interprofessional attitudes posttest scores from the baseline scores, with no significant differences found between the groups over the 3 time points. CONCLUSIONS: Our study outcomes did not show an inferiority of team training using virtual reality when compared with live simulations, which supports the potential use of virtual reality to substitute conventional simulations for communication team training. Future studies can leverage the use of artificial intelligence technology in virtual reality to replace costly human-controlled facilitators to achieve better scalability and sustainability of team-based training in interprofessional education.

Agree_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"""It's got to be on this page"": age and cognitive style in a study of online health information seeking","Agree, Emily M. and King, Abby C. and Castro, Cynthia M. and Wiley, Adrienne and Borzekowski, Dina L. G.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The extensive availability of online health information offers the public opportunities to become independently informed about their care, but what affects the successful retrieval and understanding of accurate and detailed information? We have limited knowledge about the ways individuals use the Internet and the personal characteristics that affect online health literacy. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the extent to which age and cognitive style predicted success in searching for online health information, controlling for differences in education, daily Internet use, and general health literacy. METHODS: The Online Health Study (OHS) was conducted at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and Stanford University School of Medicine from April 2009 to June 2010. The OHS was designed to explore the factors associated with success in obtaining health information across different age groups. A total of 346 men and women aged 35 years and older of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds participated in the study. Participants were evaluated for success in searching online for answers to health-related tasks/questions on nutrition, cancer, alternative medicine, vaccinations, medical equipment, and genetic testing. RESULTS: Cognitive style, in terms of context sensitivity, was associated with less success in obtaining online health information, with tasks involving visual judgment most affected. In addition, better health literacy was positively associated with overall success in online health seeking, specifically for tasks requiring prior health knowledge. The oldest searchers were disadvantaged even after controlling for education, Internet use, general health literacy, and cognitive style, especially when spatial tasks such as mapping were involved. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing availability of online health information provides opportunities to improve patient education and knowledge, but effective use of these resources depends on online health literacy. Greater support for those who are in the oldest cohorts and for design of interfaces that support users with different cognitive styles may be required in an age of shared medical decision making.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3352,17,3,e79,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Cognition and *Information Seeking Behavior and *Internet and Adult and Age Factors and age groups and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and eHealth and Female and field dependence-independence and health literacy and Health Literacy and Humans and Internet and Male and Middle Aged",NA,NA,2015/03/24/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many printed versions of such material are available, including comics that explore the individual memories of patients who have gone through cancer treatment. These studies have been used to orientate patients, patients' relatives, and physicians. However, only a few Web-based comics have been specifically designed for patients with breast cancer and used as aids to decision making. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the developmental process of creating an animated comic as a Web-based surgery decision-making tool; the comic was aimed at illustrating the feelings, thoughts, and meanings when a patient suffers from breast cancer. This was done by recounting the symptoms, diagnostic process, treatments, and treatment effects of such women from the diagnosis stage onward. METHODS: Using cycles of planning, action, evaluation, and reflection, which involved collaborative work, action research was conducted to develop a Web-based animated comic. The stages of action research consisted of (1) semistructured and in-depth interviews to collect experiences of women with breast cancer; (2) construction of an animated comic by editors, graphics designers, dubbers, and information technology engineers; (3) redrawing of pictures of the comic after gathering feedback from a breast surgeon; and (4) evaluation of the Web-based animated comic using 6 patient focus groups. RESULTS: The comic was produced and showcased on the website ""The Network of Making-decision Aids for Breast Cancer Surgery""; the comic was accompanied by soft music and audio explanations. The comic functions as a personal statement that describes experiencing breast cancer. The animated comic consists of 8 chapters, based on the 8 themes deducted from the findings obtained during the analysis of relevant interviews. The 8 chapters include (1) the appearance of a lump; (2) confirmation by medical diagnosis; (3) the uncertainty of waiting (4) fear of life-threatening disease; (5) choosing life over despair; (6) being brave and deciding to undergo treatment; (7) choosing the type of surgery; and (8) being reborn. CONCLUSIONS: Using action research, this study illustrated that the comic that sheds light on issues of feelings, emotions, and thoughts that are present when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and provides a communication medium to explain the steps in the process. Meanwhile, it implies that hope will be able to overcome the challenges that will be faced. Within the Web-based decision aid for patients with breast cancer, the animated comic acts as an information resource and is aimed at patients' understanding of impacts of emotions arising when suffering from breast cancer. It is potentially applicable as a therapeutic tool that facilitates self-reflection and self-healing among newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer.",2019,10.2196/10716,21,2,e10716,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*action research and *breast cancer and *comic and *narrative and action research and breast cancer and Breast Neoplasms/*psychology and comic and Female and Graphic Novels as Topic and Health Services Research/*methods and Humans and Internet and narrative,NA,NA,2019/02/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a lack of consensus on its link to mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between internet addiction severity and adverse mental health outcomes. METHODS: First-year undergraduates enrolled at Sichuan University during September 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 were invited to participate in the current study survey, 85.13% (31,659/37,187) of whom fully responded. Young's 20-item Internet Addiction Test, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Symptom Checklist 90, Six-Item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised were used to evaluate internet addiction, four psychopathologies (high somatic symptom severity, clinically significant depression, psychoticism, and paranoia), serious mental illness, and lifetime suicidality. RESULTS: The prevalence of students with mild, moderate, and severe internet addiction was 37.93% (12,009/31,659), 6.33% (2003/31,659), and 0.20% (63/31,659), respectively. The prevalence rates of high somatic symptom severity, clinically significant depression, psychoticism, paranoid ideation, and serious mental illness were 6.54% (2072/31,659), 4.09% (1294/31,659), 0.51% (160/31,659), 0.52% (165/31,659), and 1.88% (594/31,659), respectively, and the lifetime prevalence rates of suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicidal attempt were 36.31% (11,495/31,659), 5.13% (1624/31,659), and 1.00% (315/31,659), respectively. The prevalence rates and odds ratios (ORs) of the four psychopathologies and their comorbidities, screened serious mental illness, and suicidalities in the group without internet addiction were much lower than the average levels of the surveyed population. Most of these metrics in the group with mild internet addiction were similar to or slightly higher than the average rates; however, these rates sharply increased in the moderate and severe internet addiction groups. Among the four psychopathologies, clinically significant depression was most strongly associated with internet addiction after adjusting for the confounding effects of demographics and other psychopathologies, and its prevalence increased from 1.01% (178/17,584) in the students with no addiction to 4.85% (582/12,009), 24.81% (497/2,003), and 58.73% (37/63) in the students with mild, moderate, and severe internet addiction, respectively. The proportions of those with any of the four psychopathologies increased from 4.05% (713/17,584) to 11.72% (1408/12,009), 36.89% (739/2003), and 68.25% (43/63); those with lifetime suicidal ideation increased from 24.92% (4382/17,584) to 47.56% (5711/12,009), 67.70% (1356/2003), and 73.02% (46/63); those with a suicidal plan increased from 2.59% (456/17,584) to 6.77% (813/12,009), 16.72% (335/2003), and 31.75% (20/63); and those with a suicidal attempt increased from 0.50% (88/17,584) to 1.23% (148/12,009), 3.54% (71/2003), and 12.70% (8/63), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate and severe internet addiction were strongly associated with a broad group of adverse mental health outcomes, including somatic symptoms that are the core features of many medical illnesses, although clinically significant depression showed the strongest association. This finding supports the illness validity of moderate and severe internet addiction in contrast to mild internet addiction.

However, previous informatics research has largely viewed tracking as a solitary process that lacks the characteristics essential to tracking in support of chronic illness management. OBJECTIVE: To inform development of effective technologies that aid tracking of health indicators to support chronic illness management, this study aimed to construct a health informatics model that accurately describes the work and social context of that tracking work. METHODS: As part of a larger project, we conducted semistructured interviews with 40 adults concerning their chronic illness management practices, including tracking and communication. We also assembled transcripts of 30 publicly available videos of 24 adults discussing tracking processes for managing their own chronic illness. We used qualitative methods to analyze interviews and video transcripts through the lens of ongoing personal and health informatics research. RESULTS: We have described the people and work involved in tracking in support of chronic illness management and contributed a Conceptual Model of Shared Health Informatics (CoMSHI). Specifically, we identified the need for a health informatics model that (1) incorporates the ongoing nature of tracking work and (2) represents the social dimension of tracking for illness management. Our model depicts communication, information, collection, integration, reflection, and action work in the social context of the person with chronic illness, informal carers, health care providers, and community members. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting CoMSHI yields a more detailed and nuanced viewpoint of tracking in support of chronic illness management and can inform technology design to improve tracking tools to support people in more confident and capable chronic illness management.",2019,10.2196/10830,21,4,e10830,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*chronic illness and *consumer health informatics and *information seeking behavior and *Information Seeking Behavior and *patient generated health data and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *patient reported outcomes and *shared decision making and *workflow and Adult and Chronic Disease/*psychology and chronic illness and consumer health informatics and Female and Humans and information seeking behavior and Internet and Male and Medical Informatics/*methods and Middle Aged and patient generated health data and patient reported outcomes and shared decision making and workflow,NA,NA,2019/04/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: LEGEND defines a process for high-quality observational research based on 10 guiding principles. We demonstrate how this process, here implemented through large-scale propensity score modeling, negative and positive control questions, empirical calibration, and full transparency, can be applied to compare antihypertensive drug therapies. We assess internal validity through covariate balance, confidence-interval coverage, between-database heterogeneity, and transitivity of results. We assess external validity through comparison to direct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: From 21.6 million unique antihypertensive new users, we generate 6 076 775 effect size estimates for 699 872 research questions on 12 946 treatment comparisons. Through propensity score matching, we achieve balance on all baseline patient characteristics for 75% of estimates, observe 95.7% coverage in our effect-estimate 95% confidence intervals, find high between-database consistency, and achieve transitivity in 84.8% of triplet hypotheses. Compared with meta-analyses of RCTs, our results are consistent with 28 of 30 comparisons while providing narrower confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: We find that these LEGEND results show high internal validity and are congruent with meta-analyses of RCTs. For these reasons we believe that evidence generated by LEGEND is of high quality and can inform medical decision-making where evidence is currently lacking.

A recent analysis of the home hospitalization and early discharge (HH/ED) program at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona over a 10-year period demonstrated high levels of acceptance by patients and professionals, as well as health value-based generation at the provider and health-system levels. However, health risk assessment was identified as an unmet need with the potential to enhance clinical decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to generate and assess predictive models of mortality and in-hospital admission at entry and at HH/ED discharge. METHODS: Predictive modeling of mortality and in-hospital admission was done in 2 different scenarios: at entry into the HH/ED program and at discharge, from January 2009 to December 2015. Multisource predictive variables, including standard clinical data, patients' functional features, and population health risk assessment, were considered. RESULTS: We studied 1925 HH/ED patients by applying a random forest classifier, as it showed the best performance. Average results of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC; sensitivity/specificity) for the prediction of mortality were 0.88 (0.81/0.76) and 0.89 (0.81/0.81) at entry and at home hospitalization discharge, respectively; the AUROC (sensitivity/specificity) values for in-hospital admission were 0.71 (0.67/0.64) and 0.70 (0.71/0.61) at entry and at home hospitalization discharge, respectively.

Wildevuur_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Information and communication technology-enabled person-centered care for the ""big five"" chronic conditions: scoping review","Wildevuur, Sabine E. and Simonse, Lianne W. L.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Person-centered information and communication technology (ICT) could encourage patients to take an active part in their health care and decision-making process, and make it possible for patients to interact directly with health care providers and services about their personal health concerns. Yet, little is known about which ICT interventions dedicated to person-centered care (PCC) and connected-care interactions have been studied, especially for shared care management of chronic diseases. The aim of this research is to investigate the extent, range, and nature of these research activities and identify research gaps in the evidence base of health studies regarding the ""big 5"" chronic diseases: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and stroke. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to review the literature and to scope the field with respect to 2 questions: (1) which ICT interventions have been used to support patients and health care professionals in PCC management of the big 5 chronic diseases? and (2) what is the impact of these interventions, such as on health-related quality of life and cost efficiency? METHODS: This research adopted a scoping review method. Three electronic medical databases were accessed: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. The research reviewed studies published between January 1989 and December 2013. In 5 stages of systematic scanning and reviewing, relevant studies were identified, selected, and charted. Then we collated, summarized, and reported the results. RESULTS: From the initial 9380 search results, we identified 350 studies that qualified for inclusion: diabetes mellitus (n=103), cardiovascular disease (n=89), chronic respiratory disease (n=73), cancer (n=67), and stroke (n=18). Persons with one of these chronic conditions used ICT primarily for self-measurement of the body, when interacting with health care providers, with the highest rates of use seen in chronic respiratory (63%, 46/73) and cardiovascular (53%, 47/89) diseases. We found 60 relevant studies (17.1%, 60/350) on person-centered shared management ICT, primarily using telemedicine systems as personalized ICT. The highest impact measured related to the increase in empowerment (15.4%, 54/350). Health-related quality of life accounted for 8%. The highest impact connected to health professionals was an increase in clinical outcome (11.7%, 41/350). The impacts on organization outcomes were decrease in hospitalization (12.3%, 43/350) and increase of cost efficiency (10.9%, 38/350). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review outlined ICT-enabled PCC in chronic disease management. Persons with a chronic disease could benefit from an ICT-enabled PCC approach, but ICT-PCC also yields organizational paybacks. It could lead to an increase in health care usage, as reported in some studies. Few interventions could be regarded as ""fully"" addressing PCC. This review will be especially helpful to those deciding on areas where further development of research or implementation of ICT-enabled PCC may be warranted.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3687,17,3,e77,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Communication and *Internet and Biomedical Technology/*methods and cardiovascular diseases and chronic disease and Chronic Disease/*therapy and chronic respiratory tract diseases and decision making and Decision Making and diabetes mellitus and disease management and eHealth and Humans and neoplasms and patient-centered care and person-centered care and Quality of Life and Self Care/*methods and self-care and stroke and telemedicine and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2015/03/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Past-year prevalence of exposure to FV is known to be highest in AYAs and has severe consequences. Peer support is an effective approach to behavior change and the Internet is considered suitable as a mode of delivery. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate both effectiveness and feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and feasibility study of the Internet-based self-support method ""Feel the ViBe"" (FtV) using mixed-methods approach to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of a new intervention. METHODS: AYAs aged 12-25 years and exposed to FV were randomized in an intervention group (access to FtV + usual care) and a control group (minimally enhanced usual care) after they self-registered themselves. From June 2012 to July 2014, participants completed the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and Depression (DEP) and Anxiety (ANX) subscales of the Symptom CheckList-90-R (SCL-90) every 6 weeks. The Web Evaluation Questionnaire was completed after 12 weeks. Quantitative usage data were collected using Google analytics and content management system (CMS) logs and data files. A univariate analysis of variance (UNIANOVA) and mixed model analysis (intention-to-treat [ITT], complete case) were used to compare groups. Pre-post t tests were used to find within-group effects. Feasibility measures structurally address the findings. The CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH) checklist was closely followed. RESULTS: In total, 31 out of 46 participants in the intervention group and 26 out of 47 participants in the control group started FtV. Seventeen participants (intervention: n=8, control: n=9) completed all questionnaires. Mixed model analysis showed significant differences between groups on the SCL-90 DEP (P=.04) and ANX (P=.049) subscales between 6 and 12 weeks after participation started. UNIANOVA showed no significant differences. Pre-post paired sample t tests showed significant improvements after 12 weeks for the SCL-90 DEP (P=.03) and ANX (P=.046) subscales. Reported mean Web-based time per week was 2.83 with a session time of 36 min. FtV was rated a mean 7.47 (1-10 Likert scale) with a helpfulness score of 3.16 (1-5 Likert scale). All participants felt safe. Two-thirds of the intervention participants started regular health care. CONCLUSIONS: No changes on the IES were found. SCL-90 DEP and ANX showed promising results; however, the calculated sample size was not reached (n=18). FtV functions best as a first step for adolescents and young adults in an early stage of change. FtV can be easily implemented without extensive resources and fits best in the field of public health care or national governmental care.

However, there are no studies on how the Saudi Arabian population seeks health information. Details about the most used and trusted sources of health information among the public will help health authorities and public awareness accounts on social media to effectively disseminate health information. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the types of sources accessed by the Saudi Arabian population while seeking health information, as well as their level of trust in the sources and to assess the impact of these sources on their perception of medical knowledge and health decision-making. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the objectives. The study population included both men and women who were aged 16 years or more and visited primary care clinics at King Khalid University Hospital. Four hundred and thirteen participants were sampled using the simple random method, and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA). RESULTS: A total of 413 participants were included in this study, and of these, 99 (24.0%) were males and 206 (49.9%) had a bachelor's degree. Doctors were chosen as the first source of information by 87.6% (283/323) of the participants, and they were completely trusted by most of the population (326/411, 79.3%). The second most commonly used source was pharmacists (112/194, 57.7%), and they were partially trusted by 41.4% (159/384) of the participants. Internet searches, social media, and traditional medicine were not prioritized by most of the participants as the first or second source of health information. The majority of the participants did not trust information obtained from social media, and WhatsApp was the most untrusted source. Almost half of the respondents (197/413, 47.7%) acknowledged that various sources of information can often help them understand their health problems. However, the majority disagreed on substituting a doctor's prescription with information obtained from the internet or a friend or relative. CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians were preferred and highly trusted, internet sources appeared to impact the medical knowledge of the population. The population still preferred to use internet search to obtain health information prior to a doctor's visit.",2020,10.2196/14414,22,3,e14414,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*health information sources and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *health perception and *medical information sources and *satisfaction and *social media and *trust and Adolescent and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Female and health information sources and health perception and Humans and Internet and Male and medical information sources and Middle Aged and satisfaction and Saudi Arabia and social media and trust and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/03/19/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hjollund_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Health Data Processes: A Framework for Analyzing and Discussing Efficient Use and Reuse of Health Data With a Focus on Patient-Reported Outcome Measures,"Hjollund, Niels Henrik Ingvar and Valderas, Jose Maria and Kyte, Derek and Calvert, Melanie Jane",Journal of medical Internet research,"The collection and use of patient health data are central to any kind of activity in the health care system. These data may be produced during routine clinical processes or obtained directly from the patient using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Although efficiency and other reasons justify data availability for a range of potentially relevant uses, these data are nearly always collected for a single specific purpose. The health care literature reflects this narrow scope, and there is limited literature on the joint use of health data for daily clinical use, clinical research, surveillance, and administrative purposes. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework for discussing the efficient use of health data with a specific focus on the role of PRO measures. PRO data may be used at an individual patient level to inform patient care or shared decision making and to tailor care to individual needs or group-level needs as a complement to health record data, such as that on mortality and readmission, in order to inform service delivery and measure the real-world effectiveness of treatment. PRO measures may be used either for their own sake, to provide valuable information from the patient perspective, or as a proxy for clinical data that would otherwise not be feasible to collect. We introduce a framework to analyze any health care activity that involves health data. The framework consists of four data processes (patient identification, data collection, data aggregation and data use), further structured into two dichotomous dimensions in each data process (level: group vs patient; timeframe: ad hoc vs systematic). This framework is used to analyze various health activities with respect to joint use of data, considering the technical, legal, organizational, and logistical challenges that characterize each data process. Finally, we propose a model for joint use of health data with data collected during follow-up as a base. Demands for health data will continue to increase, which will further add to the need for the concerted use and reuse of PRO data for parallel purposes. Repeated and uncoordinated PRO data collection for the same patient for different purposes results in misuse of resources for the patient and the health care system as well as reduced response rates owing to questionnaire fatigue. PRO data can be routinely collected both at the hospital (from inpatients as well as outpatients) and outside of hospital settings; in primary or social care settings; or in the patient's home, provided the health informatics infrastructure is in place. In the future, clinical settings are likely to be a prominent source of PRO data; however, we are also likely to see increased remote collection of PRO data by patients in their own home (telePRO). Data collection for research and quality surveillance will have to adapt to this circumstance and adopt complementary data capture methods that take advantage of the utility of PRO data collected during daily clinical practice. The European Union's regulation with respect to the protection of personal data-General Data Protection Regulation-imposes severe restrictions on the use of health data for parallel purposes, and steps should be taken to alleviate the consequences while still protecting personal data against misuse.",2019,10.2196/12412,21,5,e12412,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*data collection and *medical informatics and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *patient-physician relationship and *patient-reported outcome and data collection and Data Collection/*methods and Humans and medical informatics and Medical Informatics/*methods and Medical Records Systems, Computerized/*standards and patient-physician relationship and patient-reported outcome and Physician-Patient Relations",NA,NA,2019/05/21/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Passive and ubiquitous digital tracking and wearable devices may provide more accurate estimates of sleep duration and quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify trends in sleep duration and quality in New York City based on 2 million nights of data from users of a popular mobile sleep app. METHODS: We examined sleep duration and quality using 2,161,067 nights of data captured from 2015 to 2018 by Sleep Cycle, a popular sleep-tracking app. In this analysis, we explored differences in sleep parameters based on demographic factors, including age and sex. We used graphical matrix representations of data (heat maps) and geospatial analyses to compare sleep duration (in hours) and sleep quality (based on time in bed, deep sleep time, sleep consistency, and number of times fully awake), considering potential effects of day of the week and seasonality. RESULTS: Women represented 46.43% (1,003,421/2,161,067) of the sample, and men represented 53.57% (1,157,646/2,161,067) of individuals in the sample. The average age of the sample was 31.0 years (SD 10.6). The mean sleep duration of the total sample was 7.11 hours (SD 1.4). Women slept longer on average (mean 7.27 hours, SD 1.4) than men (mean 7 hours, SD 1.3; P<.001). Trend analysis indicated longer sleep duration and higher sleep quality among older individuals than among younger (P<.001). On average, sleep duration was longer on the weekend nights (mean 7.19 hours, SD 1.5) than on weeknights (mean 7.09 hours, SD 1.3; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study of data from a commercially available sleep tracker showed that women experienced longer sleep duration and higher sleep quality in nearly every age group than men, and a low proportion of young adults obtained the recommended sleep duration.

Jay_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Natural Language Search Interfaces: Health Data Needs Single-Field Variable Search,"Jay, Caroline and Harper, Simon and Dunlop, Ian and Smith, Sam and Sufi, Shoaib and Goble, Carole and Buchan, Iain",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Data discovery, particularly the discovery of key variables and their inter-relationships, is key to secondary data analysis, and in-turn, the evolving field of data science. Interface designers have presumed that their users are domain experts, and so they have provided complex interfaces to support these ""experts."" Such interfaces hark back to a time when searches needed to be accurate first time as there was a high computational cost associated with each search. Our work is part of a governmental research initiative between the medical and social research funding bodies to improve the use of social data in medical research. OBJECTIVE: The cross-disciplinary nature of data science can make no assumptions regarding the domain expertise of a particular scientist, whose interests may intersect multiple domains. Here we consider the common requirement for scientists to seek archived data for secondary analysis. This has more in common with search needs of the ""Google generation"" than with their single-domain, single-tool forebears. Our study compares a Google-like interface with traditional ways of searching for noncomplex health data in a data archive. METHODS: Two user interfaces are evaluated for the same set of tasks in extracting data from surveys stored in the UK Data Archive (UKDA). One interface, Web search, is ""Google-like,"" enabling users to browse, search for, and view metadata about study variables, whereas the other, traditional search, has standard multioption user interface. RESULTS: Using a comprehensive set of tasks with 20 volunteers, we found that the Web search interface met data discovery needs and expectations better than the traditional search. A task * interface repeated measures analysis showed a main effect indicating that answers found through the Web search interface were more likely to be correct (F1,19=37.3, P<.001), with a main effect of task (F3,57=6.3, P<.001). Further, participants completed the task significantly faster using the Web search interface (F1,19=18.0, P<.001). There was also a main effect of task (F2,38=4.1, P=.025, Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied). Overall, participants were asked to rate learnability, ease of use, and satisfaction. Paired mean comparisons showed that the Web search interface received significantly higher ratings than the traditional search interface for learnability (P=.002, 95% CI [0.6-2.4]), ease of use (P<.001, 95% CI [1.2-3.2]), and satisfaction (P<.001, 95% CI [1.8-3.5]). The results show superior cross-domain usability of Web search, which is consistent with its general familiarity and with enabling queries to be refined as the search proceeds, which treats serendipity as part of the refinement.

Sbaffi_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Information Overload in Emergency Medicine Physicians: A Multisite Case Study Exploring the Causes, Impact, and Solutions in Four North England National Health Service Trusts","Sbaffi, Laura and Walton, James and Blenkinsopp, John and Walton, Graham",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Information overload is affecting modern society now more than ever because of the wide and increasing distribution of digital technologies. Social media, emails, and online communications among others infuse a sense of urgency as information must be read, produced, and exchanged almost instantaneously. Emergency medicine is a medical specialty that is particularly affected by information overload with consequences on patient care that are difficult to quantify and address. Understanding the current causes of medical information overload, their impact on patient care, and strategies to handle the inflow of constant information is crucial to alleviating stress and anxiety that is already crippling the profession. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and evaluate the main causes and sources of medical information overload, as experienced by emergency medicine physicians in selected National Health Service (NHS) trusts in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This study used a quantitative, survey-based data collection approach including close- and open-ended questions. A web-based survey was distributed to emergency physicians to assess the impact of medical information overload on their jobs. In total, 101 valid responses were collected from 4 NHS trusts in north England. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, independent sample two-tailed t tests, and one-way between-group analysis of variance with post hoc tests were performed on the data. Open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key topics. RESULTS: The vast majority of respondents agreed that information overload is a serious issue in emergency medicine, and it increases with time. The always available culture (mean 5.40, SD 1.56), email handling (mean 4.86, SD 1.80), and multidisciplinary communications (mean 4.51, SD 1.61) are the 3 main reasons leading to information overload. Due to this, emergency physicians experience guideline fatigue, stress and tension, longer working hours, and impaired decision making, among other issues. Aspects of information overload are also reported to have different impacts on physicians depending on demographic factors such as age, years spent in emergency medicine, and level of employment. CONCLUSIONS: There is a serious concern regarding information overload in emergency medicine. Participants identified a considerable number of daily causes affecting their job, particularly the traditional culture of emergency departments being always available on the ward, exacerbated by email and other forms of communication necessary to maintain optimal, evidence-based practice standards. However, not all information is unwelcome, as physicians also need to stay updated with the latest guidelines on conditions and treatment, and communicate with larger medical teams to provide quality care.",2020,10.2196/19126,22,7,e19126,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*emergency medicine and *information overload and *national health care system and *physicians and Adult and Electronic Data Processing/*methods and emergency medicine and Emergency Medicine/*standards and England and Humans and information overload and Middle Aged and national health care system and physicians and Physicians/*standards and Surveys and Questionnaires and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/07/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Speech recognition correctness and clinicians' preferences were evaluated using 15 recorder-microphone combinations, six documents, three speakers, Dragon Medical 11, and five survey/interview participants. Information extraction correctness evaluation used 260 documents, six-class classification for each word, two annotators, and the CRF++ conditional random field toolkit. RESULTS: A noise-cancelling lapel-microphone with a digital voice recorder gave the best correctness (79%). This microphone was also the most preferred option by all but one participant. Although the participants liked the small size of this recorder, their preference was for tablets that can also be used for document proofing and sign-off, among other tasks. Accented speech was harder to recognize than native language and a male speaker was detected better than a female speaker. Information extraction was excellent in filtering out irrelevant text (85% F1) and identifying text relevant to two classes (87% and 70% F1). Similarly to the annotators' disagreements, there was confusion between the remaining three classes, which explains the modest 62% macro-averaged F1. DISCUSSION: We present evidence for the feasibility of speech recognition and information extraction to support clinicians' in entering text and unlock its content for computerized decision-making and surveillance in healthcare.

Bray_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Acceptability and Impact of the Xploro Digital Therapeutic Platform to Inform and Prepare Children for Planned Procedures in a Hospital: Before and After Evaluation Study,"Bray, Lucy and Sharpe, Ashley and Gichuru, Phillip and Fortune, Peter-Marc and Blake, Lucy and Appleton, Victoria",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in finding novel approaches to improve the preparation of children for hospital procedures such as surgery, x-rays, and blood tests. Well-prepared and informed children have better outcomes (less procedural anxiety and higher satisfaction). A digital therapeutic (DTx) platform (Xploro) was developed with children to provide health information through gamification, serious games, a chatbot, and an augmented reality avatar. OBJECTIVE: This before and after evaluation study aims to assess the acceptability of the Xploro DTx and examine its impact on children and their parent's procedural knowledge, procedural anxiety, and reported experiences when attending a hospital for a planned procedure. METHODS: We used a mixed methods design with quantitative measures and qualitative data collected sequentially from a group of children who received standard hospital information (before group) and a group of children who received the DTx intervention (after group). Participants were children aged between 8 and 14 years and their parents who attended a hospital for a planned clinical procedure at a children's hospital in North West England. Children and their parents completed self-report measures (perceived knowledge, procedural anxiety, procedural satisfaction, and procedural involvement) at baseline, preprocedure, and postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 80 children (n=40 standard care group and n=40 intervention group) and their parents participated in the study; the children were aged between 8 and 14 years (average 10.4, SD 2.27 years) and were attending a hospital for a range of procedures. The children in the intervention group reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety before the procedure than those in the standard group (two-tailed t(63.64)=2.740; P=.008). The children in the intervention group also felt more involved in their procedure than those in the standard group (t(75)=-2.238; P=.03). The children in the intervention group also reported significantly higher levels of perceived procedural knowledge preprocedure (t(59.98)=-4.892; P=.001) than those in the standard group. As for parents, those with access to the Xploro intervention reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety preprocedure than those who did not (t(68.51)=1.985; P=.05). During the semistructured write and tell interviews, children stated that they enjoyed using the intervention, it was fun and easy to use, and they felt that it had positively influenced their experiences of coming to the hospital for a procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the DTx platform, Xploro, has a positive impact on children attending a hospital for a procedure by reducing levels of procedural anxiety. The children and parents in the intervention group described Xploro as improving their experiences and being easy and fun to use.",2020,10.2196/17367,22,8,e17367,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *augmented reality and *children and *health and *health literacy and *procedure and Adolescent and Anxiety/*psychology and artificial intelligence and augmented reality and Child and Child Health Services/*organization & administration and Child, Hospitalized/*psychology and children and Female and health and health literacy and Hospitals, Pediatric/*standards and Humans and Male and procedure",NA,NA,2020/08/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lattie_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Practical Do-It-Yourself Recruitment Framework for Concurrent eHealth Clinical Trials: Identification of Efficient and Cost-Effective Methods for Decision Making (Part 2),"Lattie, Emily G. and Kaiser, Susan M. and Alam, Nameyeh and Tomasino, Kathryn N. and Sargent, Elizabeth and Rubanovich, Caryn Kseniya and Palac, Hannah L. and Mohr, David C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The ability to successfully recruit participants for electronic health (eHealth) clinical trials is largely dependent on the use of efficient and effective recruitment strategies. Determining which types of recruitment strategies to use presents a challenge for many researchers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present an analysis of the time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of recruitment strategies for eHealth clinical trials, and it describes a framework for cost-effective trial recruitment. METHODS: Participants were recruited for one of 5 eHealth trials of interventions for common mental health conditions. A multipronged recruitment approach was used, including digital (eg, social media and Craigslist), research registry-based, print (eg, flyers and posters on public transportation), clinic-based (eg, a general internal medicine clinic within an academic medical center and a large nonprofit health care organization), a market research recruitment firm, and traditional media strategies (eg, newspaper and television coverage in response to press releases). The time costs and fees for each recruitment method were calculated, and the participant yield on recruitment costs was calculated by dividing the number of enrolled participants by the total cost for each method. RESULTS: A total of 777 participants were enrolled across all trials. Digital recruitment strategies yielded the largest number of participants across the 5 clinical trials and represented 34.0% (264/777) of the total enrolled participants. Registry-based recruitment strategies were in second place by enrolling 28.0% (217/777) of the total enrolled participants across trials. Research registry-based recruitment had a relatively high conversion rate from potential participants who contacted our center for being screened to be enrolled, and it was also the most cost-effective for enrolling participants in this set of clinical trials with a total cost per person enrolled at US $8.99. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, a framework is proposed for participant recruitment. To make decisions on initiating and maintaining different types of recruitment strategies, the resources available and requirements of the research study (or studies) need to be carefully examined.",2018,10.2196/11050,20,11,e11050,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*eHealth and *mental health and *mHealth and *recruitment and Adult and Clinical Trials as Topic/*economics and Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods and Decision Making/*physiology and eHealth and Female and Humans and Male and mental health and mHealth and recruitment and Telemedicine/*economics,NA,NA,2018/11/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Electronic health records are generally used to capture these symptoms during medical consultation. Internet and mobile technologies provide the opportunity to monitor symptoms emerging in patients' environments using ecological momentary assessment techniques to support preventive therapeutic decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the acceptability of a Web-based app designed to collect medical data during appointments and provide ecological momentary assessment features. METHODS: We recruited clinicians at 4 community psychiatry departments in France to participate. They used the app to assess patients and to collect data after viewing a video of a young patient's emerging psychiatric consultation. We then asked them to answer a short anonymous self-administered questionnaire that evaluated their experience, the acceptability of the app, and their habit of using new technologies. RESULTS: Of 24 practitioners invited, 21 (88%) agreed to participate. Most of them were between 25 and 45 years old, and greater age was not associated with poorer acceptability. Most of the practitioners regularly used new technologies, and 95% (20/21) connected daily to the internet, with 70% (15/21) connecting 3 times a day or more. However, only 57% (12/21) reported feeling comfortable with computers. Of the clinicians, 86% (18/21) would recommend the tool to their colleagues and 67% (14/21) stated that they would be interested in daily use of the app. Most of the clinicians (16/21, 76%) found the interface easy to use and useful. However, several clinicians noted the lack of readability (8/21, 38%) and the need to improve ergonometric features (4/21, 19%), in particular to facilitate browsing through various subsections. Some participants (5/21, 24%) were concerned about the storage of medical data and most of them (11/21, 52%) seemed to be uncomfortable with this. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first step of the development of a Web app combining an electronic health record and ecological momentary assessment features. This online tool offers the possibility to assess patients and to integrate medical data easily into face-to-face conditions. The acceptability of this app supports the feasibility of its broader implementation. This app could help to standardize assessment and to build up a strong database. Used in conjunction with robust data mining analytic techniques, such a database would allow exploration of risk factors, patterns of symptom evolution, and identification of distinct risk subgroups.",2019,10.2196/10111,21,4,e10111,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*acceptability and *decision support systems, clinical and *ecological momentary assessment and *feasibility studies and *internet and *mental health and *mobile applications and *outpatients and *prodromal symptoms and *young adult and acceptability and Adult and decision support systems, clinical and ecological momentary assessment and Ecological Momentary Assessment/*standards and feasibility studies and Female and Humans and internet and Mental Disorders/*diagnosis and mental health and Middle Aged and mobile applications and outpatients and prodromal symptoms and Prospective Studies and young adult",NA,NA,2019/04/25/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Eichenberg_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Attitudes of Therapists and Physicians on the Use of Sex Robots in Sexual Therapy: Online Survey and Interview Study,"Eichenberg, Christiane and Khamis, Marwa and Hubner, Lisa",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Various types of robots have already been successfully used in medical care, and the use of new technologies is also playing an increasing role in the area of sexuality. Sex robots are marketed as advanced sex toys and sex dolls with artificial intelligence. Only a few considerations about the therapeutic use of sex robots in sexual therapy are debated in expert discussions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a first exploratory survey on the attitudes of sex therapists and physicians toward the therapeutic benefits of sex robots. METHODS: This study comprised a quantitative online survey and a qualitative interview study. A self-constructed questionnaire was used to survey the general attitudes of sex therapists and physicians regarding the benefits of sex robots in therapy. The qualitative study was designed to gain in-depth insight into the participants' beliefs and attitudes. Therefore, semistructured interviews were conducted. The quantitative data were evaluated by statistical analysis, and the interviews were transcribed and analyzed by using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: A total of 72 sex therapists and physicians completed our self-constructed questionnaire (response rate 15%, 72/480). Only a few respondents (11%, 8/72) said that the use of sex robots was not conceivable for them, and almost half of all therapists and physicians could imagine recommending sex robots in therapy (45%, 33/72). The attitude toward sex robots as a therapeutic tool was very heterogeneous, with gender (P=.006), age (P=.03), and occupational differences (P=.05); female therapists, older therapists, and psychologists (in contrast to physicians) were more critical toward the therapeutic use of sex robots. The analysis of the 5 interviews identified 3 high-level core themes that were representative of the participants' responses: (1) the importance of the personal definition of sex robots for the assessment of their therapeutic benefits, (2) therapeutic benefits and dangers of sex robots, and (3) considerations on the quality of human-robot sexuality. Initial insights into the possible therapeutic use of sex robots in different disorders (eg, sexual dysfunction or pedophilia) and situations were gained from the perspective of sex therapists. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a first overview of the potential therapeutic use of sex robots. Moral, ethical, and treatment-related issues in this context are still unresolved and need to be further researched. We suggest integrating the topic into the training of sex therapists to form opinions beyond media images and to show therapy possibilities. Scientists engaged in sexual research should be involved in the development of sex robots to design robots with positive effects on sexual education, sexual therapy, sexual counseling, and sexual well-being for interested groups.",2019,10.2196/13853,21,8,e13853,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Attitude of Health Personnel and *robotics and *sexual health and *therapy and Adult and Allied Health Personnel/*psychology and Female and Humans and Interview, Psychological and Male and Middle Aged and Physicians/*psychology and Psychotherapy/instrumentation/methods and robotics and Robotics/*methods and Sexual Behavior/*psychology and sexual health and Surveys and Questionnaires and therapy",NA,NA,2019/08/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Safi_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Technical Aspects of Developing Chatbots for Medical Applications: Scoping Review,"Safi, Zeineb and Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa and Khalifa, Mohamed and Househ, Mowafa",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Chatbots are applications that can conduct natural language conversations with users. In the medical field, chatbots have been developed and used to serve different purposes. They provide patients with timely information that can be critical in some scenarios, such as access to mental health resources. Since the development of the first chatbot, ELIZA, in the late 1960s, much effort has followed to produce chatbots for various health purposes developed in different ways. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the technical aspects and development methodologies associated with chatbots used in the medical field to explain the best methods of development and support chatbot development researchers on their future work. METHODS: We searched for relevant articles in 8 literature databases (IEEE, ACM, Springer, ScienceDirect, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar). We also performed forward and backward reference checking of the selected articles. Study selection was performed by one reviewer, and 50% of the selected studies were randomly checked by a second reviewer. A narrative approach was used for result synthesis. Chatbots were classified based on the different technical aspects of their development. The main chatbot components were identified in addition to the different techniques for implementing each module. RESULTS: The original search returned 2481 publications, of which we identified 45 studies that matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common language of communication between users and chatbots was English (n=23). We identified 4 main modules: text understanding module, dialog management module, database layer, and text generation module. The most common technique for developing text understanding and dialogue management is the pattern matching method (n=18 and n=25, respectively). The most common text generation is fixed output (n=36). Very few studies relied on generating original output. Most studies kept a medical knowledge base to be used by the chatbot for different purposes throughout the conversations. A few studies kept conversation scripts and collected user data and previous conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Many chatbots have been developed for medical use, at an increasing rate. There is a recent, apparent shift in adopting machine learning-based approaches for developing chatbot systems. Further research can be conducted to link clinical outcomes to different chatbot development techniques and technical characteristics.",2020,10.2196/19127,22,12,e19127,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*chatbots and *conversational agents and *medical applications and *scoping review and *technical aspects and chatbots and Communication and conversational agents and Humans and medical applications and Mobile Applications/*standards and Research Design and scoping review and technical aspects,NA,NA,2020/12/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Manigault_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Assessment of unconscious decision aids applied to complex patient-centered medical decisions,"Manigault, Andrew Wilhelm and Handley, Ian Michael and Whillock, Summer Rain",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: To improve patient health, recent research urges for medical decision aids that are designed to enhance the effectiveness of specific medically related decisions. Many such decisions involve complex information, and decision aids that independently use deliberative (analytical and slower) or intuitive (more affective and automatic) cognitive processes for such decisions result in suboptimal decisions. Unconscious thought can arguably use both intuitive and deliberative (slow and analytic) processes, and this combination may further benefit complex patient (or practitioner) decisions as medical decision aids. Indeed, mounting research demonstrates that individuals render better decisions generally if they are distracted from thinking consciously about complex information after it is presented (but can think unconsciously), relative to thinking about that information consciously or not at all. OBJECTIVE: The current research tested whether the benefits of unconscious thought processes can be replicated using an Internet platform for a patient medical decision involving complex information. This research also explored the possibility that judgments reported after a period of unconscious thought are actually the result of a short period of conscious deliberation occurring during the decision report phase. METHODS: A total of 173 participants in a Web-based experiment received information about four medical treatments, the best (worst) associated with mostly positive (negative) side-effects/attributes and the others with equal positive-negative ratios. Next, participants were either distracted for 3 minutes (unconscious thought), instructed to think about the information for 3 minutes (conscious thought), or moved directly to the decision task (immediate decision). Finally, participants reported their choice of, and attitudes toward, the treatments while experiencing high, low, or no cognitive load, which varied their ability to think consciously while reporting judgments. Cognitive load was manipulated by having participants memorize semi-random (high), line structured (low), or no dot patterns and recall these intermittently with their decision reports. Overall then, participants were randomly assigned to the conditions of a 3 (thought condition) by 3 (cognitive-load level) between-subjects design. RESULTS: A logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of participants choosing the best treatment were 2.25 times higher in the unconscious-thought condition compared to the immediate-decision condition (b=.81, Wald=4.32, P=.04, 95% CI 1.048-4.836), and 2.39 times greater compared to the conscious-thought condition (b=.87, Wald=4.87, P=.027, 95% CI 1.103-5.186). No difference was observed between the conscious-thought condition compared to the immediate-decision condition, and cognitive load manipulations did not affect choices or alter the above finding. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates a plausible benefit of unconscious thinking as a decision aid for complex medical decisions, and represents the first use of unconscious thought processes as a patient-centered medical decision aid. Further, the quality of decisions reached unconsciously does not appear to be affected by the amount of cognitive load participants experienced.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3739,17,2,e37,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Decision Making and *Decision Support Techniques and *Internet and *Unconscious, Psychology and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and Attitude and Choice Behavior and cognitive load and decision and Female and Humans and intuition and judgment and Male and medical and Middle Aged and patient-centered and Thinking and thought and unconscious and Young Adult",NA,NA,2015/02/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Li_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Personalized Voice-Based Diet Assistant for Caregivers of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: System Development and Validation,"Li, Juan and Maharjan, Bikesh and Xie, Bo and Tao, Cui",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The world's aging population is increasing, with an expected increase in the prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Proper nutrition and good eating behavior show promise for preventing and slowing the progression of ADRD and consequently improving patients with ADRD's health status and quality of life. Most ADRD care is provided by informal caregivers, so assisting caregivers to manage patients with ADRD's diet is important. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design, develop, and test an artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant to help informal caregivers manage the daily diet of patients with ADRD and learn food and nutrition-related knowledge. METHODS: The voice assistant is being implemented in several steps: construction of a comprehensive knowledge base with ontologies that define ADRD diet care and user profiles, and is extended with external knowledge graphs; management of conversation between users and the voice assistant; personalized ADRD diet services provided through a semantics-based knowledge graph search and reasoning engine; and system evaluation in use cases with additional qualitative evaluations. RESULTS: A prototype voice assistant was evaluated in the lab using various use cases. Preliminary qualitative test results demonstrate reasonable rates of dialogue success and recommendation correctness. CONCLUSIONS: The voice assistant provides a natural, interactive interface for users, and it does not require the user to have a technical background, which may facilitate senior caregivers' use in their daily care tasks.

Schulz_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Influence of Health Literacy on Effects of Patient Rating Websites: Survey Study Using a Hypothetical Situation and Fictitious Doctors,"Schulz, Peter Johannes and Rothenfluh, Fabia",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Physician rating websites (PRWs) are a device people use actively and passively, although their objective capabilities are insufficient when it comes to judging the medical performance and qualification of physicians. PRWs are an innovation born of the potential of the Internet and boosted very much by the longstanding policy of improving and encouraging patient participation in medical decision-making. A mismatch is feared between patient motivations to participate and their capabilities of doing so well. Awareness of such a mismatch might contribute to some skepticism of patient-written physician reviews on PRWs. OBJECTIVE: We intend to test whether health literacy is able to dampen the effects that a patient-written review of a physician's performance might have on physician choice. METHODS: An experiment was conducted within a survey interview. Participants were put into a fictitious decision situation in which they had to choose between two physicians on the basis of their profiles on a PRW. One of the physician profiles contained the experimental stimulus in the form of a friendly and a critical written review. The dependent variable was physician choice. An attitude differential, trust differential, and two measures of health literacy, the newest vital sign as an example of a performance-based measure and eHealth Literacy Scale as an example of a perception-based measure, were tested for roles as intermediary variables. Analysis traced the influence of the review tendency on the dependent variables and a possible moderating effect of health literacy on these influences. RESULTS: Reviews of a physician's competence and medical skill affected participant choice of a physician. High health literacy dampened these effects only in the case of the perception-based measure and only for the negative review. Correspondingly, the effect of the review tendency appeared to be stronger for the positive review. Attitudes and trust only affected physician choice when included as covariants, considerably increasing the variance explained by regression models. CONCLUSIONS: Findings sustain physician worries that even one negative PRW review can affect patient choice and damage doctors' reputations. Hopes that health literacy might raise awareness of the poor basis of physician reviews and ratings given by patients have some foundation.",2020,10.2196/14134,22,4,e14134,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*experiment and *patient feedback and *physician competence assessment and *physician rating websites and *Physician-Patient Relations and *warning messages and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and experiment and Female and Health Literacy/*methods and Humans and Internet/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and patient feedback and physician competence assessment and physician rating websites and Physicians/*standards and Surveys and Questionnaires and Telemedicine and warning messages and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/04/06/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such a community evaluation has not been previously executed. Task 1a included a total of 22 system submissions, and Task 1b included 17. Most of the systems employed a combination of rules and machine learners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a subset of the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) corpus of annotated clinical text--199 clinical notes for training and 99 for testing (roughly 180 K words in total). We provided the community with the annotated gold standard training documents to build systems to identify and normalize disorder mentions. The systems were tested on a held-out gold standard test set to measure their performance. RESULTS: For Task 1a, the best-performing system achieved an F1 score of 0.75 (0.80 precision; 0.71 recall). For Task 1b, another system performed best with an accuracy of 0.59. DISCUSSION: Most of the participating systems used a hybrid approach by supplementing machine-learning algorithms with features generated by rules and gazetteers created from the training data and from external resources.

Challenges include how to connect the somewhat abstract nature of classroom-based PBL with clinical practice and how to maintain learner engagement in the process of PBL over time. OBJECTIVE: A study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of decision-PBL (D-PBL), a variant form of PBL that replaces linear PBL cases with virtual patients. These Web-based interactive cases provided learners with a series of patient management pathways. Learners were encouraged to consider and discuss courses of action, take their chosen management pathway, and experience the consequences of their decisions. A Web-based application was essential to allow scenarios to respond dynamically to learners' decisions, to deliver the scenarios to multiple PBL classrooms in the same timeframe, and to record centrally the paths taken by the PBL groups. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial in crossover design was run involving all learners (N=81) in the second year of the graduate entry stream for the undergraduate medicine program at St George's University of London. Learners were randomized to study groups; half engaged in a D-PBL activity whereas the other half had a traditional linear PBL activity on the same subject material. Groups alternated D-PBL and linear PBL over the semester. The measure was mean cohort performance on specific face-to-face exam questions at the end of the semester. RESULTS: D-PBL groups performed better than linear PBL groups on questions related to D-PBL with the difference being statistically significant for all questions. Differences between the exam performances of the 2 groups were not statistically significant for the questions not related to D-PBL. The effect sizes for D-PBL-related questions were large and positive (>0.6) except for 1 question that showed a medium positive effect size. The effect sizes for questions not related to D-PBL were all small (<e2><89><a4>0.3) with a mix of positive and negative values. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of D-PBL was indicated by improved exam performance for learners who had D-PBL compared to those who had linear PBL. This suggests that the use of D-PBL leads to better midterm learning outcomes than linear PBL, at least for learners with prior experience with linear PBL. On the basis of tutor and student feedback, St George's University of London and the University of Nicosia, Cyprus have replaced paper PBL cases for midstage undergraduate teaching with D-PBL virtual patients, and 6 more institutions in the ePBLnet partnership will be implementing D-PBL in Autumn 2015.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3748,16,11,e240,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Internet and *Patient Simulation and *Problem-Based Learning and Computer-Assisted Instruction and Cross-Over Studies and curriculum and decision making and education, medical and Education, Medical, Undergraduate/*methods and Female and Humans and London and Male and problem-based learning and virtual patients",NA,NA,2014/11/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Langford_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,"Mobile Phone Ownership, Health Apps, and Tablet Use in US Adults With a Self-Reported History of Hypertension: Cross-Sectional Study","Langford, Aisha T. and Solid, Craig A. and Scott, Ebony and Lad, Meeki and Maayan, Eli and Williams, Stephen K. and Seixas, Azizi A.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone and tablet ownership have increased in the United States over the last decade, contributing to the growing use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to help patients manage chronic health conditions like diabetes. However, few studies have characterized mobile device ownership and the presence of health-related apps on mobile devices in people with a self-reported history of hypertension. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of smartphone, tablet, and basic mobile phone ownership and the presence of health apps by sociodemographic factors and self-reported hypertension status (ie, history) in a nationally representative sample of US adults, and to describe whether mobile devices are associated with health goal achievement, medical decision making, and patient-provider communication. METHODS: Data from 3285 respondents from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey were analyzed. Participants were asked if they owned a smartphone, tablet, or basic mobile phone and if they had health apps on a smartphone or tablet. Participants were also asked if their smartphones or tablets helped them achieve a health-related goal like losing weight, make a decision about how to treat an illness, or talk with their health care providers. Chi-square analyses were conducted to test for differences in mobile device ownership, health app presence, and app helpfulness by patient characteristics. RESULTS: Approximately 1460 (37.6% weighted prevalence) participants reported a history of hypertension. Tablet and smartphone ownership were lower in participants with a history of hypertension than in those without a history of hypertension (55% vs 66%, P=.001, and 86% vs 68%, P<.001, respectively). Participants with a history of hypertension were more likely to own a basic mobile phone only as compared to those without a history of hypertension (16% vs 9%, P<.001). Among those with a history of hypertension exclusively, basic mobile phone, smartphone, and tablet ownership were associated with age and education, but not race or sex. Older adults were more likely to report having a basic mobile phone only, whereas those with higher education were more likely to report owning a tablet or smartphone. Compared to those without a history of hypertension, participants with a history of hypertension were less likely to have health-related apps on their smartphones or tablets (45% vs 30%, P<.001) and report that mobile devices helped them achieve a health-related goal (72% vs 63%, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increasing use of smartphones, tablets, and health-related apps, these tools are used less among people with a self-reported history of hypertension. To reach the widest cross-section of patients, a mix of novel mHealth interventions and traditional health communication strategies (eg, print, web based, and in person) are needed to support the diverse needs of people with a history of hypertension.",2019,10.2196/12228,7,1,e12228,eng,2291-5222,"*cell phone and *chronic disease and *goals and *health communication and *hypertension and *ownership and *smartphone and *tablets and *telemedicine and *text messaging and Adult and Aged and cell phone and Cell Phone/*statistics & numerical data and Chi-Square Distribution and chronic disease and Computers, Handheld/*statistics & numerical data and Cross-Sectional Studies and Female and goals and health communication and Humans and hypertension and Hypertension/epidemiology/*psychology and Male and Middle Aged and ownership and Ownership/*statistics & numerical data and Self Report/*statistics & numerical data and smartphone and Socioeconomic Factors and tablets and telemedicine and text messaging and United States/epidemiology",NA,NA,2019/01/14/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

So far, little data is available on the impact of such approaches on procedural learning and skill acquisition and their comparison with traditional approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of a blended learning approach, including Web-based virtual patients (VPs) and standard pediatric basic life support (PBLS) training, on procedural knowledge, objective performance, and self-assessment. METHODS: A total of 57 medical students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=30) and a control group (n=27). Both groups received paper handouts in preparation of simulation-based PBLS training. The intervention group additionally completed two Web-based VPs with embedded video clips. Measurements were taken at randomization (t0), after the preparation period (t1), and after hands-on training (t2). Clinical decision-making skills and procedural knowledge were assessed at t0 and t1. PBLS performance was scored regarding adherence to the correct algorithm, conformance to temporal demands, and the quality of procedural steps at t1 and t2. Participants' self-assessments were recorded in all three measurements. RESULTS: Procedural knowledge of the intervention group was significantly superior to that of the control group at t1. At t2, the intervention group showed significantly better adherence to the algorithm and temporal demands, and better procedural quality of PBLS in objective measures than did the control group. These aspects differed between the groups even at t1 (after VPs, prior to practical training). Self-assessments differed significantly only at t1 in favor of the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Training with VPs combined with hands-on training improves PBLS performance as judged by objective measures.",2015,10.2196/jmir.4141,17,7,e162,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Internet and *Patient Simulation and Adult and blended learning and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*education and Clinical Competence and Computer-Assisted Instruction/*methods and Female and Humans and Male and pediatric basic life support and Pediatrics/*education and performance and simulation and Students, Medical and virtual patients and Young Adult",NA,NA,2015/07/02/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yin_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Role of Technology in Self-Assessment and Feedback Among Hospitalist Physicians: Semistructured Interviews and Thematic Analysis,"Yin, Andrew Lukas and Gheissari, Pargol and Lin, Inna Wanyin and Sobolev, Michael and Pollak, John P. and Cole, Curtis and Estrin, Deborah",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Lifelong learning is embedded in the culture of medicine, but there are limited tools currently available for many clinicians, including hospitalists, to help improve their own practice. Although there are requirements for continuing medical education, resources for learning new clinical guidelines, and developing fields aimed at facilitating peer-to-peer feedback, there is a gap in the availability of tools that enable clinicians to learn based on their own patients and clinical decisions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the technologies or modifications to existing systems that could be used to benefit hospitalist physicians in pursuing self-assessment and improvement by understanding physicians' current practices and their reactions to proposed possibilities. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted in two separate stages with analysis performed after each stage. In the first stage, interviews (N=12) were conducted to understand the ways in which hospitalist physicians are currently gathering feedback and assessing their practice. A thematic analysis of these interviews informed the prototype used to elicit responses in the second stage. RESULTS: Clinicians actively look for feedback that they can apply to their practice, with the majority of the feedback obtained through self-assessment. The following three themes surrounding this aspect were identified in the first round of semistructured interviews: collaboration, self-reliance, and uncertainty, each with three related subthemes. Using a wireframe, the second round of interviews led to identifying the features that are currently challenging to use or could be made available with technology. CONCLUSIONS: Based on each theme and subtheme, we provide targeted recommendations for use by relevant stakeholders such as institutions, clinicians, and technologists. Most hospitalist self-assessments occur on a rolling basis, specifically using data in electronic medical records as their primary source. Specific objective data points or subjective patient relationships lead clinicians to review their patient cases and to assess their own performance. However, current systems are not built for these analyses or for clinicians to perform self-assessment, making this a burdensome and incomplete process. Building a platform that focuses on providing and curating the information used for self-assessment could help physicians make more accurately informed changes to their own clinical practice and decision-making.",2020,10.2196/23299,22,11,e23299,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"learning and Humans and Female and Male and assessment and feedback and electronic medical record and Self-Assessment and *digital health and *self-assessment and *assessment and *electronic medical record and *feedback and *hospitalist and *learning and *self-learning and Digital Technology/*methods and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Hospitalists/*standards and Interview, Psychological/*methods and digital health and hospitalist and self-assessment and self-learning",NA,NA,2020/11/03/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Timmers_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Educating Patients by Providing Timely Information Using Smartphone and Tablet Apps: Systematic Review,"Timmers, Thomas and Janssen, Loes and Kool, Rudolf B. and Kremer, Jan Am",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Patient education is a crucial element within health care. It is a known predictor for increased engagement in shared decision making, improved medication and treatment adherence, higher levels of satisfaction, and even better treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, often patients only remember a very limited amount of medical information. An important reason is that most patients are simply not capable of processing large amounts of new medical information in a short time. Apps for smartphones and tablets have the potential to actively educate patients by providing them with timely information through the use of push notifications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effects of using smartphone and tablet apps to educate patients with timely education. Within this review, we focused on patients that receive their care in a hospital setting. We assessed the effects of the interventions on outcomes, such as patients' knowledge about their illness and treatment, adherence to treatment instructions and to medication usage, and satisfaction with the care they received. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2015 and November 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched and screened articles, assessed study quality and risk of bias, and extracted the data. Due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes, a meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate. Instead, a narrative synthesis is presented. RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs with 4106 participants were included. Compared to usual care, overall effectiveness of the interventions was demonstrated in 69% of the outcomes. Effectiveness increased to 82% when the intervention had a duration shorter than one month and increased to 78% when the intervention provided at least one push notification per week. The interventions showed the highest effects on satisfaction with information, adherence to treatment instructions and to medication usage, clinical outcomes, and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that educating patients with timely medical information through their smartphones or tablets improves their levels of knowledge, medication or treatment adherence, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes, as well as having a positive effect on health care economics. These effects are most pronounced in interventions with a short duration (ie, less than a month) and with a high frequency of messages to patients (ie, once per week or more). With the knowledge that patient education is a predictor for improved outcomes and the fact that patients have obvious difficulties processing large amounts of new medical information, we suggest incorporating the delivery of timely information through smartphone and tablet apps within current medical practices.",2020,10.2196/17342,22,4,e17342,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*eHealth and *mobile phone and *patient education and *push notification and *self-care and *self-management and *smartphone and *tablet computer and *timely education and *timely information and eHealth and Humans and mobile phone and patient education and Patient Education as Topic/*methods and push notification and self-care and self-management and smartphone and Smartphone/*standards and tablet computer and Tablets/*standards and timely education and timely information,NA,NA,2020/04/13/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Drugs in the DDI tables from First DataBank (FDB), Micromedex, and Multum were mapped to RxNorm. The KBs were compared at the clinical drug, ingredient, and DDI rule levels. The KBs were evaluated against a reference list of highly significant DDIs from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). The KBs and the ONC list were applied to a prescription data set to simulate their use in clinical decision support. RESULTS: The KBs contained 1.6 million (FDB), 4.5 million (Micromedex), and 4.8 million (Multum) clinical drug pairs. Altogether, there were 8.6 million unique pairs, of which 79% were found only in 1 KB and 5% in all 3 KBs. However, there was generally more agreement than disagreement in the severity rankings, especially in the contraindicated category. The KBs covered 99.8-99.9% of the alerts of the ONC list and would have generated 25 (FDB), 145 (Micromedex), and 84 (Multum) alerts per 1000 prescriptions. CONCLUSION: The commercial KBs differ considerably in size and quantity of alerts generated. There is less variability in severity ranking of DDIs than suggested by previous studies. All KBs provide very good coverage of the ONC list. More work is needed to standardize the editorial policies and evidence for inclusion of DDIs to reduce variation among knowledge sources and improve relevance. Some DDIs considered contraindicated in all 3 KBs might be possible candidates to add to the ONC list.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocx010,24,4,806-812,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Drug Interactions and *Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted and *Knowledge Bases and clinical decision support and Clinical Decision-Making and commercial knowledge base and computerized physician order entry and drug-drug interaction and Humans and Medical Order Entry Systems and prescription decision support",NA,NA,2017/07/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to develop a novel Web- and mobile phone-based application to provide a dynamic CDSS by monitoring and analyzing practitioners' antipsychotic prescription habits and simultaneously linking these data to inpatients' symptom changes. METHODS: We recruited 353 psychiatric inpatients whose symptom levels and prescribed medications were inputted into the MEmind application. We standardized all medications in the MEmind database using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and the defined daily dose (DDD). For each patient, MEmind calculated an average for the daily dose prescribed for antipsychotics (using the N05A ATC code), prescribed daily dose (PDD), and the PDD to DDD ratio. RESULTS: MEmind results found that antipsychotics were used by 61.5% (217/353) of inpatients, with the largest proportion being patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (33.4%, 118/353). Of the 217 patients, 137 (63.2%, 137/217) were administered pharmacological monotherapy and 80 (36.8%, 80/217) were administered polytherapy. Antipsychotics were used mostly in schizophrenia spectrum and related psychotic disorders, but they were also prescribed in other nonpsychotic diagnoses. Notably, we observed polypharmacy going against current antipsychotics guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: MEmind data indicated that antipsychotic polypharmacy and off-label use in inpatient units is commonly practiced. MEmind holds the potential to create a dynamic CDSS that provides real-time tracking of prescription practices and symptom change. Such feedback can help practitioners determine a maximally therapeutic drug treatment while avoiding unproductive overprescription and off-label use.",2017,10.2196/jmir.5954,19,1,e25,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*antipsychotic agents and *Cell Phone and *clinical decision-making and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Electronic Prescribing and *Internet and *mobile applications and *off-label use and *prescriptions and *software and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and antipsychotic agents and Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use and clinical decision-making and Drug Prescriptions and Feasibility Studies and Female and Humans and Inpatients and Male and Middle Aged and mobile applications and off-label use and Pilot Projects and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and prescriptions and Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy and software and Young Adult",NA,NA,2017/01/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Golder_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Understanding Public Attitudes Toward Researchers Using Social Media for Detecting and Monitoring Adverse Events Data: Multi Methods Study,"Golder, Su and Scantlebury, Arabella and Christmas, Helen",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Adverse events are underreported in research studies, particularly randomized controlled trials and pharmacovigilance studies. A method that researchers could use to identify more complete safety profiles for medications is to use social media analytics. However, patient's perspectives on the ethical issues associated with using patient reports of adverse drug events on social media are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the ethics of using social media for detecting and monitoring adverse events for research purposes using a multi methods approach. METHODS: A multi methods design comprising qualitative semistructured interviews (n=24), a focus group (n=3), and 3 Web-based discussions (n=20) with members of the public was adopted. Findings from a recent systematic review on the use of social media for monitoring adverse events provided a theoretical framework to interpret the study's findings. RESULTS: Views were ascertained regarding the potential benefits and harms of the research, privacy expectations, informed consent, and social media platform. Although the majority of participants were supportive of social media content being used for research on adverse events, a small number of participants strongly opposed the idea. The potential benefit of the research was cited as the most influential factor to whether participants would give their consent to their data being used for research. There were also some caveats to people's support for the use of their social media data for research purposes: the type of social media platform and consideration of the vulnerability of the social media user. Informed consent was regarded as difficult to obtain and this divided the opinion on whether it should be sought. CONCLUSIONS: Social media users were generally positive about their social media data being used for research purposes; particularly for research on adverse events. However, approval was dependent on the potential benefit of the research and that individuals are protected from harm. Further study is required to establish when consent is required for an individual's social media data to be used.",2019,10.2196/jmir.7081,21,8,e7081,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*adverse effects and *digital health and *ethics and *infodemiology and *infoveillance and *pharmacovigilance and *qualitative research and *research and *social media and *surveillance and Adolescent and Adult and adverse effects and Aged and digital health and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis and ethics and Focus Groups and Humans and infodemiology and infoveillance and Middle Aged and pharmacovigilance and Pharmacovigilance and Public Opinion and qualitative research and research and Research Design and social media and Social Media/*standards and surveillance and Young Adult,NA,NA,2019/08/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dunn_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Associations Between Exposure to and Expression of Negative Opinions About Human Papillomavirus Vaccines on Social Media: An Observational Study,"Dunn, Adam G. and Leask, Julie and Zhou, Xujuan and Mandl, Kenneth D. and Coiera, Enrico",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Groups and individuals that seek to negatively influence public opinion about the safety and value of vaccination are active in online and social media and may influence decision making within some communities. OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure whether exposure to negative opinions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in Twitter communities is associated with the subsequent expression of negative opinions by explicitly measuring potential information exposure over the social structure of Twitter communities. METHODS: We hypothesized that prior exposure to opinions rejecting the safety or value of HPV vaccines would be associated with an increased risk of posting similar opinions and tested this hypothesis by analyzing temporal sequences of messages posted on Twitter (tweets). The study design was a retrospective analysis of tweets related to HPV vaccines and the social connections between users. Between October 2013 and April 2014, we collected 83,551 English-language tweets that included terms related to HPV vaccines and the 957,865 social connections among 30,621 users posting or reposting the tweets. Tweets were classified as expressing negative or neutral/positive opinions using a machine learning classifier previously trained on a manually labeled sample. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 25.13% (20,994/83,551) of tweets were classified as negative; among the 30,621 users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, 9046 (29.54%) were exposed to a majority of negative tweets. The likelihood of a user posting a negative tweet after exposure to a majority of negative opinions was 37.78% (2780/7361) compared to 10.92% (1234/11,296) for users who were exposed to a majority of positive and neutral tweets corresponding to a relative risk of 3.46 (95% CI 3.25-3.67, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous community structure on Twitter appears to skew the information to which users are exposed in relation to HPV vaccines. We found that among users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, those who were more often exposed to negative opinions were more likely to subsequently post negative opinions. Although this research may be useful for identifying individuals and groups currently at risk of disproportionate exposure to misinformation about HPV vaccines, there is a clear need for studies capable of determining the factors that affect the formation and adoption of beliefs about public health interventions.",2015,10.2196/jmir.4343,17,6,e144,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Attitude to Health and *Papillomavirus Vaccines and *Public Opinion and *Social Media and HPV vaccines and Humans and Public Health and public health surveillance and Retrospective Studies and social media and Social Networking and social networks and Twitter messaging,NA,NA,2015/06/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Liu_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Understanding Weight Loss via Online Discussions: Content Analysis of Reddit Posts Using Topic Modeling and Word Clustering Techniques,"Liu, Yang and Yin, Zhijun",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancers. Online social media platforms are popular among people seeking social support regarding weight loss and sharing their weight loss experiences, which provides opportunities for learning about weight loss behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the content posted by users in the r/loseit subreddit, an online community for discussing weight loss, and online interactions were associated with their weight loss in terms of the number of replies and votes that these users received. METHODS: All posts that were published before January 2018 in r/loseit were collected. We focused on users who revealed their start weight, current weight, and goal weight and were active in this online community for at least 30 days. A topic modeling technique and a hierarchical clustering algorithm were used to obtain both global topics and local word semantic clusters. Finally, we used a regression model to learn the association between weight loss and topics, word semantic clusters, and online interactions. RESULTS: Our data comprised 477,904 posts that were published by 7660 users within a span of 7 years. We identified 25 topics, including food and drinks, calories, exercises, family members and friends, and communication. Our results showed that the start weight (<ce><b2>=.823; P<.001), active days (<ce><b2>=.017; P=.009), and median number of votes (<ce><b2>=.263; P=.02), mentions of exercises (<ce><b2>=.145; P<.001), and nutrition (<ce><b2>=.120; P<.001) were associated with higher weight loss. Users who lost more weight might be motivated by the negative emotions (<ce><b2>=-.098; P<.001) that they experienced before starting the journey of weight loss. In contrast, users who mentioned vacations (<ce><b2>=-.108; P=.005) and payments (<ce><b2>=-.112; P=.001) tended to experience relatively less weight loss. Mentions of family members (<ce><b2>=-.031; P=.03) and employment status (<ce><b2>=-.041; P=.03) were associated with less weight loss as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that both online interactions and offline activities were associated with weight loss, suggesting that future interventions based on existing online platforms should focus on both aspects.

Ricard_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Exploring the Utility of Community-Generated Social Media Content for Detecting Depression: An Analytical Study on Instagram,"Ricard, Benjamin J. and Marsch, Lisa A. and Crosier, Benjamin and Hassanpour, Saeed",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The content produced by individuals on various social media platforms has been successfully used to identify mental illness, including depression. However, most of the previous work in this area has focused on user-generated content, that is, content created by the individual, such as an individual's posts and pictures. In this study, we explored the predictive capability of community-generated content, that is, the data generated by a community of friends or followers, rather than by a sole individual, to identify depression among social media users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to evaluate the utility of community-generated content on social media, such as comments on an individual's posts, to predict depression as defined by the clinically validated Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) assessment questionnaire. We hypothesized that the results of this research may provide new insights into next generation of population-level mental illness risk assessment and intervention delivery. METHODS: We created a Web-based survey on a crowdsourcing platform through which participants granted access to their Instagram profiles as well as provided their responses to PHQ-8 as a reference standard for depression status. After data quality assurance and postprocessing, the study analyzed the data of 749 participants. To build our predictive model, linguistic features were extracted from Instagram post captions and comments, including multiple sentiment scores, emoji sentiment analysis results, and meta-variables such as the number of likes and average comment length. In this study, 10.4% (78/749) of the data were held out as a test set. The remaining 89.6% (671/749) of the data were used to train an elastic-net regularized linear regression model to predict PHQ-8 scores. We compared different versions of this model (ie, a model trained on only user-generated data, a model trained on only community-generated data, and a model trained on the combination of both types of data) on a test set to explore the utility of community-generated data in our predictive analysis. RESULTS: The 2 models, the first trained on only community-generated data (area under curve [AUC]=0.71) and the second trained on a combination of user-generated and community-generated data (AUC=0.72), had statistically significant performances for predicting depression based on the Mann-Whitney U test (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). The model trained on only user-generated data (AUC=0.63; P=.11) did not achieve statistically significant results. The coefficients of the models revealed that our combined data classifier effectively amalgamated both user-generated and community-generated data and that the 2 feature sets were complementary and contained nonoverlapping information in our predictive analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this study indicate that leveraging community-generated data from social media, in addition to user-generated data, can be informative for predicting depression among social media users.",2018,10.2196/11817,20,12,e11817,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*depression and *machine learning and *mental health and *social media and depression and Depression/*diagnosis/psychology and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and mental health and social media and Social Media/*standards,NA,NA,2018/12/06/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tracy_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Exploring the Vast Choice of Question Prompt Lists Available to Health Consumers via Google: Environmental Scan,"Tracy, Marguerite Clare and Shepherd, Heather L. and Patel, Pinika and Trevena, Lyndal Jane",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in shared decision making (SDM) in Australia. Question prompt lists (QPLs) support question asking by patients, a key part of SDM. QPLs have been studied in a variety of settings, and increasingly the internet provides a source of suggested questions for patients. Environmental scans have been shown to be useful in assessing the availability and quality of online SDM tools. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the number and readability of QPLs available to users via Google.com.au. METHODS: Our environmental scan used search terms derived from literature and reputable websites to search for QPLs available via Google.com.au. Following removal of duplicates from the 4000 URLs and 22 reputable sites, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to create a list of unique QPLs. A sample of 20 QPLs was further assessed for list length, proxy measures of quality such as a date of review, and evidence of doctor endorsement. Readability of the sample QPL instructions and QPLs themselves was assessed using Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores. RESULTS: Our environmental scan identified 173 unique QPLs available to users. Lists ranged in length from 1 question to >200 questions. Of our sample, 50% (10/20) had a listed date of creation or update, and 60% (12/20) had evidence of authorship or source. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores for instructions were higher than for the QPLs (grades 10.3 and 7.7, respectively). There was over a 1 grade difference between QPLs from reputable sites compared with other sites (grades 4.2 and 5.4, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: People seeking questions to ask their doctor using Google.com.au encounter a vast number of question lists that they can use to prepare for consultations with their doctors. Markers of the quality or usefulness of various types of online QPLs, either surrogate or direct, have not yet been established, which makes it difficult to assess the value of the abundance of lists. Doctor endorsement of question asking has previously been shown to be an important factor in the effectiveness of QPLs, but information regarding this is not readily available online. Whether these diverse QPLs are endorsed by medical practitioners warrants further investigation.",2020,10.2196/17002,22,5,e17002,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Consumer Health Information and *environmental scan and *question prompt list and *shared decision making and environmental scan and Humans and Internet and question prompt list and shared decision making and Surveys and Questionnaires,NA,NA,2020/05/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many companies remain wary about such sharing because of unaddressed concerns about ethics, data security, logistics, and public relations. Without guidance on these issues, few companies are willing to take on the potential work and risks involved in noncommercial data sharing, and the scientific and societal potential of their data goes unrealized. In this paper, we describe the 18-month long pilot of a data-sharing program led by Crisis Text Line (CTL), a not-for-profit technology company that provides a free 24/7 text line for people in crisis. The primary goal of the data-sharing pilot was to design, develop, and implement a rigorous framework of principles and protocols for the safe and ethical sharing of user data. CTL used a stakeholder-based policy process to develop a feasible and ethical data-sharing program. The process comprised forming a data ethics committee; identifying policy challenges and solutions; announcing the program and generating interest; and revising the policy and launching the program. Once the pilot was complete, CTL examined how well the program ran and compared it with other potential program models before putting in place the program that was most suitable for its organizational needs. By drawing on CTL's experiences, we have created a 3-step set of guidelines for other organizations that wish to develop their own data-sharing program with academic researchers. The guidelines explain how to (1) determine the value and suitability of the data and organization for creating a data-sharing program; (2) decide on an appropriate data sharing and collaboration model; and (3) develop protocols and technical solutions for safe and ethical data sharing and the best organizational structure for implementing the program. An internal evaluation determined that the pilot satisfied CTL's goals of sharing scientific data and protecting client confidentiality. The policy development process also yielded key principles and protocols regarding the ethical challenges involved in data sharing that can be applied by other organizations. Finally, CTL's internal review of the pilot program developed a number of alternative models for sharing data that will suit a range of organizations with different priorities and capabilities. In implementing and studying this pilot program, CTL aimed both to optimize its own future data-sharing programs and to inform similar decisions made by others. Open data programs are both important and feasible to establish. With careful planning and appropriate resources, data sharing between big data companies and academic researchers can advance their shared mission to benefit society and improve lives.",2019,10.2196/11507,21,1,e11507,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*cooperative behavior and *crisis intervention and *data sharing and *ethics, business and *industry and *information dissemination and *privacy and *technology and *text messaging and Computer Security/*standards and cooperative behavior and crisis intervention and Crisis Intervention/*methods and Data Collection/*standards and data sharing and ethics, business and Humans and industry and information dissemination and Information Dissemination/*methods and Pilot Projects and privacy and Privacy/*psychology and technology and text messaging",NA,NA,2019/01/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kholghi_2016_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Active learning: a step towards automating medical concept extraction,"Kholghi, Mahnoosh and Sitbon, Laurianne and Zuccon, Guido and Nguyen, Anthony",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an automatic, active learning-based system for the extraction of medical concepts from clinical free-text reports. Specifically, (1) the contribution of active learning in reducing the annotation effort and (2) the robustness of incremental active learning framework across different selection criteria and data sets are determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The comparative performance of an active learning framework and a fully supervised approach were investigated to study how active learning reduces the annotation effort while achieving the same effectiveness as a supervised approach. Conditional random fields as the supervised method, and least confidence and information density as 2 selection criteria for active learning framework were used. The effect of incremental learning vs standard learning on the robustness of the models within the active learning framework with different selection criteria was also investigated. The following 2 clinical data sets were used for evaluation: the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/Veteran Affairs (i2b2/VA) 2010 natural language processing challenge and the Shared Annotated Resources/Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (ShARe/CLEF) 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab. RESULTS: The annotation effort saved by active learning to achieve the same effectiveness as supervised learning is up to 77%, 57%, and 46% of the total number of sequences, tokens, and concepts, respectively. Compared with the random sampling baseline, the saving is at least doubled.

Zhao_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Web-Based Medical Appointment Systems: A Systematic Review,"Zhao, Peng and Yoo, Illhoi and Lavoie, Jaie and Lavoie, Beau James and Simoes, Eduardo",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Health care is changing with a new emphasis on patient-centeredness. Fundamental to this transformation is the increasing recognition of patients' role in health care delivery and design. Medical appointment scheduling, as the starting point of most non-urgent health care services, is undergoing major developments to support active involvement of patients. By using the Internet as a medium, patients are given more freedom in decision making about their preferences for the appointments and have improved access. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the benefits and barriers to implement Web-based medical scheduling discussed in the literature as well as the unmet needs under the current health care environment. METHODS: In February 2017, MEDLINE was searched through PubMed to identify articles relating to the impacts of Web-based appointment scheduling. RESULTS: A total of 36 articles discussing 21 Web-based appointment systems were selected for this review. Most of the practices have positive changes in some metrics after adopting Web-based scheduling, such as reduced no-show rate, decreased staff labor, decreased waiting time, and improved satisfaction, and so on. Cost, flexibility, safety, and integrity are major reasons discouraging providers from switching to Web-based scheduling. Patients' reluctance to adopt Web-based appointment scheduling is mainly influenced by their past experiences using computers and the Internet as well as their communication preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the literature suggests a growing trend for the adoption of Web-based appointment systems. The findings of this review suggest that there are benefits to a variety of patient outcomes from Web-based scheduling interventions with the need for further studies.",2017,10.2196/jmir.6747,19,4,e134,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*appointments and schedules and *Appointments and Schedules and *hospital information systems and *Internet and *no-show patients and *Patient Participation/economics/trends and *patient-centered care and *smartphone and appointments and schedules and Costs and Cost Analysis and hospital information systems and Humans and Internet and Internet/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Needs Assessment and no-show patients and Patient Satisfaction and patient-centered care and Personnel Staffing and Scheduling/economics and smartphone,NA,NA,2017/04/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is an urgent need for a COVID-19 disease severity assessment that can assist in patient triage and resource allocation for patients at risk for severe disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and scale a clinical decision support system and mobile app to assist in COVID-19 severity assessment, management, and care. METHODS: Model training data from 701 patients with COVID-19 were collected across practices within the Family Health Centers network at New York University Langone Health. A two-tiered model was developed. Tier 1 uses easily available, nonlaboratory data to help determine whether biomarker-based testing and/or hospitalization is necessary. Tier 2 predicts the probability of mortality using biomarker measurements (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer) and age. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 models were validated using two external datasets from hospitals in Wuhan, China, comprising 160 and 375 patients, respectively. RESULTS: All biomarkers were measured at significantly higher levels in patients who died vs those who were not hospitalized or discharged (P<.001). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 internal validations had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98), respectively. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 external validations had AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the validity of the clinical decision support system and mobile app, which are now ready to assist health care providers in making evidence-based decisions when managing COVID-19 patient care.

Massey_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Applying Multiple Data Collection Tools to Quantify Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Communication on Twitter,"Massey, Philip M. and Leader, Amy and Yom-Tov, Elad and Budenz, Alexandra and Fisher, Kara and Klassen, Ann C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. There are several vaccines that protect against strains of HPV most associated with cervical and other cancers. Thus, HPV vaccination has become an important component of adolescent preventive health care. As media evolves, more information about HPV vaccination is shifting to social media platforms such as Twitter. Health information consumed on social media may be especially influential for segments of society such as younger populations, as well as ethnic and racial minorities. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to quantify HPV vaccine communication on Twitter, and to develop a novel methodology to improve the collection and analysis of Twitter data. METHODS: We collected Twitter data using 10 keywords related to HPV vaccination from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015. Prospective data collection used the Twitter Search API and retrospective data collection used Twitter Firehose. Using a codebook to characterize tweet sentiment and content, we coded a subsample of tweets by hand to develop classification models to code the entire sample using machine learning procedures. We also documented the words in the 140-character tweet text most associated with each keyword. We used chi-square tests, analysis of variance, and nonparametric equality of medians to test for significant differences in tweet characteristic by sentiment. RESULTS: A total of 193,379 English-language tweets were collected, classified, and analyzed. Associated words varied with each keyword, with more positive and preventive words associated with ""HPV vaccine"" and more negative words associated with name-brand vaccines. Positive sentiment was the largest type of sentiment in the sample, with 75,393 positive tweets (38.99% of the sample), followed by negative sentiment with 48,940 tweets (25.31% of the sample). Positive and neutral tweets constituted the largest percentage of tweets mentioning prevention or protection (20,425/75,393, 27.09% and 6477/25,110, 25.79%, respectively), compared with only 11.5% of negative tweets (5647/48,940; P<.001). Nearly one-half (22,726/48,940, 46.44%) of negative tweets mentioned side effects, compared with only 17.14% (12,921/75,393) of positive tweets and 15.08% of neutral tweets (3787/25,110; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Examining social media to detect health trends, as well as to communicate important health information, is a growing area of research in public health. Understanding the content and implications of conversations that form around HPV vaccination on social media can aid health organizations and health-focused Twitter users in creating a meaningful exchange of ideas and in having a significant impact on vaccine uptake.

Currently, phenotype algorithms are most commonly represented as noncomputable descriptive documents and knowledge artifacts that detail the protocols for querying diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, medications, and/or text-driven medical concepts, and are primarily meant for human comprehension. We present desiderata for developing a computable phenotype representation model (PheRM). METHODS: A team of clinicians and informaticians reviewed common features for multisite phenotype algorithms published in PheKB.org and existing phenotype representation platforms. We also evaluated well-known diagnostic criteria and clinical decision-making guidelines to encompass a broader category of algorithms. RESULTS: We propose 10 desired characteristics for a flexible, computable PheRM: (1) structure clinical data into queryable forms; (2) recommend use of a common data model, but also support customization for the variability and availability of EHR data among sites; (3) support both human-readable and computable representations of phenotype algorithms; (4) implement set operations and relational algebra for modeling phenotype algorithms; (5) represent phenotype criteria with structured rules; (6) support defining temporal relations between events; (7) use standardized terminologies and ontologies, and facilitate reuse of value sets; (8) define representations for text searching and natural language processing; (9) provide interfaces for external software algorithms; and (10) maintain backward compatibility.

Data on the feasibility of chatbots for chronic disease management are scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of utilizing natural language processing (NLP) for the categorization of electronic dialog data of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) for use in the development of a chatbot. METHODS: Electronic dialog data collected between 2013 and 2018 from a care management platform (UCLA eIBD) at a tertiary referral center for IBD at the University of California, Los Angeles, were used. Part of the data was manually reviewed, and an algorithm for categorization was created. The algorithm categorized all relevant dialogs into a set number of categories using NLP. In addition, 3 independent physicians evaluated the appropriateness of the categorization. RESULTS: A total of 16,453 lines of dialog were collected and analyzed. We categorized 8324 messages from 424 patients into seven categories. As there was an overlap in these categories, their frequencies were measured independently as symptoms (2033/6193, 32.83%), medications (2397/6193, 38.70%), appointments (1518/6193, 24.51%), laboratory investigations (2106/6193, 34.01%), finance or insurance (447/6193, 7.22%), communications (2161/6193, 34.89%), procedures (617/6193, 9.96%), and miscellaneous (624/6193, 10.08%). Furthermore, in 95.0% (285/300) of cases, there were minor or no differences in categorization between the algorithm and the three independent physicians. CONCLUSIONS: With increased adaptation of electronic health technologies, chatbots could have great potential in interacting with patients, collecting data, and increasing efficiency. Our categorization showcases the feasibility of using NLP in large amounts of electronic dialog for the development of a chatbot algorithm.

Joyce and Ellis, William J. and Lober, William B. and McReynolds, Justin and Wulff, Jennifer",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Given that no other disease with the high incidence of localized prostate cancer (LPC) has so many treatments with so few certainties related to outcomes, many men are faced with assuming some responsibility for the treatment decision along with guidance from clinicians. Men strongly consider their own personal characteristics and other personal factors as important and influential to the decision. Clinical researchers have not developed or comprehensively investigated interventions to facilitate the insight and prioritizing of personal factors along with medical factors that are required of a man in preparation for the treatment decision. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility and usability of a Web-based decision support technology, the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate (P3P), in men newly diagnosed with LPC. METHODS: Use cases were developed followed by infrastructure and content application. The program was provided on a personal desktop computer with a touch screen monitor. Participant responses to the query component of P3P determined the content of the multimedia educational and coaching intervention. The intervention was tailored to race, age, and personal factors reported as influencing the decision. Prepilot usability testing was conducted using a ""think aloud"" interview to identify navigation and content challenges. These issues were addressed prior to deployment in the clinic. A clinical pilot was conducted in an academic medical center where men sought consultation and treatment for LPC. Completion time, missing data, and acceptability were measured. RESULTS: Prepilot testing included 4 men with a past diagnosis of LPC who had completed therapy. Technical navigation issues were documented along with confusing content language. A total of 30 additional men with a recent diagnosis of LPC completed the P3P program in clinic prior to consulting with a urologist regarding treatment options. In a mean time of 46 minutes (SD 13 minutes), participants completed the P3P query and intervention components. Of a possible 4560 items for 30 participants, 22 (0.5%) were missing. Acceptability was reported as high overall. The sections of the intervention reported as most useful were the statistics graphs, priority information topics, and annotated external website links.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, building on previous work qualitatively analyzing depression-related Twitter data, was to describe the development of a comprehensive annotation scheme (ie, coding scheme) for manually annotating Twitter data with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 (DSM 5) major depressive symptoms (eg, depressed mood, weight change, psychomotor agitation, or retardation) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition IV (DSM-IV) psychosocial stressors (eg, educational problems, problems with primary support group, housing problems). METHODS: Using this annotation scheme, we developed an annotated corpus, Depressive Symptom and Psychosocial Stressors Acquired Depression, the SAD corpus, consisting of 9300 tweets randomly sampled from the Twitter application programming interface (API) using depression-related keywords (eg, depressed, gloomy, grief). An analysis of our annotated corpus yielded several key results. RESULTS: First, 72.09% (6829/9473) of tweets containing relevant keywords were nonindicative of depressive symptoms (eg, ""we're in for a new economic depression""). Second, the most prevalent symptoms in our dataset were depressed mood and fatigue or loss of energy. Third, less than 2% of tweets contained more than one depression related category (eg, diminished ability to think or concentrate, depressed mood). Finally, we found very high positive correlations between some depression-related symptoms in our annotated dataset (eg, fatigue or loss of energy and educational problems; educational problems and diminished ability to think). CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed an annotation scheme and an annotated corpus, the SAD corpus, consisting of 9300 tweets randomly-selected from the Twitter application programming interface using depression-related keywords. Our analyses suggest that keyword queries alone might not be suitable for public health monitoring because context can change the meaning of keyword in a statement.

Travis and Cole, Curtis L. and Kaushal, Rainu and Ancker, Jessica S.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Increasing the use of generic medications could help control medical costs. However, educational interventions have limited impact on prescriber behavior, and e-prescribing alerts are associated with high override rates and alert fatigue. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of a less intrusive intervention, a redesign of an e-prescribing interface that provides default options intended to ""nudge"" prescribers towards prescribing generic drugs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study in an academic ambulatory multispecialty practice assessed the effects of customizing an e-prescribing interface to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name medications during order entry and allow a one-click override to order the brand-name medication. RESULTS: Among drugs with generic equivalents, the proportion of generic drugs prescribed more than doubled after the interface redesign, rising abruptly from 39.7% to 95.9% (a 56.2% increase; 95% confidence interval, 56.0-56.4%; P < .001). Before the redesign, generic drug prescribing rates varied by therapeutic class, with rates as low as 8.6% for genitourinary products and 15.7% for neuromuscular drugs. After the redesign, generic drug prescribing rates for all but four therapeutic classes were above 90%: endocrine drugs, neuromuscular drugs, nutritional products, and miscellaneous products. DISCUSSION: Changing the default option in an e-prescribing interface in an ambulatory care setting was followed by large and sustained increases in the proportion of generic drugs prescribed at the practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases including Scopus, PubMed, and Science Citation Index Expanded from January 2004 to December 2015 for studies reporting problems with IT and their effects. A framework called the information value chain, which connects technology use to final outcome, was used to assess how IT problems affect user interaction, information receipt, decision-making, care processes, and patient outcomes. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Of the 34 studies identified, the majority ( n = 14, 41%) were analyses of incidents reported from 6 countries. There were 7 descriptive studies, 9 ethnographic studies, and 4 case reports. The types of IT problems were similar to those described in earlier classifications of safety problems associated with health IT. The frequency, scale, and severity of IT problems were not adequately captured within these studies. Use errors and poor user interfaces interfered with the receipt of information and led to errors of commission when making decisions. Clinical errors involving medications were well characterized. Issues with system functionality, including poor user interfaces and fragmented displays, delayed care delivery. Issues with system access, system configuration, and software updates also delayed care. In 18 studies (53%), IT problems were linked to patient harm and death. Near-miss events were reported in 10 studies (29%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The research evidence describing problems with health IT remains largely qualitative, and many opportunities remain to systematically study and quantify risks and benefits with regard to patient safety. The information value chain, when used in conjunction with existing classifications for health IT safety problems, can enhance measurement and should facilitate identification of the most significant risks to patient safety.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw154,24,2,246-250,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*adverse events and *Delivery of Health Care and *health information technology and *Medical Informatics and *patient safety and *systematic review and *Treatment Outcome and *unintended consequences and adverse events and health information technology and Humans and Medical Errors and patient safety and Patient Safety and systematic review and unintended consequences,NA,NA,2017/03/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grunloh_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"""Why Do They Need to Check Me?"" Patient Participation Through eHealth and the Doctor-Patient Relationship: Qualitative Study","Grunloh, Christiane and Myreteg, Gunilla and Cajander, Asa and Rexhepi, Hanife",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Roles in the doctor-patient relationship are changing and patient participation in health care is increasingly emphasized. Electronic health (eHealth) services such as patient accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) have been implemented to support patient participation. Little is known about practical use of PAEHR and its effect on roles of doctors and patients. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to investigate how physicians view the idea of patient participation, in particular in relation to the PAEHR system. Hereby, the paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of physicians' constructions of PAEHR, roles in the doctor-patient relationship, and levels and limits of involvement. METHODS: A total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians in different fields. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and a theoretically informed thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Two important aspects were identified that are related to the doctor-patient relationship: roles and involvement. The physicians viewed their role as being the ones to take on the responsibility, determining treatment options, and to be someone who should be trusted. In relation to the patient's role, lack of skills (technical or regarding medical jargon), motives to read, and patients' characteristics were aspects identified in the interviews. Patients were often referred to as static entities disregarding their potential to develop skills and knowledge over time. Involvement captures aspects that support or hinder patients to take an active role in their care. CONCLUSIONS: Literature of at least two decades suggests an overall agreement that the paternalistic approach in health care is inappropriate, and a collaborative process with patients should be adopted. Although the physicians in this study stated that they, in principle, were in favor of patient participation, the analysis found little support in their descriptions of their daily practice that participation is actualized. As seen from the results, paternalistic practices are still present, even if professionals might not be aware of this. This can create a conflict between patients who strive to become more informed and their questions being interpreted as signs of critique and mistrust toward the physician. We thus believe that the full potential of PAEHRs is not reached yet and argue that the concept of patient empowerment is problematic as it triggers an interpretation of ""power"" in health care as a zero-sum, which is not helpful for the maintenance of the relationship between the actors. Patient involvement is often discussed merely in relation to decision making; however, this study emphasizes the need to include also sensemaking and learning activities. This would provide an alternative understanding of patients asking questions, not in terms of ""monitoring the doctor"" but to make sense of the situation.",2018,10.2196/jmir.8444,20,1,e11,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*doctor-patient relationship and *eHealth services for patients and *Electronic Health Records and *medical records and *patient accessible electronic health records and *patient empowerment and *patient participation and *Patient Participation and *patient portal and *personal health records and *Physician-Patient Relations and *physicians and Decision Making and doctor-patient relationship and eHealth services for patients and Female and Humans and Male and medical records and patient accessible electronic health records and patient empowerment and patient participation and patient portal and personal health records and physicians and Physicians and Power, Psychological and Qualitative Research and Self Care and Telemedicine",NA,NA,2018/01/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Henderson_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Phenotype Instance Verification and Evaluation Tool (PIVET): A Scaled Phenotype Evidence Generation Framework Using Web-Based Medical Literature,"Henderson, Jette and Ke, Junyuan and Ho, Joyce C. and Ghosh, Joydeep and Wallace, Byron C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Researchers are developing methods to automatically extract clinically relevant and useful patient characteristics from raw healthcare datasets. These characteristics, often capturing essential properties of patients with common medical conditions, are called computational phenotypes. Being generated by automated or semiautomated, data-driven methods, such potential phenotypes need to be validated as clinically meaningful (or not) before they are acceptable for use in decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to present Phenotype Instance Verification and Evaluation Tool (PIVET), a framework that uses co-occurrence analysis on an online corpus of publically available medical journal articles to build clinical relevance evidence sets for user-supplied phenotypes. PIVET adopts a conceptual framework similar to the pioneering prototype tool PheKnow-Cloud that was developed for the phenotype validation task. PIVET completely refactors each part of the PheKnow-Cloud pipeline to deliver vast improvements in speed without sacrificing the quality of the insights PheKnow-Cloud achieved. METHODS: PIVET leverages indexing in NoSQL databases to efficiently generate evidence sets. Specifically, PIVET uses a succinct representation of the phenotypes that corresponds to the index on the corpus database and an optimized co-occurrence algorithm inspired by the Aho-Corasick algorithm. We compare PIVET's phenotype representation with PheKnow-Cloud's by using PheKnow-Cloud's experimental setup. In PIVET's framework, we also introduce a statistical model trained on domain expert-verified phenotypes to automatically classify phenotypes as clinically relevant or not. Additionally, we show how the classification model can be used to examine user-supplied phenotypes in an online, rather than batch, manner. RESULTS: PIVET maintains the discriminative power of PheKnow-Cloud in terms of identifying clinically relevant phenotypes for the same corpus with which PheKnow-Cloud was originally developed, but PIVET's analysis is an order of magnitude faster than that of PheKnow-Cloud. Not only is PIVET much faster, it can be scaled to a larger corpus and still retain speed. We evaluated multiple classification models on top of the PIVET framework and found ridge regression to perform best, realizing an average F1 score of 0.91 when predicting clinically relevant phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that PIVET improves on the most notable existing computational tool for phenotype validation in terms of speed and automation and is comparable in terms of accuracy.",2018,10.2196/jmir.9610,20,5,e164,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*algorithms and *classification and *clustering analysis and *databases as topic and *information storage and retrieval and *medical informatics and *medical subject headings and *MEDLINE and algorithms and Algorithms and classification and clustering analysis and databases as topic and Humans and information storage and retrieval and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Internet/*instrumentation and medical informatics and medical subject headings and MEDLARS/*standards and MEDLINE and Phenotype,NA,NA,2018/05/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Agarwal_2010_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Technological viewpoints (frames) about electronic prescribing in physician practices,"Agarwal, Ritu and Angst, Corey M. and DesRoches, Catherine M. and Fischer, Michael A.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Physician practices may adopt and use electronic prescribing (eRx) in response to mandates, incentives, and perceived value of the technology. Yet, for the most part, diffusion has been limited and geographically confined, and even when adopted, use of eRx in many practices has been low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that decision-makers in the practices possess different technological viewpoints (frames) related to eRx and these frames have formed the basis for the adoption decision, expectations about the technology, and patterns of use. In this study eRx technological frames were examined. DESIGN: Focus groups, direct observation, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with physicians, practice managers, nurses, and other medical staff. MEASUREMENTS: Focus groups were observed, taped, transcribed, and analyzed to reveal themes. These themes guided the observational visits and subsequent interviews. A triangulation process was used to confirm the findings. RESULTS: Seven frames emerged from the qualitative analysis ranging from positive to neutral to negative: (1) eRx as an efficiency and effectiveness enhancing tool; (2) eRx as the harbinger of new practices; (3) eRx as core to the clinical workflow; (4) eRx as an administrative tool; (5) eRx: the artifact; (6) eRx as a necessary evil; and (7) eRx as an unwelcome disruption. CONCLUSION: Frames provide a unique perspective within which to explore the adoption and use of eRx and may explain why perceptions of value vary greatly. Some frames facilitate effective use of eRx while others impose barriers. Electronic prescribing can be viewed as a transitional technology on the path to greater digitization at the physician practice level. Understanding the impact of technological frames on the effectiveness of eRx use may provide lessons for the implementation of future health information technology innovations.",2010,10.1136/jamia.2009.001826,17,4,425-431,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Attitude to Computers and *Diffusion of Innovation and *Electronic Prescribing and *Practice Management, Medical and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Decision Making, Organizational and Efficiency, Organizational and Health Plan Implementation and Humans and Qualitative Research and United States and Workflow",NA,NA,2010/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks.

Lee_2018_NPJdigmed,JOUR,Natural language generation for electronic health records,"Lee, Scott H.",NPJ digital medicine,"One broad goal of biomedical informatics is to generate fully-synthetic, faithfully representative electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate data sharing between healthcare providers and researchers and promote methodological research. A variety of methods existing for generating synthetic EHRs, but they are not capable of generating unstructured text, like emergency department (ED) chief complaints, history of present illness, or progress notes. Here, we use the encoder-decoder model, a deep learning algorithm that features in many contemporary machine translation systems, to generate synthetic chief complaints from discrete variables in EHRs, like age group, gender, and discharge diagnosis. After being trained end-to-end on authentic records, the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that appears to preserve the epidemiological information encoded in the original record-sentence pairs. As a side effect of the model's optimization goal, these synthetic chief complaints are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings, and they include none of the personally identifiable information (PII) that was in the training data, suggesting that this model may be used to support the de-identification of text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs, allowing healthcare providers to share faithful representations of multimodal medical data without compromising patient privacy. This is an important advance that we hope will facilitate the development of machine-learning methods for clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and other data-hungry applications in biomedical informatics.",2018,10.1038/s41746-018-0070-0,1,NA,63,eng,2398-6352,NA,NA,NA,2018///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0070-0.pdf,NA,NA
Bennett_2017_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The use of computerized clinical decision support systems in emergency care: a substantive review of the literature,"Bennett, Paula and Hardiker, Nicholas R.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVES: : This paper provides a substantive review of international literature evaluating the impact of computerized clinical decision support systems (CCDSSs) on the care of emergency department (ED) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: : A literature search was conducted using Medline, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase electronic resources, and gray literature. Studies were selected if they compared the use of a CCDSS with usual care in a face-to-face clinical interaction in an ED. RESULTS: : Of the 23 studies included, approximately half demonstrated a statistically significant positive impact on aspects of clinical care with the use of CCDSSs. The remaining studies showed small improvements, mainly around documentation. However, the methodological quality of the studies was poor, with few or no controls to mitigate against confounding variables. The risk of bias was high in all but 6 studies. DISCUSSION: : The ED environment is complex and does not lend itself to robust quantitative designs such as randomized controlled trials. The quality of the research in <e2><88><bc>75% of the studies was poor, and therefore conclusions cannot be drawn from these results. However, the studies with a more robust design show evidence of the positive impact of CCDSSs on ED patient care. CONCLUSION: This is the first review to consider the role of CCDSSs in emergency care and expose the research in this area. The role of CCDSSs in emergency care may provide some solutions to the current challenges in EDs, but further high-quality research is needed to better understand what technological solutions can offer clinicians and patients.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw151,24,3,655-668,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Emergency Medical Services and computer decision support and computerized clinical decision support system and Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and emergency care and emergency department and Emergency Service, Hospital and Humans",NA,NA,2017/05/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

We highlight key concepts within the prediction-action dyad that together are expected to impact model benefit. These include factors relevant to model prediction (including the number needed to screen) as well as those relevant to the subsequent action (number needed to treat).

Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of available electronic health record (EHR) data and machine learning (ML) techniques have been considerably evolving. However, managing and modeling this amount of information may lead to several challenges, such as overfitting, model interpretability, and computational cost. Starting from these motivations, we introduced an ML method called sparse balanced support vector machine (SB-SVM) for discovering T2D in a novel collected EHR dataset (named Federazione Italiana Medici di Medicina Generale dataset). In particular, among all the EHR features related to exemptions, examination, and drug prescriptions, we have selected only those collected before T2D diagnosis from an uniform age group of subjects. We demonstrated the reliability of the introduced approach with respect to other ML and deep learning approaches widely employed in the state-of-the-art for solving this task.

To overcome this limitation, attention mechanism has been introduced to clinical research as an explanatory modeling method. However, potential limitations of using this attractive method have not been clarified to clinical researchers. Furthermore, there has been a lack of introductory information explaining attention mechanisms to clinical researchers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to introduce the basic concepts and design approaches of attention mechanisms. In addition, we aimed to empirically assess the potential limitations of current attention mechanisms in terms of prediction and interpretability performance. METHODS: First, the basic concepts and several key considerations regarding attention mechanisms were identified. Second, four approaches to attention mechanisms were suggested according to a two-dimensional framework based on the degrees of freedom and uncertainty awareness. Third, the prediction performance, probability reliability, concentration of variable importance, consistency of attention results, and generalizability of attention results to conventional statistics were assessed in the diabetic classification modeling setting. Fourth, the potential limitations of attention mechanisms were considered. RESULTS: Prediction performance was very high for all models. Probability reliability was high in models with uncertainty awareness. Variable importance was concentrated in several variables when uncertainty awareness was not considered. The consistency of attention results was high when uncertainty awareness was considered. The generalizability of attention results to conventional statistics was poor regardless of the modeling approach.

Even after a fracture occurs, high fracture risk remains widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Common fracture risk assessment tools utilize a subset of clinical risk factors for prediction, and often require manual data entry. Furthermore, these tools predict risk over the long term and do not explicitly provide short-term risk estimates necessary to identify patients likely to experience a fracture in the next 1-2 years. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an algorithm for the identification of patients at risk of fracture in a subsequent 1- to 2-year period. In order to address the aforementioned limitations of current prediction tools, this approach focused on a short-term timeframe, automated data entry, and the use of longitudinal data to inform the predictions. METHODS: Using retrospective electronic health record data from over 1,000,000 patients, we developed Crystal Bone, an algorithm that applies machine learning techniques from natural language processing to the temporal nature of patient histories to generate short-term fracture risk predictions. Similar to how language models predict the next word in a given sentence or the topic of a document, Crystal Bone predicts whether a patient's future trajectory might contain a fracture event, or whether the signature of the patient's journey is similar to that of a typical future fracture patient. A holdout set with 192,590 patients was used to validate accuracy. Experimental baseline models and human-level performance were used for comparison. RESULTS: The model accurately predicted 1- to 2-year fracture risk for patients aged over 50 years (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC] 0.81). These algorithms outperformed the experimental baselines (AUROC 0.67) and showed meaningful improvements when compared to retrospective approximation of human-level performance by correctly identifying 9649 of 13,765 (70%) at-risk patients who did not receive any preventative bone-health-related medical interventions from their physicians. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that it is possible to use a patient's unique medical history as it changes over time to predict the risk of short-term fracture. Validating and applying such a tool within the health care system could enable automated and widespread prediction of this risk and may help with identification of patients at very high risk of fracture.",2020,10.2196/22550,22,10,e22550,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*AI and *artificial intelligence and *bone and *deep learning and *EHR and *electronic health record and *fracture and *low bone mass and *machine learning and *natural language processing and *NLP and *osteoporosis and *prediction and AI and Algorithms and artificial intelligence and bone and deep learning and Deep Learning/*standards and EHR and electronic health record and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Female and fracture and Fractures, Bone/*epidemiology and Humans and low bone mass and machine learning and Male and Middle Aged and natural language processing and NLP and osteoporosis and prediction and Reproducibility of Results and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors",NA,NA,2020/10/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

During 7 months of prospective evaluation, 5530 predictions were analyzed. In addition, 119 predictions for internal medicine patients were compared with ratings of clinical experts in a blinded and nonblinded setting. RESULTS: During clinical application, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 82.2%. Discrimination on prospective data (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.86) was as good as in the test dataset, but calibration was poor. The predictions correlated strongly with delirium risk perceived by experts in the blinded (r = 0.81) and nonblinded (r = 0.62) settings.

Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions.

This task is typically recognized as 2 sequential subtasks in a pipeline, clinical entity or attribute recognition followed by entity-attribute relation extraction. One problem of pipeline methods is that errors from entity recognition are unavoidably passed to relation extraction. We propose a novel joint deep learning method to recognize clinical entities or attributes and extract entity-attribute relations simultaneously. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed method integrates 2 state-of-the-art methods for named entity recognition and relation extraction, namely bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random field and bidirectional long short-term memory, into a unified framework. In this method, relation constraints between clinical entities and attributes and weights of the 2 subtasks are also considered simultaneously.

Li_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Marrying Medical Domain Knowledge With Deep Learning on Electronic Health Records: A Deep Visual Analytics Approach,"Li, Rui and Yin, Changchang and Yang, Samuel and Qian, Buyue and Zhang, Ping",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Deep learning models have attracted significant interest from health care researchers during the last few decades. There have been many studies that apply deep learning to medical applications and achieve promising results. However, there are three limitations to the existing models: (1) most clinicians are unable to interpret the results from the existing models, (2) existing models cannot incorporate complicated medical domain knowledge (eg, a disease causes another disease), and (3) most existing models lack visual exploration and interaction. Both the electronic health record (EHR) data set and the deep model results are complex and abstract, which impedes clinicians from exploring and communicating with the model directly. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an interpretable and accurate risk prediction model as well as an interactive clinical prediction system to support EHR data exploration, knowledge graph demonstration, and model interpretation. METHODS: A domain-knowledge-guided recurrent neural network (DG-RNN) model is proposed to predict clinical risks. The model takes medical event sequences as input and incorporates medical domain knowledge by attending to a subgraph of the whole medical knowledge graph. A global pooling operation and a fully connected layer are used to output the clinical outcomes. The middle results and the parameters of the fully connected layer are helpful in identifying which medical events cause clinical risks. DG-Viz is also designed to support EHR data exploration, knowledge graph demonstration, and model interpretation. RESULTS: We conducted both risk prediction experiments and a case study on a real-world data set. A total of 554 patients with heart failure and 1662 control patients without heart failure were selected from the data set. The experimental results show that the proposed DG-RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 1.5%. The case study demonstrates how our medical physician collaborator can effectively explore the data and interpret the prediction results using DG-Viz. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present DG-Viz, an interactive clinical prediction system, which brings together the power of deep learning (ie, a DG-RNN-based model) and visual analytics to predict clinical risks and visually interpret the EHR prediction results. Experimental results and a case study on heart failure risk prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the DG-Viz system. This study will pave the way for interactive, interpretable, and accurate clinical risk predictions.",2020,10.2196/20645,22,9,e20645,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*electronic health records and *interpretable deep learning and *knowledge graph and *visual analytics and Deep Learning/*standards and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Humans and interpretable deep learning and Knowledge Bases and knowledge graph and Neural Networks, Computer and visual analytics",NA,NA,2020/09/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. METHODS: This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. RESULTS: Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations' inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs.

However, the nature of UGC brings challenges in both data collecting and processing. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to UGC for personal health investigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Library, ACM library, AAAI library, and the ACL anthology. We focused on research articles that were published in English and in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings between 2010 and 2018. Publications that applied ML to UGC with a focus on personal health were identified for further systematic review. RESULTS: We identified 103 eligible studies which we summarized with respect to 5 research categories, 3 data collection strategies, 3 gold standard dataset creation methods, and 4 types of features applied in ML models. Popular off-the-shelf ML models were logistic regression (n = 22), support vector machines (n = 18), naive Bayes (n = 17), ensemble learning (n = 12), and deep learning (n = 11). The most investigated problems were mental health (n = 39) and cancer (n = 15). Common health-related aspects extracted from UGC were treatment experience, sentiments and emotions, coping strategies, and social support.

Peng_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Comparisons Between Hypothesis- and Data-Driven Approaches for Multimorbidity Frailty Index: A Machine Learning Approach,"Peng, Li-Ning and Hsiao, Fei-Yuan and Lee, Wei-Ju and Huang, Shih-Tsung and Chen, Liang-Kung",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Using big data and the theory of cumulative deficits to develop the multimorbidity frailty index (mFI) has become a widely accepted approach in public health and health care services. However, constructing the mFI using the most critical determinants and stratifying different risk groups with dose-response relationships remain major challenges in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop the mFI by using machine learning methods that select variables based on the optimal fitness of the model. In addition, we aimed to further establish 4 entities of risk using a machine learning approach that would achieve the best distinction between groups and demonstrate the dose-response relationship. METHODS: In this study, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to develop a machine learning multimorbidity frailty index (ML-mFI) using the theory of cumulative diseases/deficits of an individual older person. Compared to the conventional mFI, in which the selection of diseases/deficits is based on expert opinion, we adopted the random forest method to select the most influential diseases/deficits that predict adverse outcomes for older people. To ensure that the survival curves showed a dose-response relationship with overlap during the follow-up, we developed the distance index and coverage index, which can be used at any time point to classify the ML-mFI of all subjects into the categories of fit, mild frailty, moderate frailty, and severe frailty. Survival analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of the ML-mFI to predict adverse outcomes, such as unplanned hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality. RESULTS: The final ML-mFI model contained 38 diseases/deficits. Compared with conventional mFI, both indices had similar distribution patterns by age and sex; however, among people aged 65 to 69 years, the mean mFI and ML-mFI were 0.037 (SD 0.048) and 0.0070 (SD 0.0254), respectively. The difference may result from discrepancies in the diseases/deficits selected in the mFI and the ML-mFI. A total of 86,133 subjects aged 65 to 100 years were included in this study and were categorized into 4 groups according to the ML-mFI. Both the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models showed that the ML-mFI significantly predicted all outcomes of interest, including all-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalizations, and all-cause ICU admissions at 1, 5, and 8 years of follow-up (P<.01). In particular, a dose-response relationship was revealed between the 4 ML-mFI groups and adverse outcomes.

R. and Wolff, Anthony H.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical interventions and death in the intensive care unit (ICU) depend on complex patterns in patients' longitudinal data. We aim to anticipate these events earlier and more consistently so that staff can consider preemptive action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use a temporal convolutional network to encode longitudinal data and a feedforward neural network to encode demographic data from 4713 ICU admissions in 2014-2018. For each hour of each admission, we predict events in the subsequent 1-6 hours. We compare performance with other models including a recurrent neural network. RESULTS: Our model performed similarly to the recurrent neural network for some events and outperformed it for others. This performance increase was more evident in a sensitivity analysis where the prediction timeframe was varied. Average positive predictive value (95% CI) was 0.786 (0.781-0.790) and 0.738 (0.732-0.743) for up- and down-titrating FiO2, 0.574 (0.519-0.625) for extubation, 0.139 (0.117-0.162) for intubation, 0.533 (0.492-0.572) for starting noradrenaline, 0.441 (0.433-0.448) for fluid challenge, and 0.315 (0.282-0.352) for death. DISCUSSION: Events were better predicted where their important determinants were captured in structured electronic health data, and where they occurred in homogeneous circumstances.

New_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,A Precision Environment-Wide Association Study of Hypertension via Supervised Cadre Models,"New, Alexander and Bennett, Kristin P.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"We consider the problem in precision health of grouping people into subpopulations based on their degree of vulnerability to a risk factor. These subpopulations cannot be discovered with traditional clustering techniques because their quality is evaluated with a supervised metric: The ease of modeling a response variable for observations within them. Instead, we apply the more appropriate supervised cadre model (SCM). We extend the SCM formalism so that it may be applied to multivariate regression and binary classification problems and develop a way to use conditional entropy to assess the confidence in the process by which a subject is assigned their cadre. Using the SCM, we generalize the environment-wide association study (EWAS) to be able to model heterogeneity in population risk. In our EWAS, we consider more than 200 environmental exposure factors and find their association with diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hypertension. This requires adapting the SCM to be applicable to data generated by a complex survey design. After correcting for false positives, we found 25 exposure variables that had a significant association with at least one of our response variables. Eight of these were significant for a discovered subpopulation but not for the overall population. Some of these associations have been identified by previous researchers, whereas others appear to be novel.

The hiding-in-plain-sight (HIPS) approach attempts to solve this ""residual PII problem."" HIPS replaces PII tagged by a de-identification system with realistic but fictitious (resynthesized) content, making it harder to detect remaining unredacted PII. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 2000 representative clinical documents from 2 healthcare settings (4000 total), we used a novel method to generate 2 de-identified 100-document corpora (200 documents total) in which PII tagged by a typical automated machine-learned tagger was replaced by HIPS-resynthesized content. Four readers conducted aggressive reidentification attacks to isolate leaked PII: 2 readers from within the originating institution and 2 external readers. RESULTS: Overall, mean recall of leaked PII was 26.8% and mean precision was 37.2%. Mean recall was 9% (mean precision = 37%) for patient ages, 32% (mean precision = 26%) for dates, 25% (mean precision = 37%) for doctor names, 45% (mean precision = 55%) for organization names, and 23% (mean precision = 57%) for patient names.

Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN). METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%).

Mirchev_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Academic Viewpoint on Patient Data Ownership in the Context of Big Data: Scoping Review,"Mirchev, Martin and Mircheva, Iskra and Kerekovska, Albena",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The ownership of patient information in the context of big data is a relatively new problem, which is not yet fully recognized by the medical academic community. The problem is interdisciplinary, incorporating legal, ethical, medical, and aspects of information and communication technologies, requiring a sophisticated analysis. However, no previous scoping review has mapped existing studies on the subject. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to map and assess published studies on patient data ownership in the context of big data as viewed by the academic community. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on the 5-stage framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and further developed by Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien. The organization and reporting of results of the scoping review were conducted according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and its extensions for Scoping Reviews). A systematic and comprehensive search of 4 scientific information databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Springer, was performed for studies published between January 2000 and October 2019. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies and the extracted data. RESULTS: The review included 32 eligible articles authored by academicians that correspond to 3 focus areas: problem (ownership), area (health care), and context (big data). Five major aspects were studied: the scientific area of publications, aspects and academicians' perception of ownership in the context of big data, proposed solutions, and practical applications for data ownership issues in the context of big data. The aspects in which publications consider ownership of medical data are not clearly distinguished but can be summarized as ethical, legal, political, and managerial. The ownership of patient data is perceived primarily as a challenge fundamental to conducting medical research, including data sales and sharing, and to a lesser degree as a means of control, problem, threat, and opportunity also in view of medical research. Although numerous solutions falling into 3 categories, technology, law, and policy, were proposed, only 3 real applications were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The issue of ownership of patient information in the context of big data is poorly researched; it is not addressed consistently and in its integrity, and there is no consensus on policy decisions and the necessary legal regulations. Future research should investigate the issue of ownership as a core research question and not as a minor fragment among other topics. More research is needed to increase the body of knowledge regarding the development of adequate policies and relevant legal frameworks in compliance with ethical standards. The combined efforts of multidisciplinary academic teams are needed to overcome existing gaps in the perception of ownership, the aspects of ownership, and the possible solutions to patient data ownership issues in the reality of big data.",2020,10.2196/22214,22,8,e22214,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*big data and *Big Data and *Data Analysis and *ethics and *legal aspects and *ownership and *patient-generated health data and big data and Biomedical Research/*standards and ethics and Female and Humans and legal aspects and Male and ownership and patient-generated health data,NA,NA,2020/08/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tideman_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Internet search query data improve forecasts of daily emergency department volume,"Tideman, Sam and Santillana, Mauricio and Bickel, Jonathan and Reis, Ben",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Emergency departments (EDs) are increasingly overcrowded. Forecasting patient visit volume is challenging. Reliable and accurate forecasting strategies may help improve resource allocation and mitigate the effects of overcrowding. Patterns related to weather, day of the week, season, and holidays have been previously used to forecast ED visits. Internet search activity has proven useful for predicting disease trends and offers a new opportunity to improve ED visit forecasting. This study tests whether Google search data and relevant statistical methods can improve the accuracy of ED volume forecasting compared with traditional data sources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven years of historical daily ED arrivals were collected from Boston Children's Hospital. We used data from the public school calendar, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Google Trends. Multiple linear models using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for variable selection were created. The models were trained on 5 years of data and out-of-sample accuracy was judged using multiple error metrics on the final 2 years. RESULTS: All data sources added complementary predictive power. Our baseline day-of-the-week model recorded average percent errors of 10.99%. Autoregressive terms, calendar and weather data reduced errors to 7.71%. Search volume data reduced errors to 7.58% theoretically preventing 4 improperly staffed days. DISCUSSION: The predictive power provided by the search volume data may stem from the ability to capture population-level interaction with events, such as winter storms and infectious diseases, that traditional data sources alone miss.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical corpus used in this study was from the MIMIC-III database and the organizers annotated 303 documents for training and 202 for testing. Our system consists of 2 components: a named entity recognition (NER) and a relation classification (RC) component. For each component, we implemented deep learning-based approaches (eg, BI-LSTM-CRF) and compared them with traditional machine learning approaches, namely, conditional random fields for NER and support vector machines for RC, respectively. In addition, we developed a deep learning-based joint model that recognizes ADEs and their relations to medications in 1 step using a sequence labeling approach. To further improve the performance, we also investigated different ensemble approaches to generating optimal performance by combining outputs from multiple approaches. RESULTS: Our best-performing systems achieved F1 scores of 93.45% for NER, 96.30% for RC, and 89.05% for end-to-end evaluation, which ranked #2, #1, and #1 among all participants, respectively. Additional evaluations show that the deep learning-based approaches did outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in both NER and RC. The joint model that simultaneously recognizes ADEs and their relations to medications also achieved the best performance on RC, indicating its promise for relation extraction. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed deep learning approaches for extracting medications and their attributes such as ADEs, and demonstrated its superior performance compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, indicating its uses in broader NER and RC tasks in the medical domain.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocz063,27,1,13-21,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*adverse drug events and *deep learning and *Deep Learning and *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and *electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records and *named entity recognition and *Natural Language Processing and *relation extraction and adverse drug events and Algorithms and deep learning and electronic health records and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Machine Learning and named entity recognition and Narration and Pharmaceutical Preparations and relation extraction,NA,NA,2020/01/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mahmoud_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,An Efficient Deep Learning Based Method for Speech Assessment of Mandarin-Speaking Aphasic Patients,"Mahmoud, Seedahmed S. and Kumar, Akshay and Tang, Yiting and Li, Youcun and Gu, Xudong and Fu, Jianming and Fang, Qiang",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Speech assessment is an important part of the rehabilitation process for patients with aphasia (PWA). Mandarin speech lucidity features such as articulation, fluency, and tone influence the meaning of the spoken utterance and overall speech clarity. Automatic assessment of these features is important for an efficient assessment of the aphasic speech. Hence, in this paper, a standardized automatic speech lucidity assessment method for Mandarin-speaking aphasic patients using a machine learning based technique is presented. The proposed assessment method adopts the Chinese Rehabilitation Research Center Aphasia Examination (CRRCAE) standard as a guideline. Quadrature based high-resolution time-frequency images with a convolutional neural network (CNN) are utilized to develop a method that can map the relationship between the severity level of aphasic patients' speech and the three speech lucidity features. The results show a linear relationship with statistically significant correlations between the normalized true-class output activations (TCOA) of the CNN model and patients' articulation, fluency, and tone scores, i.e., 0.71 (p < 0.001), 0.60 (p < 0.001) and 0.58 (p < 0.001), respectively. The linearity of the proposed Mandarin aphasic speech assessment method and its significant correlation with the speech severity levels show the efficacy of the method in predicting the severity of impaired Mandarin speech. The outcome of this research envisages assisting speech-language pathologists in Mandarin-speech impairment assessment and promoting early support discharge; hence could alleviate the stress that the healthcare system is currently experiencing in China nationwide. The framework of the proposed Mandarin aphasic speech assessment method can be readily extended to other languages.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3011104,24,11,3191-3202,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Aphasia/diagnosis and *Deep Learning and Humans and Language and Neural Networks, Computer and Speech",NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). METHODS: Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. RESULTS: After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage.

However, daily assessment of emotional states largely depends on active self-reports, which are often inconvenient and prone to incomplete information. Automated detection of emotional states and transitions on a daily basis could be an effective solution to this problem. However, the relationship between emotional transitions and everyday context remains to be unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the relationship between contextual information and emotional transitions and states to evaluate the feasibility of detecting emotional transitions and states from daily contextual information using machine learning (ML) techniques. METHODS: This study was conducted on the data of 18 individuals from a publicly available data set called ExtraSensory. Contextual and sensor data were collected using smartphone and smartwatch sensors in a free-living condition, where the number of days for each person varied from 3 to 9. Sensors included an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, location services, a microphone, a phone state indicator, light, temperature, and a barometer. The users self-reported approximately 49 discrete emotions at different intervals via a smartphone app throughout the data collection period. We mapped the 49 reported discrete emotions to the 3 dimensions of the pleasure, arousal, and dominance model and considered 6 emotional states: discordant, pleased, dissuaded, aroused, submissive, and dominant. We built general and personalized models for detecting emotional transitions and states every 5 min. The transition detection problem is a binary classification problem that detects whether a person's emotional state has changed over time, whereas state detection is a multiclass classification problem. In both cases, a wide range of supervised ML algorithms were leveraged, in addition to data preprocessing, feature selection, and data imbalance handling techniques. Finally, an assessment was conducted to shed light on the association between everyday context and emotional states. RESULTS: This study obtained promising results for emotional state and transition detection. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for emotional state detection reached 60.55% in the general models and an average of 96.33% across personalized models. Despite the highly imbalanced data, the best AUROC curve for emotional transition detection reached 90.5% in the general models and an average of 88.73% across personalized models. In general, feature analyses show that spatiotemporal context, phone state, and motion-related information are the most informative factors for emotional state and transition detection. Our assessment showed that lifestyle has an impact on the predictability of emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a strong association of daily context with emotional states and transitions as well as the feasibility of detecting emotional states and transitions using data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors.",2020,10.2196/17818,8,9,e17818,eng,2291-5222,*artificial intelligence and *digital biomarkers and *digital phenotyping and *emotion detection and *emotional transition detection and *Machine Learning and *mental health and *mHealth and *mobile phone and *Smartphone and *spatiotemporal context and *supervised machine learning and artificial intelligence and digital biomarkers and digital phenotyping and emotion detection and emotional transition detection and Emotions and Humans and mental health and mHealth and mobile phone and Self Report and Smokers and spatiotemporal context and supervised machine learning,NA,NA,2020/09/29/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The application of medical informatics allows patients to be aware of their clinical conditions, which may contribute toward the prevention of several chronic diseases and disorders. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to construct a medical database system from electronic medical records (EMRs) of subjects who have undergone health examination. This system aims to provide online self-health evaluation to clinicians and patients worldwide, enabling personalized health and preventive health. METHODS: We built a medical database system based on the literature, and data preprocessing and cleaning were performed for the database. We utilized both supervised and unsupervised machine learning technology to analyze the EMR data to establish prediction models. The models with EMR databases were then applied to the internet platform. RESULTS: The validation data were used to validate the online diagnosis prediction system. The accuracy of the prediction model for metabolic syndrome reached 91%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.904 in this system. For chronic kidney disease, the prediction accuracy of the model reached 94.7%, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.982. In addition, the system also provided disease diagnosis visualization via clustering, allowing users to check their outcome compared with those in the medical database, enabling increased awareness for a healthier lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Our web-based health care machine learning system allowed users to access online diagnosis predictions and provided a health examination report. Users could understand and review their health status accordingly.

We aim to answer consumer health questions with information from reliable sources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combine knowledge-based, traditional machine and deep learning approaches to understand consumers' questions and select the best answers from consumer-oriented sources. We evaluate the end-to-end system and its components on simple questions generated in a pilot development of MedlinePlus Alexa skill, as well as the short and long real-life questions submitted to the National Library of Medicine by consumers. RESULTS: Our system achieves 78.7% mean average precision and 87.9% mean reciprocal rank on simple Alexa questions, and 44.5% mean average precision and 51.6% mean reciprocal rank on real-life questions submitted by National Library of Medicine consumers. DISCUSSION: The ensemble of deep learning, domain knowledge, and traditional approaches recognizes question type and focus well in the simple questions, but it leaves room for improvement on the real-life consumers' questions. Information retrieval approaches alone are sufficient for finding answers to simple Alexa questions.

However, the integration of wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices can aid in monitoring home exercise by analyzing exercise biomechanics. The objective of this study is to evaluate machine learning models for classifying nine different upper extremity exercises, based upon kinematic data captured from an IMU-based device. Fifty participants performed one compound and eight isolation exercises with their right arm. Each exercise was performed ten times for a total of 4500 trials. Joint angles were calculated using IMUs that were placed on the hand, forearm, upper arm, and torso. Various machine learning models were developed with different algorithms and train-test splits. Random forest models with flattened kinematic data as a feature had the greatest accuracy (98.6%). Using triaxial joint range of motion as the feature set resulted in decreased accuracy (91.9%) with faster speeds. Accuracy did not decrease below 90% until training size was decreased to 5% from 50%. Accuracy decreased (88.7%) when splitting data by participant. Upper extremity exercises can be classified accurately using kinematic data from a wearable IMU device. A random forest classification model was developed that quickly and accurately classified exercises. Sampling frequency and lower training splits had a modest effect on performance. When the data were split by subject stratification, larger training sizes were required for acceptable algorithm performance.

With the development of deep learning algorithms, individual follow-up assignments might be completed by artificial intelligence (AI). We developed an AI-assisted follow-up conversational agent that can simulate the human voice and select an appropriate follow-up time for quantitative, automatic, and personalized patient follow-up. Patient feedback and voice information could be collected and converted into text data automatically. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up to manual follow-up of patients after surgery. The secondary objective was to compare the feedback from AI-assisted follow-up to feedback from manual follow-up. METHODS: The AI-assisted follow-up system was adopted in the Orthopedic Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in April 2019. A total of 270 patients were followed up through this system. Prior to that, 2656 patients were followed up by phone calls manually. Patient characteristics, telephone connection rate, follow-up rate, feedback collection rate, time spent, and feedback composition were compared between the two groups of patients. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in age, gender, or disease between the two groups. There was no significant difference in telephone connection rate (manual: 2478/2656, 93.3%; AI-assisted: 249/270, 92.2%; P=.50) or successful follow-up rate (manual: 2301/2478, 92.9%; AI-assisted: 231/249, 92.8%; P=.96) between the two groups. The time spent on 100 patients in the manual follow-up group was about 9.3 hours. In contrast, the time spent on the AI-assisted follow-up was close to 0 hours.

In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict a patient's response to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey's ""Doctor Communications"" domain questions while simultaneously identifying most impactful providers in a network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational study of patients admitted to a single tertiary care hospital between 2016 and 2020. Using machine learning algorithms, electronic health record data were used to predict patient responses to Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey questions in the doctor domain, and patients who are at risk for responding negatively were identified. Model performance was assessed by area under receiver-operating characteristic curve. Social network analysis metrics were also used to identify providers most impactful to patient experience. RESULTS: Using a random forest algorithm, patients' responses to the following 3 questions were predicted: ""During this hospital stay how often did doctors. 1) treat you with courtesy and respect? 2) explain things in a way that you could understand? 3) listen carefully to you?"" with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.876, 0.819, and 0.819, respectively. Social network analysis found that doctors with higher centrality appear to have an outsized influence on patient experience, as measured by rank in the random forest model in the doctor domain.

RESULTS: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies.",2019,10.2196/11241,21,2,e11241,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*e-learning and *education and *Learning and *learning analytics and *learning management systems and *online learning and *systematic review and Clinical Competence/*standards and e-learning and education and Humans and learning analytics and learning management systems and online learning and Program Evaluation/*methods and Qualitative Research and systematic review and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2019/02/13/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

The magnitude of this problem is rising, jeopardizing the effectiveness of evidence-based therapies. An important reason for this is the unprecedented demographic change at the beginning of the 21st century. Aging leads to multimorbidity and complex therapeutic regimens that create a fertile ground for nonadherence. As this scenario is a global problem, it needs a worldwide answer. Could this answer be provided, given the new opportunities created by the digitization of health care? Daily, health-related information is being collected in electronic health records, pharmacy dispensing databases, health insurance systems, and national health system records. These big data repositories offer a unique chance to study adherence both retrospectively and prospectively at the population level, as well as its related factors. In order to make full use of this opportunity, there is a need to develop standardized measures of adherence, which can be applied globally to big data and will inform scientific research, clinical practice, and public health. These standardized measures may also enable a better understanding of the relationship between adherence and clinical outcomes, and allow for fair benchmarking of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adherence-targeting interventions. Unfortunately, despite this obvious need, such standards are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to call for a consensus on global standards for measuring adherence with big data. More specifically, sound standards of formatting and analyzing big data are needed in order to assess, uniformly present, and compare patterns of medication adherence across studies. Wide use of these standards may improve adherence and make health care systems more effective and sustainable.",2020,10.2196/18150,22,8,e18150,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*big data and *Big Data and *consensus and *metrics and *patient adherence and big data and consensus and Humans and metrics and patient adherence and Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data and Retrospective Studies,NA,NA,2020/08/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In previous studies, statistical methods have been applied to impute missing values on the basis of statistical assumptions. Deep learning algorithms, however, can learn features from the data without any such assumptions and may outperform previous approaches in imputation tasks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to impute missing values in data using a deep learning approach. METHODS: To develop an imputation model for missing values in accelerometer-based actigraphy data, a denoising convolutional autoencoder was adopted. We trained and tested our deep learning-based imputation model with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set and validated it with the external Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Korean Chronic Cerebrovascular Disease Oriented Biobank data sets which consist of daily records measuring activity counts. The partial root mean square error and partial mean absolute error of the imputed intervals (partial RMSE and partial MAE, respectively) were calculated using our deep learning-based imputation model (zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder) as well as using other approaches (mean imputation, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and Bayesian regression). RESULTS: The zero-inflated denoising convolutional autoencoder exhibited a partial RMSE of 839.3 counts and partial MAE of 431.1 counts, whereas mean imputation achieved a partial RMSE of 1053.2 counts and partial MAE of 545.4 counts, the zero-inflated Poisson regression model achieved a partial RMSE of 1255.6 counts and partial MAE of 508.6 counts, and Bayesian regression achieved a partial RMSE of 924.5 counts and partial MAE of 605.8 counts.

Schachner_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents for Chronic Conditions: Systematic Literature Review,"Schachner, Theresa and Keller, Roman and V Wangenheim, Florian",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: A rising number of conversational agents or chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms ""conversational agent,"" ""healthcare,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis. RESULTS: The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.",2020,10.2196/20701,22,9,e20701,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *chatbots and *chronic diseases and *conversational agents and *healthcare and *Natural Language Processing and *systematic literature review and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*standards and chatbots and Chronic Disease/*therapy and chronic diseases and Communication and conversational agents and healthcare and Humans and systematic literature review,NA,NA,2020/09/14/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the complexity of healthcare decisions, it is likely that ML outputs will need to be understood and trusted by physicians, and then explained to patients. We therefore investigated the association between physician understanding of ML outputs, their ability to explain these to patients, and their willingness to trust the ML outputs, using various ML explainability methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a survey for physicians with a diagnostic dilemma that could be resolved by an ML risk calculator. Physicians were asked to rate their understanding, explainability, and trust in response to 3 different ML outputs. One ML output had no explanation of its logic (the control) and 2 ML outputs used different model-agnostic explainability methods. The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P < .001), between physician understanding and trust (P < .001), and between explainability and trust (P < .001). ML outputs that used model-agnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular ML explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in ML risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred ML outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocz229,27,4,592-600,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*artificial intelligence and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Attitude to Computers and *Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and *decision support and *explainability and *interpretability and *Machine Learning and *medicine and *Physicians/psychology and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence and decision support and explainability and Humans and interpretability and medicine and Pulmonary Embolism/diagnosis and Risk Assessment/methods and Surveys and Questionnaires and Trust and User-Computer Interface",NA,NA,2020/04/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The gold-standard (human auditors) is insufficient for assessing true overall compliance. Computer vision technology has the ability to perform more accurate appraisals. Our primary objective was to evaluate if a computer vision algorithm could accurately observe hand hygiene dispenser use in images captured by depth sensors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen depth sensors were installed on one hospital unit. Images were collected continuously from March to August 2017. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, a machine learning algorithm was trained to detect hand hygiene dispenser use in the images. The algorithm's accuracy was then compared with simultaneous in-person observations of hand hygiene dispenser usage. Concordance rate between human observation and algorithm's assessment was calculated. Ground truth was established by blinded annotation of the entire image set. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for both human and machine-level observation. RESULTS: A concordance rate of 96.8% was observed between human and algorithm (kappa = 0.85). Concordance among the 3 independent auditors to establish ground truth was 95.4% (Fleiss's kappa = 0.87). Sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning algorithm were 92.1% and 98.3%, respectively. Human observations showed sensitivity and specificity of 85.2% and 99.4%, respectively.

However, many claim such data cannot be used to estimate causal treatment effects because of the potential for observational study bias; for example, due to residual confounding. Other concerns include P hacking and publication bias. In response, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics international collaborative launched the Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND) research initiative. Its mission is to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases while addressing the aforementioned concerns by following a recently proposed paradigm. We define 10 principles of LEGEND that enshrine this new paradigm, prescribing the generation and dissemination of evidence on many research questions at once; for example, comparing all treatments for a disease for many outcomes, thus preventing publication bias. These questions are answered using a prespecified and systematic approach, avoiding P hacking. Best-practice statistical methods address measured confounding, and control questions (research questions where the answer is known) quantify potential residual bias. Finally, the evidence is generated in a network of databases to assess consistency by sharing open-source analytics code to enhance transparency and reproducibility, but without sharing patient-level information.

Cirkovic_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Evaluation of Four Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Self-Diagnosis Apps on Three Diagnoses: Two-Year Follow-Up Study,"Cirkovic, Aleksandar",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Consumer-oriented mobile self-diagnosis apps have been developed using undisclosed algorithms, presumably based on machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration now discerns apps with learning AI algorithms from those with stable ones and treats the former as medical devices. To the author's knowledge, no self-diagnosis app testing has been performed in the field of ophthalmology so far. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test apps that were previously mentioned in the scientific literature on a set of diagnoses in a deliberate time interval, comparing the results and looking for differences that hint at ""nonlocked"" learning algorithms. METHODS: Four apps from the literature were chosen (Ada, Babylon, Buoy, and Your.MD). A set of three ophthalmology diagnoses (glaucoma, retinal tear, dry eye syndrome) representing three levels of urgency was used to simultaneously test the apps' diagnostic efficiency and treatment recommendations in this specialty. Two years was the chosen time interval between the tests (2018 and 2020). Scores were awarded by one evaluating physician using a defined scheme. RESULTS: Two apps (Ada and Your.MD) received significantly higher scores than the other two. All apps either worsened in their results between 2018 and 2020 or remained unchanged at a low level. The variation in the results over time indicates ""nonlocked"" learning algorithms using AI technologies. None of the apps provided correct diagnoses and treatment recommendations for all three diagnoses in 2020. Two apps (Babylon and Your.MD) asked significantly fewer questions than the other two (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: ""Nonlocked"" algorithms are used by self-diagnosis apps. The diagnostic efficiency of the tested apps seems to worsen over time, with some apps being more capable than others. Systematic studies on a wider scale are necessary for health care providers and patients to correctly assess the safety and efficacy of such apps and for correct classification by health care regulating authorities.",2020,10.2196/18097,22,12,e18097,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *machine learning and *medical diagnosis and *mHealth and *mobile apps and Algorithms and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*standards and Follow-Up Studies and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and medical diagnosis and mHealth and Mobile Applications/*standards and mobile apps and Time Factors,NA,NA,2020/12/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ozaydin_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Healthcare Research and Analytics Data Infrastructure Solution: A Data Warehouse for Health Services Research,"Ozaydin, Bunyamin and Zengul, Ferhat and Oner, Nurettin and Feldman, Sue S.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Health services researchers spend a substantial amount of time performing integration, cleansing, interpretation, and aggregation of raw data from multiple public or private data sources. Often, each researcher (or someone in their team) duplicates this effort for their own project, facing the same challenges and experiencing the same pitfalls discovered by those before them. OBJECTIVE: This paper described a design process for creating a data warehouse that includes the most frequently used databases in health services research. METHODS: The design is based on a conceptual iterative process model framework that utilizes the sociotechnical systems theory approach and includes the capacity for subsequent updates of the existing data sources and the addition of new ones. We introduce the theory and the framework and then explain how they are used to inform the methodology of this study. RESULTS: The application of the iterative process model to the design research process of problem identification and solution design for the Healthcare Research and Analytics Data Infrastructure Solution (HRADIS) is described. Each phase of the iterative model produced end products to inform the implementation of HRADIS. The analysis phase produced the problem statement and requirements documents. The projection phase produced a list of tasks and goals for the ideal system. Finally, the synthesis phase provided the process for a plan to implement HRADIS. HRADIS structures and integrates data dictionaries provided by the data sources, allowing the creation of dimensions and measures for a multidimensional business intelligence system. We discuss how HRADIS is complemented with a set of data mining, analytics, and visualization tools to enable researchers to more efficiently apply multiple methods to a given research project. HRADIS also includes a built-in security and account management framework for data governance purposes to ensure customized authorization depending on user roles and parts of the data the roles are authorized to access. CONCLUSIONS: To address existing inefficiencies during the obtaining, extracting, preprocessing, cleansing, and filtering stages of data processing in health services research, we envision HRADIS as a full-service data warehouse integrating frequently used data sources, processes, and methods along with a variety of data analytics and visualization tools.

Although clinical data in their raw form can be used directly for predictive modeling, it is a common practice to map data to standard terminologies to facilitate data aggregation and reuse. There is, however, a lack of systematic investigation of how different representations could affect the performance of predictive models, especially in the context of machine learning and deep learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We projected the input diagnoses data in the Cerner HealthFacts database to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and 5 other terminologies, including CCS, CCSR, ICD-9, ICD-10, and PheWAS, and evaluated the prediction performances of these terminologies on 2 different tasks: the risk prediction of heart failure in diabetes patients and the risk prediction of pancreatic cancer. Two popular models were evaluated: logistic regression and a recurrent neural network. RESULTS: For logistic regression, using UMLS delivered the optimal area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) results in both dengue hemorrhagic fever (81.15%) and pancreatic cancer (80.53%) tasks. For recurrent neural network, UMLS worked best for pancreatic cancer prediction (AUROC 82.24%), second only (AUROC 85.55%) to PheWAS (AUROC 85.87%) for dengue hemorrhagic fever prediction.

Ismail_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Requirements of Health Data Management Systems for Biomedical Care and Research: Scoping Review,"Ismail, Leila and Materwala, Huned and Karduck, Achim P. and Adem, Abdu",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Over the last century, disruptive incidents in the fields of clinical and biomedical research have yielded a tremendous change in health data management systems. This is due to a number of breakthroughs in the medical field and the need for big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) to be incorporated in a real-time smart health information management system. In addition, the requirements of patient care have evolved over time, allowing for more accurate prognoses and diagnoses. In this paper, we discuss the temporal evolution of health data management systems and capture the requirements that led to the development of a given system over a certain period of time. Consequently, we provide insights into those systems and give suggestions and research directions on how they can be improved for a better health care system. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show that there is a need for a secure and efficient health data management system that will allow physicians and patients to update decentralized medical records and to analyze the medical data for supporting more precise diagnoses, prognoses, and public insights. Limitations of existing health data management systems were analyzed. METHODS: To study the evolution and requirements of health data management systems over the years, a search was conducted to obtain research articles and information on medical lawsuits, health regulations, and acts. These materials were obtained from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery, Elsevier, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: Health data management systems have undergone a disruptive transformation over the years from paper to computer, web, cloud, IoT, big data analytics, and finally to blockchain. The requirements of a health data management system revealed from the evolving definitions of medical records and their management are (1) medical record data, (2) real-time data access, (3) patient participation, (4) data sharing, (5) data security, (6) patient identity privacy, and (7) public insights. This paper reviewed health data management systems based on these 7 requirements across studies conducted over the years. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the temporal evolution of health data management systems giving insights into the system requirements for better health care. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for a comprehensive real-time health data management system that allows physicians, patients, and external users to input their medical and lifestyle data into the system. The incorporation of big data analytics will aid in better prognosis or diagnosis of the diseases and the prediction of diseases. The prediction results will help in the development of an effective prevention plan.",2020,10.2196/17508,22,7,e17508,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*big data and *blockchain and *data analytics and *eHealth and *electronic medical records and *health care and *health information management and *Internet of Things and *medical research and *mHealth and big data and Biomedical Research/*methods and blockchain and data analytics and Data Management/*methods and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and eHealth and electronic medical records and health care and health information management and Humans and Internet of Things and medical research and mHealth,NA,NA,2020/07/07/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for ""identifiability"". We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions.

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. METHODS: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ""conversational agents,"" ""conversational AI,"" ""chatbots,"" and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents.

Balachandar_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Accounting for data variability in multi-institutional distributed deep learning for medical imaging,"Balachandar, Niranjan and Chang, Ken and Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree and Rubin, Daniel L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVES: Sharing patient data across institutions to train generalizable deep learning models is challenging due to regulatory and technical hurdles. Distributed learning, where model weights are shared instead of patient data, presents an attractive alternative. Cyclical weight transfer (CWT) has recently been demonstrated as an effective distributed learning method for medical imaging with homogeneous data across institutions. In this study, we optimize CWT to overcome performance losses from variability in training sample sizes and label distributions across institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimizations included proportional local training iterations, cyclical learning rate, locally weighted minibatch sampling, and cyclically weighted loss. We evaluated our optimizations on simulated distributed diabetic retinopathy detection and chest radiograph classification. RESULTS: Proportional local training iteration mitigated performance losses from sample size variability, achieving 98.6% of the accuracy attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split with highest sample size variance across institutions. Locally weighted minibatch sampling and cyclically weighted loss both mitigated performance losses from label distribution variability, achieving 98.6% and 99.1%, respectively, of the accuracy attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split with highest label distribution variability across institutions. DISCUSSION: Our optimizations to CWT improve its capability of handling data variability across institutions. Compared to CWT without optimizations, CWT with optimizations achieved performance significantly closer to performance from centrally hosting. CONCLUSION: Our work is the first to identify and address challenges of sample size and label distribution variability in simulated distributed deep learning for medical imaging.

Wang_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Contrastive Cross-Site Learning With Redesigned Net for COVID-19 CT Classification,"Wang, Zhao and Liu, Quande and Dou, Qi",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19 identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the performanceson both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3023246,24,10,2806-2813,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Betacoronavirus and *Deep Learning and *Pandemics/classification and Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*statistics & numerical data and Computational Biology and Computer Systems and Coronavirus Infections/classification/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging and COVID-19 and COVID-19 Testing and Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data and Humans and Machine Learning and Pneumonia, Viral/classification/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging and Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/statistics & numerical data and SARS-CoV-2 and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability to monitor breathing metrics may have indications both for general health as well as respiratory conditions such as asthma, where long-term monitoring of lung function has shown promising utility. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we explore a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture and predict measures of interbreath intervals, respiratory rate, and the inspiration-expiration ratio from a photoplethysmogram signal. This serves as a proof-of-concept study of the applicability of a machine learning architecture to the derivation of respiratory metrics. METHODS: A pulse oximeter was mounted to the left index finger of 9 healthy subjects who breathed at controlled respiratory rates. A respiratory band was used to collect a reference signal as a comparison. RESULTS: Over a 40-second window, the LSTM model predicted a respiratory waveform through which breathing metrics could be derived with a bias value and 95% CI. Metrics included inspiration time (-0.16 seconds, -1.64 to 1.31 seconds), expiration time (0.09 seconds, -1.35 to 1.53 seconds), respiratory rate (0.12 breaths per minute, -2.13 to 2.37 breaths per minute), interbreath intervals (-0.07 seconds, -1.75 to 1.61 seconds), and the inspiration-expiration ratio (0.09, -0.66 to 0.84).

The improvement effort necessitates reliable prediction models which can identify high-risk patients effectively and enable healthcare practitioners to take a strategic approach. Using predictive analytics based on electronic health record (EHR) for hospital readmission is faced with multiple challenges such as high dimensionality and event sparsity of medical codes and the class imbalance. To response to these challenges, an analytical framework is proposed by data-driven approaches using hospital inpatient administrative data from a nationwide healthcare dataset. A joint ensemble-learning model, which combines the modified weight boosting algorithm with stacking algorithm, is developed and validated. Our study first explores the effects of different feature engineering methods, which effectively handles the challenge of medical vector representation and medical vector sparsity. Secondly, ensemble learning with the proposed modified weight boosting algorithm is used to tackle the class imbalance problem and improve predictability. Finally, we provide various misclassification costs by setting different weights for each class during model training. Using the framework with the proposed modified weight boosting algorithm improves overall model performance by 22.7% and recall from 0.726 to the highest of 0.891 comparing to the benchmark models.

Machine learning classifiers that identify vaping-relevant tweets and characterize sentiments in them can underpin a Twitter-based vaping surveillance system. Compared with traditional machine learning classifiers that are reliant on annotations that are expensive to obtain, deep learning classifiers offer the advantage of requiring fewer annotated tweets by leveraging the large numbers of readily available unannotated tweets. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to derive and evaluate traditional and deep learning classifiers that can identify tweets relevant to vaping, tweets of a commercial nature, and tweets with provape sentiments. METHODS: We continuously collected tweets that matched vaping-related keywords over 2 months from August 2018 to October 2018. From this data set of tweets, a set of 4000 tweets was selected, and each tweet was manually annotated for relevance (vape relevant or not), commercial nature (commercial or not), and sentiment (provape or not). Using the annotated data, we derived traditional classifiers that included logistic regression, random forest, linear support vector machine, and multinomial naive Bayes. In addition, using the annotated data set and a larger unannotated data set of tweets, we derived deep learning classifiers that included a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, LSTM-CNN network, and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network. The unannotated tweet data were used to derive word vectors that deep learning classifiers can leverage to improve performance. RESULTS: LSTM-CNN performed the best with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.98) for relevance, all deep learning classifiers including LSTM-CNN performed better than the traditional classifiers with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) for distinguishing commercial from noncommercial tweets, and BiLSTM performed the best with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.89) for provape sentiment. Overall, LSTM-CNN performed the best across all 3 classification tasks. CONCLUSIONS: We derived and evaluated traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers to identify vaping-related relevant, commercial, and provape tweets.

In recent years, the windfalls of ""big data"" have afforded investigators more substrate for research than ever before. However, issues with translation have persisted: although countless biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting have been proposed, few of these generalize effectively.

Few studies have investigated employee perceptions of artificial intelligence implementation in Saudi Arabia and the Arabian world. In addition, limited studies investigated the effect of employee knowledge and job title on the perception of artificial intelligence implementation in the workplace. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore health care employee perceptions and attitudes toward the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in health care institutions in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: An online questionnaire was published, and responses were collected from 250 employees, including doctors, nurses, and technicians at 4 of the largest hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that 3.11 of 4 respondents feared artificial intelligence would replace employees and had a general lack of knowledge regarding artificial intelligence.

However, the processing of medical texts is difficult because they are structurally free, diverse in style, and have subjective factors. Assigning metadata codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) presents a standardized way of indicating diagnoses and procedures, so it becomes a mandatory process for understanding medical records to make better clinical and financial decisions. Such a manual encoding task is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach and a medical topic mining method to automatically predict ICD codes from text-free medical records.

It is most relevant for the care provider and insurer as well as for the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. METHODS: In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. RESULTS: Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care.",2020,10.2196/16866,22,2,e16866,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *cost-benefit analysis and *machine learning and *telemedicine and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*economics and cost-benefit analysis and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Health Care Costs/*standards and Humans and machine learning and telemedicine,NA,NA,2020/02/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recurrent neural network (RNN) long short-term memory (LSTM) and RNN gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning methods were designed and compared with random forest and multilayer perceptron traditional models. Prediction accuracy of selected complications were compared on 3 settings corresponding to minimum number of hospitalizations between diabetes diagnosis and the diagnosis of complications. RESULTS: The diagnosis domain was used for experiments. The best results were achieved with RNN GRU model, followed by RNN LSTM model. The prediction accuracy achieved with RNN GRU model was between 73% (myocardial infarction) and 83% (chronic ischemic heart disease), while accuracy of traditional models was between 66% - 76%. DISCUSSION: The number of hospitalizations was an important factor for the prediction accuracy. Experiments with 4 hospitalizations achieved significantly better accuracy than with 2 hospitalizations. To achieve improved accuracy deep learning models required training on at least 1000 patients and accuracy significantly dropped if training datasets contained 500 patients.

von.Wedel_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Economic Value of Data and Analytics for Health Care Providers: Hermeneutic Systematic Literature Review,"von Wedel, Philip and Hagist, Christian",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of data and analytics for health care systems and single providers is an increasingly investigated field in digital health literature. Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. RESULTS: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base.",2020,10.2196/23315,22,11,e23315,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *data analytics and *digital health and *electronic health records and *health information technology and *healthcare provider economics and *Hermeneutics and artificial intelligence and Data Analysis and data analytics and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and digital health and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*standards and health information technology and Health Personnel/*economics and healthcare provider economics and Humans",NA,NA,2020/11/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, deriving insights for clinical practice and individual life choices and deciding what data or information should be used for this purpose pose difficult challenges that require tremendous time, resources, and skill. Thus, big data not only promises new clinical insights but also generates new-and heretofore largely unarticulated-forms of work for patients, families, and health care providers alike. Building on science studies, medical informatics, Anselm Strauss and colleagues' concept of patient work, and subsequent elaborations of articulation work, in this article, we analyze the forms of work engendered by the need to make data and information actionable for the treatment decisions and lives of individual patients. We outline three areas of data work, which we characterize as the work of supporting digital data practices, the work of interpretation and contextualization, and the work of inclusion and interaction. This is a first step toward naming and making visible these forms of work in order that they can be adequately seen, rewarded, and assessed in the future.

In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians' use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI.

This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care.

With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, it is highly possible that physicians and health care workers will not be able to treat all cases. Thus, computer scientists can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve rapid control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this review were to analyze the current literature, discuss the applicability of reported ideas for using AI to prevent and control COVID-19, and build a comprehensive view of how current systems may be useful in particular areas. This may be of great help to many health care administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers worldwide. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of articles in the MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive review that summarizes different categories of the most recently reported AI-based approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Our search identified the 10 most recent AI approaches that were suggested to provide the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These approaches included detection of suspected cases, large-scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, pneumonia screening, use of the IIoT for data and information gathering and integration, resource allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: We found few or almost no studies regarding the use of AI to examine COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, the use of AI for resource allocation to COVID-19 patients, or the use of AI and the IIoT for COVID-19 data and information gathering/integration. Moreover, the adoption of other approaches, including use of AI for COVID-19 prediction, use of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and use of AI robotics for medical quarantine, should be further emphasized by researchers because these important approaches lack sufficient numbers of studies. Therefore, we recommend that computer scientists focus on these approaches, which are still not being adequately addressed.",2020,10.2196/19104,22,8,e19104,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *Betacoronavirus and *COVID-19 and *internet of things and *machine learning and *modeling and *novel coronavirus and *robotics and *SARS-CoV-2 and *simulation and *telemedicine and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence and Coronavirus Infections/*prevention & control and COVID-19 and Health Personnel and Humans and Internet and internet of things and machine learning and modeling and novel coronavirus and Pandemics/*prevention & control and Pneumonia, Viral/*prevention & control and Risk Factors and robotics and SARS-CoV-2 and simulation and telemedicine",NA,NA,2020/08/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents. METHODS: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

Triantafyllidis_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Applications of Machine Learning in Real-Life Digital Health Interventions: Review of the Literature,"Triantafyllidis, Andreas K. and Tsanas, Athanasios",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning has attracted considerable research interest toward developing smart digital health interventions. These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction). RESULTS: Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.",2019,10.2196/12286,21,4,e12286,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *data mining and *digital health and *machine learning and *review and *telemedicine and artificial intelligence and data mining and Data Mining/*methods and digital health and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*trends and Quality of Health Care/*standards and review and telemedicine and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2019/04/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

S. and Coiera, Enrico",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review the characteristics, current applications, and evaluation measures of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities used for health-related purposes. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen's kappa measured inter-coder agreement. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d = 0.44, p = .04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 <c2><ba>C without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.",2020,10.2196/21801,22,10,e21801,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *big data and *COVID-19 and *electronic health records and *Machine Learning and *Natural Language Processing and *predictive model and *SARS-CoV-2 and *tachypnea and Adult and Aged and artificial intelligence and Betacoronavirus and big data and Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and COVID-19 and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and Emergency Service, Hospital and Female and Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data and Humans and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and Male and Middle Aged and Pandemics and Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and predictive model and Prognosis and Retrospective Studies and SARS-CoV-2 and Spain/epidemiology and tachypnea and Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,2020/10/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers. RESULTS: DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a ""long tail"" of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific. DISCUSSION: Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted.

Social network platforms, where users can express their emotions, feelings, and thoughts, are a valuable source of data for researching mental health, and techniques based on machine learning are increasingly used for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to explore the scope and limits of cutting-edge techniques that researchers are using for predictive analytics in mental health and to review associated issues, such as ethical concerns, in this area of research. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in March 2017, using keywords to search articles on data mining of social network data in the context of common mental health disorders, published between 2010 and March 8, 2017 in medical and computer science journals. RESULTS: The initial search returned a total of 5386 articles. Following a careful analysis of the titles, abstracts, and main texts, we selected 48 articles for review. We coded the articles according to key characteristics, techniques used for data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model construction, and model verification. The most common analytical method was text analysis, with several studies using different flavors of image analysis and social interaction graph analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increasing number of studies investigating mental health issues using social network data, some common problems persist.

Chen_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19: Rapid Review,"Chen, Jiayang and See, Kay Choong",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has since evolved into a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19-related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shaw_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence and the Implementation Challenge,"Shaw, James and Rudzicz, Frank and Jamieson, Trevor and Goldfarb, Avi",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). METHODS: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. RESULTS: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. CONCLUSIONS: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.",2019,10.2196/13659,21,7,e13659,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *ethics and *implementation science and *machine learning and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*standards and ethics and Humans and implementation science and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2019/07/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chae_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Web-Based Upper Limb Home Rehabilitation System Using a Smartwatch and Machine Learning Model for Chronic Stroke Survivors: Prospective Comparative Study,"Chae, Sang Hoon and Kim, Yushin and Lee, Kyoung-Soub and Park, Hyung-Soon",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

Assisting health organizations to improve, adapt, and introduce new patient-health care practitioner communication channels (such as patient portals, mobile apps, and text messaging) enhances health care services access. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective data study aims to assist health care administrators and policy makers to improve and personalize communication between patients and health care professionals by expanding the capabilities of current communication channels and introducing new ones. Our main hypothesis is that patient follow-up and clinical outcomes are influenced by their preferred communication channels with the health care organization. METHODS: This study analyzes data stored in electronic medical records and logs documenting access to various communication channels between patients and a health organization (Clalit Health Services, Israel). Data were collected between 2008 and 2016 from records of 311,168 patients diagnosed with diabetes, aged 21 years and over, members of Clalit at least since 2007, and still alive in 2016. The analysis consisted of characterizing the use profiles of communication channels over time and used clustering for discretization purposes and patient profile building and then a hierarchical clustering and heatmaps to visualize the different communication profiles. RESULTS: A total of 13 profiles of patients were identified and characterized. We have shown how the communication channels provided by the health organization influence the communication behavior of patients. We observed how different patients respond differently to technological means of communication and change or don't change their communication patterns with the health care organization based on the communication channels available to them. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the channels of communication within the health organization and which are preferred by each patient creates an opportunity to convey messages adapted to the patient in the most appropriate way. The greater the likelihood that the therapeutic message is received by the patient, the greater the patient's response and proactiveness to the treatment will be.

The meaningful combination of omics data, ie, pathogenic gene variants and alterations with other patient data, to understand the full picture of malignancy has been challenging. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the implementation of a system capable of processing, analyzing, and subsequently combining NGS data with other clinical patient data for analysis within and across institutions. METHODS: On the basis of the already existing NGS analysis workflows for the identification of malignant gene variants at the Institute of Pathology of the University Hospital Erlangen, we defined basic requirements on an NGS processing and analysis pipeline and implemented a pipeline based on the GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) open source genetic variation database. For the purpose of validation, this pipeline was applied to data from the 1000 Genomes Project and subsequently to NGS data derived from 206 patients of a local hospital. We further integrated the pipeline into existing structures of data integration centers at the University Hospital Erlangen and combined NGS data with local nongenomic patient-derived data available in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format. RESULTS: Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and from the patient cohort as input, the implemented system produced the same results as already established methodologies. Further, it satisfied all our identified requirements and was successfully integrated into the existing infrastructure. Finally, we showed in an exemplary analysis how the data could be quickly loaded into and analyzed in KETOS, a web-based analysis platform for statistical analysis and clinical decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the GEMINI open source database can be augmented to create an NGS analysis pipeline. The pipeline generates high-quality results consistent with the already established workflows for gene variant annotation and pathological evaluation. We further demonstrate how NGS-derived genomic and other clinical data can be combined for further statistical analysis, thereby providing for data integration using standardized vocabularies and methods.

This track aimed to assess the state of the art in identifying and matching salient medical concepts to a controlled vocabulary. In this paper, we describe the task, describe the data set used, compare the participating systems, present results, identify the strengths and limitations of the current state of the art, and identify directions for future research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participating teams were provided with narrative discharge summaries in which text spans corresponding to medical concepts were identified. This paper refers to these text spans as mentions. Teams were tasked with normalizing these mentions to concepts, represented by concept unique identifiers, within the Unified Medical Language System. Submitted systems represented 4 broad categories of approaches: cascading dictionary matching, cosine distance, deep learning, and retrieve-and-rank systems. Disambiguation modules were common across all approaches. RESULTS: A total of 33 teams participated in the MCN task. The best-performing team achieved an accuracy of 0.8526. The median and mean performances among all teams were 0.7733 and 0.7426, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall performance among the top 10 teams was high. However, several mention types were challenging for all teams. These included mentions requiring disambiguation of misspelled words, acronyms, abbreviations, and mentions with more than 1 possible semantic type.

Park_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automatic Grading of Stroke Symptoms for Rapid Assessment Using Optimized Machine Learning and 4-Limb Kinematics: Clinical Validation Study,"Park, Eunjeong and Lee, Kijeong and Han, Taehwa and Nam, Hyo Suk",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. METHODS: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.",2020,10.2196/20641,22,9,e20641,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *kinematics and *machine learning and *sensors and *stroke and *telemedicine and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Algorithms and artificial intelligence and Biomechanical Phenomena/*physiology and Female and Humans and kinematics and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and Neurologic Examination/*methods and sensors and stroke and Stroke/*classification/*diagnosis and telemedicine",NA,NA,2020/09/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Eguchi_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Estimation of Vertical Ground Reaction Force Using Low-Cost Insole With Force Plate-Free Learning From Single Leg Stance and Walking,"Eguchi, Ryo and Yorozu, Ayanori and Fukumoto, Takahiko and Takahashi, Masaki",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"For the evaluation of pathological gait, a machine learning-based estimation of the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) using a low-cost insole is proposed as an alternative to costly force plates. However, learning a model for estimation still relies on the use of force plates, which is not accessible in small clinics and individuals. Therefore, this paper presents a force plate-free learning from a single leg stance (SLS) and natural walking measured only by the insoles. This method used a linear least squares regression that fits insole measurements during SLS to body weight in order to learn a model to estimate vGRF during walking. Constraints were added to the regression so that vGRF estimates during walking were of proper magnitude, and the constraint bounds were newly defined as a linear function of stance duration. Moreover, a lower bound for the estimated vGRF in mid-stance was added to the constraints to enhance estimation accuracy. The vGRF estimated by the proposed method was compared with force platforms for 4 healthy young adults and 13 elderly adults including patients with mild osteoarthritis, knee pain, and valgus hallux. Through the experiments, the proposed learning method had a normalized root mean squared error under 10% for healthy young and elderly adults with stance durations within a certain range (600-800 ms). From these results, the validity of the proposed learning method was verified for various users requiring assessment in the field of medicine and healthcare.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2937279,24,5,1276-1283,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,*Gait Analysis/instrumentation/methods and *Machine Learning and Adult and Biomechanical Phenomena/*physiology and Equipment Design and Humans and Leg/physiology and Male and Posture/physiology and Walking/*physiology and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future.

As medicine becomes increasingly precise, a patient's electronic medical record phenotype will play an important role in triggering clinical decision support systems that can deliver personalized recommendations in real time. Learning with anchors presents a method of efficiently learning statistically driven phenotypes with minimal manual intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a phenotype library that uses both structured and unstructured data from the EMR to represent patients for real-time clinical decision support. Eight of the phenotypes were evaluated using retrospective EMR data on emergency department patients using a set of prospectively gathered gold standard labels. RESULTS: We built a phenotype library with 42 publicly available phenotype definitions. Using information from triage time, the phenotype classifiers have an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of infection 0.89, cancer 0.88, immunosuppressed 0.85, septic shock 0.93, nursing home 0.87, anticoagulated 0.83, cardiac etiology 0.89, and pneumonia 0.90. Using information available at the time of disposition from the emergency department, the AUC values are infection 0.91, cancer 0.95, immunosuppressed 0.90, septic shock 0.97, nursing home 0.91, anticoagulated 0.94, cardiac etiology 0.92, and pneumonia 0.97. DISCUSSION: The resulting phenotypes are interpretable and fast to build, and perform comparably to statistically learned phenotypes developed with 5000 manually labeled patients.

Hospital adoption of electronic health records with Meaningful Use (MU) capabilities expected to improve medication safety has grown rapidly. However, evidence that MU capabilities are associated with declines in in-hospital ADEs is lacking. METHODS: Data came from the 2010-2013 Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System and the 2008-2013 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics Database. Two-level random intercept logistic regression was used to estimate the association of MU capabilities and occurrence of ADEs, adjusting for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, and year of observation. RESULTS: Rates of in-hospital ADEs declined by 19% from 2010 to 2013. Adoption of MU capabilities was associated with 11% lower odds of an ADE (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.96). Interoperability capability was associated with 19% lower odds of an ADE (95% CI, 0.67- 0.98). Adoption of MU capabilities explained 22% of the observed reduction in ADEs, or 67,000 fewer ADEs averted by MU. DISCUSSION: Concurrent with the rapid uptake of MU and interoperability, occurrence of in-hospital ADEs declined significantly from 2010 to 2013. MU capabilities and interoperability were associated with lower occurrence of ADEs, but the effects did not vary by experience with MU. About one-fifth of the decline in ADEs from 2010 to 2013 was attributable to MU capabilities. CONCLUSION: Findings support the contention that adoption of MU capabilities and interoperability spurred by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act contributed in part to the recent decline in ADEs.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw183,24,4,729-736,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Health Information Interoperability and *Meaningful Use/legislation & jurisprudence and Adult and adverse drug events and Aged and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*epidemiology and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data and Female and hospitals and Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data and Humans and interoperability and Male and Medical Informatics/legislation & jurisprudence and Medicare and Medication Errors/prevention & control/*trends and Middle Aged and patient safety and United States/epidemiology,NA,NA,2017/07/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Each subject received a Fitbit Charge 2 device to record daily activity data, and each subject completed eight Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems short form at the end of each week as a self-assessment of their health status. Two models were built to classify PRO scores using activity tracker data. The first model treated each week independently, whereas the second used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to take advantage of correlations between successive weeks. Retrospective analysis compared the classification accuracy of the two models and the importance of each feature. In the independent model, a random forest classifier achieved a mean area under curve (AUC) of 0.76 for classifying the physical function PRO. The HMM model achieved significantly better AUCs for all PROs (p < 0.05) other than Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance, with a highest mean AUC of 0.79 for the physical function-short form 10a. Our study demonstrates the ability of activity tracker data to classify health status over time. These results suggest that patient outcomes can be monitored in real time using activity trackers.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2922178,24,3,878-884,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Fitness Trackers and *Health Status and *Heart Diseases/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy and *Machine Learning and Algorithms and Cohort Studies and Humans and Monitoring, Ambulatory and Self Report/*classification and Telemedicine",NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Machine learning approaches to electronic phenotyping are limited by the paucity of labeled training datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing semi-automatically labeled training sets to create phenotype models via machine learning, using a comprehensive representation of the patient medical record. METHODS: We use a list of keywords specific to the phenotype of interest to generate noisy labeled training data. We train L1 penalized logistic regression models for a chronic and an acute disease and evaluate the performance of the models against a gold standard. RESULTS: Our models for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.86, 0.89, respectively. Local implementations of the previously validated rule-based definitions for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.84, 0.87, respectively.We have demonstrated feasibility of learning phenotype models using imperfectly labeled data for a chronic and acute phenotype. Further research in feature engineering and in specification of the keyword list can improve the performance of the models and the scalability of the approach.

Alshalan_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Detection of Hate Speech in COVID-19-Related Tweets in the Arab Region: Deep Learning and Topic Modeling Approach,"Alshalan, Raghad and Al-Khalifa, Hend and Alsaeed, Duaa and Al-Baity, Heyam and Alshalan, Shahad",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The massive scale of social media platforms requires an automatic solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.",2020,10.2196/22609,22,12,e22609,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*CNN and *convolutional neural network and *coronavirus and *COVID-19 and *deep learning and *Hate and *hate speech and *NMF and *non-negative matrix factorization and *pandemic and *public health and *social media and *social network analysis and *Twitter and CNN and convolutional neural network and coronavirus and COVID-19 and COVID-19/*epidemiology and deep learning and Deep Learning/*standards and hate speech and Humans and NMF and non-negative matrix factorization and pandemic and Pandemics and public health and Research Design and SARS-CoV-2/*pathogenicity and Saudi Arabia and social media and Social Media/*standards and social network analysis and Speech/*physiology and Twitter,NA,NA,2020/12/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Information extraction and coding is a manual, labor-intensive process. In this study, we investigated deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN), for extracting ICD-O-3 topographic codes from a corpus of breast and lung cancer pathology reports. We performed two experiments, using a CNN and a more conventional term frequency vector approach, to assess the effects of class prevalence and inter-class transfer learning. The experiments were based on a set of 942 pathology reports with human expert annotations as the gold standard. CNN performance was compared against a more conventional term frequency vector space approach. We observed that the deep learning models consistently outperformed the conventional approaches in the class prevalence experiment, resulting in micro- and macro-F score increases of up to 0.132 and 0.226, respectively, when class labels were well populated. Specifically, the best performing CNN achieved a micro-F score of 0.722 over 12 ICD-O-3 topography codes. Transfer learning provided a consistent but modest performance boost for the deep learning methods but trends were contingent on the CNN method and cancer site.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified and investigated several CDSS malfunctions at Brigham and Women's Hospital and present them as a case series. We also conducted a preliminary survey of Chief Medical Information Officers to assess the frequency of such malfunctions. RESULTS: We identified four CDSS malfunctions at Brigham and Women's Hospital: (1) an alert for monitoring thyroid function in patients receiving amiodarone stopped working when an internal identifier for amiodarone was changed in another system; (2) an alert for lead screening for children stopped working when the rule was inadvertently edited; (3) a software upgrade of the electronic health record software caused numerous spurious alerts to fire; and (4) a malfunction in an external drug classification system caused an alert to inappropriately suggest antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, for patients already taking one. We found that 93% of the Chief Medical Information Officers who responded to our survey had experienced at least one CDSS malfunction, and two-thirds experienced malfunctions at least annually. DISCUSSION: CDSS malfunctions are widespread and often persist for long periods. The failure of alerts to fire is particularly difficult to detect. A range of causes, including changes in codes and fields, software upgrades, inadvertent disabling or editing of rules, and malfunctions of external systems commonly contribute to CDSS malfunctions, and current approaches for preventing and detecting such malfunctions are inadequate.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning-based screening tool using patient-generated health data (PGHD) obtained from a mobile health (mHealth) app. METHODS: We trained a deep learning model based on a gated recurrent unit to screen influenza using PGHD, including each patient's fever pattern and drug administration records. We used meteorological data and app-based surveillance of the weekly number of patients with influenza. We defined a single episode as the set of consecutive days, including the day the user was diagnosed with influenza or another disease. Any record a user entered 24 hours after his or her last record was considered to be the start of a new episode. Each episode contained data on the user's age, gender, weight, and at least one body temperature record. The total number of episodes was 6657. Of these, there were 3326 episodes within which influenza was diagnosed. We divided these episodes into 80% training sets (2664/3330) and 20% test sets (666/3330). A 5-fold cross-validation was used on the training set. RESULTS: We achieved reliable performance with an accuracy of 82%, a sensitivity of 84%, and a specificity of 80% in the test set. After the effect of each input variable was evaluated, app-based surveillance was observed to be the most influential variable. The correlation between the duration of input data and performance was not statistically significant (P=.09). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PGHD from an mHealth app could be a complementary tool for influenza screening. In addition, PGHD, along with traditional clinical data, could be used to improve health conditions.",2020,10.2196/21369,22,10,e21369,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*deep learning and *influenza and *mHealth and *mobile health and *patient-generated health data and *screening tool and deep learning and Deep Learning/*standards and Female and Humans and influenza and Influenza, Human/*diagnosis and Male and mHealth and Mobile Applications/*standards and mobile health and patient-generated health data and Retrospective Studies and screening tool and Telemedicine/*methods",NA,NA,2020/10/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Baki and Ijaz, Kiran and Laranjo, Liliana and Quiroz, Juan C. and Rezazadegan, Dana and Tong, Huong Ly and Willcock, Simon and Berkovsky, Shlomo and Coiera, Enrico",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: The study sought to understand the potential roles of a future artificial intelligence (AI) documentation assistant in primary care consultations and to identify implications for doctors, patients, healthcare system, and technology design from the perspective of general practitioners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. RESULTS: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. CONCLUSIONS: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations.

Jeong_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,De-Identification of Facial Features in Magnetic Resonance Images: Software Development Using Deep Learning Technology,"Jeong, Yeon Uk and Yoo, Soyoung and Kim, Young-Hak and Shim, Woo Hyun",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: High-resolution medical images that include facial regions can be used to recognize the subject's face when reconstructing 3-dimensional (3D)-rendered images from 2-dimensional (2D) sequential images, which might constitute a risk of infringement of personal information when sharing data. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, full-face photographic images and any comparable image are direct identifiers and considered as protected health information. Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) categorizes facial images as biometric data and stipulates that special restrictions should be placed on the processing of biometric data. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop software that can remove the header information from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format files and facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) at the 2D sliced-image level to anonymize personal information in medical images. METHODS: A total of 240 cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to train the deep learning model (144, 48, and 48 for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] database). To overcome the small sample size problem, we used a data augmentation technique to create 576 images per epoch. We used attention-gated U-net for the basic structure of our deep learning model. To validate the performance of the software, we adapted an external test set comprising 100 cranial MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. RESULTS: The facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) were successfully detected and anonymized in both test sets (48 from ADNI and 100 from OASIS). Each result was manually validated in both the 2D image plane and the 3D-rendered images. Furthermore, the ADNI test set was verified using Microsoft Azure's face recognition artificial intelligence service. By adding a user interface, we developed and distributed (via GitHub) software named ""Deface program"" for medical images as an open-source project. CONCLUSIONS: We developed deep learning-based software for the anonymization of MR images that distorts the eyes, nose, and ears to prevent facial identification of the subject in reconstructed 3D images.

Zheng_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Accelerating Health Data Sharing: A Solution Based on the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledger Technologies,"Zheng, Xiaochen and Sun, Shengjing and Mukkamala, Raghava Rao and Vatrapu, Ravi and Ordieres-Mere, Joaquin",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Huge amounts of health-related data are generated every moment with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technologies. These big health data contain great value and can bring benefit to all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Currently, most of these data are siloed and fragmented in different health care systems or public and private databases. It prevents the fulfillment of intelligent health care inspired by these big data. Security and privacy concerns and the lack of ensured authenticity trails of data bring even more obstacles to health data sharing. With a decentralized and consensus-driven nature, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) provide reliable solutions such as blockchain, Ethereum, and IOTA Tangle to facilitate the health care data sharing. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a health-related data sharing system by integrating IoT and DLT to enable secure, fee-less, tamper-resistant, highly-scalable, and granularly-controllable health data exchange, as well as build a prototype and conduct experiments to verify the feasibility of the proposed solution. METHODS: The health-related data are generated by 2 types of IoT devices: wearable devices and stationary air quality sensors. The data sharing mechanism is enabled by IOTA's distributed ledger, the Tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph. Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is adopted to facilitate data communications among different parties. Merkle Hash Tree is used for data encryption and verification. RESULTS: A prototype system was built according to the proposed solution. It uses a smartwatch and multiple air sensors as the sensing layer; a smartphone and a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) as the gateway; and a local server for data publishing. The prototype was applied to the remote diagnosis of tremor disease. The results proved that the solution could enable costless data integrity and flexible access management during data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: DLT integrated with IoT technologies could greatly improve the health-related data sharing. The proposed solution based on IOTA Tangle and MAM could overcome many challenges faced by other traditional blockchain-based solutions in terms of cost, efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in data access management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Obtaining large datasets to take advantage of highly expressive deep learning methods is difficult in clinical natural language processing (NLP). We address this difficulty by pretraining a clinical text encoder on billing code data, which is typically available in abundance. We explore several neural encoder architectures and deploy the text representations obtained from these encoders in the context of clinical text classification tasks. While our ultimate goal is learning a universal clinical text encoder, we also experiment with training a phenotype-specific encoder. A universal encoder would be more practical, but a phenotype-specific encoder could perform better for a specific task. RESULTS: We successfully train several clinical text encoders, establish a new state-of-the-art on comorbidity data, and observe good performance gains on substance misuse data. DISCUSSION: We find that pretraining using billing codes is a promising research direction. The representations generated by this type of pretraining have universal properties, as they are highly beneficial for many phenotyping tasks. Phenotype-specific pretraining is a viable route for trading the generality of the pretrained encoder for better performance on a specific phenotyping task.

Lu_2019_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Deep Learning for Fall Detection: Three-Dimensional CNN Combined With LSTM on Video Kinematic Data,"Lu, Na and Wu, Yidan and Feng, Li and Song, Jinbo",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Fall detection is an important public healthcare problem. Timely detection could enable instant delivery of medical service to the injured. A popular nonintrusive solution for fall detection is based on videos obtained through ambient camera, and the corresponding methods usually require a large dataset to train a classifier and are inclined to be influenced by the image quality. However, it is hard to collect fall data and instead simulated falls are recorded to construct the training dataset, which is restricted to limited quantity. To address these problems, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) based method for fall detection is developed, which only uses video kinematic data to train an automatic feature extractor and could circumvent the requirement for large fall dataset of deep learning solution. 2-D CNN could only encode spatial information, and the employed 3-D convolution could extract motion feature from temporal sequence, which is important for fall detection. To further locate the region of interest in each frame, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based spatial visual attention scheme is incorporated. Sports dataset Sports-1 M with no fall examples is employed to train the 3-D CNN, which is then combined with LSTM to train a classifier with fall dataset.

The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control has maintained real-time national influenza surveillance systems since 2004. Except for timely monitoring, epidemic forecasting using the national influenza surveillance data can provide pivotal information for public health response. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop predictive models using machine learning to provide real-time influenza-like illness forecasts. METHODS: Using surveillance data of influenza-like illness visits from emergency departments (from the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System), outpatient departments (from the National Health Insurance database), and the records of patients with severe influenza with complications (from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System), we developed 4 machine learning models (autoregressive integrated moving average, random forest, support vector regression, and extreme gradient boosting) to produce weekly influenza-like illness predictions for a given week and 3 subsequent weeks. We established a framework of the machine learning models and used an ensemble approach called stacking to integrate these predictions. We trained the models using historical data from 2008-2014. We evaluated their predictive ability during 2015-2017 for each of the 4-week time periods using Pearson correlation, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and hit rate of trend prediction. A dashboard website was built to visualize the forecasts, and the results of real-world implementation of this forecasting framework in 2018 were evaluated using the same metrics. RESULTS: All models could accurately predict the timing and magnitudes of the seasonal peaks in the then-current week (nowcast) (Ï=0.802-0.965; MAPE: 5.2%-9.2%; hit rate: 0.577-0.756), 1-week (Ï=0.803-0.918; MAPE: 8.3%-11.8%; hit rate: 0.643-0.747), 2-week (Ï=0.783-0.867; MAPE: 10.1%-15.3%; hit rate: 0.669-0.734), and 3-week forecasts (Ï=0.676-0.801; MAPE: 12.0%-18.9%; hit rate: 0.643-0.786), especially the ensemble model. In real-world implementation in 2018, the forecasting performance was still accurate in nowcasts (Ï=0.875-0.969; MAPE: 5.3%-8.0%; hit rate: 0.582-0.782) and remained satisfactory in 3-week forecasts (Ï=0.721-0.908; MAPE: 7.6%-13.5%; hit rate: 0.596-0.904).

Goodwin_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,A customizable deep learning model for nosocomial risk prediction from critical care notes with indirect supervision,"Goodwin, Travis R. and Demner-Fushman, Dina",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Reliable longitudinal risk prediction for hospitalized patients is needed to provide quality care. Our goal is to develop a generalizable model capable of leveraging clinical notes to predict healthcare-associated diseases 24-96 hours in advance. METHODS: We developed a reCurrent Additive Network for Temporal RIsk Prediction (CANTRIP) to predict the risk of hospital acquired (occurring <e2><89><a5> 48 hours after admission) acute kidney injury, pressure injury, or anemia <e2><89><a5> 24 hours before it is implicated by the patient's chart, labs, or notes. We rely on the MIMIC III critical care database and extract distinct positive and negative cohorts for each disease. We retrospectively determine the date-of-event using structured and unstructured criteria and use it as a form of indirect supervision to train and evaluate CANTRIP to predict disease risk using clinical notes. RESULTS: Our experiments indicate that CANTRIP, operating on text alone, obtains 74%-87% area under the curve and 77%-85% Specificity. Baseline shallow models showed lower performance on all metrics, while bidirectional long short-term memory obtained the highest Sensitivity at the cost of significantly lower Specificity and Precision. DISCUSSION: Proper model architecture allows clinical text to be successfully harnessed to predict nosocomial disease, outperforming shallow models and obtaining similar performance to disease-specific models reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: Clinical text on its own can provide a competitive alternative to traditional structured features (eg, lab values, vital signs).

We sought to determine whether a machine learning analyses of satellite imagery can be used to map remote communities to facilitate service delivery and planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a method for mapping communities using a deep learning approach that excels at detecting objects within images. We trained an algorithm to detect individual buildings, then examined building clusters to identify groupings suggestive of communities. The approach was validated in southeastern Liberia, by comparing algorithmically generated results with community location data collected manually by enumerators and community health workers. RESULTS: The deep learning approach achieved 86.47% positive predictive value and 79.49% sensitivity with respect to individual building detection. The approach identified 75.67% (n = 451) of communities registered through the community enumeration process, and identified an additional 167 potential communities not previously registered. Several instances of false positives and false negatives were identified. DISCUSSION: Analysis of satellite images is a promising solution for mapping remote communities rapidly, and with relatively low costs. Further research is needed to determine whether the communities identified algorithmically, but not registered in the manual enumeration process, are currently inhabited.

METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched through January 30, 2019, for studies describing CRO-based CDSSs. Articles that explored the development or application of CROs or terminology were selected. Eligible articles were assessed for quality features of both CDSSs and CROs to determine the current practices. We then compiled concepts and properties used within the articles. RESULTS: We included 38 CRO-based CDSSs for the analysis. Diversity of the purpose and scope of their ontologies was seen, with a variety of knowledge sources were used for ontology development. We found 126 unique medical knowledge concepts, 38 unique reasoning concepts, and 240 unique properties (137 relationships and 103 attributes). Although there is a great diversity among the terms used across CROs, there is a significant overlap based on their descriptions. Only 5 studies described high quality assessment. CONCLUSION: We identified current practices used in CRO development and provided lists of medical knowledge concepts, reasoning concepts, and properties (relationships and attributes) used by CRO-based CDSSs. CRO developers reason that the inclusion of concepts used by clinicians' during medical decision making has the potential to improve CDSS performance.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. METHODS: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians.

METHODS: A novel multimodal fusion architecture is proposed to calculate the respiratory and exercise parameters and simultaneously identify human actions. A hybrid hierarchical classification (HHC) algorithm combining deep learning and threshold-based methods is presented to distinguish 15 complex activities for accuracy enhancement and fast computation. A series of signal processing algorithms are utilized and integrated to calculate breathing and motion indices. The designed wireless communication structure achieves the interactions among chest bands, mobile devices, and the data processing center. RESULTS: The advantage of the proposed HHC method is evaluated by comparing the average accuracy (97.22%) and predictive time (0.0094 s) with machine learning and deep learning approaches. The nine breathing patterns during 15 activities were analyzed by investigating the data from 12 subjects. With 12 hours of naturalistic data collected from one participant, the WRAM system reports the breathing and exercise performance within the identified motions. The demonstration shows the ability of the WRAM system to monitor multiple users breathing and exercise status in real-time.

Roehrs_2019_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,"Roehrs, Alex and da Costa, Cristiano Andre and Righi, Rodrigo da Rosa and Rigo, Sandro Jose and Wichman, Matheus Henrique",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

Existing approaches for activity recognition in smart homes have achieved promising results. Most of these approaches evaluate real-time recognition of activities using only sensor activations that precede the evaluation time (where the decision is made). However, in several critical situations, such as diagnosing people with dementia, ""preceding sensor activations"" are not always sufficient to accurately recognize the inhabitant's daily activities in each evaluated time. To improve performance, we propose a method that delays the recognition process in order to include some sensor activations that occur after the point in time where the decision needs to be made. For this, the proposed method uses multiple incremental fuzzy temporal windows to extract features from both preceding and some oncoming sensor activations. The proposed method is evaluated with two temporal deep learning models (convolutional neural network and long short-term memory), on a binary sensor dataset of real daily living activities. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than the real-time approach, and that the representation with fuzzy temporal windows enhances performance within deep learning models.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2918412,24,2,387-395,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Fuzzy Logic and *Human Activities and Humans and Neural Networks, Computer",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two investigators independently extracted data about study design and quality, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. RESULTS: Seven studies (4 CRTs, 3 RCTs) met our inclusion criteria. All studies were performed in the USA. Proportions of eligible patient visits that triggered CDSS use varied substantially between intervention arms of studies (range 2.8-62.8%). Five out of seven trials showed marginal to moderate statistically significant effects of CDSS in improving antibiotic prescribing behavior. CDSS that automatically provided decision support were more likely to improve prescribing practice in contrast to systems that had to be actively initiated by healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: CDSS show promising effectiveness in improving antibiotic prescribing behavior in primary care.

METHODS: We conducted a postdeployment evaluation of a new virtual health care service, Virtual Urgent Clinic, which uses mHealth and telemedicine modalities to provide patient care. We used a multinomial logistic model to test the significance and predictive power of a set of features in determining patients' preferred method of telecare encounters-a nominal outcome variable of two levels (mHealth and telemedicine). RESULTS: Postdeployment, 1403 encounters were recorded, of which 1228 (87.53%) were completed with mHealth and 175 (12.47%) were telemedicine encounters. Patients' sex (P=.004) and setting (P<.001) were the most predictive determinants of their preferred method of telecare delivery, with significantly small P values of less than .01. Pearson chi-square test returned a strong indication of dependency between chief concern and encounter mediums, with an extremely small P<.001. Of the 169 mHealth patients who responded to the survey, 154 (91.1%) were satisfied by their encounter, compared with 31 of 35 (89%) telemedicine patients. CONCLUSIONS: We studied factors influencing patients' choice of communication medium, either mHealth or telemedicine, for a virtual care clinic. Sex and geographic location, as well as their chief concern, were strong predictors of patients' choice of communication medium for their urgent care needs. This study suggests providing the option of mHealth or telemedicine to patients, and suggesting which medium would be a better fit for the patient based on their characteristics.",2019,10.2196/13772,7,6,e13772,eng,2291-5222,"*Choice Behavior and *mHealth and *predictive analytics and *telemedicine and *urgent care and Adolescent and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Female and Health Services Accessibility/standards/statistics & numerical data and Humans and Logistic Models and Male and mHealth and Middle Aged and North Carolina and Patients/*psychology and predictive analytics and Rural Population/statistics & numerical data and Surveys and Questionnaires and telemedicine and Telemedicine/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data and urgent care",NA,NA,2019/06/08/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Without prioritization, physicians must mentally identify and collate relevant data, an activity that can lead to cognitive overload. To mitigate cognitive overload, a Learning EMR (LEMR) system prioritizes the display of relevant medical record data. Relevant data are those that are pertinent to a context-defined as the combination of the user, clinical task, and patient case. To determine which data are relevant in a specific context, a LEMR system uses supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. Since obtaining information-seeking behavior data via manual annotation is slow and expensive, automatic methods for capturing such data are needed. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to propose and evaluate eye tracking as a high-throughput method to automatically acquire physician information-seeking behavior useful for training models for a LEMR system. METHODS: Critical care medicine physicians reviewed intensive care unit patient cases in an EMR interface developed for the study. Participants manually identified patient data that were relevant in the context of a clinical task: preparing a patient summary to present at morning rounds. We used eye tracking to capture each physician's gaze dwell time on each data item (eg, blood glucose measurements). Manual annotations and gaze dwell times were used to define target variables for developing supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. We compared the performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on an independent set of patient cases. RESULTS: A total of 68 pairs of manual selection and gaze-derived machine learning models were developed from training data and evaluated on an independent evaluation data set. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed similar performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P=.40). CONCLUSIONS: We used eye tracking to automatically capture physician information-seeking behavior and used it to train models for a LEMR system. The models that were trained using eye tracking performed like models that were trained using manual annotations. These results support further development of eye tracking as a high-throughput method for training clinical decision support systems that prioritize the display of relevant medical record data.",2020,10.2196/15876,22,4,e15876,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*electronic medical record system and *eye tracking and *information-seeking behavior and *intensive care unit and *machine learning and Electronic Health Records/*standards and electronic medical record system and Eye Movements and eye tracking and Humans and Information Seeking Behavior and information-seeking behavior and intensive care unit and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards,NA,NA,2020/04/02/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, a significant number of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their condition due to the limited access to mental health care facilities; the reduced availability of clinicians; the lack of awareness; and stigma, neglect, and discrimination surrounding mental disorders. In contrast, internet access and social media usage have increased significantly, providing experts and patients with a means of communication that may contribute to the development of methods to detect mental health issues among social media users. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to describe an approach for the suicide risk assessment of Spanish-speaking users on social media. We aimed to explore behavioral, relational, and multimodal data extracted from multiple social platforms and develop machine learning models to detect users at risk. METHODS: We characterized users based on their writings, posting patterns, relations with other users, and images posted. We also evaluated statistical and deep learning approaches to handle multimodal data for the detection of users with signs of suicidal ideation (suicidal ideation risk group). Our methods were evaluated over a dataset of 252 users annotated by clinicians. To evaluate the performance of our models, we distinguished 2 control groups: users who make use of suicide-related vocabulary (focused control group) and generic random users (generic control group). RESULTS: We identified significant statistical differences between the textual and behavioral attributes of each of the control groups compared with the suicidal ideation risk group. At a 95% CI, when comparing the suicidal ideation risk group and the focused control group, the number of friends (P=.04) and median tweet length (P=.04) were significantly different. The median number of friends for a focused control user (median 578.5) was higher than that for a user at risk (median 372.0). Similarly, the median tweet length was higher for focused control users, with 16 words against 13 words of suicidal ideation risk users. Our findings also show that the combination of textual, visual, relational, and behavioral data outperforms the accuracy of using each modality separately. We defined text-based baseline models based on bag of words and word embeddings, which were outperformed by our models, obtaining an increase in accuracy of up to 8% when distinguishing users at risk from both types of control users. CONCLUSIONS: The types of attributes analyzed are significant for detecting users at risk, and their combination outperforms the results provided by generic, exclusively text-based baseline models. After evaluating the contribution of image-based predictive models, we believe that our results can be improved by enhancing the models based on textual and relational features.

Records of naloxone administration found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However, as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause, attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. METHODS: First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April 2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM. Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4 machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen September 2018 data. RESULTS: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM. Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for 2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on 5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68). The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases; PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99).

Most pain assessments occur in clinical settings away from patients' natural environments. Advances in smart home technology may allow observation of pain in the home setting. Smart homes recognizing human behaviors may be useful for quantifying functional pain interference, thereby creating new ways of assessing pain and supporting people living with pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a smart home can detect pain-related behaviors to perform automated assessment and support intervention for persons with chronic pain. METHODS: A multiple methods, secondary data analysis was conducted using historic ambient sensor data and weekly nursing assessment data from 11 independent older adults reporting pain across 1-2 years of smart home monitoring. A qualitative approach was used to interpret sensor-based data of 27 unique pain events to support clinician-guided training of a machine learning model. A periodogram was used to calculate circadian rhythm strength, and a random forest containing 100 trees was employed to train a machine learning model to recognize pain-related behaviors. The model extracted 550 behavioral markers for each sensor-based data segment. These were treated as both a binary classification problem (event, control) and a regression problem. RESULTS: We found 13 clinically relevant behaviors, revealing 6 pain-related behavioral qualitative themes. Quantitative results were classified using a clinician-guided random forest technique that yielded a classification accuracy of 0.70, sensitivity of 0.72, specificity of 0.69, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.777 in comparison to using standard anomaly detection techniques without clinician guidance (0.16 accuracy achieved; P<.001). The regression formulation achieved moderate correlation, with r=0.42. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this secondary data analysis reveal that a pain-assessing smart home may recognize pain-related behaviors.

Blockchain architecture can provide efficient data retrieval and security requirements. Exchangeable PHRs and the self-management of patient health can offer many benefits to traditional medical services by allowing people to manage their own health records for disease prevention, prediction, and control while reducing resource burdens on the health care infrastructure and improving population health and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a blockchain-based architecture for an international health record exchange platform to ensure health record confidentiality, integrity, and availability for health management and used Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource international standards as the data format that could allow international, cross-institutional, and patient/doctor exchanges of PHRs. METHODS: The PHR architecture in this study comprised 2 main components. The first component was the PHR management platform, on which users could upload PHRs, view their record content, authorize PHR exchanges with doctors or other medical health care providers, and check their block information. When a PHR was uploaded, the hash value of the PHR would be calculated by the SHA-256 algorithm and the PHR would be encrypted by the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption mechanism before being transferred to a secure database. The second component was the blockchain exchange architecture, which was based on Ethereum to create a private chain. Proof of authority, which delivers transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity, was used for consensus. The hash value was calculated based on the previous hash value, block content, and timestamp by a hash function. RESULTS: The PHR blockchain architecture constructed in this study is an effective method for the management and utilization of PHRs. The platform has been deployed in Southeast Asian countries via the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN) and has become the first PHR management platform for cross-region medical data exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Some systems have shown that blockchain technology has great potential for electronic health record applications. This study combined different types of data storage modes to effectively solve the problems of PHR data security, storage, and transmission and proposed a hybrid blockchain and data security approach to enable effective international PHR exchange. By partnering with the AeHIN and making use of the network's regional reach and expert pool, the platform could be deployed and promoted successfully. In the future, the PHR platform could be utilized for the purpose of precision and individual medicine in a cross-country manner because of the platform's provision of a secure and efficient PHR sharing and management architecture, making it a reasonable base for future data collection sources and the data analytics needed for precision medicine.",2020,10.2196/16748,22,6,e16748,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*blockchain and *health information interoperability and *health information management and *personal health records and *precision health care and blockchain and Blockchain/*standards and health information interoperability and health information management and Health Records, Personal/*ethics and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and personal health records and precision health care and Telemedicine/*methods",NA,NA,2020/06/09/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for ""what-if"" models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that ""affect"" the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive).

Despite this, it has not yet been possible to successfully use this data to systematically build clinical decision support systems that can produce personalized clinical recommendations to assist clinicians in providing individualized healthcare. In this paper, we present a novel approach, discovery engine (DE), that discovers which patient characteristics are most relevant for predicting the correct diagnosis and/or recommending the best treatment regimen for each patient. We demonstrate the performance of DE in two clinical settings: diagnosis of breast cancer as well as a personalized recommendation for a specific chemotherapy regimen for breast cancer patients. For each distinct clinical recommendation, different patient features are relevant; DE can discover these different relevant features and use them to recommend personalized clinical decisions. The DE approach achieves a 16.6% improvement over existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms regarding kappa coefficients for recommending the personalized chemotherapy regimens. For diagnostic predictions, the DE approach achieves a 2.18% and 4.20% improvement over existing state-of-the-art prediction algorithms regarding prediction error rate and false positive rate, respectively.

Mohammadi_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Neural Network-Based Algorithm for Adjusting Activity Targets to Sustain Exercise Engagement Among People Using Activity Trackers: Retrospective Observation and Algorithm Development Study,"Mohammadi, Ramin and Atif, Mursal and Centi, Amanda Jayne and Agboola, Stephen and Jethwani, Kamal and Kvedar, Joseph and Kamarthi, Sagar",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: It is well established that lack of physical activity is detrimental to the overall health of an individual. Modern-day activity trackers enable individuals to monitor their daily activities to meet and maintain targets. This is expected to promote activity encouraging behavior, but the benefits of activity trackers attenuate over time due to waning adherence. One of the key approaches to improving adherence to goals is to motivate individuals to improve on their historic performance metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to build a machine learning model to predict an achievable weekly activity target by considering (1) patterns in the user's activity tracker data in the previous week and (2) behavior and environment characteristics. By setting realistic goals, ones that are neither too easy nor too difficult to achieve, activity tracker users can be encouraged to continue to meet these goals, and at the same time, to find utility in their activity tracker. METHODS: We built a neural network model that prescribes a weekly activity target for an individual that can be realistically achieved. The inputs to the model were user-specific personal, social, and environmental factors, daily step count from the previous 7 days, and an entropy measure that characterized the pattern of daily step count. Data for training and evaluating the machine learning model were collected over a duration of 9 weeks. RESULTS: Of 30 individuals who were enrolled, data from 20 participants were used. The model predicted target daily count with a mean absolute error of 1545 (95% CI 1383-1706) steps for an 8-week period. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence applied to physical activity data combined with behavioral data can be used to set personalized goals in accordance with the individual's level of activity and thereby improve adherence to a fitness tracker; this could be used to increase engagement with activity trackers.

Traditional research methods are poorly suited to operationalize the agile, iterative trials required to evidence and optimize these digitally mediated interventions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to contribute a resource to support the quantification, analysis, and visualization of analytic indicators of effective engagement with mHealth apps for chronic conditions. METHODS: We applied user-centered design methods to design and develop an Analytics Platform to Evaluate Effective Engagement (APEEE) with consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions and implemented the platform to analyze both retrospective and prospective data generated from a smartphone-based pain self-management app called iCanCope for young people with chronic pain. RESULTS: Through APEEE, we were able to automate the process of defining, operationalizing, and evaluating effective engagement with iCanCope. Configuring the platform to integrate with the app was feasible and provided investigators with a resource to consolidate, analyze, and visualize engagement data generated by participants in real time. Preliminary efforts to evaluate APEEE showed that investigators perceived the platform to be an acceptable evaluative resource and were satisfied with its design, functionality, and performance. Investigators saw potential in APEEE to accelerate and augment evidence generation and expressed enthusiasm for adopting the platform to support their evaluative practice once fully implemented.

Yeung_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Social Media as a Catalyst for Policy Action and Social Change for Health and Well-Being: Viewpoint,"Yeung, Douglas",Journal of medical Internet research,"This viewpoint paper argues that policy interventions can benefit from the continued use of social media analytics, which can serve as an important complement to traditional social science data collection and analysis. Efforts to improve well-being should provide an opportunity to explore these areas more deeply, and encourage the efforts of those conducting national and local data collection on health to incorporate more of these emerging data sources. Social media remains a relatively untapped source of information to catalyze policy action and social change. However, the diversity of social media platforms and available analysis techniques provides multiple ways to offer insight for policy making and decision making. For instance, social media content can provide timely information about the impact of policy interventions. Social media location information can inform where to deploy resources or disseminate public messaging. Network analysis of social media connections can reveal underserved populations who may be disconnected from public services. Machine learning can help recognize important patterns for disease surveillance or to model population sentiment. To fully realize these potential policy uses, limitations to social media data will need to be overcome, including data reliability and validity, and potential privacy risks. Traditional data collection may not fully capture the upstream factors and systemic relationships that influence health and well-being. Policy actions and social change efforts, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's effort to advance a culture of health, which are intended to drive change in a network of upstream health drivers, will need to incorporate a broad range of behavioral information, such as health attitudes or physical activity levels. Applying innovative techniques to emerging data has the potential to extract insight from unstructured data or fuse disparate sources of data, such as linking health attitudes that are expressed to health behaviors or broader health and well-being outcomes.",2018,10.2196/jmir.8508,20,3,e94,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*health knowledge, attitudes, practice and *health policy and *health promotion and *Policy Making and *social change and *Social Change and *social media and Health Behavior/*ethics and health knowledge, attitudes, practice and health policy and Health Policy/*trends and health promotion and Health Promotion/*methods and Humans and social change and social media and Social Media/*standards",NA,NA,2018/03/19/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we evaluate this technique for measuring HR in a controlled situation, in a naturalistic computer interaction session, and in an exercise situation. For comparison, HR was measured simultaneously using an electrocardiography device during all sessions. The results replicated the published results in controlled situations, but show that they cannot yet be considered as a valid measure of HR in naturalistic human-computer interaction.

We use a bag-of-words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur.

METHODS: Based on existing best practices we propose a 5 step standardized framework for: (1) transparently defining the problem; (2) selecting suitable datasets; (3) constructing variables from the observational data; (4) learning the predictive model; and (5) validating the model performance. We implemented this framework as open-source software utilizing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enable convenient sharing of models and reproduction of model evaluation across multiple observational datasets. The software implementation contains default covariates and classifiers but the framework enables customization and extension. RESULTS: As a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the transparency and ease of model dissemination using the software, we developed prediction models for 21 different outcomes within a target population of people suffering from depression across 4 observational databases.

Recent federal initiatives promote the use of RWD to make clinical assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical assertions, also known as ""regulatory-grade"" RWE. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 2010-2016. METHODS: A predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured (EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy were compared using Chi-square test. RESULTS: The dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%, respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded criteria, with the exception of medications. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based studes intended for regulatory use.

Nguyen_2014_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Learning classification models with soft-label information,"Nguyen, Quang and Valizadegan, Hamed and Hauskrecht, Milos",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Learning of classification models in medicine often relies on data labeled by a human expert. Since labeling of clinical data may be time-consuming, finding ways of alleviating the labeling costs is critical for our ability to automatically learn such models. In this paper we propose a new machine learning approach that is able to learn improved binary classification models more efficiently by refining the binary class information in the training phase with soft labels that reflect how strongly the human expert feels about the original class labels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of methods that can learn improved binary classification models from soft labels are proposed. The first relies on probabilistic/numeric labels, the other on ordinal categorical labels. We study and demonstrate the benefits of these methods for learning an alerting model for heparin induced thrombocytopenia. The experiments are conducted on the data of 377 patient instances labeled by three different human experts. The methods are compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score. RESULTS: Our AUC results show that the new approach is capable of learning classification models more efficiently compared to traditional learning methods. The improvement in AUC is most remarkable when the number of examples we learn from is small.

We demonstrate the use of distributional analytics for comparing electronic health record (EHR) laboratory test orders across time to diagnose and quantify overutilization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We looked at hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing across 119,000 patients and 15 years of hospital records. We examined the patterns of HbA1c ordering before and after the publication of the 2002 American Diabetes Association guidelines for HbA1c testing. We conducted analyses to answer three questions. What are the patterns of HbA1c ordering? Do HbA1c orders follow the guidelines with respect to frequency of measurement? If not, how and why do they depart from the guidelines? RESULTS: The raw number of HbA1c orderings has steadily increased over time, with a specific increase in low-measurement orderings (<6.5%). There is a change in ordering pattern following the 2002 guideline (p<0.001). However, by comparing ordering distributions, we found that the changes do not reflect the guidelines and rather exhibit a new practice of rapid-repeat testing. The rapid-retesting phenomenon does not follow the 2009 guidelines for diabetes diagnosis either, illustrated by a stratified HbA1c value analysis. DISCUSSION: Results suggest HbA1c test overutilization, and contributing factors include lack of care coordination, unexpected values prompting retesting, and point-of-care tests followed by confirmatory laboratory tests.

We focus on automated ICD9 code assignment from discharge summary content and methods for evaluating such assignments. METHODS: We study ICD9 diagnosis codes and discharge summaries from the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) repository. We experiment with two coding approaches: one that treats each ICD9 code independently of each other (flat classifier), and one that leverages the hierarchical nature of ICD9 codes into its modeling (hierarchy-based classifier). We propose novel evaluation metrics, which reflect the distances among gold-standard and predicted codes and their locations in the ICD9 tree. Experimental setup, code for modeling, and evaluation scripts are made available to the research community. RESULTS: The hierarchy-based classifier outperforms the flat classifier with F-measures of 39.5% and 27.6%, respectively, when trained on 20,533 documents and tested on 2282 documents. While recall is improved at the expense of precision, our novel evaluation metrics show a more refined assessment: for instance, the hierarchy-based classifier identifies the correct sub-tree of gold-standard codes more often than the flat classifier. Error analysis reveals that gold-standard codes are not perfect, and as such the recall and precision are likely underestimated.

However, questions remain about how differences in patient characteristics and demographics might influence the likelihood of refill using this channel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SMS-based refill reminder solution using conversational artificial intelligence (AI; an automated system that mimics human conversations) with a large Medicare patient population and to explore the association and impact of patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, language) and social determinants of health on successful engagement with the solution to improve refill adherence. METHODS: The study targeted 99,217 patients with chronic disease, median age of 71 years, for medication refill using the mPulse Mobile interactive SMS text messaging solution from December 2016 to February 2019. All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X(2)(1) [n=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001). There were also significantly different rates of refill requests by age band (X(2)(6) [n=268,793]=1460.3; P<.001), with younger patients requesting refills at a higher rate. Finally, the vast majority (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) of patient responses were handled using conversational AI. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS.

Inkster_2018_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,"An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being: Real-World Data Evaluation Mixed-Methods Study","Inkster, Becky and Sarda, Shubhankar and Subramanian, Vinod",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. METHODS: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. RESULTS: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise.

The existing work is restrictive to either a limited number or specific outcome types. We propose a framework for mixed-type multioutcome prediction. Our proposed framework proposes a cumulative loss function composed of a specific loss function for each outcome type-as an example, least square (continuous outcome), hinge (binary outcome), Poisson (count outcome), and exponential (nonnegative outcome). To model these outcomes jointly, we impose a commonality across the prediction parameters through a common matrix normal prior. The framework is formulated as iterative optimization problems and solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent method. We empirically demonstrate both scalability and convergence. We apply the proposed model to a synthetic dataset and then on two real-world cohorts: a cancer cohort and an acute myocardial infarction cohort collected over a two-year period. We predict multiple emergency-related outcomes-as example, future emergency presentations (binary), emergency admissions (count), emergency length of stay days (nonnegative), and emergency time to next admission day (nonnegative). We show that the predictive performance of the proposed model is better than several state-of-the-art baselines.",2017,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2681799,21,4,1182-1191,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Machine Learning and *Medical Informatics Applications and Computational Biology and Health Information Management/*methods and Humans and Models, Statistical and Regression Analysis",NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The review aims to (1) characterize the variety of evaluation methods used within the health informatics community and (2) identify best practices. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed searches were conducted in February 2017 using search terms representing key concepts of interest: health care settings, visualization, and evaluation. References were also screened for eligibility. Data were extracted from included studies and analyzed using a PICOS framework: Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study Design. RESULTS: After screening, 76 publications met the review criteria. Publications varied across all PICOS dimensions. The most common audience was healthcare providers (n = 43), and the most common data gathering methods were direct observation (n = 30) and surveys (n = 27). About half of the publications focused on static, concentrated views of data with visuals (n = 36). Evaluations were heterogeneous regarding setting and measurements used. DISCUSSION: When evaluating data visualizations and visual analytics technologies, a variety of approaches have been used. Usability measures were used most often in early (prototype) implementations, whereas clinical outcomes were most common in evaluations of operationally-deployed systems.

A Discussion Between a (Cautious) Physician Informatician and an (Optimistic) Medical Informatics Researcher,"Zeng-Treitler, Qing and Nelson, Stuart J.",Journal of medical Internet research,"Artificial intelligence (AI), the computerized capability of doing tasks, which until recently was thought to be the exclusive domain of human intelligence, has demonstrated great strides in the past decade. The abilities to play games, provide piloting for an automobile, and respond to spoken language are remarkable successes. How are the challenges and opportunities of medicine different from these challenges and how can we best apply these data-driven techniques to patient care and outcomes? A New England Journal of Medicine paper published in 1980 suggested that more well-defined ""specialized"" tasks of medical care were more amenable to computer assistance, while the breadth of approach required for defining a problem and narrowing down the problem space was less so, and perhaps, unachievable. On the other hand, one can argue that the modern version of AI, which uses data-driven approaches, will be the most useful in tackling tasks such as outcome prediction that are often difficult for clinicians and patients. The ability today to collect large volumes of data about a single individual (eg, through a wearable device) and the accumulation of large datasets about multiple persons receiving medical care has the potential to apply to the care of individuals. As these techniques of analysis, enumeration, aggregation, and presentation are brought to bear in medicine, the question arises as to their utility and applicability in that domain. Early efforts in decision support were found to be helpful; as the systems proliferated, later experiences have shown difficulties such as alert fatigue and physician burnout becoming more prevalent. Will something similar arise from data-driven predictions? Will empowering patients by equipping them with information gained from data analysis help? Patients, providers, technology, and policymakers each have a role to play in the development and utilization of AI in medicine. Some of the challenges, opportunities, and tradeoffs implicit here are presented as a dialog between a clinician (SJN) and an informatician (QZT).",2019,10.2196/16272,21,11,e16272,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *big data and *Big Data and *data driven approach and *digital health and *digital medicine and *medical informatics and *quality of care and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*standards and big data and data driven approach and digital health and digital medicine and Health Personnel/*standards and Humans and medical informatics and Medical Informatics/*methods and Physicians/*standards and quality of care,NA,NA,2019/11/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Katapally_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,"The SMART Framework: Integration of Citizen Science, Community-Based Participatory Research, and Systems Science for Population Health Science in the Digital Age","Katapally, Tarun Reddy",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process, from conceptualization and data collection, to knowledge translation and evaluation. Citizen science is gradually emerging as a pertinent approach in population health research. Given that citizen science has intrinsic links with community-based research, where participatory action drives the research agenda, these two approaches could be integrated to address complex population health issues. Community-based participatory research has a strong record of application across multiple disciplines and sectors to address health inequities. Citizen science can use the structure of community-based participatory research to take local approaches of problem solving to a global scale, because citizen science emerged through individual environmental activism that is not limited by geography. This synergy has significant implications for population health research if combined with systems science, which can offer theoretical and methodological strength to citizen science and community-based participatory research. Systems science applies a holistic perspective to understand the complex mechanisms underlying causal relationships within and between systems, as it goes beyond linear relationships by utilizing big data-driven advanced computational models. However, to truly integrate citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science, it is time to realize the power of ubiquitous digital tools, such as smartphones, for connecting us all and providing big data. Smartphones have the potential to not only create equity by providing a voice to disenfranchised citizens but smartphone-based apps also have the reach and power to source big data to inform policies. An imminent challenge in legitimizing citizen science is minimizing bias, which can be achieved by standardizing methods and enhancing data quality-a rigorous process that requires researchers to collaborate with citizen scientists utilizing the principles of community-based participatory research action.

In the medical domain, there have been a number of studies on NER in English clinical notes; however, very limited NER research has been carried out on clinical notes written in Chinese. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate features and machine learning algorithms for NER in Chinese clinical text. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomly selected 400 admission notes and 400 discharge summaries from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in China. For each note, four types of entity-clinical problems, procedures, laboratory test, and medications-were annotated according to a predefined guideline. Two-thirds of the 400 notes were used to train the NER systems and one-third for testing. We investigated the effects of different types of feature including bag-of-characters, word segmentation, part-of-speech, and section information, and different machine learning algorithms including conditional random fields (CRF), support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy (ME), and structural SVM (SSVM) on the Chinese clinical NER task. All classifiers were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test set, and micro-averaged precision, recall, and F-measure were reported. RESULTS: Our evaluation on the independent test set showed that most types of feature were beneficial to Chinese NER systems, although the improvements were limited. The system achieved the highest performance by combining word segmentation and section information, indicating that these two types of feature complement each other. When the same types of optimized feature were used, CRF and SSVM outperformed SVM and ME.

Although the questions are domain-specific, they are asked by non-professionals, making the question classification task more challenging. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to classify health care-related questions posted by the general public (Chinese speakers) on the Internet. METHODS: A topic-based classification schema for health-related questions was built by manually annotating randomly selected questions. The Kappa statistic was used to measure the interrater reliability of multiple annotation results. Using the above corpus, we developed a machine-learning method to automatically classify these questions into one of the following six classes: Condition Management, Healthy Lifestyle, Diagnosis, Health Provider Choice, Treatment, and Epidemiology. RESULTS: The consumer health question schema was developed with a four-hierarchical-level of specificity, comprising 48 quaternary categories and 35 annotation rules. The 2000 sample questions were coded with 2000 major codes and 607 minor codes. Using natural language processing techniques, we expressed the Chinese questions as a set of lexical, grammatical, and semantic features.

Goodale_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Wearable Sensors Reveal Menses-Driven Changes in Physiology and Enable Prediction of the Fertile Window: Observational Study,"Goodale, Brianna Mae and Shilaih, Mohaned and Falco, Lisa and Dammeier, Franziska and Hamvas, Gyorgyi and Leeners, Brigitte",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Previous research examining physiological changes across the menstrual cycle has considered biological responses to shifting hormones in isolation. Clinical studies, for example, have shown that women's nightly basal body temperature increases from 0.28 to 0.56 <cb><9a>C following postovulation progesterone production. Women's resting pulse rate, respiratory rate, and heart rate variability (HRV) are similarly elevated in the luteal phase, whereas skin perfusion decreases significantly following the fertile window's closing. Past research probed only 1 or 2 of these physiological features in a given study, requiring participants to come to a laboratory or hospital clinic multiple times throughout their cycle. Although initially designed for recreational purposes, wearable technology could enable more ambulatory studies of physiological changes across the menstrual cycle. Early research suggests that wearables can detect phase-based shifts in pulse rate and wrist skin temperature (WST). To date, previous work has studied these features separately, with the ability of wearables to accurately pinpoint the fertile window using multiple physiological parameters simultaneously yet unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we probed what phase-based differences a wearable bracelet could detect in users' WST, heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, and skin perfusion. Drawing on insight from artificial intelligence and machine learning, we then sought to develop an algorithm that could identify the fertile window in real time. METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study, recruiting 237 conception-seeking Swiss women. Participants wore the Ava bracelet (Ava AG) nightly while sleeping for up to a year or until they became pregnant. In addition to syncing the device to the corresponding smartphone app daily, women also completed an electronic diary about their activities in the past 24 hours. Finally, women took a urinary luteinizing hormone test at several points in a given cycle to determine the close of the fertile window. We assessed phase-based changes in physiological parameters using cross-classified mixed-effects models with random intercepts and random slopes. We then trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize the fertile window. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that wearable technology can detect significant, concurrent phase-based shifts in WST, heart rate, and respiratory rate (all P<.001). HRV and skin perfusion similarly varied across the menstrual cycle (all P<.05), although these effects only trended toward significance following a Bonferroni correction to maintain a family-wise alpha level. Our findings were robust to daily, individual, and cycle-level covariates. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning algorithm that can detect the fertile window with 90% accuracy (95% CI 0.89 to 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Our contributions highlight the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning's integration into health care. By monitoring numerous physiological parameters simultaneously, wearable technology uniquely improves upon retrospective methods for fertility awareness and enables the first real-time predictive model of ovulation.",2019,10.2196/13404,21,4,e13404,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*algorithms and *fertility/physiology and *heart rate and *machine learning and *menstrual cycle and *ovulation detection/methods and *perfusion and *respiratory rate and *skin temperature and *wearable electronic devices and algorithms and Algorithms and Female and Fertility/*physiology and fertility/physiology and heart rate and Humans and Longitudinal Studies and machine learning and menstrual cycle and Menstrual Cycle/*physiology and ovulation detection/methods and Ovulation/*physiology and perfusion and Prospective Studies and respiratory rate and skin temperature and wearable electronic devices and Wearable Electronic Devices/*standards,NA,NA,2019/04/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Children in socioeconomically disadvantaged families are most at risk. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potential route to target these families because of its relatively low cost and high reach. The Growing healthy program was developed to provide evidence-based information on infant feeding from birth to 9 months via app or website. Understanding user engagement with these media is vital to developing successful interventions. Engagement is a complex, multifactorial concept that needs to move beyond simple metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to describe the development of an engagement index (EI) to monitor participant interaction with the Growing healthy app. The index included a number of subindices and cut-points to categorize engagement. METHODS: The Growing program was a feasibility study in which 300 mother-infant dyads were provided with an app which included 3 push notifications that was sent each week. Growing healthy participants completed surveys at 3 time points: baseline (T1) (infant age <e2><89><a4>3 months), infant aged 6 months (T2), and infant aged 9 months (T3). In addition, app usage data were captured from the app. The EI was adapted from the Web Analytics Demystified visitor EI. Our EI included 5 subindices: (1) click depth, (2) loyalty, (3) interaction, (4) recency, and (5) feedback. The overall EI summarized the subindices from date of registration through to 39 weeks (9 months) from the infant's date of birth. Basic descriptive data analysis was performed on the metrics and components of the EI as well as the final EI score. Group comparisons used t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman correlation tests as appropriate. Consideration of independent variables associated with the EI score were modeled using linear regression models. RESULTS: The overall EI mean score was 30.0% (SD 11.5%) with a range of 1.8% - 57.6%. The cut-points used for high engagement were scores greater than 37.1% and for poor engagement were scores less than 21.1%. Significant explanatory variables of the EI score included: parity (P=.005), system type including ""app only"" users or ""both"" app and email users (P<.001), recruitment method (P=.02), and baby age at recruitment (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: The EI provided a comprehensive understanding of participant behavior with the app over the 9-month period of the Growing healthy program. The use of the EI in this study demonstrates that rich and useful data can be collected and used to inform assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the app and in turn inform future interventions.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7236,5,6,e89,eng,2291-5222,children and infant development and infant obesity and infants and mHealth and practitioners and primary healthcare and social medium,NA,NA,2017/06/29/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Marshall_2015_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Automating risk of bias assessment for clinical trials,"Marshall, Iain J. and Kuiper, Joel and Wallace, Byron C.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Systematic reviews, which summarize the entirety of the evidence pertaining to a specific clinical question, have become critical for evidence-based decision making in healthcare. But such reviews have become increasingly onerous to produce due to the exponentially expanding biomedical literature base. This study proposes a step toward mitigating this problem by automating risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews, in which reviewers determine whether study results may be affected by biases (e.g., poor randomization or blinding). Conducting risk of bias assessment is an important but onerous task. We thus describe a machine learning approach to automate this assessment, using the standard Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool which assesses seven common types of bias. Training such a system would typically require a large labeled corpus, which would be prohibitively expensive to collect here. Instead, we use distant supervision, using data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (a large repository of systematic reviews), to pseudoannotate a corpus of 2200 clinical trial reports in PDF format. We then develop a joint model which, using the full text of a clinical trial report as input, predicts the risks of bias while simultaneously extracting the text fragments supporting these assessments. This study represents a step toward automating or semiautomating extraction of data necessary for the synthesis of clinical trials.",2015,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2431314,19,4,1406-1412,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,*Bias and *Clinical Trials as Topic and Humans and Medical Informatics/methods and Natural Language Processing and Risk Assessment/*methods,NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objective was to identify facilitators, challenges, and recommendations for implementing a novel predictive algorithm which aims to prospectively identify patients with high preventable utilization to proactively involve them in preventative interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In preparation for implementing the predictive algorithm in 3 organizations, we interviewed 3 stakeholder groups: health systems operations (eg, chief medical officers, department chairs), informatics personnel, and potential end users (eg, physicians, nurses, social workers). We applied thematic analysis to derive key themes and categorize them into the dimensions of Sittig and Singh's original sociotechnical model for studying health information technology in complex adaptive healthcare systems. Recruiting and analysis were conducted iteratively until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Forty-nine interviews were conducted in 3 healthcare organizations. Technical components of the implementation (hardware and software) raised fewer concerns than alignment with sociotechnical factors. Stakeholders wanted decision support based on the algorithm to be clear and actionable and incorporated into current workflows. However, how to make this disease-independent classification tool actionable was perceived as a challenge, and appropriate patient interventions informed by the algorithm appeared likely to require substantial external and institutional resources. Stakeholders also described the criticality of trust, credibility, and interpretability of the predictive algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Although predictive analytics can classify patients with high accuracy, they cannot advance healthcare processes and outcomes without careful implementation that takes into account the sociotechnical system.

These studies seek to collect passive and active sensor signals from participants' smartphones for the purposes of modelling and predicting health outcomes, with a specific focus on mental health. We also highlight features of the current research landscape that recommend the coordinated development of such platforms, including the significant technical and resource costs of development, and we identify specific considerations relevant to the design of platforms for digital phenotyping. In addition, we describe trade-offs relating to data quality and completeness versus the experience for patients and public users who consent to their devices being used to collect data. We summarize distinctive features of the resulting platform, InSTIL (Intelligent Sensing to Inform and Learn), which includes universal (ie, cross-platform) support for both iOS and Android devices and privacy-preserving mechanisms which, by default, collect only anonymized participant data. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for future work arising from learning during the development of the platform. The development of the InSTIL platform is a key step towards our research vision of a population-scale, international, digital phenotyping bank.

Chu_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Identifying Key Target Audiences for Public Health Campaigns: Leveraging Machine Learning in the Case of Hookah Tobacco Smoking,"Chu, Kar-Hai and Colditz, Jason and Malik, Momin and Yates, Tabitha and Primack, Brian",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is a particularly important issue for public health professionals to address owing to its prevalence and deleterious health effects. Social media sites can be a valuable tool for public health officials to conduct informational health campaigns. Current social media platforms provide researchers with opportunities to better identify and target specific audiences and even individuals. However, we are not aware of systematic research attempting to identify audiences with mixed or ambivalent views toward HTS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to (1) confirm previous research showing positively skewed HTS sentiment on Twitter using a larger dataset by leveraging machine learning techniques and (2) systematically identify individuals who exhibit mixed opinions about HTS via the Twitter platform and therefore represent key audiences for intervention. METHODS: We prospectively collected tweets related to HTS from January to June 2016. We double-coded sentiment for a subset of approximately 5000 randomly sampled tweets for sentiment toward HTS and used these data to train a machine learning classifier to assess the remaining approximately 556,000 HTS-related Twitter posts. Natural language processing software was used to extract linguistic features (ie, language-based covariates). The data were processed by machine learning tools and algorithms using R. Finally, we used the results to identify individuals who, because they had consistently posted both positive and negative content, might be ambivalent toward HTS and represent an ideal audience for intervention. RESULTS: There were 561,960 HTS-related tweets: 373,911 were classified as positive and 183,139 were classified as negative. A set of 12,861 users met a priori criteria indicating that they posted both positive and negative tweets about HTS. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis can allow researchers to identify audience segments on social media that demonstrate ambiguity toward key public health issues, such as HTS, and therefore represent ideal populations for intervention. Using large social media datasets can help public health officials to preemptively identify specific audience segments that would be most receptive to targeted campaigns.",2019,10.2196/12443,21,7,e12443,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*infodemiology and *infoveillance and *machine learning and *public health and *smoking and *smoking water pipes and *social media and *tobacco and *waterpipe tobacco and Health Promotion/*methods and Humans and infodemiology and infoveillance and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Prospective Studies and public health and Public Health/*methods and smoking and smoking water pipes and Smoking Water Pipes and social media and Social Media/*standards and tobacco and waterpipe tobacco,NA,NA,2019/07/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

We developed a standardized analytic tool to replicate the cohort construction process from a published epidemiology protocol and applied the analysis to all 6 databases to assess time-to-execution and comparability of results. RESULTS: Transformation to the CDM resulted in minimal information loss across all 6 databases.

In the Women's heart health study (WHHS), we developed Wanda-cardiovascular disease (CVD), where participants received healthy lifestyle education followed by six months of technology support and reinforcement. Wanda-CVD is a smartphone-based RHM system designed to assist participants in reducing identified CVD risk factors through wireless coaching using feedback and prompts as social support. Many participants benefitted from this RHM system. In response to the variance in participants' success, we developed a framework to identify classification schemes that predicted successful and unsuccessful participants. We analyzed both contextual baseline features and data from the first month of intervention such as activity, blood pressure, and questionnaire responses transmitted through the smartphone. A prediction tool can aid clinicians and scientists in identifying participants who may optimally benefit from the RHM system. Targeting therapies could potentially save healthcare costs, clinician, and participant time and resources. Our classification scheme yields RHM outcome success predictions with an F-measure of 91.9%, and identifies behaviors during the first month of intervention that help determine outcome success.

Studies have shown that electronic health record adoption has been slower than desired in certain types of hospitals; but generally, the overall adoption rate has increased among hospitals. However, these studies have neither evaluated the adoption of advanced functionalities of electronic health records (beyond MU) nor forecasted electronic health record maturation over an extended period in a holistic fashion. Additional research is needed to prospectively assess US hospitals' electronic health record technology adoption and advancement patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study forecasts the maturation of electronic health record functionality adoption among US hospitals through 2035. METHODS: The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics' Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM) dataset was used to track historic uptakes of various electronic health record functionalities considered critical to improving health care quality and efficiency in hospitals. The Bass model was used to predict the technological diffusion rates for repeated electronic health record adoptions where upgrades undergo rapid technological improvements. The forecast used EMRAM data from 2006 to 2014 to estimate adoption levels to the year 2035. RESULTS: In 2014, over 5400 hospitals completed HIMSS' annual EMRAM survey (86%+ of total US hospitals). In 2006, the majority of the US hospitals were in EMRAM Stages 0, 1, and 2. By 2014, most hospitals had achieved Stages 3, 4, and 5. The overall technology diffusion model (ie, the Bass model) reached an adjusted R-squared of .91. The final forecast depicted differing trends for each of the EMRAM stages. In 2006, the first year of observation, peaks of Stages 0 and 1 were shown as electronic health record adoption predates HIMSS' EMRAM. By 2007, Stage 2 reached its peak. Stage 3 reached its full height by 2011, while Stage 4 peaked by 2014. The first three stages created a graph that exhibits the expected ""S-curve"" for technology diffusion, with inflection point being the peak diffusion rate. This forecast indicates that Stage 5 should peak by 2019 and Stage 6 by 2026. Although this forecast extends to the year 2035, no peak was readily observed for Stage 7. Overall, most hospitals will achieve Stages 5, 6, or 7 of EMRAM by 2020; however, a considerable number of hospitals will not achieve Stage 7 by 2035. CONCLUSIONS: We forecasted the adoption of electronic health record capabilities from a paper-based environment (Stage 0) to an environment where only electronic information is used to document and direct care delivery (Stage 7). According to our forecasts, the majority of hospitals will not reach Stage 7 until 2035, absent major policy changes or leaps in technological capabilities.

Chung_2018_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Health and Fitness Apps for Hands-Free Voice-Activated Assistants: Content Analysis,"Chung, Arlene E. and Griffin, Ashley C. and Selezneva, Dasha and Gotz, David",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Hands-free voice-activated assistants and their associated devices have recently gained popularity with the release of commercial products, including Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Voice-activated assistants have many potential use cases in healthcare including education, health tracking and monitoring, and assistance with locating health providers. However, little is known about the types of health and fitness apps available for voice-activated assistants as it is an emerging market. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine the characteristics of health and fitness apps for commercially available, hands-free voice-activated assistants, including Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. METHODS: Amazon Alexa Skills Store and Google Assistant app were searched to find voice-activated assistant apps designated by vendors as health and fitness apps. Information was extracted for each app including name, description, vendor, vendor rating, user reviews and ratings, cost, developer and security policies, and the ability to pair with a smartphone app and website and device. Using a codebook, two reviewers independently coded each app using the vendor's descriptions and the app name into one or more health and fitness, intended age group, and target audience categories. A third reviewer adjudicated coding disagreements until consensus was reached. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize app characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 309 apps were reviewed; health education apps (87) were the most commonly occurring, followed by fitness and training (72), nutrition (33), brain training and games (31), and health monitoring (25). Diet and calorie tracking apps were infrequent. Apps were mostly targeted towards adults and general audiences with few specifically geared towards patients, caregivers, or medical professionals. Most apps were free to enable or use and 18.1% (56/309) could be paired with a smartphone app and website and device; 30.7% (95/309) of vendors provided privacy policies; and 22.3% (69/309) provided terms of use. The majority (36/42, 85.7%) of Amazon Alexa apps were rated by the vendor as mature or guidance suggested, which were geared towards adults only. When there was a user rating available, apps had a wide range of ratings from 1 to 5 stars with a mean of 2.97. Google Assistant apps did not have user reviews available, whereas most of Amazon Alexa apps had at least 1-9 reviews available. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging market of health and fitness apps for voice-activated assistants is still nascent and mainly focused on health education and fitness. Voice-activated assistant apps had a wide range of content areas but many published in the health and fitness categories did not actually have a clear health or fitness focus. This may, in part, be due to Amazon and Google policies, which place restrictions on the delivery of care or direct recording of health data.

Apps in this category are diverse. Some display important information (ie, drug interactions), whereas others help patients to keep track of their health. However, insufficient transport security can lead to confidentiality issues for patients and medical professionals, as well as safety issues regarding data integrity. mHealth apps should therefore deploy intensified vigilance to protect their data and integrity. This paper analyzes the state of security in mHealth apps. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) identification of relevant transport issues in mHealth apps, (2) development of a platform for test purposes, and (3) recommendation of practices to mitigate them. METHODS: Security characteristics relevant to the transport security of mHealth apps were assessed, presented, and discussed. These characteristics were used in the development of a prototypical platform facilitating streamlined tests of apps. For the tests, six lists of the 10 most downloaded free apps from three countries and two stores were selected. As some apps were part of these top 10 lists in more than one country, 53 unique apps were tested. RESULTS: Out of the 53 apps tested from three European App Stores for Android and iOS, 21/53 (40%) showed critical results. All 21 apps failed to guarantee the integrity of data displayed. A total of 18 apps leaked private data or were observable in a way that compromised confidentiality between apps and their servers; 17 apps used unprotected connections; and two apps failed to validate certificates correctly. None of the apps tested utilized certificate pinning. Many apps employed analytics or ad providers, undermining user privacy. CONCLUSIONS: The tests show that many mHealth apps do not apply sufficient transport security measures. The most common security issue was the use of any kind of unprotected connection. Some apps used secure connections only for selected tasks, leaving all other traffic vulnerable.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7791,5,10,e147,eng,2291-5222,computer security and confidentiality and data security and health information technology and mobile apps and mobile health,NA,NA,2017/10/18/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pham_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Service of Research Analytics to Optimize Digital Health Evidence Generation: Multilevel Case Study,"Pham, Quynh and Shaw, James and Morita, Plinio P. and Seto, Emily and Stinson, Jennifer N. and Cafazzo, Joseph A.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The widespread adoption of digital health interventions for chronic disease self-management has catalyzed a paradigm shift in the selection of methodologies used to evidence them. Recently, the application of digital health research analytics has emerged as an efficient approach to evaluate these data-rich interventions. However, there is a growing mismatch between the promising evidence base emerging from analytics mediated trials and the complexity of introducing these novel research methods into evaluative practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to generate transferable insights into the process of implementing research analytics to evaluate digital health interventions. We sought to answer the following two research questions: (1) how should the service of research analytics be designed to optimize digital health evidence generation? and (2) what are the challenges and opportunities to scale, spread, and sustain this service in evaluative practice? METHODS: We conducted a qualitative multilevel embedded single case study of implementing research analytics in evaluative practice that comprised a review of the policy and regulatory climate in Ontario (macro level), a field study of introducing a digital health analytics platform into evaluative practice (meso level), and interviews with digital health innovators on their perceptions of analytics and evaluation (microlevel). RESULTS: The practice of research analytics is an efficient and effective means of supporting digital health evidence generation. The introduction of a research analytics platform to evaluate effective engagement with digital health interventions into a busy research lab was ultimately accepted by research staff, became routinized in their evaluative practice, and optimized their existing mechanisms of log data analysis and interpretation. The capacity for research analytics to optimize digital health evaluations is highest when there is (1) a collaborative working relationship between research client and analytics service provider, (2) a data-driven research agenda, (3) a robust data infrastructure with clear documentation of analytic tags, (4) in-house software development expertise, and (5) a collective tolerance for methodological change. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific methods and practices that can facilitate the agile trials needed to iterate and improve digital health interventions warrant continued implementation.

However, some diseases are rare and require data from multiple institutions to construct generalizable models. To address institutional data protection policies, many distributed methods keep the data locally but rely on a central server for coordination, which introduces risks such as a single point of failure. We focus on providing an alternative based on a decentralized approach. We introduce the idea using blockchain technology for this purpose, with a brief description of its own potential advantages/disadvantages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explain how our proposed EXpectation Propagation LOgistic REgRession on Permissioned blockCHAIN (ExplorerChain) can achieve the same results when compared to a distributed model that uses a central server on 3 healthcare/genomic datasets, and what trade-offs need to be considered when using centralized/decentralized methods. We explain how the use of blockchain technology can help decrease some of the problems encountered in decentralized methods. RESULTS: We showed that the discrimination power of ExplorerChain can be statistically similar to its counterpart central server-based algorithm. While ExplorerChain inherited some benefits of blockchain, it had a small increased running time. DISCUSSION: ExplorerChain has the same prerequisites as a distributed model with a centralized server for coordination. In a manner similar to secure multi-party computation strategies, it assumes that participating institutions are honest, but ""curious."" CONCLUSION: When evaluated on relatively small datasets, results suggest that ExplorerChain, which combines artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, performs as well as a central server-based method, and may avoid some risks at the cost of efficiency.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa023,27,5,747-756,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Blockchain and *blockchain distributed ledger technology and *clinical information systems and *decision support systems and *Decision Support Systems, Management and *Delivery of Health Care and *Genomics/methods and *Machine Learning and *online machine learning and *privacy-preserving predictive modeling and Algorithms and Area Under Curve and blockchain distributed ledger technology and clinical information systems and Computer Communication Networks and Computer Security and Datasets as Topic and decision support systems and Decision Support Systems, Clinical and Female and Humans and Length of Stay and Logistic Models and Male and online machine learning and privacy-preserving predictive modeling and Prognosis",NA,NA,2020/05/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previously widely used screening tools, such as Health Risk Appraisal, are restricted in their achievement this goal due to their limitations, such as static characteristics, accessibility, and generalizability. Hypertension is one of the most important chronic diseases requiring management via the nationwide health maintenance program, and health care providers should inform patients about their risks of a complication caused by hypertension. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and compare machine learning models predicting high-risk vascular diseases for hypertensive patients so that they can manage their blood pressure based on their risk level. METHODS: We used a 12-year longitudinal dataset of the nationwide sample cohort, which contains the data of 514,866 patients and allows tracking of patients' medical history across all health care providers in Korea (N=51,920). To ensure the generalizability of our models, we conducted an external validation using another national sample cohort dataset, comprising one million different patients, published by the National Health Insurance Service. From each dataset, we obtained the data of 74,535 and 59,738 patients with essential hypertension and developed machine learning models for predicting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Six machine learning models were developed and compared for evaluating performances based on validation metrics. RESULTS: Machine learning algorithms enabled us to detect high-risk patients based on their medical history. The long short-term memory-based algorithm outperformed in the within test (F1-score=.772, external test F1-score=.613), and the random forest-based algorithm of risk prediction showed better performance over other machine learning algorithms concerning generalization (within test F1-score=.757, external test F1-score=.705). Concerning the number of features, in the within test, the long short-term memory-based algorithms outperformed regardless of the number of features. However, in the external test, the random forest-based algorithm was the best, irrespective of the number of features it encountered.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, Cochrane Trials, and Cochrane Reviews were searched for CDSS studies that assessed patient outcomes in inpatient settings. For each study, 2 physicians independently mapped patient outcome effects to a predefined medical effect score to assess the clinical impact of reported outcome effects. Disagreements were measured by using weighted kappa and solved by consensus. An example set of promising disease entities was generated based on medical effect scores and risk of bias assessment. To summarize technical characteristics of the systems, reported input variables and algorithm types were extracted as well. RESULTS: Seventy studies were included. Five (7%) reported reduced mortality, 16 (23%) reduced life-threatening events, and 28 (40%) reduced non-life-threatening events, 20 (29%) had no significant impact on patient outcomes, and 1 showed a negative effect (weighted <ce><ba>: 0.72, P < .001). Six of 24 disease entity settings showed high effect scores with medium or low risk of bias: blood glucose management, blood transfusion management, physiologic deterioration prevention, pressure ulcer prevention, acute kidney injury prevention, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Most of the implemented algorithms (72%) were rule-based. Reported input variables are shared as standardized models on a metadata repository. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Most of the included CDSS studies were associated with positive patient outcomes effects but with substantial differences regarding the clinical impact.

We used a self-organizing map to analyze word frequency data derived from users' forum posts. We then introduced a novel network-based approach for modeling users' forum interactions and employed a network partitioning method based on optimizing a stability quality measure. This allowed us to determine consumer opinion and identify influential users within the retrieved modules using information derived from both word-frequency data and network-based properties.

However, essential standardized nursing data are seldom integrated into EHRs and clinical data repositories. There are many diverse activities that exist to implement standardized nursing languages in EHRs; however, these activities are not coordinated, resulting in duplicate efforts rather than building a shared learning environment and resources. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the historical context of nursing terminologies, challenges to the use of nursing data for purposes other than documentation of care, and a national action plan for implementing and using sharable and comparable nursing data for quality reporting and translational research. METHODS: In 2013 and 2014, the University of Minnesota School of Nursing hosted a diverse group of nurses to participate in the Nursing Knowledge: Big Data and Science to Transform Health Care consensus conferences. This consensus conference was held to develop a national action plan and harmonize existing and new efforts of multiple individuals and organizations to expedite integration of standardized nursing data within EHRs and ensure their availability in clinical data repositories for secondary use. This harmonization will address the implementation of standardized nursing terminologies and subsequent access to and use of clinical nursing data. CONCLUSION: Foundational to integrating nursing data into clinical data repositories for big data and science, is the implementation of standardized nursing terminologies, common data models, and information structures within EHRs.

One proposed explanation for this variable effect is that users do not engage with apps as intended. The application of analytics, defined as the use of data to generate new insights, is an emerging approach to study and interpret engagement with mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to consolidate how analytic indicators of engagement have previously been applied across clinical and technological contexts, to inform how they might be optimally applied in future evaluations. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to catalog the range of analytic indicators being used in evaluations of consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions. We categorized studies according to app structure and application of engagement data and calculated descriptive data for each category. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests of independence were applied to calculate differences between coded variables. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies met our inclusion criteria. The average mHealth evaluation included for review was a two-group pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial of a hybrid-structured app for mental health self-management, had 103 participants, lasted 5 months, did not provide access to health care provider services, measured 3 analytic indicators of engagement, segmented users based on engagement data, applied engagement data for descriptive analyses, and did not report on attrition. Across the reviewed studies, engagement was measured using the following 7 analytic indicators: the number of measures recorded (76%, 31/41), the frequency of interactions logged (73%, 30/41), the number of features accessed (49%, 20/41), the number of log-ins or sessions logged (46%, 19/41), the number of modules or lessons started or completed (29%, 12/41), time spent engaging with the app (27%, 11/41), and the number or content of pages accessed (17%, 7/41). Engagement with unstructured apps was mostly measured by the number of features accessed (8/10, P=.04), and engagement with hybrid apps was mostly measured by the number of measures recorded (21/24, P=.03). A total of 24 studies presented, described, or summarized the data generated from applying analytic indicators to measure engagement. The remaining 17 studies used or planned to use these data to infer a relationship between engagement patterns and intended outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although researchers measured on average 3 indicators in a single study, the majority reported findings descriptively and did not further investigate how engagement with an app contributed to its impact on health and well-being. Researchers are gaining nuanced insights into engagement but are not yet characterizing effective engagement for improved outcomes. Raising the standard of mHealth app efficacy through measuring analytic indicators of engagement may enable greater confidence in the causal impact of apps on improved chronic health and well-being.",2019,10.2196/11941,7,1,e11941,eng,2291-5222,*adherence and *analytics and *chronic disease and *effective engagement and *engagement and *log data and *mobile applications and *mobile health and *scoping review and adherence and analytics and Chi-Square Distribution and chronic disease and Chronic Disease/*psychology and effective engagement and engagement and Humans and log data and mobile applications and mobile health and Patient Participation/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Program Evaluation/*methods/statistics & numerical data and scoping review and Telemedicine/*standards/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2019/01/18/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, traditional natural language processing (NLP) pipelines are limited, so we propose a method combining word embedding with a convolutional neural network (CNN). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the performance of traditional pipelines (NLP plus supervised machine learning models) with that of word embedding combined with a CNN in conducting a classification task identifying International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes in discharge notes. METHODS: We used 2 classification methods: (1) extracting from discharge notes some features (terms, n-gram phrases, and SNOMED CT categories) that we used to train a set of supervised machine learning models (support vector machine, random forests, and gradient boosting machine), and (2) building a feature matrix, by a pretrained word embedding model, that we used to train a CNN. We used these methods to identify the chapter-level ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in a set of discharge notes. We conducted the evaluation using 103,390 discharge notes covering patients hospitalized from June 1, 2015 to January 31, 2017 in the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. We used the receiver operating characteristic curve as an evaluation measure, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and F-measure as the global measure of effectiveness. RESULTS: In 5-fold cross-validation tests, our method had a higher testing accuracy (mean AUC 0.9696; mean F-measure 0.9086) than traditional NLP-based approaches (mean AUC range 0.8183-0.9571; mean F-measure range 0.5050-0.8739). A real-world simulation that split the training sample and the testing sample by date verified this result (mean AUC 0.9645; mean F-measure 0.9003 using the proposed method). Further analysis showed that the convolutional layers of the CNN effectively identified a large number of keywords and automatically extracted enough concepts to predict the diagnosis codes. CONCLUSIONS: Word embedding combined with a CNN showed outstanding performance compared with traditional methods, needing very little data preprocessing. This shows that future studies will not be limited by incomplete dictionaries. A large amount of unstructured information from free-text medical writing will be extracted by automated approaches in the future, and we believe that the health care field is about to enter the age of big data.",2017,10.2196/jmir.8344,19,11,e380,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*convolutional neural network and *data mining and *electronic health records and *electronic medical records and *machine learning and *natural language processing and *neural networks (computer) and *Semantics and *text mining and *word embedding and Artificial Intelligence/*trends and convolutional neural network and data mining and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*standards and electronic medical records and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*trends and natural language processing and Natural Language Processing and neural networks (computer) and text mining and word embedding",NA,NA,2017/11/06/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mozaffari.Kermani_2015_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Systematic Poisoning Attacks on and Defenses for Machine Learning in Healthcare,"Mozaffari-Kermani, Mehran and Sur-Kolay, Susmita and Raghunathan, Anand and Jha, Niraj K.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Machine learning is being used in a wide range of application domains to discover patterns in large datasets. Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors (incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five healthcare datasets. Finally, we present countermeasures against the proposed generic attacks that are based on tracking and detecting deviations in various accuracy metrics, and benchmark their effectiveness.",2015,10.1109/JBHI.2014.2344095,19,6,1893-1905,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Algorithms and *Computer Security and *Machine Learning and Databases, Factual/*standards and Humans and Medical Informatics/*standards and Models, Theoretical and Neoplasms",NA,NA,2015/11//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhu_2017_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Online Medical Prediagnosis Framework Using Nonlinear SVM,"Zhu, Hui and Liu, Xiaoxia and Lu, Rongxing and Li, Hui",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"With the advances of machine learning algorithms and the pervasiveness of network terminals, the online medical prediagnosis system, which can provide the diagnosis of healthcare provider anywhere anytime, has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of online medical prediagnosis system still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose an e fficient and privacy-preserving online medical prediagnosis framework, called eDiag, by using nonlinear kernel support vector machine (SVM). With eDiag, the sensitive personal health information can be processed without privacy disclosure during online prediagnosis service. Specifically, based on an improved expression for the nonlinear SVM, an efficient and privacy-preserving classification scheme is introduced with lightweight multiparty random masking and polynomial aggregation techniques. The encrypted user query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by user. Through extensive analysis, we show that eDiag can ensure that users' health information and healthcare provider's prediction model are kept confidential, and has significantly less computation and communication overhead than existing schemes. In addition, performance evaluations via implementing eDiag on smartphone and computer demonstrate eDiag's effectiveness in term of real online environment.",2017,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2548248,21,3,838-850,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,*Diagnosis and *Support Vector Machine and Humans and Medical Informatics/*methods,NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Developing unobtrusive remote monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of impending symptomatic relapses would allow clinicians to intervene before the patient's condition worsens. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to create the first models, exclusively using passive sensing data from a smartphone, to predict behavioral anomalies that could indicate early warning signs of a psychotic relapse. METHODS: Data used to train and test the models were collected during the CrossCheck study. Hourly features derived from smartphone passive sensing data were extracted from 60 patients with SSDs (42 nonrelapse and 18 relapse >1 time throughout the study) and used to train models and test performance. We trained 2 types of encoder-decoder neural network models and a clustering-based local outlier factor model to predict behavioral anomalies that occurred within the 30-day period before a participant's date of relapse (the near relapse period). Models were trained to recreate participant behavior on days of relative health (DRH, outside of the near relapse period), following which a threshold to the recreation error was applied to predict anomalies. The neural network model architecture and the percentage of relapse participant data used to train all models were varied. RESULTS: A total of 20,137 days of collected data were analyzed, with 726 days of data (0.037%) within any 30-day near relapse period. The best performing model used a fully connected neural network autoencoder architecture and achieved a median sensitivity of 0.25 (IQR 0.15-1.00) and specificity of 0.88 (IQR 0.14-0.96; a median 108% increase in behavioral anomalies near relapse). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the best performing model to identify behavioral features that had a medium-to-large effect (Cohen d>0.5) in distinguishing anomalies near relapse from DRH among 4 participants who relapsed multiple times throughout the study. Qualitative validation using clinical notes collected during the original CrossCheck study showed that the identified features from our analysis were presented to clinicians during relapse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method predicted a higher rate of anomalies in patients with SSDs within the 30-day near relapse period and can be used to uncover individual-level behaviors that change before relapse. This approach will enable technologists and clinicians to build unobtrusive digital mental health tools that can predict incipient relapse in SSDs.",2020,10.2196/19962,8,8,e19962,eng,2291-5222,"*artificial intelligence and *deep learning and *digital biomarkers and *digital phenotyping and *machine learning and *mental health and *mHealth and *mobile health and *mobile phone and *Neural Networks, Computer and *passive sensing and *psychotic disorders and *schizophrenia and *smartphone applications and Adult and artificial intelligence and deep learning and digital biomarkers and digital phenotyping and Female and Humans and machine learning and Male and mental health and mHealth and Middle Aged and mobile health and mobile phone and passive sensing and psychotic disorders and Recurrence and schizophrenia and Schizophrenia/diagnosis and Smartphone and smartphone applications and Text Messaging and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/08/31/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, many people are often unaware of their condition. The gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea is an overnight polysomnography in a dedicated sleep laboratory. Yet, these tests are expensive and beds are limited as trained staff needs to analyze the entire recording. An automated detection method would allow a faster diagnosis and more patients to be analyzed. Most algorithms for automated sleep apnea detection use a set of human-engineered features, potentially missing important sleep apnea markers. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on state-of-the-art deep learning models for automatically extracting features and detecting sleep apnea events in respiratory signals. The algorithm is evaluated on the Sleep-Heart-Health-Study-1 dataset and provides per-epoch sensitivity and specificity scores comparable to the state of the art. Furthermore, when these predictions are mapped to the apnea-hypopnea index, a considerable improvement in per-patient scoring is achieved over conventional methods.

In this work, structured and unstructured (textual) data are combined to assign clinical diagnostic and procedural codes (specifically ICD-9-CM) to patient stays. We investigate whether integrating these heterogeneous data types improves prediction strength compared to using the data types in isolation. METHODS: Two separate data integration approaches were evaluated. Early data integration combines features of several sources within a single model, and late data integration learns a separate model per data source and combines these predictions with a meta-learner. This is evaluated on data sources and clinical codes from a broad set of medical specialties. RESULTS: When compared with the best individual prediction source, late data integration leads to improvements in predictive power (eg, overall F-measure increased from 30.6% to 38.3% for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes), while early data integration is less consistent. The predictive strength strongly differs between medical specialties, both for ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedural codes. DISCUSSION: Structured data provides complementary information to unstructured data (and vice versa) for predicting ICD-9-CM codes. This can be captured most effectively by the proposed late data integration approach. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that models using multiple electronic health record data sources systematically outperform models using data sources in isolation in the task of predicting ICD-9-CM codes over a broad range of medical specialties.",2016,10.1093/jamia/ocv115,23,e1,19-e11,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*International Classification of Diseases and clinical coding and Clinical Coding/*methods and data integration and data mining and Data Mining and Datasets as Topic and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration and Humans and international classification of diseases and Machine Learning,NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gold standard diagnostic labels (sepsis negative, culture positive sepsis, culture negative/clinical sepsis) were assigned based on all the laboratory, clinical and microbiology data available in EMR. Only data that were available up to 12 h after phlebotomy for blood culture testing were used to build predictive models using machine learning (ML) algorithms. MEASUREMENT: We compared sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sepsis treatment of physicians with the predictions of models generated by ML algorithms. RESULTS: The treatment sensitivity of all the nine ML algorithms and specificity of eight out of the nine ML algorithms tested exceeded that of the physician when culture-negative sepsis was included. When culture-negative sepsis was excluded both sensitivity and specificity exceeded that of the physician for all the ML algorithms. The top three predictive variables were the hematocrit or packed cell volume, chorioamnionitis and respiratory rate.

Rivas_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automatic Classification of Online Doctor Reviews: Evaluation of Text Classifier Algorithms,"Rivas, Ryan and Montazeri, Niloofar and Le, Nhat Xt and Hristidis, Vagelis",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of doctor reviews are being generated by patients on the internet. These reviews address a diverse set of topics (features), including wait time, office staff, doctor's skills, and bedside manners. Most previous work on automatic analysis of Web-based customer reviews assumes that (1) product features are described unambiguously by a small number of keywords, for example, battery for phones and (2) the opinion for each feature has a positive or negative sentiment. However, in the domain of doctor reviews, this setting is too restrictive: a feature such as visit duration for doctor reviews may be expressed in many ways and does not necessarily have a positive or negative sentiment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to adapt existing and propose novel text classification methods on the domain of doctor reviews. These methods are evaluated on their accuracy to classify a diverse set of doctor review features. METHODS: We first manually examined a large number of reviews to extract a set of features that are frequently mentioned in the reviews. Then we proposed a new algorithm that goes beyond bag-of-words or deep learning classification techniques by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) tools. Specifically, our algorithm automatically extracts dependency tree patterns and uses them to classify review sentences. RESULTS: We evaluated several state-of-the-art text classification algorithms as well as our dependency tree-based classifier algorithm on a real-world doctor review dataset. We showed that methods using deep learning or NLP techniques tend to outperform traditional bag-of-words methods. In our experiments, the 2 best methods used NLP techniques; on average, our proposed classifier performed 2.19% better than an existing NLP-based method, but many of its predictions of specific opinions were incorrect.

We developed and prospectively validated a versatile platform (IRIS) for real-time ICU physiologic monitoring, clinical decision making, and caretaker notification. METHODS: IRIS was implemented in the neurointensive care unit to stream multimodal time series data, including EEG, intracranial pressure (ICP), and brain tissue oxygenation (P(bt)O(2)), from ICU monitors to an analysis server. IRIS was applied for 364 patients undergoing continuous EEG, 26 patients undergoing burst suppression monitoring, and four patients undergoing intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen monitoring. Custom algorithms were used to identify periods of elevated ICP, compute burst suppression ratios (BSRs), and detect faulty or disconnected EEG electrodes. Hospital staff were notified of clinically relevant events using our secure API to route alerts through a password-protected smartphone application. RESULTS: Sustained increases in ICP and concordant decreases in P(bt)O(2) were reliably detected using user-defined thresholds and alert throttling. BSR trends computed by the platform correlated highly with manual neurologist markings (r(2) 0.633-0.781; p < 0.0001). The platform identified EEG electrodes with poor signal quality with 95% positive predictive value, and reduced latency of technician response by 93%. CONCLUSION: This study validates a flexible real-time platform for monitoring and interpreting ICU data and notifying caretakers of actionable results, with potential to reduce the manual burden of continuous monitoring services on care providers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop methodology for extending i2b2's pre-existing API to query additional data models, using i2b2's recent ""multi-fact-table querying"" feature. Our method involves developing data-model-specific i2b2 ontologies and mapping these to query non-standard table structure. RESULTS: We implement this methodology to query OMOP and PCORnet models, which we validate with the i2b2 query tool. We implement the entire PCORnet data model and a five-domain subset of the OMOP model. We also demonstrate that additional, ancillary data model columns can be modeled and queried as i2b2 ""modifiers.""

In order to improve the performance of queries in that kind of scenario, we present the Domain Index, a new category of index structures intended to efficiently query a data domain across multiple repositories, regardless of the repository to which the data belong. To evaluate our method, we carried out experiments involving content-based queries, namely range and k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, 1) over real-world data from a public data set of mammograms, as well as 2) over synthetic data to perform scalability evaluations. The results show that images from any repository are seamlessly retrieved, sustaining performance gains of up to 53% in range queries and up to 81% in kNN queries. Regarding scalability, our proposal scaled well as we increased 1) the cardinality of data (up to 59% of gain) and 2) the number of queried repositories (up to 71% of gain).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a virtual patient cohort, we simulated real-world healthcare data and applied random forest and gradient boosting classifiers to develop prediction models. Treatment effect was estimated as the difference between the predicted outcomes of a treatment and a control. We evaluated the impact of predictors (ie, treatment predictors [X1], confounders [X2], treatment effects modifiers [X3], and other outcome risk factors [X4]) with known effects on treatment and outcome using real-world data, and outcome imbalance on predicting individual outcome. Using counterfactuals, we evaluated percentage of patients with biased predicted individual treatment effects. RESULTS: The X4 had relatively more impact on model performance than X2 and X3 did. No effects were observed from X1. Moderate-to-severe outcome imbalance had a significantly negative impact on model performance, particularly among subgroups in which an outcome occurred. Bias in predicting individual treatment effects was significant and persisted even when the models had a 100% accuracy in predicting health outcome. DISCUSSION: Inadequate inclusion of the X2, X3, and X4 and moderate-to-severe outcome imbalance may affect model performance in predicting individual outcome and subsequently bias in predicting individual treatment effects.

Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality. METHODS: Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM). RESULTS: Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. ""CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EMR data were extracted from 1 year of hospitalizations (>18K patients with >5.4M structured items including clinical orders, lab results, and diagnosis codes). Association statistics were counted for the <e2><88><bc>1.5K most common items to drive an order recommender. The authors assessed the recommender's ability to predict hospital admission orders and outcomes based on initial encounter data from separate validation patients. RESULTS: Compared to a reference benchmark of using the overall most common orders, the recommender using temporal relationships improves precision at 10 recommendations from 33% to 38% (P < 10(-10)) for hospital admission orders. Relative risk-based association methods improve inverse frequency weighted recall from 4% to 16% (P < 10(-16)). The framework yields a prediction receiver operating characteristic area under curve (c-statistic) of 0.84 for 30 day mortality, 0.84 for 1 week need for ICU life support, 0.80 for 1 week hospital discharge, and 0.68 for 30-day readmission. DISCUSSION: Recommender results quantitatively improve on reference benchmarks and qualitatively appear clinically reasonable. The method assumes that aggregate decision making converges appropriately, but ongoing evaluation is necessary to discern common behaviors from ""correct"" ones.

Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed at reporting and further presenting and analyzing the methods, tools, and statistical approaches for Google Trends (infodemiology) studies in health-related topics from 2006 to 2016 to provide an overview of the usefulness of said tool and be a point of reference for future research on the subject. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term ""Google Trends"" in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling. RESULTS: All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively. Only 8.7% (9/104) of the studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting in health-related topics; therefore, it is evident that a gap exists in forecasting using Google Trends data.

To assist in this research effort, we developed a novel clinical data representation model entitled medical knowledge-infused convolutional neural network (MKCNN), which is used for learning the clinical trial criteria eligibility status of patients to participate in cohort studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we propose a clinical text representation infused with medical knowledge (MK). First, we isolate the noise from the relevant data using a medically relevant description extractor; then we utilize log-likelihood ratio based weights from selected sentences to highlight ""met"" and ""not-met"" knowledge-infused representations in bichannel setting for each instance. The combined medical knowledge-infused representation (MK) from these modules helps identify significant clinical criteria semantics, which in turn renders effective learning when used with a convolutional neural network architecture. RESULTS: MKCNN outperforms other Medical Knowledge (MK) relevant learning architectures by approximately 3%; notably SVM and XGBoost implementations developed in this study. MKCNN scored 86.1% on F1metric, a gain of 6% above the average performance assessed from the submissions for n2c2 task. Although pattern/rule-based methods show a higher average performance for the n2c2 clinical data set, MKCNN significantly improves performance of machine learning implementations for clinical datasets. CONCLUSION: MKCNN scored 86.1% on the F1 score metric. In contrast to many of the rule-based systems introduced during the n2c2 challenge workshop, our system presents a model that heavily draws on machine-based learning. In addition, the MK representations add more value to clinical comprehension and interpretation of natural texts.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz128,26,11,1227-1236,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*clinical trials and *cohort selection and *convolutional neural network and *Deep Learning and *medical records and *natural language processing and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Patient Selection and clinical trials and Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods and cohort selection and convolutional neural network and Data Mining/*methods and Humans and medical records and natural language processing and Natural Language Processing and Support Vector Machine",NA,NA,2019/11/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Self-management of diabetes including maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for glycemic control and to prevent diabetes complications. Mobile-based health data can play an important role in the forecasting of blood glucose levels for lifestyle management and control of T2DM. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to dynamically forecast daily glucose levels in patients with T2DM based on their daily mobile health lifestyle data including diet, physical activity, weight, and glucose level from the day before. METHODS: We used data from 10 T2DM patients who were overweight or obese in a behavioral lifestyle intervention using mobile tools for daily monitoring of diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose over 6 months. We developed a deep learning model based on long short-term memory-based recurrent neural networks to forecast the next-day glucose levels in individual patients. The neural network used several layers of computational nodes to model how mobile health data (food intake including consumed calories, fat, and carbohydrates; exercise; and weight) were progressing from one day to another from noisy data. RESULTS: The model was validated based on a data set of 10 patients who had been monitored daily for over 6 months. The proposed deep learning model demonstrated considerable accuracy in predicting the next day glucose level based on Clark Error Grid and <c2><b1>10% range of the actual values. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning methodologies may leverage mobile health lifestyle data to develop effective individualized prediction plans for T2DM management. However, predicting future glucose levels is challenging as glucose level is determined by multiple factors.

The speed with which a healthcare provider receives pertinent information, such as results from clinical orders, can impact flow. We seek to determine if clinical ordering behavior can be predicted at triage during an ED visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data available during triage, we trained multilabel machine learning classifiers to predict clinical orders placed during an ED visit. We benchmarked 4 classifiers with 2 multilabel learning frameworks that predict orders independently (binary relevance) or simultaneously (random k-labelsets). We evaluated algorithm performance, calculated variable importance, and conducted a simple simulation study to examine the effects of algorithm implementation on length of stay and cost. RESULTS: Aggregate performance across orders was highest when predicting orders independently with a multilayer perceptron (median F1 score = 0.56), but prediction frameworks that simultaneously predict orders for a visit enhanced predictive performance for correlated orders. Visit acuity was the most important predictor for most orders. Simulation results indicated that direct implementation of the model would increase ordering costs (from $21 to $45 per visit) but reduce length of stay (from 158 minutes to 151 minutes) over all visits. DISCUSSION: Simulated implementations of the predictive algorithm decreased length of stay but increased ordering costs. Optimal implementation of these predictions to reduce patient length of stay without incurring additional costs requires more exploration.

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline.

Stein and Kinley, Teresa",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak progressed rapidly from a public health (PH) emergency of international concern (World Health Organization [WHO], 30 January 2020) to a pandemic (WHO, 11 March 2020). The declaration of a national emergency in the United States (13 March 2020) necessitated the addition and modification of terminology related to COVID-19 and development of the disease's case definition. During this period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and standard development organizations released guidance on data standards for reporting COVID-19 clinical encounters, laboratory results, cause-of-death certifications, and other surveillance processes for COVID-19 PH emergency operations. The CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository was created to address the need for PH and health-care stakeholders at local and national levels to easily obtain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information management resources.

Although the application of big data technology for COVID-19 warning and monitoring remain important tasks, prevention of the disease's rapid spread and reduction of its impact on society are currently the most pressing challenges for the application of big data technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, the Chinese government and nongovernmental organizations actively used big data technology to prevent, contain, and control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to discuss the application of big data technology to prevent, contain, and control COVID-19 in China; draw lessons; and make recommendations. METHODS: We discuss the data collection methods and key data information that existed in China before the outbreak of COVID-19 and how these data contributed to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Next, we discuss China's new data collection methods and new information assembled after the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the data and information collected in China, we analyzed the application of big data technology from the perspectives of data sources, data application logic, data application level, and application results. In addition, we analyzed the issues, challenges, and responses encountered by China in the application of big data technology from four perspectives: data access, data use, data sharing, and data protection. Suggestions for improvements are made for data collection, data circulation, data innovation, and data security to help understand China's response to the epidemic and to provide lessons for other countries' prevention and control of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the process of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, big data technology has played an important role in personal tracking, surveillance and early warning, tracking of the virus's sources, drug screening, medical treatment, resource allocation, and production recovery. The data used included location and travel data, medical and health data, news media data, government data, online consumption data, data collected by intelligent equipment, and epidemic prevention data. We identified a number of big data problems including low efficiency of data collection, difficulty in guaranteeing data quality, low efficiency of data use, lack of timely data sharing, and data privacy protection issues. To address these problems, we suggest unified data collection standards, innovative use of data, accelerated exchange and circulation of data, and a detailed and rigorous data protection system. CONCLUSIONS: China has used big data technology to prevent and control COVID-19 in a timely manner.

Nonetheless, the frequent situation of unobserved measurements impairs the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently extract context from raw streams of data. In this paper, we study the problem of accurate estimation of missing multimodal inertial data and we propose a classification framework that considers the reconstruction of subsampled data during the test phase. We introduce the concept of forming the available data streams into low-rank two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D Hankel structures, and we exploit data redundancies using sophisticated imputation techniques, namely matrix and tensor completion. Moreover, we examine the impact of reconstruction on the classification performance by experimenting with several state-of-the-art classifiers. The system is evaluated with respect to different data structuring scenarios, the volume of data available for reconstruction, and various levels of missing values per device. Finally, the tradeoff between subsampling accuracy and energy conservation in wearable platforms is examined.

A human-annotated training set with gold-standard disease status labels is usually required to build an algorithm for phenotyping based on a set of predictive features. The time intensiveness of annotation and feature curation severely limits the ability to achieve high-throughput phenotyping. While previous studies have successfully automated feature curation, annotation remains a major bottleneck. In this paper, we present PheNorm, a phenotyping algorithm that does not require expert-labeled samples for training. METHODS: The most predictive features, such as the number of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes or mentions of the target phenotype, are normalized to resemble a normal mixture distribution with high area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for prediction. The transformed features are then denoised and combined into a score for accurate disease classification. RESULTS: We validated the accuracy of PheNorm with 4 phenotypes: coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The AUCs of the PheNorm score reached 0.90, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94 for the 4 phenotypes, respectively, which were comparable to the accuracy of supervised algorithms trained with sample sizes of 100-300, with no statistically significant difference.

We reviewed titles, abstracts, and full paper contents for evidence of attention to measurement validity, reliability, or reuse. We used Friedman and Wyatt's typology to categorize the studies. RESULTS: There were 391 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study types in this cohort were primarily field user effect studies (n = 210) or problem impact studies (n = 150). Of those, 280 studies (72%) had no evidence of attention to measurement methodology, and 111 (28%) had some evidence with 33 (8%) offering validity evidence; 45 (12%) offering reliability evidence; and 61 (16%) reporting measurement artefact reuse. DISCUSSION: Only 5 studies offered validity assessment within the study. Valid measures were predominantly observed in problem impact studies with the majority of measures being clinical or patient reported outcomes with validity measured elsewhere. CONCLUSION: Measurement methodology is frequently ignored in empirical studies of clinical decision support systems and particularly so in field user effect studies. Authors may in fact be attending to measurement considerations and not reporting this or employing methods of unknown validity and reliability in their studies.

Given the heavy reliance on smartphones and mobile devices around the world, this readily available source of data is an important and highly underutilized source that has the potential to improve mental health risk prediction and prevention and advance mental health globally. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply machine learning in an acute mental health setting for suicide risk prediction. This study uses a nascent approach, adding to existing knowledge by using data collected through a smartphone in place of clinical data, which have typically been collected from health care records. METHODS: We created a smartphone app called Strength Within Me, which was linked to Fitbit, Apple Health kit, and Facebook, to collect salient clinical information such as sleep behavior and mood, step frequency and count, and engagement patterns with the phone from a cohort of inpatients with acute mental health (n=66). In addition, clinical research interviews were used to assess mood, sleep, and suicide risk. Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested to determine the best fit. RESULTS: K-nearest neighbors (KNN; k=2) with uniform weighting and the Euclidean distance metric emerged as the most promising algorithm, with 68% mean accuracy (averaged over 10,000 simulations of splitting the training and testing data via 10-fold cross-validation) and an average area under the curve of 0.65. We applied a combined 5*2 F test to test the model performance of KNN against the baseline classifier that guesses training majority, random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression, and achieved F statistics of 10.7 (P=.009) and 17.6 (P=.003) for training majority and random forest, respectively, rejecting the null of performance being the same. Therefore, we have taken the first steps in prototyping a system that could continuously and accurately assess the risk of suicide via mobile devices. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting for suicidality is an underaddressed area of research to which this paper makes a useful contribution. This is part of the first generation of studies to suggest that it is feasible to utilize smartphone-generated user input and passive sensor data to generate a risk algorithm among inpatients at suicide risk. The model reveals fair concordance between phone-derived and research-generated clinical data, and with iterative development, it has the potential for accurate discriminant risk prediction.

In addition to using conventional epidemiologic evidence from registries, this innovative approach explores the vast potential of open-access omics databases for identifying genetic evidence pertaining to devices. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)/Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUPNet) data (2002-2011) was focused on the ventilation-related iatrogenic pneumothorax (Vent-IP) outcome in discharges with mechanical ventilation (MV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The derived epidemiologic evidence was analyzed in conjunction with pre-existing genomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus/National Center for Biotechnology Information and other databases. RESULTS: AHRQ/HCUPNet epidemiologic evidence showed that annual occurrence of Vent-IP did not decrease over a decade. While the Vent-IP risk associated with noninvasive CPAP comprised about 0.5%, the Vent-IP risk due to longer-term MV reached 2%. Along with MV posing an independent risk for Vent-IP, female sex and white race were found to be effect modifiers, resulting in the highest Vent-IP risk among mechanically ventilated white females. The Vent-IP risk was also potentiated by comorbidities associated with spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) and fibrosis. Consistent with the epidemiologic evidence, expression profiling in a number of animal models showed that the expression of several collagens and other SP/fibrosis-related genes was modified by ventilation settings. CONCLUSION: Integration of complementary genetic evidence into epidemiologic analysis can lead to a cost- and time-efficient discovery of the risk predictors and markers and thus can facilitate more efficient marker-based evaluation of medical product performance.",2016,10.1093/jamia/ocw031,23,4,711-720,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Computer Simulation and *In silico evidence integration using big data approaches and *Medical device safety biomarkers and *Repurposing and re-utilization of pre-existing genetic data and *Translational Epidemiology and Epidemiologic Methods and Ethnic Groups and Ethnicity and Female and Gene Expression Profiling and Humans and In silico evidence integration using big data approaches and Male and Medical device safety biomarkers and Pilot Projects and Pneumothorax/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics and Repurposing and re-utilization of pre-existing genetic data and Respiration, Artificial/*adverse effects and Retrospective Studies and Translational Epidemiology",NA,NA,2016/07//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rabbi_2015_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Automated personalized feedback for physical activity and dietary behavior change with mobile phones: a randomized controlled trial on adults,"Rabbi, Mashfiqui and Pfammatter, Angela and Zhang, Mi and Spring, Bonnie and Choudhury, Tanzeem",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. OBJECTIVE: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. METHODS: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. RESULTS: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.

Nikfarjam_2015_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Pharmacovigilance from social media: mining adverse drug reaction mentions using sequence labeling with word embedding cluster features,"Nikfarjam, Azadeh and Sarker, Abeed and O'Connor, Karen and Ginn, Rachel and Gonzalez, Graciela",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Social media is becoming increasingly popular as a platform for sharing personal health-related information. This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. METHODS: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. RESULTS: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocu041,22,3,671-681,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Artificial Intelligence and *Pharmacovigilance and *Social Media and ADR and adverse drug reaction and Data Mining/*methods and deep learning word embeddings and Humans and machine learning and natural language processing and Natural Language Processing and pharmacovigilance and Semantics and social media mining,NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Perry_2014_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Supervised embedding of textual predictors with applications in clinical diagnostics for pediatric cardiology,"Perry, Thomas Ernest and Zha, Hongyuan and Zhou, Ke and Frias, Patricio and Zeng, Dadan and Braunstein, Mark",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records possess critical predictive information for machine-learning-based diagnostic aids. However, many traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate textual data into the prediction process because of its high dimensionality. In this paper, we present a supervised method using Laplacian Eigenmaps to enable existing machine learning methods to estimate both low-dimensional representations of textual data and accurate predictors based on these low-dimensional representations at the same time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to enhance predictive models by embedding textual predictors into a low-dimensional latent space, which preserves the local similarities among textual data in high-dimensional space. The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient descent. For the evaluation, we applied our method to over 2000 patient records from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients were diagnosed with cardiac disease. In our experiments, we consider relatively short textual descriptions because of data availability. We compared our method with latent semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant analysis. The results were assessed using four metrics: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), specificity, and sensitivity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicate that supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps was the highest performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC, respectively. Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps showed an increase of 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the baseline that excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and MCC, respectively, over unsupervised Laplacian Eigenmaps. CONCLUSIONS: As a solution, we present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to embed textual predictors into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This method allows many existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently capture the potential of textual predictors, especially those based on short texts.",2014,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001792,21,e1,142-e136,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Algorithms and *Artificial Intelligence and *Diagnosis and Area Under Curve and Cardiology/*methods and Clinical Diagnostics and Discriminant Analysis and Eigenmaps and Embedding and Humans and Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods and Pediatrics/methods and ROC Curve and Sensitivity and Specificity and Supervised Learning",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012, a multidisciplinary team was assembled by the leadership of the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and charged with rapidly developing a pragmatic and actionable analytics framework for understanding and enhancing healthcare value. Based on an analysis of relevant prior work, a value analytics framework known as Value Driven Outcomes (VDO) was developed using an agile methodology. Evaluation consisted of measurement against project objectives, including implementation timeliness, system performance, completeness, accuracy, extensibility, adoption, satisfaction, and the ability to support value improvement. RESULTS: A modular, extensible framework was developed to allocate clinical care costs to individual patient encounters. For example, labor costs in a hospital unit are allocated to patients based on the hours they spent in the unit; actual medication acquisition costs are allocated to patients based on utilization; and radiology costs are allocated based on the minutes required for study performance. Relevant process and outcome measures are also available. A visualization layer facilitates the identification of value improvement opportunities, such as high-volume, high-cost case types with high variability in costs across providers. Initial implementation was completed within 6 months, and all project objectives were fulfilled. The framework has been improved iteratively and is now a foundational tool for delivering high-value care.

Our working hypothesis is that the HL7 vMR standard in its release 1 version can properly capture the semantics needed to drive evidence-based clinical decision support systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To achieve seamless communication between the personal health record and heterogeneous data consumers, we used a three-pronged approach. First, the choice of the HL7 vMR as a message model for all components accompanied by the use of medical vocabularies eases their semantic interoperability. Second, the DI follows a service-oriented approach to provide access to system components. Third, an XML database provides the data layer.Results The DI supports requirements of a guideline-based clinical decision support system implemented in two clinical domains and settings, ensuring reliable and secure access, high performance, and simplicity of integration, while complying with standards for the storage and processing of patient information needed for decision support and analytics. This was tested within the framework of a multinational project (www.mobiguide-project.eu) aimed at developing a ubiquitous patient guidance system (PGS).

An early warning system (EWS) to identify patients at high risk of subsequent intrahospital death can be an effective tool for ensuring patient safety and quality of care and reducing avoidable harm and costs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively validate a real-time EWS designed to predict patients at high risk of inpatient mortality during their hospital episodes. METHODS: Data were collected from the system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) of two acute Berkshire Health System hospitals, comprising 54,246 inpatient admissions from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017, of which 2.30% (1248/54,246) resulted in intrahospital deaths. Multiple machine learning methods (linear and nonlinear) were explored and compared. The tree-based random forest method was selected to develop the predictive application for the intrahospital mortality assessment. After constructing the model, we prospectively validated the algorithms as a real-time inpatient EWS for mortality. RESULTS: The EWS algorithm scored patients' daily and long-term risk of inpatient mortality probability after admission and stratified them into distinct risk groups. In the prospective validation, the EWS prospectively attained a c-statistic of 0.884, where 99 encounters were captured in the highest risk group, 69% (68/99) of whom died during the episodes. It accurately predicted the possibility of death for the top 13.3% (34/255) of the patients at least 40.8 hours before death. Important clinical utilization features, together with coded diagnoses, vital signs, and laboratory test results were recognized as impactful predictors in the final EWS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we prospectively demonstrated the capability of the newly-designed EWS to monitor and alert clinicians about patients at high risk of in-hospital death in real time, thereby providing opportunities for timely interventions. This real-time EWS is able to assist clinical decision making and enable more actionable and effective individualized care for patients' better health outcomes in target medical facilities.",2019,10.2196/13719,21,7,e13719,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*electronic health records and *inpatients and *machine learning and *mortality and *risk assessment and Algorithms and Computer Systems/*standards and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Female and Humans and inpatients and Inpatients and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods and mortality and Mortality/*trends and Prospective Studies and Retrospective Studies and risk assessment and Risk Assessment/*methods and Risk Factors",NA,NA,2019/07/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We used visual analytics software to develop the dashboard. We collaborated with the hospital-wide Clinical Decision Support committee to perform three interventions successively deactivating clinically irrelevant drug-drug interaction (DDI) alert rules. We analyzed the impact of the interventions on care providers' and pharmacists' alert and override rates using an interrupted time series framework with piecewise regression. RESULTS: We evaluated 2 391 880 medication alerts between January 31, 2011 and January 26, 2014. For pharmacists, the median alert rate prior to the first DDI deactivation was 58.74 alerts/100 orders (IQR 54.98-60.48) and 25.11 alerts/100 orders (IQR 23.45-26.57) following the three interventions (p<0.001). For providers, baseline median alert rate prior to the first round of DDI deactivation was 19.73 alerts/100 orders (IQR 18.66-20.24) and 15.11 alerts/100 orders (IQR 14.44-15.49) following the three interventions (p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis, we observed a decrease in pharmacists' override rates for DDI alerts that were not modified in the system from a median of 93.06 overrides/100 alerts (IQR 91.96-94.33) to 85.68 overrides/100 alerts (IQR 84.29-87.15, p<0.001). The medication serious safety event rate decreased during the study period, and there were no serious safety events reported in association with the deactivated alert rules. CONCLUSIONS: An alert dashboard facilitated safe rapid-cycle reductions in alert burden that were temporally associated with lower pharmacist override rates in a subgroup of DDIs not directly affected by the interventions; meanwhile, the pharmacists' frequency of selecting the 'cancel' option increased.

The authors have developed a data-mining method for systematic, automated detection of ADEs from electronic medical records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This method uses the text from 9.5 million clinical notes, along with prior knowledge of drug usages and known ADEs, as inputs. These inputs are further processed into statistics used by a discriminative classifier which outputs the probability that a given drug-disorder pair represents a valid ADE association. Putative ADEs identified by the classifier are further filtered for positive support in 2 independent, complementary data sources. The authors evaluate this method by assessing support for the predictions in other curated data sources, including a manually curated, time-indexed reference standard of label change events. RESULTS: This method uses a classifier that achieves an area under the curve of 0.94 on a held out test set. The classifier is used on 2,362,950 possible drug-disorder pairs comprised of 1602 unique drugs and 1475 unique disorders for which we had data, resulting in 240 high-confidence, well-supported drug-AE associations.

We assessed how different categories of information relate to risk assessment and compared discrete models to time-to-event models. RESULTS: The best predictors used all the available data (c-statistic ranged from 0.72-0.76), with stronger models in the near term. While different variable groups showed different utility, exclusion of any particular group did not lead to a meaningfully different risk assessment. Discrete time models performed better than time-to-event models. CONCLUSIONS: Different variable groups were predictive over different time horizons, with vital signs most predictive for near-term mortality and demographic and comorbidities more important in long-term mortality.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw057,24,1,176-181,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Electronic Health Records and *ESRD and *hemodialysis and *Mortality and *predictive modeling and *Prognosis and *Renal Dialysis and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Data Mining and Electronic Health Records and ESRD and Female and hemodialysis and Humans and Logistic Models and Male and predictive modeling and Time",NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

This report is a summary of the discussions during the second day of the workshop. Collectively, the workshop presenters and participants emphasized the need for unstructured clinical notes to be included in the decision making workflow and the need for individualized longitudinal data tracking. The workshop also discussed the need to: (1) combine evidence-based literature and patient records with machine-learning and prediction models; (2) provide trusted and reproducible clinical advice; (3) prioritize evidence and test results; and (4) engage healthcare professionals, caregivers, and patients. The overall consensus of the NLP-CDS workshop was that there are promising opportunities for NLP and CDS to deliver cognitive support for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and patients.",2014,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001896,21,e1,5-e2,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence and clinical decision-making and Electronic Health Records and Humans and medical knowledge base and medical reasoning and natural language processing and personalized longitudinal healthcare and unstructured clinical notes",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The availability of CDS to health care professionals has grown in line with the increased prevalence of apps and smart mobile devices. Despite these benefits, patients may have safety concerns about the use of mobile devices around medical equipment. OBJECTIVE: This research explored the engagement of junior doctors (JDs) with CDS and the perceptions of patients about their use. There were three objectives for this research: (1) to measure the actual usage of CDS tools on mobile devices (mCDS) by JDs, (2) to explore the perceptions of JDs about the drivers and barriers to using mCDS, and (3) to explore the perceptions of patients about the use of mCDS. METHODS: This study used a mixed-methods approach to study the engagement of JDs with CDS accessed through mobile devices. Usage data were collected on the number of interactions by JDs with mCDS. The perceived drivers and barriers for JDs to using CDS were then explored by interviews. Finally, these findings were contrasted with the perception of patients about the use of mCDS by JDs. RESULTS: Nine of the 16 JDs made a total of 142 recorded interactions with the mCDS over a 4-month period. Only 27 of the 114 interactions (24%) that could be categorized as on-shift or off-shift occurred on-shift. Eight individual, institutional, and cultural barriers to engagement emerged from interviews with the user group. In contrast to reported cautions and concerns about the impact of clinicians' use of mobile phone on patient health and safety, patients had positive perceptions about the use of mCDS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported positive perceptions toward mCDS. The usage of mCDS to support clinical decision making was considered to be positive as part of everyday clinical practice. The degree of engagement was found to be limited due to a number of individual, institutional, and cultural barriers. The majority of mCDS engagement occurred outside of the workplace.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Codified information and a string-matching algorithm were applied to a RA cohort of 5903 patients from Partners HealthCare to select 1130 patients with potential liver toxicity. Supervised machine learning was applied as our key method. For features, Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) was used to extract standard vocabulary from relevant sections of the unstructured clinical narrative. Temporal features were further extracted to assess the temporal relevance of event mentions with regard to the date of transaminase abnormality. All features were encapsulated in a 3-month-long episode for classification. Results were summarized at patient level in a training set (N=480 patients) and evaluated against a test set (N=120 patients). RESULTS: The system achieved positive predictive value (PPV) 0.756, sensitivity 0.919, F1 score 0.829 on the test set, which was significantly better than the best baseline system (PPV 0.590, sensitivity 0.703, F1 score 0.642).

Bremer_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Predicting Therapy Success and Costs for Personalized Treatment Recommendations Using Baseline Characteristics: Data-Driven Analysis,"Bremer, Vincent and Becker, Dennis and Kolovos, Spyros and Funk, Burkhardt and van Breda, Ward and Hoogendoorn, Mark and Riper, Heleen",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Different treatment alternatives exist for psychological disorders. Both clinical and cost effectiveness of treatment are crucial aspects for policy makers, therapists, and patients and thus play major roles for healthcare decision-making. At the start of an intervention, it is often not clear which specific individuals benefit most from a particular intervention alternative or how costs will be distributed on an individual patient level. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at predicting the individual outcome and costs for patients before the start of an internet-based intervention. Based on these predictions, individualized treatment recommendations can be provided. Thus, we expand the discussion of personalized treatment recommendation. METHODS: Outcomes and costs were predicted based on baseline data of 350 patients from a two-arm randomized controlled trial that compared treatment as usual and blended therapy for depressive disorders. For this purpose, we evaluated various machine learning techniques, compared the predictive accuracy of these techniques, and revealed features that contributed most to the prediction performance. We then combined these predictions and utilized an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in order to derive individual treatment recommendations before the start of treatment. RESULTS: Predicting clinical outcomes and costs is a challenging task that comes with high uncertainty when only utilizing baseline information. However, we were able to generate predictions that were more accurate than a predefined reference measure in the shape of mean outcome and cost values. Questionnaires that include anxiety or depression items and questions regarding the mobility of individuals and their energy levels contributed to the prediction performance. We then described how patients can be individually allocated to the most appropriate treatment type. For an incremental cost-effectiveness threshold of 25,000 <e2><82><ac>/quality-adjusted life year, we demonstrated that our recommendations would have led to slightly worse outcomes (1.98%), but with decreased cost (5.42%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that it was feasible to provide personalized treatment recommendations at baseline and thus allocate patients to the most beneficial treatment type. This could potentially lead to improved decision-making, better outcomes for individuals, and reduced health care costs.",2018,10.2196/10275,20,8,e10275,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*cost effectiveness and *machine learning and *mental health and *treatment recommendation and cost effectiveness and Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods and Female and Health Care Costs/*trends and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*trends and Male and mental health and Surveys and Questionnaires and Treatment Outcome and treatment recommendation,NA,NA,2018/08/21/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Haimson_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Mapping gender transition sentiment patterns via social media data: toward decreasing transgender mental health disparities,"Haimson, Oliver L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Transgender people face substantial mental health disparities, and this population's emotional well-being can be particularly volatile during gender transition. Understanding gender transition sentiment patterns can positively impact transgender people by enabling them to anticipate, and put support in place for, particularly difficult time periods. Yet, tracking sentiment over time throughout gender transition is challenging using traditional research methods. This study's objective was to use social media data to understand average gender transition sentiment patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational sentiment analysis and statistics were used to analyze 41 066 posts from 240 Tumblr transition blogs (online spaces where transgender people document gender transitions) to understand sentiment patterns over time and quantify relationships between transgender identity disclosures, sentiment, and social support. RESULTS: Findings suggest that sentiment increases over time on average throughout gender transition, particularly when people receive supportive responses to transgender identity disclosures. However, after disclosures to family members, people experienced temporary increased negative sentiment, followed by increased positive sentiment in the long term. After transgender identity disclosures on Facebook, an important means of mass disclosure, those with supportive networks experienced increased positive sentiment. CONCLUSIONS: With foreknowledge of sentiment patterns likely to occur during gender transition, transgender people and their mental healthcare professionals can prepare with proper support in place throughout the gender transition process. Social media are a novel data source for understanding transgender people's sentiment patterns, which can help reduce mental health disparities for this marginalized population during a particularly difficult time.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz056,26,8-9,749-758,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*health status disparities and *mental health and *Mental Health and *minority health and *Self Disclosure and *social media and *Social Media and *Social Support and *transgender persons and Blogging and Female and health status disparities and Health Status Disparities and Humans and Machine Learning and Male and mental health and minority health and social media and transgender persons and Transgender Persons/*psychology,NA,NA,2019/08/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kuo_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Fair compute loads enabled by blockchain: sharing models by alternating client and server roles,"Kuo, Tsung-Ting and Gabriel, Rodney A. and Ohno-Machado, Lucila",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Decentralized privacy-preserving predictive modeling enables multiple institutions to learn a more generalizable model on healthcare or genomic data by sharing the partially trained models instead of patient-level data, while avoiding risks such as single point of control. State-of-the-art blockchain-based methods remove the ""server"" role but can be less accurate than models that rely on a server. Therefore, we aim at developing a general model sharing framework to preserve predictive correctness, mitigate the risks of a centralized architecture, and compute the models in a fair way. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a framework that includes both server and ""client"" roles to preserve correctness. We adopt a blockchain network to obtain the benefits of decentralization, by alternating the roles for each site to ensure computational fairness. Also, we developed GloreChain (Grid Binary LOgistic REgression on Permissioned BlockChain) as a concrete example, and compared it to a centralized algorithm on 3 healthcare or genomic datasets to evaluate predictive correctness, number of learning iterations and execution time. RESULTS: GloreChain performs exactly the same as the centralized method in terms of correctness and number of iterations. It inherits the advantages of blockchain, at the cost of increased time to reach a consensus model. DISCUSSION: Our framework is general or flexible and can also address intrinsic challenges of blockchain networks. Further investigations will focus on higher-dimensional datasets, additional use cases, privacy-preserving quality concerns, and ethical, legal, and social implications.

Boyer_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automated Detection of HONcode Website Conformity Compared to Manual Detection: An Evaluation,"Boyer, Celia and Dolamic, Ljiljana",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: To earn HONcode certification, a website must conform to the 8 principles of the HONcode of Conduct In the current manual process of certification, a HONcode expert assesses the candidate website using precise guidelines for each principle. In the scope of the European project KHRESMOI, the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation has developed an automated system to assist in detecting a website's HONcode conformity. Automated assistance in conducting HONcode reviews can expedite the current time-consuming tasks of HONcode certification and ongoing surveillance. Additionally, an automated tool used as a plugin to a general search engine might help to detect health websites that respect HONcode principles but have not yet been certified. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether the automated system is capable of performing as good as human experts for the task of identifying HONcode principles on health websites. METHODS: Using manual evaluation by HONcode senior experts as a baseline, this study compared the capability of the automated HONcode detection system to that of the HONcode senior experts. A set of 27 health-related websites were manually assessed for compliance to each of the 8 HONcode principles by senior HONcode experts. The same set of websites were processed by the automated system for HONcode compliance detection based on supervised machine learning. The results obtained by these two methods were then compared. RESULTS: For the privacy criterion, the automated system obtained the same results as the human expert for 17 of 27 sites (14 true positives and 3 true negatives) without noise (0 false positives). The remaining 10 false negative instances for the privacy criterion represented tolerable behavior because it is important that all automatically detected principle conformities are accurate (ie, specificity [100%] is preferred over sensitivity [58%] for the privacy criterion). In addition, the automated system had precision of at least 75%, with a recall of more than 50% for contact details (100% precision, 69% recall), authority (85% precision, 52% recall), and reference (75% precision, 56% recall). The results also revealed issues for some criteria such as date. Changing the ""document"" definition (ie, using the sentence instead of whole document as a unit of classification) within the automated system resolved some but not all of them. CONCLUSIONS: Study results indicate concordance between automated and expert manual compliance detection for authority, privacy, reference, and contact details. Results also indicate that using the same general parameters for automated detection of each criterion produces suboptimal results. Future work to configure optimal system parameters for each HONcode principle would improve results. The potential utility of integrating automated detection of HONcode conformity into future search engines is also discussed.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3831,17,6,e135,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Automation and *Natural Language Processing and *Privacy and Advertising and artificial intelligence and Certification/*methods and classification and Consumer Health Information/*standards and Disclosure and HONcode and Humans and Internet/*standards and natural language processing and quality standards and Search Engine,NA,NA,2015/06/02/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Second, this paper introduces a machine learning-based analytic pipeline that estimates the amount of hand use using data obtained from the wearable sensors and validates its estimation performance against the aforementioned benchmark measurement. Based on data collected from 18 neurologically intact individuals performing 11 motor tasks resembling various activities of daily living, the analytic results presented herein show that our new benchmark measure is reliable and responsive, and that the proposed wearable system can yield an accurate estimation of the amount of hand use (normalized root mean square error of 0.11 and average Pearson correlation of 0.78).

Jiang_2019_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Correlation-Aware Sparse and Low-Rank Constrained Multi-Task Learning for Longitudinal Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Jiang, Pengbo and Wang, Xuetong and Li, Qiongling and Jin, Leiming and Li, Shuyu",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a severe neurodegenerative disease, is now attracting more and more researchers' attention in the healthcare. With the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the neuroimaging-based longitudinal analysis is gradually becoming an important research direction to understand and trace the process of the AD. In addition, regression analysis has been commonly adopted in the AD pattern analysis and progression prediction. However, most existing methods assume that all input features are equally related to the output variables, which ignore the difference in terms of the correlation. In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-task learning formulation, which considers a correlation-aware sparse and low-rank constrained regularization, for accurately predicting the cognitive scores of the patients at different time points and identifying the most predictive biomarkers. In addition, an efficient iterative algorithm is developed to optimize the proposed non-smooth convex objective formulation. We also have performed experiments using data from the AD neuroimaging initiative dataset to evaluate the proposed optimization formulation. Especially, we will predict cognitive scores of multiple time points through the baseline MRI features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. RESULTS: While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively).

We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. METHODS: We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. RESULTS: The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness.

Miotto_2015_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Case-based reasoning using electronic health records efficiently identifies eligible patients for clinical trials,"Miotto, Riccardo and Weng, Chunhua",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a cost-effective, case-based reasoning framework for clinical research eligibility screening by only reusing the electronic health records (EHRs) of minimal enrolled participants to represent the target patient for each trial under consideration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EHR data--specifically diagnosis, medications, laboratory results, and clinical notes--of known clinical trial participants were aggregated to profile the ""target patient"" for a trial, which was used to discover new eligible patients for that trial. The EHR data of unseen patients were matched to this ""target patient"" to determine their relevance to the trial; the higher the relevance, the more likely the patient was eligible. Relevance scores were a weighted linear combination of cosine similarities computed over individual EHR data types. For evaluation, we identified 262 participants of 13 diversified clinical trials conducted at Columbia University as our gold standard. We ran a 2-fold cross validation with half of the participants used for training and the other half used for testing along with other 30 000 patients selected at random from our clinical database. We performed binary classification and ranking experiments. RESULTS: The overall area under the ROC curve for classification was 0.95, enabling the highlight of eligible patients with good precision. Ranking showed satisfactory results especially at the top of the recommended list, with each trial having at least one eligible patient in the top five positions. CONCLUSIONS: This relevance-based method can potentially be used to identify eligible patients for clinical trials by processing patient EHR data alone without parsing free-text eligibility criteria, and shows promise of efficient ""case-based reasoning"" modeled only on minimal trial participants.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocu050,22,e1,150-e141,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Electronic Health Records and *Eligibility Determination and *Patient Selection and *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence and clinical trials and electronic health records and Humans and information storage and retrieval and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and ROC Curve,NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We searched for English-language literature published between January 2000 and January 2016 using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL. Titles and abstracts of 586 unique citations were screened. Studies were included if they: (1) reported results for an ICU population; (2) evaluated the impact of CPOE or the addition of CDSSs to an existing CPOE system; (3) reported quantitative data on medication errors, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, ICU mortality, and/or hospital mortality; and (4) used a randomized controlled trial or quasi-experimental study design. RESULTS: Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria. The transition from paper-based ordering to commercial CPOE systems in ICUs was associated with an 85% reduction in medication prescribing error rates and a 12% reduction in ICU mortality rates. Overall meta-analyses of LOS and hospital mortality did not demonstrate a significant change. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Critical care settings, both adult and pediatric, involve unique complexities, making them vulnerable to medication errors and adverse patient outcomes. The currently limited evidence base requires research that has sufficient statistical power to identify the true effect of CPOE implementation.

Cukic_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Classification of Depression Through Resting-State Electroencephalogram as a Novel Practice in Psychiatry: Review,"Cukic, Milena and Lopez, Victoria and Pavon, Juan",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning applications in health care have increased considerably in the recent past, and this review focuses on an important application in psychiatry related to the detection of depression. Since the advent of computational psychiatry, research based on functional magnetic resonance imaging has yielded remarkable results, but these tools tend to be too expensive for everyday clinical use. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on an affordable data-driven approach based on electroencephalographic recordings. Web-based applications via public or private cloud-based platforms would be a logical next step. We aim to compare several different approaches to the detection of depression from electroencephalographic recordings using various features and machine learning models. METHODS: To detect depression, we reviewed published detection studies based on resting-state electroencephalogram with final machine learning, and to predict therapy outcomes, we reviewed a set of interventional studies using some form of stimulation in their methodology. RESULTS: We reviewed 14 detection studies and 12 interventional studies published between 2008 and 2019. As direct comparison was not possible due to the large diversity of theoretical approaches and methods used, we compared them based on the steps in analysis and accuracies yielded. In addition, we compared possible drawbacks in terms of sample size, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, internal and external validation, and possible unwarranted optimism and reproducibility. In addition, we suggested desirable practices to avoid misinterpretation of results and optimism. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows the need for larger data sets and more systematic procedures to improve the use of the solution for clinical diagnostics. Therefore, regulation of the pipeline and standard requirements for methodology used should become mandatory to increase the reliability and accuracy of the complete methodology for it to be translated to modern psychiatry.",2020,10.2196/19548,22,11,e19548,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*computational neuroscience and *computational psychiatry and *machine learning and *personalized medicine and *physiological complexity and *resting-state EEG and *theory-driven approach and *unwarranted optimism and computational neuroscience and computational psychiatry and Depression/*classification and Electroencephalography/*methods and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and personalized medicine and physiological complexity and Psychiatry/*standards and Reproducibility of Results and resting-state EEG and theory-driven approach and unwarranted optimism,NA,NA,2020/11/03/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Abd.Alrazaq_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Technical Metrics Used to Evaluate Health Care Chatbots: Scoping Review,"Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa and Safi, Zeineb and Alajlani, Mohannad and Warren, Jim and Househ, Mowafa and Denecke, Kerstin",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Dialog agents (chatbots) have a long history of application in health care, where they have been used for tasks such as supporting patient self-management and providing counseling. Their use is expected to grow with increasing demands on health systems and improving artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Approaches to the evaluation of health care chatbots, however, appear to be diverse and haphazard, resulting in a potential barrier to the advancement of the field. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the technical (nonclinical) metrics used by previous studies to evaluate health care chatbots. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The studies were independently selected by two reviewers who then extracted data from the included studies. Extracted data were synthesized narratively by grouping the identified metrics into categories based on the aspect of chatbots that the metrics evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 1498 citations retrieved, 65 studies were included in this review. Chatbots were evaluated using 27 technical metrics, which were related to chatbots as a whole (eg, usability, classifier performance, speed), response generation (eg, comprehensibility, realism, repetitiveness), response understanding (eg, chatbot understanding as assessed by users, word error rate, concept error rate), and esthetics (eg, appearance of the virtual agent, background color, and content). CONCLUSIONS: The technical metrics of health chatbot studies were diverse, with survey designs and global usability metrics dominating. The lack of standardization and paucity of objective measures make it difficult to compare the performance of health chatbots and could inhibit advancement of the field. We suggest that researchers more frequently include metrics computed from conversation logs. In addition, we recommend the development of a framework of technical metrics with recommendations for specific circumstances for their inclusion in chatbot studies.",2020,10.2196/18301,22,6,e18301,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*chatbots and *conversational agents and *evaluation and *health care and *metrics and Artificial Intelligence/*standards and chatbots and Communication and conversational agents and Delivery of Health Care/*standards and evaluation and health care and Humans and metrics,NA,NA,2020/06/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We developed new tools that provide objective physiological and behavioral measures using wearable sensors and mobile phones, together with methods that improve their data integrity. The aim of this study was to examine, using machine learning, how accurately these measures could identify conditions of self-reported high stress and poor mental health and which of the underlying modalities and measures were most accurate in identifying those conditions. METHODS: We designed and conducted the 1-month SNAPSHOT study that investigated how daily behaviors and social networks influence self-reported stress, mood, and other health or well-being-related factors. We collected over 145,000 hours of data from 201 college students (age: 18-25 years, male:female=1.8:1) at one university, all recruited within self-identified social groups. Each student filled out standardized pre- and postquestionnaires on stress and mental health; during the month, each student completed twice-daily electronic diaries (e-diaries), wore two wrist-based sensors that recorded continuous physical activity and autonomic physiology, and installed an app on their mobile phone that recorded phone usage and geolocation patterns. We developed tools to make data collection more efficient, including data-check systems for sensor and mobile phone data and an e-diary administrative module for study investigators to locate possible errors in the e-diaries and communicate with participants to correct their entries promptly, which reduced the time taken to clean e-diary data by 69%. We constructed features and applied machine learning to the multimodal data to identify factors associated with self-reported poststudy stress and mental health, including behaviors that can be possibly modified by the individual to improve these measures. RESULTS: We identified the physiological sensor, phone, mobility, and modifiable behavior features that were best predictors for stress and mental health classification. In general, wearable sensor features showed better classification performance than mobile phone or modifiable behavior features. Wearable sensor features, including skin conductance and temperature, reached 78.3% (148/189) accuracy for classifying students into high or low stress groups and 87% (41/47) accuracy for classifying high or low mental health groups. Modifiable behavior features, including number of naps, studying duration, calls, mobility patterns, and phone-screen-on time, reached 73.5% (139/189) accuracy for stress classification and 79% (37/47) accuracy for mental health classification. CONCLUSIONS: New semiautomated tools improved the efficiency of long-term ambulatory data collection from wearable and mobile devices.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate methods to estimate the understandability of health Web pages and use these to improve the retrieval of information for people seeking health advice on the Web. METHODS: Our investigation considered methods to automatically estimate the understandability of health information in Web pages, and it provided a thorough evaluation of these methods using human assessments as well as an analysis of preprocessing factors affecting understandability estimations and associated pitfalls. Furthermore, lessons learned for estimating Web page understandability were applied to the construction of retrieval methods, with specific attention to retrieving information understandable by the general public. RESULTS: We found that machine learning techniques were more suitable to estimate health Web page understandability than traditional readability formulae, which are often used as guidelines and benchmark by health information providers on the Web (larger difference found for Pearson correlation of .602 using gradient boosting regressor compared with .438 using Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index with the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum eHealth 2015 collection).

METHODS: The forecast model was derived using a 13-month retrospective cohort of 6384 catheterization patients. Predictor variables such as demographics, scheduled procedures, and clinical indicators mined from free-text notes were input to a multivariable logistic regression model that predicted the probability of inpatient admission. The model was embedded into a web-based application connected to the local EMR system and used to support bed management decisions. After implementation, the tool was prospectively evaluated for accuracy on a 13-month test cohort of 7029 catheterization patients. RESULTS: The forecast model predicted admission with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.722. Daily aggregate forecasts were accurate to within one bed for 70.3% of days and within three beds for 97.5% of days during the prospective evaluation period. The web-based application housing the forecast model was used by cardiology providers in practice to estimate daily admissions from the catheterization laboratory. DISCUSSION: The forecast model identified older age, male gender, invasive procedures, coronary artery bypass grafts, and a history of congestive heart failure as qualities indicating a patient was at increased risk for admission. Diagnostic procedures and less acute clinical indicators decreased patients' risk of admission. Despite the site-specific limitations of the model, these findings were supported by the literature.

Besides yielding a high return on investment from forestalling surgeries using a low-cost intervention at a young age, it improves school performance and thus boosts future labor force quality. Leveraging low-skilled health care workers with smartphones and automated diagnosis to offer such programs can be a scalable model in resource-limited areas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an effective, efficient, and comprehensive vision screening solution for school children in resource-limited areas. First, such an exam would need to cover the major risk factors of amblyopia and myopia, 2 major sources of vision impairment effectively preventable at a young age. Second, the solution must be integrated with digital patient record-keeping for long-term monitoring and popular statistical analysis. Last, it should utilize low-skilled technicians and only low-cost tools that are available in a typical school in developing regions, without compromising quality or efficiency. METHODS: A workflow for the screening program was designed and a smartphone app was developed to implement it. In the standardized screening procedure, a young child went through the smartphone-based photoscreening in a dark room. The child held a smartphone in front of their forehead, displaying pre-entered personal information as a quick response code that duplexed as a reference of scale. In one 10-second procedure, the child's personal information and interpupillary distance, relative visual axis alignment, and refractive error ranges were measured and analyzed automatically using image processing and artificial intelligence algorithms. The child's risk for strabismus, myopia, and anisometropia was then derived and consultation given. RESULTS: A preliminary evaluation of the solution was conducted alongside yearly physical exams in Luoyang, Henan, People's Republic of China. It covered 20 students with suspected strabismus and 80 randomly selected students, aged evenly between 8 and 10. Each examinee took about 1 minute, and a streamlined workflow allowed 3 exams to run in parallel. The 1-shot and 2-shot measurement success rates were 87% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of strabismus detection were 0.80 and 0.98, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of myopia detection were 0.83 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of anisometropia detection were 0.80 and 1.00, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed vision screening program is effective, efficient, and scalable.

Wang_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Analyzing and Predicting User Participations in Online Health Communities: A Social Support Perspective,"Wang, Xi and Zhao, Kang and Street, Nick",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Online health communities (OHCs) have become a major source of social support for people with health problems. Members of OHCs interact online with similar peers to seek, receive, and provide different types of social support, such as informational support, emotional support, and companionship. As active participations in an OHC are beneficial to both the OHC and its users, it is important to understand factors related to users' participations and predict user churn for user retention efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze OHC users' Web-based interactions, reveal which types of social support activities are related to users' participation, and predict whether and when a user will churn from the OHC. METHODS: We collected a large-scale dataset from a popular OHC for cancer survivors. We used text mining techniques to decide what kinds of social support each post contained. We illustrated how we built text classifiers for 5 different social support categories: seeking informational support (SIS), providing informational support (PIS), seeking emotional support (SES), providing emotional support (PES), and companionship (COM). We conducted survival analysis to identify types of social support related to users' continued participation. Using supervised machine learning methods, we developed a predictive model for user churn. RESULTS: Users' behaviors to PIS, SES, and COM had hazard ratios significantly lower than 1 (0.948, 0.972, and 0.919, respectively) and were indicative of continued participations in the OHC. The churn prediction model based on social support activities offers accurate predictions on whether and when a user will leave the OHC. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting different types of social support activities via text mining contributes to better understanding and prediction of users' participations in an OHC.

Fernandes_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence Technologies for Coping with Alarm Fatigue in Hospital Environments Because of Sensory Overload: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Fernandes, Chrystinne Oliveira and Miles, Simon and Lucena, Carlos Jose Pereira De and Cowan, Donald",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Informed estimates claim that 80% to 99% of alarms set off in hospital units are false or clinically insignificant, representing a cacophony of sounds that do not present a real danger to patients. These false alarms can lead to an alert overload that causes a health care provider to miss important events that could be harmful or even life-threatening. As health care units become more dependent on monitoring devices for patient care purposes, the alarm fatigue issue has to be addressed as a major concern for the health care team as well as to enhance patient safety. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this paper was to propose a feasible solution for the alarm fatigue problem by using an automatic reasoning mechanism to decide how to notify members of the health care team. The aim was to reduce the number of notifications sent by determining whether or not to group a set of alarms that occur over a short period of time to deliver them together, without compromising patient safety. METHODS: This paper describes: (1) a model for supporting reasoning algorithms that decide how to notify caregivers to avoid alarm fatigue; (2) an architecture for health systems that support patient monitoring and notification capabilities; and (3) a reasoning algorithm that specifies how to notify caregivers by deciding whether to aggregate a group of alarms to avoid alarm fatigue. RESULTS: Experiments were used to demonstrate that providing a reasoning system can reduce the notifications received by the caregivers by up to 99.3% (582/586) of the total alarms generated. Our experiments were evaluated through the use of a dataset comprising patient monitoring data and vital signs recorded during 32 surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. We present the results of our algorithm by using graphs we generated using the R language, where we show whether the algorithm decided to deliver an alarm immediately or after a delay. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results strongly suggest that this reasoning algorithm is a useful strategy for avoiding alarm fatigue. Although we evaluated our algorithm in an experimental environment, we tried to reproduce the context of a clinical environment by using real-world patient data. Our future work is to reproduce the evaluation study based on more realistic clinical conditions by increasing the number of patients, monitoring parameters, and types of alarm.",2019,10.2196/15406,21,11,e15406,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*alert fatigue health personnel and *alert systems and *artificial intelligence and *health information systems and *patient monitoring and Adaptation, Psychological/*physiology and alert fatigue health personnel and alert systems and Algorithms and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*statistics & numerical data and Clinical Alarms and Fatigue/*therapy and health information systems and Humans and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods and patient monitoring and Reproducibility of Results",NA,NA,2019/11/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

To facilitate secondary use of these data, there is an urgent need to develop novel algorithms and informatics approaches using new cloud computing technologies as well as ontologies for collaborative multicenter studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the Cloudwave platform, which (a) defines parallelized algorithms for computing cardiac measures using the MapReduce parallel programming framework, (b) supports real-time interaction with large volumes of electrophysiological signals, and (c) features signal visualization and querying functionalities using an ontology-driven web-based interface. Cloudwave is currently used in the multicenter National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS)-funded Prevention and Risk Identification of SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) Mortality (PRISM) project to identify risk factors for sudden death in epilepsy. RESULTS: Comparative evaluations of Cloudwave with traditional desktop approaches to compute cardiac measures (eg, QRS complexes, RR intervals, and instantaneous heart rate) on epilepsy patient data show one order of magnitude improvement for single-channel ECG data and 20 times improvement for four-channel ECG data.

The latter replaces detected personally identifiable information (PII) with random surrogates, allowing leaked PII to blend in or ""hide in plain sight."" We evaluated the extent to which a malicious attacker could expose leaked PII in such a corpus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We modeled a scenario where an institution (the defender) externally shared an 800-note corpus of actual outpatient clinical encounter notes from a large, integrated health care delivery system in Washington State. These notes were deidentified by a machine-learned PII tagger and HIPS resynthesis. A malicious attacker obtained and performed a parrot attack intending to expose leaked PII in this corpus. Specifically, the attacker mimicked the defender's process by manually annotating all PII-like content in half of the released corpus, training a PII tagger on these data, and using the trained model to tag the remaining encounter notes. The attacker hypothesized that untagged identifiers would be leaked PII, discoverable by manual review. We evaluated the attacker's success using measures of leak-detection rate and accuracy. RESULTS: The attacker correctly hypothesized that 211 (68%) of 310 actual PII leaks in the corpus were leaks, and wrongly hypothesized that 191 resynthesized PII instances were also leaks. One-third of actual leaks remained undetected.

Niburski_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Impact of Trump's Promotion of Unproven COVID-19 Treatments and Subsequent Internet Trends: Observational Study,"Niburski, Kacper and Niburski, Oskar",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with large followings can influence public opinions and behaviors, especially during a pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic, US president Donald J Trump has endorsed the use of unproven therapies. Subsequently, a death attributed to the wrongful ingestion of a chloroquine-containing compound occurred. OBJECTIVE: We investigated Donald J Trump's speeches and Twitter posts, as well as Google searches and Amazon purchases, and television airtime for mentions of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir. METHODS: Twitter sourcing was catalogued with Factba.se, and analytics data, both past and present, were analyzed with Tweet Binder to assess average analytics data on key metrics. Donald J Trump's time spent discussing unverified treatments on the United States' 5 largest TV stations was catalogued with the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, and his speech transcripts were obtained from White House briefings. Google searches and shopping trends were analyzed with Google Trends. Amazon purchases were assessed using Helium 10 software. RESULTS: From March 1 to April 30, 2020, Donald J Trump made 11 tweets about unproven therapies and mentioned these therapies 65 times in White House briefings, especially touting hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These tweets had an impression reach of 300% above Donald J Trump's average. Following these tweets, at least 2% of airtime on conservative networks for treatment modalities like azithromycin and continuous mentions of such treatments were observed on stations like Fox News. Google searches and purchases increased following his first press conference on March 19, 2020, and increased again following his tweets on March 21, 2020. The same is true for medications on Amazon, with purchases for medicine substitutes, such as hydroxychloroquine, increasing by 200%. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in positions of power can sway public purchasing, resulting in undesired effects when the individuals' claims are unverified.

Kendra_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Characterizing the Discussion of Antibiotics in the Twittersphere: What is the Bigger Picture?,"Kendra, Rachel Lynn and Karki, Suman and Eickholt, Jesse Lee and Gandy, Lisa",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: User content posted through Twitter has been used for biosurveillance, to characterize public perception of health-related topics, and as a means of distributing information to the general public. Most of the existing work surrounding Twitter and health care has shown Twitter to be an effective medium for these problems but more could be done to provide finer and more efficient access to all pertinent data. Given the diversity of user-generated content, small samples or summary presentations of the data arguably omit a large part of the virtual discussion taking place in the Twittersphere. Still, managing, processing, and querying large amounts of Twitter data is not a trivial task. This work describes tools and techniques capable of handling larger sets of Twitter data and demonstrates their use with the issue of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: This work has two principle objectives: (1) to provide an open-source means to efficiently explore all collected tweets and query health-related topics on Twitter, specifically, questions such as what users are saying and how messages are spread, and (2) to characterize the larger discourse taking place on Twitter with respect to antibiotics. METHODS: Open-source software suites Hadoop, Flume, and Hive were used to collect and query a large number of Twitter posts. To classify tweets by topic, a deep network classifier was trained using a limited number of manually classified tweets. The particular machine learning approach used also allowed the use of a large number of unclassified tweets to increase performance. RESULTS: Query-based analysis of the collected tweets revealed that a large number of users contributed to the online discussion and that a frequent topic mentioned was resistance. A number of prominent events related to antibiotics led to a number of spikes in activity but these were short in duration. The category-based classifier developed was able to correctly classify 70% of manually labeled tweets (using a 10-fold cross validation procedure and 9 classes). The classifier also performed well when evaluated on a per category basis. CONCLUSIONS: Using existing tools such as Hive, Flume, Hadoop, and machine learning techniques, it is possible to construct tools and workflows to collect and query large amounts of Twitter data to characterize the larger discussion taking place on Twitter with respect to a particular health-related topic. Furthermore, using newer machine learning techniques and a limited number of manually labeled tweets, an entire body of collected tweets can be classified to indicate what topics are driving the virtual, online discussion. The resulting classifier can also be used to efficiently explore collected tweets by category and search for messages of interest or exemplary content.",2015,10.2196/jmir.4220,17,6,e154,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Anti-Bacterial Agents and *Drug Resistance, Microbial and *Internet and *Public Opinion and *Social Media and Attitude to Health and Humans and Information Dissemination and Internet and Machine Learning and neural network and semi-supervised learning and social media and Software and Twitter messaging and Web mining",NA,NA,2015/06/19/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

The symptoms often reduce the patient's quality of life. The TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) mobile health (mHealth) crowdsensing platform was developed for two operating systems (OS)-Android and iOS-to help patients demystify the daily moment-to-moment variations of their tinnitus symptoms. In all platforms developed for more than one OS, it is important to investigate whether the crowdsensed data predicts the OS that was used in order to understand the degree to which the OS is a confounder that is necessary to consider. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored whether the mobile OS-Android and iOS-used during user assessments can be predicted by the dynamic daily-life TYT data. METHODS: TYT mainly applies the paradigms ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and mobile crowdsensing to collect dynamic EMA (EMA-D) daily-life data. The dynamic daily-life TYT data that were analyzed included eight questions as part of the EMA-D questionnaire. In this study, 518 TYT users were analyzed, who each completed at least 11 EMA-D questionnaires. Out of these, 221 were iOS users and 297 were Android users. The iOS users completed, in total, 14,708 EMA-D questionnaires; the number of EMA-D questionnaires completed by the Android users was randomly reduced to the same number to properly address the research question of the study. Machine learning methods-a feedforward neural network, a decision tree, a random forest classifier, and a support vector machine-were applied to address the research question. RESULTS: Machine learning was able to predict the mobile OS used with an accuracy up to 78.94% based on the provided EMA-D questionnaires on the assessment level. In this context, the daily measurements regarding how users concentrate on the actual activity were particularly suitable for the prediction of the mobile OS used. CONCLUSIONS: In the work at hand, two particular aspects have been revealed. First, machine learning can contribute to EMA-D data in the medical context. Second, based on the EMA-D data of TYT, we found that the accuracy in predicting the mobile OS used has several implications. Particularly, in clinical studies using mobile devices, the OS should be assessed as a covariate, as it might be a confounder.",2020,10.2196/15547,22,6,e15547,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*crowdsensing and *ecological momentary assessment and *machine learning and *mHealth and *mobile operating system differences and *mobile phone and *tinnitus and crowdsensing and Crowdsourcing/*methods and ecological momentary assessment and Female and Humans and Longitudinal Studies and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and mHealth and mobile operating system differences and mobile phone and Quality of Life/*psychology and Surveys and Questionnaires and Telemedicine/*methods and tinnitus and Tinnitus/*epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/06/30/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been demonstrated in earlier work that commercially available spirometers are not fully able to assure the quality of individual spirometry manoeuvres.

In this paper, we propose a method to select and optimise a classifier using supervised learning techniques by learning from previously classified forced spirometry tests from a group of experts. Such a method is able to take into account the shape of the curve as an expert would during visual inspection. We evaluated the final classifier on a dataset put aside for evaluation yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and specificities of 0.91 and 0.86 for sensitivities of 0.60 and 0.82. Furthermore, other specificities and sensitivities along the receiver operating characteristic curve were close to the level of the experts when compared against each-other, and better than an earlier rules-based method assessed on the same dataset.

We, therefore, developed a mini-program within the app WeChat. This analyzes data from all users and traces close contacts of all patients. This permits early tracing and quarantine of potential sources of infection. Data from the mini-program can also be merged with other data to predict epidemic trends, calculate individual and population risks, and provide recommendations for individual and population protection action.

Researchers have yet to fully realize the potential of the large amount of data generated by these technology-based programs. Of particular interest is the ability to predict who will drop out of an intervention. This may be possible through the analysis of user journey data-self-reported as well as system-generated data-produced by the path (or journey) an individual takes to navigate through a digital health intervention. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to provide a step-by-step process for the analysis of user journey data and eventually to predict dropout in the context of digital health interventions. The process is applied to data from an internet-based intervention for insomnia as a way to illustrate its use. The completion of the program is contingent upon completing 7 sequential cores, which include an initial tutorial core. Dropout is defined as not completing the seventh core. METHODS: Steps of user journey analysis, including data transformation, feature engineering, and statistical model analysis and evaluation, are presented. Dropouts were predicted based on data from 151 participants from a fully automated web-based program (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet) that delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees were used and evaluated based on their predictive performance. Relevant features from the data are reported that predict user dropout. RESULTS: Accuracy of predicting dropout (area under the curve [AUC] values) varied depending on the program core and the machine learning technique. After model evaluation, boosted decision trees achieved AUC values ranging between 0.6 and 0.9. Additional handcrafted features, including time to complete certain steps of the intervention, time to get out of bed, and days since the last interaction with the system, contributed to the prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the feasibility and potential of analyzing user journey data to predict dropout. Theory-driven handcrafted features increased the prediction performance. The ability to predict dropout at an individual level could be used to enhance decision making for researchers and clinicians as well as inform dynamic intervention regimens.",2020,10.2196/17738,22,10,e17738,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*digital health and *dropout and *machine learning and Adult and Aged and digital health and dropout and Female and Humans and Internet-Based Intervention/*trends and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications/*standards and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/10/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In parallel, we retrospectively extracted demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical predictors from multiple sources to represent the patients' profiles. Leveraging machine learning methodology, the automated algorithms predicted participation response for individual patients and identified influential features associated with their decision-making. The performance was validated on the collection of actual patient response, where precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve were assessed. RESULTS: Compared to the random response predictor that simulated the current practice, the machine learning algorithms achieved significantly better performance (Precision/Recall/F-measure/area under the ROC curve: 70.82%/92.02%/80.04%/72.78% on 10-fold cross validation and 71.52%/92.68%/80.74%/75.74% on the test set).

Feedback from wearables such as activity trackers has the potential to encourage daily physical activity. To date, little research is available on the natural development of adherence to activity trackers or on potential factors that predict which users manage to keep using their activity tracker during the first year (and thereby increasing the chance of healthy behavior change) and which users discontinue using their trackers after a short time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the determinants for sustained use in the first year after purchase. Specifically, we look at the relative importance of demographic and socioeconomic, psychological, health-related, goal-related, technological, user experience-related, and social predictors of feedback device use. Furthermore, this study tests the effect of these predictors on physical activity. METHODS: A total of 711 participants from four urban areas in France received an activity tracker (Fitbit Zip) and gave permission to use their logged data. Participants filled out three Web-based questionnaires: at start, after 98 days, and after 232 days to measure the aforementioned determinants. Furthermore, for each participant, we collected activity data tracked by their Fitbit tracker for 320 days. We determined the relative importance of all included predictors by using Random Forest, a machine learning analysis technique. RESULTS: The data showed a slow exponential decay in Fitbit use, with 73.9% (526/711) of participants still tracking after 100 days and 16.0% (114/711) of participants tracking after 320 days. On average, participants used the tracker for 129 days. Most important reasons to quit tracking were technical issues such as empty batteries and broken trackers or lost trackers (21.5% of all Q3 respondents, 130/601). Random Forest analysis of predictors revealed that the most influential determinants were age, user experience-related factors, mobile phone type, household type, perceived effect of the Fitbit tracker, and goal-related factors. We explore the role of those predictors that show meaningful differences in the number of days the tracker was worn. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers an overview of the natural development of the use of an activity tracker, as well as the relative importance of a range of determinants from literature. Decay is exponential but slower than may be expected from existing literature. Many factors have a small contribution to sustained use. The most important determinants are technical condition, age, user experience, and goal-related factors. This finding suggests that activity tracking is potentially beneficial for a broad range of target groups, but more attention should be paid to technical and user experience-related aspects of activity trackers.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7311,5,10,e164,eng,2291-5222,habits and machine learning and mHealth and mobile health and physical activity,NA,NA,2017/10/30/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

A.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Machine learning (ML) diagnostic tools have significant potential to improve health care. However, methodological pitfalls may affect diagnostic test accuracy studies used to appraise such tools. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and reporting of design characteristics within the literature. Further, we sought to empirically assess whether design features may be associated with different estimates of diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically retrieved 2 * 2 tables (n = 281) describing the performance of ML diagnostic tools, derived from 114 publications in 38 meta-analyses, from PubMed. Data extracted included test performance, sample sizes, and design features. A mixed-effects metaregression was run to quantify the association between design features and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Participant ethnicity and blinding in test interpretation was unreported in 90% and 60% of studies, respectively. Reporting was occasionally lacking for rudimentary characteristics such as study design (28% unreported). Internal validation without appropriate safeguards was used in 44% of studies. Several design features were associated with larger estimates of accuracy, including having unreported (relative diagnostic odds ratio [RDOR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-3.1) or case-control study designs (RDOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.66), and recruiting participants for the index test (RDOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.08-2.59).

Fossa_2018_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,OpenNotes and shared decision making: a growing practice in clinical transparency and how it can support patient-centered care,"Fossa, Alan J. and Bell, Sigall K. and DesRoches, Catherine",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Prior studies suggest inviting patients to read their visit notes (OpenNotes) has important benefits for patient engagement. We utilized survey data to investigate our hypothesis that patients who read more notes would report greater shared decision making (SDM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our survey focused on the safety and quality implications of OpenNotes. 24 722 patients at an urban healthcare organization were invited to complete the survey, which included an item assessing the number of notes read and the CollaboRATE scale to measure SDM. We used log-binomial regression to estimate the relative probability of top CollaboRATE scores across number of notes read while controlling for several covariates. RESULTS: 6913 patients responded (28% response rate). Patients reading 4+ clinical notes in the past 12 months were 17% more likely to have top CollaboRATE scores when compared to patients who had not read a note in the previous 12 months (RR: 1.17, 95%CI: 1.04-1.32). DISCUSSION: There is a clear relationship between what SDM requires and the transparency OpenNotes provides. Access to clinicians' notes can support the SDM model, which relies on efficient information exchange between clinicians and well-informed patients. CONCLUSION: Our study showed evidence of a relationship between note reading and perceived SDM. Implementation of SDM is likely to expand, given its association with improved patient satisfaction, adherence, and medical decision making. Findings from this study highlight OpenNotes as a policy that institutions can implement as a facilitator of SDM and a manifestation of their commitment to patient autonomy and transparency.",2018,10.1093/jamia/ocy083,25,9,1153-1159,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Making, Shared and *Electronic Health Records and *Patient-Centered Care and Academic Medical Centers and Adult and Age Factors and Boston and Cross-Sectional Studies and Educational Status and Humans and Middle Aged and Patient Portals",NA,NA,2018/09/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Otte_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Tracker-Based Personal Advice to Support the Baby's Healthy Development in a Novel Parenting App: Data-Driven Innovation,"Otte, Renee A. and van Beukering, Alice J. E. and Boelens-Brockhuis, Lili-Marjan",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: The current generation of millennial parents prefers digital communications and makes use of apps on a daily basis to find information about child-rearing topics. Given this, an increasing amount of parenting apps have become available. These apps also allow parents to track their baby's development with increasing completeness and precision. The large amounts of data collected in this process provide ample opportunity for data-driven innovation (DDI). Subsequently, apps are increasingly personalized by offering information that is based on the data tracked in the app. In line with this, Philips Avent has developed the uGrow app, a medical-grade app dedicated to new parents for tracking their baby's development. Through so-called insights, the uGrow app seeks to provide a data-driven solution by offering parents personal advice that is sourced from user-tracked behavioral and contextual data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold. First, it aimed to give a description of the development process of the insights for the uGrow app. Second, it aimed to present results from a study about parents' experiences with the insights. METHODS: The development process comprised 3 phases: a formative phase, development phase, and summative phase. In the formative phase, 3 substudies were executed in series to understand and identify parents' and health care professionals' (HCPs) needs for insights, using qualitative and quantitative methods. After the formative phase, insights were created during the development phase. Subsequently, in the summative phase, these insights were validated against parents' experience using a quantitative approach. RESULTS: As part of the formative phase, parents indicated having a need for smart information based on a data analysis of the data they track in an app. HCPs supported the general concept of insights for the uGrow app, although specific types of insights were considered irrelevant or even risky. After implementing a preliminary set of insights in a prototype version of the uGrow app and testing it with parents, the majority of parents (87%) reported being satisfied with the insights. From these outcomes, a total of 89 insights were implemented in a final version of the uGrow app. In the summative phase, the majority of parents reported experiencing these insights as reassuring and useful (94%), as adding enjoyment (85%), and as motivating for continuing tracking for a longer period of time (77%). CONCLUSIONS: Parents experienced the insights in the uGrow app as useful and reassuring and as adding enjoyment to their use of the uGrow app and tracking their baby's development. The insights development process we followed showed how the quality of insights can be guaranteed by ensuring that insights are relevant, appropriate, and evidence based. In this way, insights are an example of meaningful DDI.",2019,10.2196/12666,7,7,e12666,eng,2291-5222,"*data analytics and *data-driven science and *infant development and *infant health and *mHealth and *mobile apps and *parenting and Adult and Child Development/*physiology and Child Rearing and data analytics and Data Science/*instrumentation and data-driven science and Female and Health Personnel/education and Health Promotion/methods and Humans and infant development and infant health and Infant Health/*statistics & numerical data and Infant, Newborn and Male and mHealth and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data/supply & distribution and mobile apps and parenting and Parenting/*trends and Parents/education/psychology and Software Design",NA,NA,2019/07/24/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

As it is a known fact that they wish to remain in their own home for as long as possible, solutions must be designed to detect these diseases automatically, limiting the reliance on human resources. To this end, our team developed a sensors platform based on infrared proximity sensors to accurately recognize basic bathroom activities such as going to the toilet and showering. This article is based on the body of scientific literature which establish evidences that activities relative to corporal hygiene are strongly correlated to health status and can be important signs of the development of eventual disorders.

Vorakulpipat_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,A Mobile-Based Patient-Centric Passive System for Guiding Patients Through the Hospital Workflow: Design and Development,"Vorakulpipat, Chalee and Rattanalerdnusorn, Ekkachan and Sirapaisan, Soontorn and Savangsuk, Visut and Kasisopha, Natsuda",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: A hospital is an unfamiliar place to patients because of its style, atmosphere, and procedures. These hospital characteristics cause patients to become confused about responding to protocols, which slows down the procedural flows. Some additional information technology infrastructure facilities and human resources may be needed to solve these problems. However, this solution needs high investment and cannot guarantee an accuracy of information sent to patients. To handle this limitation, EasyHos has been developed to help patients recognize their status (for example, ""waiting for an appointment at 11am"") during their stay in a hospital using all existing infrastructure and hospital data and without changing existing hospital's process. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a design of the EasyHos system and the case study in hospitals in Thailand. The design is usable and repeatable for small- and medium-sized hospitals where internet infrastructure is in place. METHODS: The EasyHos system has been designed based on existing infrastructure, hospital data and hospital processes. The main components include mobile devices, existing hospital data, wireless communication network. The EasyHos was deployed at 2 hospitals in Thailand, one small and the other with a medium size. The experimental process was focused on solving the problem of unfamiliarity in the hospital. The criteria and pretest conditions regarding the unexpected problem have been defined before the experiment. RESULTS: The results are presented in terms of criteria, pretest conditions, posttest conditions in the hospitals. The posttest conditions show the experimental results and impact of the system on users such as hospital nurses/staff and patients. For example, the questions from patients were reduced by 83.3% after using EasyHos system while nurses/hospital staff had 5 min more to do their routine work each day. In addition, another impact is that hospitals can create new information values from existing data, which now can be visible and valuable to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals' unexpected problems have been reduced by the EasyHos system. The EasyHos system has been developed with self-service and patient-centered concepts to assist patients with necessary information. The system makes interaction easier for nurses/hospital staff members and patients working or waiting in the hospital. The nurses/hospital staff members would have more time to do their routine works. Hospitals can easily set up the EasyHos system, which will have a low or nearly zero implementation cost.",2019,10.2196/14779,7,7,e14779,eng,2291-5222,"*data analytics and *health care informatics and *mhealth and *mobile computing and *user-centered design and Access to Information and Cell Phone/instrumentation and Communication and data analytics and Data Science/*instrumentation and Environment Design/trends and health care informatics and Health Facilities/*standards/trends and Hospitals/*standards and Humans and Industrial Development/trends and Information Technology/*standards and Internet Access and mhealth and mobile computing and Nursing Staff, Hospital/statistics & numerical data and Software Design and Telemedicine/methods and Thailand/epidemiology and user-centered design and Workflow",NA,NA,2019/07/22/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

PERSPeCT uses the collective intelligence of users (ie, preferences and feedback) and demographic and smoking profiles to select motivating messages. PERSPeCT may be more beneficial for tailoring content to minority groups influenced by complex, personally relevant factors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe and evaluate the use of PERSPeCT in African American people who smoke compared with white people who smoke. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared African American people who smoke with a historical cohort of white people who smoke, who both received up to 30 emailed tailored messages over 65 days. People who smoke rated the daily message in terms of perceived influence on quitting smoking for 30 days. Our primary analysis compared daily message ratings between the two groups using a t test. We used a logistic model to compare 30-day cessation between the two groups and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: The study included 119 people who smoke (African Americans, 55/119; whites, 64/119). At baseline, African American people who smoke were significantly more likely to report allowing smoking in the home (P=.002); all other characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Daily mean ratings were higher for African American than white people who smoke on 26 of the 30 days (P<.001). Odds of quitting as measured by 30-day cessation were significantly higher for African Americans (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.04-5.53; P=.03) and did not change after adjusting for allowing smoking at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted the potential of using a recommender system to personalize for African American people who smoke.

Previously developed ambulatory sleep detection methods rely either in whole or in part on self-reported diary data as ground truth, which is a problem, since people often do not fill them out accurately. This paper presents an algorithm that uses multimodal data from smartphones and wearable technologies to detect sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset using a type of recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory (LSTM) cells for synthesizing temporal information. We collected 5580 days of multimodal data from 186 participants and compared the new method for sleep/wake classification and sleep onset/offset detection to, first, nontemporal machine learning methods and, second, a state-of-the-art actigraphy software. The new LSTM method achieved a sleep/wake classification accuracy of 96.5%, and sleep onset/offset detection F(1) scores of 0.86 and 0.84, respectively, with mean absolute errors of 5.0 and 5.5 min, res-pectively, when compared with sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries.

We sought to evaluate the capacity for clinical, socioeconomic, and public health data sources to predict the need for various social service referrals among patients at a safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated patient clinical data and community-level data representing patients' social determinants of health (SDH) obtained from multiple sources to build random forest decision models to predict the need for any, mental health, dietitian, social work, or other SDH service referrals. To assess the impact of SDH on improving performance, we built separate decision models using clinical and SDH determinants and clinical data only. RESULTS: Decision models predicting the need for any, mental health, and dietitian referrals yielded sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures ranging between 60% and 75%. Specificity and accuracy scores for social work and other SDH services ranged between 67% and 77%, while sensitivity scores were between 50% and 63%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for the decision models ranged between 70% and 78%. Models for predicting the need for any services reported positive predictive values between 65% and 73%. Positive predictive values for predicting individual outcomes were below 40%.

To date, little information is available on the effect of individual differences in utilizing medical help-seeking strategies on their medical decisions during the perinatal period. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (1) to determine associations among perinatal women's medical help-seeking strategies, changes in medical decision making, and online health information utilization with a focus on the mediating effect of self-efficacy in perinatal health literacy on the intent to consult health professionals, and (2) to clarify these associations in perinatal women with two different medical problems: obstetric and mental health. METHODS: A total of 164 perinatal women aged 24 to 47 years (mean 34.64, SD 3.80) repeatedly completed the Problem Solving in Medicine and Online Health Information Utilization questionnaires to examine the moderating effect of two types of medical problems on their decision-making processes. To validate the hypothesized relationships in the proposed conceptual model encompassing obstetric and mental health problem-solving models, path analyses were performed. RESULTS: This study found that some perinatal women, who use an online informal medical help-seeking (OIMH) strategy, would be more likely to change their medical decisions based only on internet-based information without consulting health professionals (P<.001), compared to other women using different medical help-seeking strategies. Particularly, this concern is significantly prevalent when encountering obstetric problems during the perinatal period (obstetric problem-solving: P<.001; mental health problem-solving: P=.02). Furthermore, perinatal women with mental health issues using the OIMH strategy showed a significant difference in intent to consult health professionals based on online health information when the medical problem they had to solve was different (obstetric problem-solving: P=.94; mental health problem-solving: P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive mediating effects of perinatal women's enhanced health literacy on the intent to discuss personal medical issues with health professionals based on online health information, the strategy used is of fundamental importance for understanding their help-seeking and decision-making processes during the perinatal period. Beyond a short consultation to steer patients quickly and authoritatively towards an obstetric doctor's choice of action, it is recommended in this study that obstetricians attempt to provide their patients with needed context for the information found online.

Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices. METHODS: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care-related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R(2)=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P<.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=-.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=-.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. CONCLUSIONS: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds competitive, investigator-initiated grant applications. Funded grants represent the state of the science and therefore are expected to anticipate the progression of research in the near future. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the kinds of smartphone-based intervention apps funded in NIH research grants during the five-year period between 2014 and 2018. METHODS: We queried NIH Reporter to identify candidate funded grants that addressed mHealth and the use of smartphones. From 1524 potential grants, we identified 397 that met the requisites of including an intervention app. Each grant's abstract was analyzed to understand the focus of intervention. The year of funding, type of activity (eg, R01, R34, and so on) and funding were noted. RESULTS: We identified 13 categories of strategies employed in funded smartphone intervention apps. Most grants included either one (35.0%) or two (39.0%) intervention approaches. These included artificial intelligence (57 apps), bionic adaptation (33 apps), cognitive and behavioral therapies (68 apps), contingency management (24 apps), education and information (85 apps), enhanced motivation (50 apps), facilitating, reminding and referring (60 apps), gaming and gamification (52 apps), mindfulness training (18 apps), monitoring and feedback (192 apps), norm setting (7 apps), skills training (85 apps) and social support and social networking (59 apps). The most frequently observed grant types included Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants (40.8%) and Research Project Grants (R01s) (26.2%).

Sadasivam_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Impact of a Collective Intelligence Tailored Messaging System on Smoking Cessation: The Perspect Randomized Experiment,"Sadasivam, Rajani Shankar and Borglund, Erin M. and Adams, Roy and Marlin, Benjamin M. and Houston, Thomas K.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Outside health care, content tailoring is driven algorithmically using machine learning compared to the rule-based approach used in current implementations of computer-tailored health communication (CTHC) systems. A special class of machine learning systems (""recommender systems"") are used to select messages by combining the collective intelligence of their users (ie, the observed and inferred preferences of users as they interact with the system) and their user profiles. However, this approach has not been adequately tested for CTHC. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare, in a randomized experiment, a standard, evidence-based, rule-based CTHC (standard CTHC) to a novel machine learning CTHC: Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring (PERSPeCT). We hypothesized that PERSPeCT will select messages of higher influence than our standard CTHC system. This standard CTHC was proven effective in motivating smoking cessation in a prior randomized trial of 900 smokers (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.81). METHODS: PERSPeCT is an innovative hybrid machine learning recommender system that selects and sends motivational messages using algorithms that learn from message ratings from 846 previous participants (explicit feedback), and the prior explicit ratings of each individual participant. Current smokers (N=120) aged 18 years or older, English speaking, with Internet access were eligible to participate. These smokers were randomized to receive either PERSPeCT (intervention, n=74) or standard CTHC tailored messages (n=46). The study was conducted between October 2014 and January 2015. By randomization, we compared daily message ratings (mean of smoker ratings each day). At 30 days, we assessed the intervention's perceived influence, 30-day cessation, and changes in readiness to quit from baseline. RESULTS: The proportion of days when smokers agreed/strongly agreed (daily rating <e2><89><a5>4) that the messages influenced them to quit was significantly higher for PERSPeCT (73%, 23/30) than standard CTHC (44%, 14/30, P=.02). Among less educated smokers (n=49), this difference was even more pronounced for days strongly agree (intervention: 77%, 23/30; comparison: 23%, 7/30, P<.001). There was no significant difference in the frequency which PERSPeCT randomized smokers agreed or strongly agreed that the intervention influenced them to quit smoking (P=.07) and use nicotine replacement therapy (P=.09). Among those who completed follow-up, 36% (20/55) of PERSPeCT smokers and 32% (11/34) of the standard CTHC group stopped smoking for one day or longer (P=.70). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard CTHC with proven effectiveness, PERSPeCT outperformed in terms of influence ratings and resulted in similar cessation rates.

Xiang_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Network context matters: graph convolutional network model over social networks improves the detection of unknown HIV infections among young men who have sex with men,"Xiang, Yang and Fujimoto, Kayo and Schneider, John and Jia, Yuxi and Zhi, Degui and Tao, Cui",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: HIV infection risk can be estimated based on not only individual features but also social network information. However, there have been insufficient studies using n machine learning methods that can maximize the utility of such information. Leveraging a state-of-the-art network topology modeling method, graph convolutional networks (GCN), our main objective was to include network information for the task of detecting previously unknown HIV infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used multiple social network data (peer referral, social, sex partners, and affiliation with social and health venues) that include 378 young men who had sex with men in Houston, TX, collected between 2014 and 2016. Due to the limited sample size, an ensemble approach was engaged by integrating GCN for modeling information flow and statistical machine learning methods, including random forest and logistic regression, to efficiently model sparse features in individual nodes. RESULTS: Modeling network information using GCN effectively increased the prediction of HIV status in the social network. The ensemble approach achieved 96.6% on accuracy and 94.6% on F1 measure, which outperformed the baseline methods (GCN, logistic regression, and random forest: 79.0%, 90.5%, 94.4% on accuracy, respectively; and 57.7%, 80.2%, 90.4% on F1). In the networks with missing HIV status, the ensemble also produced promising results. CONCLUSION: Network context is a necessary component in modeling infectious disease transmissions such as HIV. GCN, when combined with traditional machine learning approaches, achieved promising performance in detecting previously unknown HIV infections, which may provide a useful tool for combatting the HIV epidemic.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz070,26,11,1263-1271,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Disease Transmission, Infectious and *epidemiology and *graph convolutional networks and *HIV and *Homosexuality, Male and *machine learning and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Social Networking and *social networks and Adolescent and Adult and epidemiology and graph convolutional networks and HIV and HIV Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and Male and Models, Statistical and Models, Theoretical and Prospective Studies and Sexual Partners and social networks and Young Adult",NA,NA,2019/11/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Christopoulou_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Adverse drug events and medication relation extraction in electronic health records with ensemble deep learning methods,"Christopoulou, Fenia and Tran, Thy Thy and Sahu, Sunil Kumar and Miwa, Makoto and Ananiadou, Sophia",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Identification of drugs, associated medication entities, and interactions among them are crucial to prevent unwanted effects of drug therapy, known as adverse drug events. This article describes our participation to the n2c2 shared-task in extracting relations between medication-related entities in electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed an ensemble approach for relation extraction and classification between drugs and medication-related entities. We incorporated state-of-the-art named-entity recognition (NER) models based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks and conditional random fields (CRF) for end-to-end extraction. We additionally developed separate models for intra- and inter-sentence relation extraction and combined them using an ensemble method. The intra-sentence models rely on bidirectional long short-term memory networks and attention mechanisms and are able to capture dependencies between multiple related pairs in the same sentence. For the inter-sentence relations, we adopted a neural architecture that utilizes the Transformer network to improve performance in longer sequences. RESULTS: Our team ranked third with a micro-averaged F1 score of 94.72% and 87.65% for relation and end-to-end relation extraction, respectively (Tracks 2 and 3). Our ensemble effectively takes advantages from our proposed models. Analysis of the reported results indicated that our proposed approach is more generalizable than the top-performing system, which employs additional training data- and corpus-driven processing techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a relation extraction system to identify relations between drugs and medication-related entities. The proposed approach is independent of external syntactic tools.

Przybyla_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Quantifying risk factors in medical reports with a context-aware linear model,"Przybyla, Piotr and Brockmeier, Austin J. and Ananiadou, Sophia",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: We seek to quantify the mortality risk associated with mentions of medical concepts in textual electronic health records (EHRs). Recognizing mentions of named entities of relevant types (eg, conditions, symptoms, laboratory tests or behaviors) in text is a well-researched task. However, determining the level of risk associated with them is partly dependent on the textual context in which they appear, which may describe severity, temporal aspects, quantity, etc. METHODS: To take into account that a given word appearing in the context of different risk factors (medical concepts) can make different contributions toward risk level, we propose a multitask approach, called context-aware linear modeling, which can be applied using appropriately regularized linear regression. To improve the performance for risk factors unseen in training data (eg, rare diseases), we take into account their distributional similarity to other concepts. RESULTS: The evaluation is based on a corpus of 531 reports from EHRs with 99 376 risk factors rated manually by experts. While context-aware linear modeling significantly outperforms single-task models, taking into account concept similarity further improves performance, reaching the level of human annotators' agreements. CONCLUSION: Our results show that automatic quantification of risk factors in EHRs can achieve performance comparable to human assessment, and taking into account the multitask structure of the problem and the ability to handle rare concepts is crucial for its accuracy.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz004,26,6,537-546,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records and *Linear Models and *machine learning and *Machine Learning and *Mortality and *multitask learning and *natural language processing and *risk assessment and electronic health records and Humans and machine learning and multitask learning and natural language processing and Natural Language Processing and risk assessment and Risk Assessment/*methods and Risk Factors,NA,NA,2019/06/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five years of clinical data were extracted from an electronic health record system for 747 985 patients who had at least one visit during 2012-2013 at practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers. Data were screened using the system to detect outliers suggestive of potential medication errors. A sample of 300 charts was selected for review from the 15 693 alerts generated. A coding system was developed and codes assigned based on chart review to reflect the accuracy, validity, and clinical value of the alerts. RESULTS: Three-quarters of the chart-reviewed alerts generated by the screening system were found to be valid in which potential medication errors were identified. Of these valid alerts, the majority (75.0%) were found to be clinically useful in flagging potential medication errors or issues. DISCUSSION: A clinical decision support (CDS) system that used a probabilistic, machine-learning approach based on statistically derived outliers to detect medication errors generated potentially useful alerts with a modest rate of false positives. The performance of such a surveillance and alerting system is critically dependent on the quality and completeness of the underlying data. CONCLUSION: The screening system was able to generate alerts that might otherwise be missed with existing CDS systems and did so with a reasonably high degree of alert usefulness when subjected to review of patients' clinical contexts and details.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw171,24,2,281-287,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*clinical decision support and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *electronic health records and *machine learning and *Medical Order Entry Systems and *medication alert systems and *patient safety and clinical decision support and electronic health records and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and medication alert systems and Medication Errors/*prevention & control and Outpatient Clinics, Hospital and patient safety",NA,NA,2017/03/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to verify whether genomic data is sufficient to predict a patient's personal information. METHODS: RNA expression data and matched patient personal information were collected from 9538 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas program. Five personal information variables (age, gender, race, cancer type, and cancer stage) were recorded for each patient. Four different machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network) were used to determine whether a patient's personal information could be accurately predicted from RNA expression data. Performance measurement of the prediction models was based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We selected five cancer types (breast carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, low-grade glioma, and lung adenocarcinoma) with large samples sizes to verify whether predictive accuracy would differ between them. We also validated the efficacy of our four machine learning models in analyzing normal samples from 593 cancer patients. RESULTS: In most samples, personal information with high genetic relevance, such as gender and cancer type, could be predicted from RNA expression data alone. The prediction accuracies for gender and cancer type, which were the best models, were 0.93-0.99 and 0.78-0.94, respectively. Other aspects of personal information, such as age, race, and cancer stage, were difficult to predict from RNA expression data, with accuracies ranging from 0.0026-0.29, 0.76-0.96, and 0.45-0.79, respectively. Among the tested machine learning methods, the highest predictive accuracy was obtained using the support vector machine algorithm (mean accuracy 0.77), while the lowest accuracy was obtained using the random forest method (mean accuracy 0.65). Gender and race were predicted more accurately than other variables in the samples. On average, the accuracy of cancer stage prediction ranged between 0.71-0.67, while the age prediction accuracy ranged between 0.18-0.23 for the five cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: We attempted to predict patient information using RNA expression data. We found that some identifiers could be predicted, but most others could not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methods developed for the Community Guide were used to review CDSS literature covering the period from January 1976 to October 2015. Twenty-one studies were identified for inclusion. RESULTS: It was difficult to draw a meaningful estimate for the cost of acquiring and operating CDSSs to prevent CVD from the available studies ( n = 12) due to considerable heterogeneity. Several studies ( n = 11) indicated that health care costs were averted by using CDSSs but many were partial assessments that did not consider all components of health care. Four cost-benefit studies reached conflicting conclusions about the net benefit of CDSSs based on incomplete assessments of costs and benefits. Three cost-utility studies indicated inconsistent conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness based on a conservative $50,000 threshold. DISCUSSION: Intervention costs were not negligible, but specific estimates were not derived because of the heterogeneity of implementation and reporting metrics. Expected economic benefits from averted health care cost could not be determined with confidence because many studies did not fully account for all components of health care. CONCLUSION: We were unable to conclude whether CDSSs for CVD prevention is either cost-beneficial or cost-effective. Several evidence gaps are identified, most prominently a lack of information about major drivers of cost and benefit, a lack of standard metrics for the cost of CDSSs, and not allowing for useful life of a CDSS that generally extends beyond one accounting period.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw160,24,3,669-676,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Health Care Costs and Cardiovascular Diseases/economics/*prevention & control and clinical; economics; economics and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Decision support systems and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*economics and Humans and medical",NA,NA,2017/05/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Without consistent mapping to standards, clinical data cannot be harmonized, shared, or interpreted in a meaningful context. We sought to develop an automated machine learning pipeline that leverages noisy labels to map laboratory data to LOINC codes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Across 130 sites in the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, we selected the 150 most commonly used laboratory tests with numeric results per site from 2000 through 2016. Using source data text and numeric fields, we developed a machine learning model and manually validated random samples from both labeled and unlabeled datasets. RESULTS: The raw laboratory data consisted of >6.5 billion test results, with 2215 distinct LOINC codes. The model predicted the correct LOINC code in 85% of the unlabeled data and 96% of the labeled data by test frequency. In the subset of labeled data where the original and model-predicted LOINC codes disagreed, the model-predicted LOINC code was correct in 83% of the data by test frequency. CONCLUSION: Using a completely automated process, we are able to assign LOINC codes to unlabeled data with high accuracy. When the model-predicted LOINC code differed from the original LOINC code, the model prediction was correct in the vast majority of cases. This scalable, automated algorithm may improve data quality and interoperability, while substantially reducing the manual effort currently needed to accurately map laboratory data.",2018,10.1093/jamia/ocy110,25,10,1292-1300,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Algorithms and *Clinical Laboratory Information Systems and *Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and *Machine Learning and *Medical Records Systems, Computerized and Data Warehousing and Datasets as Topic and Health Information Interoperability and United States",NA,NA,2018/10/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sarda_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Using Passive Smartphone Sensing for Improved Risk Stratification of Patients With Depression and Diabetes: Cross-Sectional Observational Study,"Sarda, Archana and Munuswamy, Suresh and Sarda, Shubhankar and Subramanian, Vinod",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Research studies are establishing the use of smartphone sensing to measure mental well-being. Smartphone sensor information captures behavioral patterns, and its analysis helps reveal well-being changes. Depression in diabetes goes highly underdiagnosed and underreported. The comorbidity has been associated with increased mortality and worse clinical outcomes, including poor glycemic control and self-management. Clinical-only intervention has been found to have a very modest effect on diabetes management among people with depression. Smartphone technologies could play a significant role in complementing comorbid care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the association between smartphone-sensing parameters and symptoms of depression and to explore an approach to risk-stratify people with diabetes. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study (Project SHADO-Analyzing Social and Health Attributes through Daily Digital Observation) was conducted on 47 participants with diabetes. The study's smartphone-sensing app passively collected data regarding activity, mobility, sleep, and communication from each participant. Self-reported symptoms of depression using a validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were collected once every 2 weeks from all participants. A descriptive analysis was performed to understand the representation of the participants. A univariate analysis was performed on each derived sensing variable to compare behavioral changes between depression states-those with self-reported major depression (PHQ-9>9) and those with none (PHQ-9<e2><89><a4>9). A classification predictive modeling, using supervised machine-learning methods, was explored using derived sensing variables as input to construct and compare classifiers that could risk-stratify people with diabetes based on symptoms of depression. RESULTS: A noticeably high prevalence of self-reported depression (30 out of 47 participants, 63%) was found among the participants. Between depression states, a significant difference was found for average activity rates (daytime) between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 16.06 [SD 14.90]) and those with none (mean 18.79 [SD 16.72]), P=.005. For average number of people called (calls made and received), a significant difference was found between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 5.08 [SD 3.83]) and those with none (mean 8.59 [SD 7.05]), P<.001. These results suggest that participants with diabetes and symptoms of major depression exhibited lower activity through the day and maintained contact with fewer people. Using all the derived sensing variables, the extreme gradient boosting machine-learning classifier provided the best performance with an average cross-validation accuracy of 79.07% (95% CI 74%-84%) and test accuracy of 81.05% to classify symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with diabetes and self-reported symptoms of major depression were observed to show lower levels of social contact and lower activity levels during the day. Although findings must be reproduced in a broader randomized controlled study, this study shows promise in the use of predictive modeling for early detection of symptoms of depression in people with diabetes using smartphone-sensing information.",2019,10.2196/11041,7,1,e11041,eng,2291-5222,*classification and *comorbidity and *depression and *diabetes and *machine learning and *mental health and *mHealth and *passive sensing and *risk assessment and *smartphone and Adult and classification and comorbidity and Cross-Sectional Studies and depression and Depression/classification/*psychology and diabetes and Diabetes Mellitus/classification/*psychology and Female and Humans and machine learning and Male and mental health and mHealth and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications and passive sensing and risk assessment and Risk Assessment/*methods/standards and smartphone and Smartphone/*instrumentation/statistics & numerical data and Surveys and Questionnaires,NA,NA,2019/01/29/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""quarantine"") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included ""virus,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""quarantine."" Popular bigrams included ""COVID-19,"" ""stay home,"" ""corona virus,"" ""social distancing,"" and ""new cases."" We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18* speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560* over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",2018,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2768162,22,5,1662-1671,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Smartphone and Algorithms and Cough/*classification/*diagnosis and Humans and Neural Networks, Computer and Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted/*instrumentation and Telemedicine/*instrumentation",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies reported that searching on the internet for health information may potentially influence an individual's decision making to change her health-seeking behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) develop and validate 2 questionnaires to estimate the strategies of problem-solving in medicine and utilization of online health information, (2) determine the association between searching online for health information and utilization of online health information, and (3) determine the association between online medical help-seeking and utilization of online health information. METHODS: The Problem Solving in Medicine and Online Health Information Utilization questionnaires were developed and implemented in this study. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis to examine the structure of the factor loadings and intercorrelations for all the items and dimensions. We employed Pearson correlation coefficients for examining the correlations between each dimension of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire and each dimension of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. Furthermore, we conducted structure equation modeling for examining the possible linkage between each of the 6 dimensions of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire and each of the 3 dimensions of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 457 patients participated in this study. Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from .12 to .41, all with statistical significance, implying that each dimension of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire was significantly associated with each dimension of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. Patients with the strategy of online health information search for solving medical problems positively predicted changes in medical decision making (P=.01), consulting with others (P<.001), and promoting self-efficacy on deliberating the online health information (P<.001) based on the online health information they obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Present health care professionals have a responsibility to acknowledge that patients' medical decision making may be changed based on additional online health information. Health care professionals should assist patients' medical decision making by initiating as much dialogue with patients as possible, providing credible and convincing health information to patients, and guiding patients where to look for accurate, comprehensive, and understandable online health information. By doing so, patients will avoid becoming overwhelmed with extraneous and often conflicting health information. Educational interventions to promote health information seekers' ability to identify, locate, obtain, read, understand, evaluate, and effectively use online health information are highly encouraged.",2018,10.2196/jmir.9370,20,2,e47,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*decision making and *help-seeking behavior and *internet and *literacy and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Cross-Sectional Studies and decision making and Female and Health Behavior/*ethics and help-seeking behavior and Humans and Information Seeking Behavior/*ethics and internet and Internet and literacy and Male and Medical Informatics/*methods and Surveys and Questionnaires,NA,NA,2018/02/12/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Heringa_2017_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Lower alert rates by clustering of related drug interaction alerts,"Heringa, Mette and Siderius, Hidde and Floor-Schreudering, Annemieke and de Smet, Peter A. G. M. and Bouvy, Marcel L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate to what extent clustering of related drug interaction alerts (drug-drug and drug-disease interaction alerts) would decrease the alert rate in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of drug interaction alerts generated by CDSSs in community pharmacies. Frequently generated combinations of alerts were analyzed for associations in a 5% random data sample (dataset 1). Alert combinations with similar management recommendations were defined as clusters. The alert rate was assessed by simulating a CDSS generating 1 alert per cluster per patient instead of separate alerts. The simulation was performed in dataset 1 and replicated in another 5% data sample (dataset 2). RESULTS: Data were extracted from the CDSSs of 123 community pharmacies. Dataset 1 consisted of 841 572 dispensed prescriptions and 298 261 drug interaction alerts. Dataset 2 was comparable. Twenty-two frequently occurring alert combinations were identified. Analysis of these associated alert combinations for similar management recommendations resulted in 3 clusters (related to renal function, electrolytes, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases). Using the clusters in alert generation reduced the alert rate within these clusters by 53-70%. The overall number of drug interaction alerts was reduced by 11% in dataset 1 and by 12% in dataset 2. This corresponds to a decrease of 21 alerts per pharmacy per day. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Using clusters of drug interaction alerts with similar management recommendations in CDSSs can substantially decrease the overall alert rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IBM MarketScan database (2003-2016) was used to analyze visit-level self-harm in 10 120 030 patients with <e2><89><a5>2 MMI codes. Five machine learning (ML) classifiers were tested on a balanced data subset, with XGBoost selected for the full dataset. Classification performance was validated via random data mislabeling and comparison with a clinician-derived ""gold standard."" The incidence of coded and imputed self-harm was characterized by year, patient age, sex, U.S. state, and MMI diagnosis. RESULTS: Imputation identified 1 592 703 self-harm events vs 83 113 coded events, with areas under the curve >0.99 for the balanced and full datasets, and 83.5% agreement with the gold standard. The overall coded and imputed self-harm incidence were 0.28% and 5.34%, respectively, varied considerably by age and sex, and was highest in individuals with multiple MMI diagnoses. Self-harm undercoding was higher in male than in female individuals and increased with age. Substance abuse, injuries, poisoning, asphyxiation, brain disorders, harmful thoughts, and psychotherapy were the main features used by ML to classify visits. DISCUSSION: Only 1 of 19 self-harm events was coded for individuals with MMI. ML demonstrated excellent performance in recovering self-harm visits. Male individuals and seniors with MMI are particularly vulnerable to self-harm undercoding and may be at risk of not getting appropriate psychiatric care.

In practice, patients routinely seek second opinions from multiple clinical experts for complex disease diagnosis. Our objective is to mimic such a practice of seeking second opinions by training 2 agents with different focuses: the primary agent studies the most recent visit of the patient to learn the current health status, and then the second-opinion agent considers the entire patient history to obtain a more global view. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our approach Dr. Agent augments recurrent neural networks with 2 policy gradient agents. Moreover, Dr. Agent is customized with various patient demographics information and learns a dynamic skip connection to focus on the relevant information over time. We trained Dr. Agent to perform 4 clinical prediction tasks on the publicly available MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database: (1) in-hospital mortality prediction, (2) acute care phenotype classification, (3) physiologic decompensation prediction, and (4) forecasting length of stay. We compared the performance of Dr. Agent against 4 baseline clinical predictive models. RESULTS: Dr. Agent outperforms baseline clinical prediction models across all 4 tasks in terms of all metrics. Compared with the best baseline model, Dr. Agent achieves up to 15% higher area under the precision-recall curve on different tasks.

Our objective was to determine whether a personalized asthma management computer-based decision support increases the quality of asthma management and reduces the rate of out-of-control episodes. METHODS: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted in Quebec, Canada among 81 primary care physicians and 4447 of their asthmatic patients. Patients were followed from the first visit for 3-33 months. The physician control group used the Medical Office of the 21st century (MOXXI) system, an integrated electronic health record. A custom-developed asthma decision support system was integrated within MOXXI and was activated for physicians in the intervention group. RESULTS: At the first visit, 9.8% (intervention) to 12.9% (control) of patients had out-of-control asthma, which was defined as a patient having had an emergency room visit or hospitalization for respiratory-related problems and/or more than 250 doses of fast-acting <ce><b2>-agonist (FABA) dispensed in the past 3 months. By the end of the trial, there was a significant increase in the ratio of doses of inhaled corticosteroid use to fast-acting <ce><b2>-agonist (0.93 vs. 0.69: difference: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.02-0.51; P = 0.03) in the intervention group. The overall out-of-control asthma rate was 54.7 (control) and 46.2 (intervention) per 100 patients per year (100 PY), a non-significant rate difference of -8.7 (95% CI: -24.7, 7.3; P = 0.29). The intervention's effect was greater for patients with out-of-control asthma at the beginning of the study, a group who accounted for 44.7% of the 5597 out-of-control asthma events during follow-up, as there was a reduction in the event rate of -28.4 per 100 PY (95% CI: -55.6, -1.2; P = 0.04) compared to patients with in-control asthma at the beginning of the study (-0.08 [95% CI: -10.3, 8.6; P = 0.86]). DISCUSSION: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted ADS system that facilitates systematic monitoring of asthma control status, follow-up of patients with out of control asthma, and evidence-based, patient-specific treatment recommendations. We found that physicians were more likely to use ADS for out-of-control patients, that in the majority of these patients, they were advised to add an inhaled corticosteroid or a leukotriene inhibitor to the patient s treatment regimen, and the intervention significantly increased the mean ratio of inhaled corticosteroids to FABA during follow-up. It also reduced the rate of out-of-control episodes during follow up among patients whose asthma was out-of-control at the time of study entry. Future research should assess whether coupling patient-specific treatment recommendations, automated follow-up, and home care with comparative feedback on quality and outcomes of care can improve guideline adoption and care outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A primary care-personalized asthma management system reduced the rate of out-of-control asthma episodes among patients whose asthma was poorly controlled at the study's onset.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocu009,22,4,773-783,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and asthma and Asthma/*therapy and computer decision support and Female and Humans and Male and MOXXI and out-of-control and personalized medicine and Physicians, Primary Care and Precision Medicine and Primary Health Care and RCT and Single-Blind Method and User-Computer Interface",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the role of ML in health care grows, there is an increasing need for systematic and reproducible preprocessing techniques for EHR data. Thus, we developed FIDDLE (Flexible Data-Driven Pipeline), an open-source framework that streamlines the preprocessing of data extracted from the EHR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Largely data-driven, FIDDLE systematically transforms structured EHR data into feature vectors, limiting the number of decisions a user must make while incorporating good practices from the literature. To demonstrate its utility and flexibility, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment in which we applied FIDDLE to 2 publicly available EHR data sets collected from intensive care units: MIMIC-III and the eICU Collaborative Research Database. We trained different ML models to predict 3 clinically important outcomes: in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and shock. We evaluated models using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), and compared it to several baselines. RESULTS: Across tasks, FIDDLE extracted 2,528 to 7,403 features from MIMIC-III and eICU, respectively. On all tasks, FIDDLE-based models achieved good discriminative performance, with AUROCs of 0.757-0.886, comparable to the performance of MIMIC-Extract, a preprocessing pipeline designed specifically for MIMIC-III. Furthermore, our results showed that FIDDLE is generalizable across different prediction times, ML algorithms, and data sets, while being relatively robust to different settings of user-defined arguments.

Patients' knowledge about their illness and available treatment options, gained through medical education, is one of the key drivers for SDM. Current patient education relies heavily on medical consultation and is known to be ineffective. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether providing patients with information in a subdivided, categorized, and interactive manner via an educational app for smartphone or tablet might increase the knowledge of their illness. METHODS: A surgeon-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted with 213 patients who were referred to 1 of the 6 Dutch hospitals by their general practitioner owing to knee complaints that were indicative of knee osteoarthritis. An interactive app that, in addition to standard care, actively sends informative and pertinent content to patients about their illness on a daily basis by means of push notifications in the week before their consultation. The primary outcome was the level of perceived and actual knowledge that patients had about their knee complaints and the relevant treatment options after the intervention. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were enrolled in the control group and 91 in the intervention group. After the intervention, the level of actual knowledge (measured on a 0-36 scale) was 52% higher in the app group (26.4 vs 17.4, P<.001). Moreover, within the app group, the level of perceived knowledge (measured on a 0-25 scale) increased by 22% during the week within the app group (from 13.5 to 16.5, P<.001), compared with no gain in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Actively offering patients information in a subdivided (per day), categorized (per theme), and interactive (video and quiz questions) manner significantly increases the level of perceived knowledge and demonstrates a higher level of actual knowledge, compared with standard care educational practices.

A growing number of reportedly accurate machine learning algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed using data from wearable devices (eg, smartwatch and smartphone). However, many HAR algorithms depend on fixed-size sampling windows that may poorly adapt to real-world conditions in which activity bouts are of unequal duration. A small sliding window can produce noisy predictions under stable conditions, whereas a large sliding window may miss brief bursts of intense activity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create an HAR framework adapted to variable duration activity bouts by (1) detecting the change points of activity bouts in a multivariate time series and (2) predicting activity for each homogeneous window defined by these change points. METHODS: We applied standard fixed-width sliding windows (4-6 different sizes) or greedy Gaussian segmentation (GGS) to identify break points in filtered triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope data. After standard feature engineering, we applied an Xgboost model to predict physical activity within each window and then converted windowed predictions to instantaneous predictions to facilitate comparison across segmentation methods. We applied these methods in 2 datasets: the human activity recognition using smartphones (HARuS) dataset where a total of 30 adults performed activities of approximately equal duration (approximately 20 seconds each) while wearing a waist-worn smartphone, and the Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation for Pediatric Asthma (BREATHE) dataset where a total of 14 children performed 6 activities for approximately 10 min each while wearing a smartwatch. To mimic a real-world scenario, we generated artificial unequal activity bout durations in the BREATHE data by randomly subdividing each activity bout into 10 segments and randomly concatenating the 60 activity bouts. Each dataset was divided into ~90% training and ~10% holdout testing. RESULTS: In the HARuS data, GGS produced the least noisy predictions of 6 physical activities and had the second highest accuracy rate of 91.06% (the highest accuracy rate was 91.79% for the sliding window of size 0.8 second). In the BREATHE data, GGS again produced the least noisy predictions and had the highest accuracy rate of 79.4% of predictions for 6 physical activities. CONCLUSIONS: In a scenario with variable duration activity bouts, GGS multivariate segmentation produced smart-sized windows with more stable predictions and a higher accuracy rate than traditional fixed-size sliding window approaches. Overall, accuracy was good in both datasets but, as expected, it was slightly lower in the more real-world study using wrist-worn smartwatches in children (BREATHE) than in the more tightly controlled study using waist-worn smartphones in adults (HARuS). We implemented GGS in an offline setting, but it could be adapted for real-time prediction with streaming data.",2019,10.2196/11201,7,2,e11201,eng,2291-5222,"*machine learning and *physical activity and *Recognition, Psychology and *smartphone and *statistical data analysis wearable devices and Accelerometry/methods and Adult and Female and Human Activities/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/standards/statistics & numerical data and Male and Middle Aged and Multivariate Analysis and physical activity and smartphone and statistical data analysis wearable devices and Time Factors and Wearable Electronic Devices/psychology/*standards",NA,NA,2019/02/07/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Knowledge of guidelines is used as decision aids in clinical situations, and during this process, no patient health conditions are considered. In this paper, we propose an SDM system framework for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients that not only contains knowledge abstracted from guidelines but also employs a multilabel classification model that uses class-imbalanced electronic health record (EHR) data and that aims to provide a recommended list of available antihyperglycemic medications to help physicians and patients have an SDM conversation. The use of EHR data to serve as a decision-support component in decision aids helps physicians and patients to reach a more intuitive understanding of current health conditions and allows the tailoring of the available knowledge to each patient, leading to a more effective SDM. Real-world data from 2542 T2DM inpatient EHRs were substituted by 77 features and eight output labels, i.e., eight antihyperglycemic medications, and these data were utilized to build and validate the recommendation model. The multilabel recommendation model exhibited stable performance in every single-label classification and showed the ability to predict minority positive cases in which the average recall value of the eight classes was 0.9898.

Heringa_2015_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Nature and management of duplicate medication alerts,"Heringa, Mette and Floor, Annemieke and Meijer, Willemijn M. and De Smet, Peter A. G. M. and Bouvy, Marcel L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the nature of duplicate medication (DM) alerts, their management by community pharmacists, and potential characteristics of DM alerts that lead to interventions by pharmacists. METHODS: Observational study in 53 community pharmacies. Each pharmacist registered the nature and management of 24 DM alerts on a structured form. RESULTS: On average, the clinical decision support systems generated 20.4 DM alerts per 100 dispensed drugs. In half of the 1272 registered alerts, the pharmacists judged that there was no risk for concurrent use of both prescriptions. In 32% of the alerts, the DM alert was generated for an intentional combination. In 17% of the alerts, there was a risk for unintentional concurrent use. In 32% of the alerts the pharmacists decided that one or more actions were needed: the electronic patient record was updated in 15% of the alerts and in 19% of the alerts the pharmacists performed an external action-for example, informing the patient or modifying the prescription (including 5 therapeutic prescription modifications and 22 logistic prescription modifications). Alerts concerning first dispensing were more likely to be followed by an external action than alerts concerning refills (40% vs 14%, P < .001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In community pharmacy, prescription modifications based on DM alerts are rare, but DM alerts lead with some regularity to other actions-for example, patient instruction and update of the electronic patient record. As the current DM alerts are diverse and nonspecific in detecting situations where external action is considered relevant, other ways of alerting should therefore be considered.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocv021,22,4,831-837,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Medical Order Entry Systems and *Pharmacies and clinical decision support systems and community pharmacy services and duplicate medication and Humans and medical order entry systems and medication errors and Medication Errors and Netherlands",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Qiao_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Dynamic Autonomous Cross Consortium Chain Mechanism in e-Healthcare,"Qiao, Rui and Luo, Xiang-Yang and Zhu, Si-Feng and Liu, Ao-Di and Yan, Xin-Qing and Wang, Qing-Xian",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Safe and scalable dynamic autonomous data interaction between medical institutions can increase the number of clinical trial records, which is of great significance for improving the level of medical trial collaboration, especially for clinical decision-making with regard to rare diseases. Through a preset authorization access and consensus mechanism, consortium chain provides integrity and traceability management for medical clinical data. However, how to enable users have ownership of their own medical data and share their medical data safely and dynamically between different medical institutions remains an area of particular concern. To achieve dynamic communication between medical consortium chains, this paper proposes (i) a cross-chain communication mechanism by simplifying the heterogeneous node communication topology and (ii) the construction rules of the node identity credibility path-proof to carry out dynamic construction and verification of the path-proof for cross-chain transactions. In addition, the consensus of the cross-chain transaction is modeled as a threshold digital signature process with multiple privileged subgroups; thus, the intra-chain consortium consensus based on the verification node list is extended to the cross-chain consensus. A smart contract deployment and execution scheme based on rational node value transfer mechanism is proposed by analyzing the value transfer game between nodes. Experimental results showed that the proposed scheme can not only enable patients to share their records safely and autonomously in an authorized medical consortium chain within milliseconds but also realize dynamic adaptive interaction among heterogeneous consortium chains.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2963437,24,8,2157-2168,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,*Blockchain and *Electronic Health Records and *Telemedicine and Algorithms and Biomedical Research and Confidentiality and Humans and Intersectoral Collaboration,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: Our aim in this study was to conduct a descriptive and quantitative analysis of the use of a social media community for Hirschsprung's Disease (HD). METHODS: In July 2011, a mother of a child with HD launched the ""Shit Happens"" campaign. The campaign uses social media (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) to engage other families affected by HD. Internet analytics including Google Analytics and Facebook Insights were used to evaluate the reach and responsiveness of this campaign. RESULTS: On the day the HD campaign was launched, 387 people viewed the blog ""Roo's Journey"". Blog views have now exceeded 5400 views from 37 countries. The Facebook page extends to 46 countries, has an average post reach of 298 users, 1414 ""likes"", and an overall reach of 131,032 users. The campaign has 135 Twitter followers and 344 tweets at the time of writing. The most common question posted on the Facebook page is related to treatment for extreme diaper rash. Responsiveness assessment demonstrated that within 2 hours of posting, a question could receive 143 views and 20 responses, increasing to 30 responses after 5 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Social media networks are well suited to discussion, support, and advocacy for health-related conditions and can be especially important in connecting families affected by rare conditions. The HD campaign demonstrates the reach and responsiveness of a community that primarily relies on social media to connect families affected by HD. Although responsive, this community is currently lacking consistent access to evidence-based guidance for their common concerns.

Priest_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Finding the Patient's Voice Using Big Data: Analysis of Users' Health-Related Concerns in the ChaCha Question-and-Answer Service (2009-2012),"Priest, Chad and Knopf, Amelia and Groves, Doyle and Carpenter, Janet S. and Furrey, Christopher and Krishnan, Anand and Miller, Wendy R. and Otte, Julie L. and Palakal, Mathew and Wiehe, Sarah and Wilson, Jeffrey",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The development of effective health care and public health interventions requires a comprehensive understanding of the perceptions, concerns, and stated needs of health care consumers and the public at large. Big datasets from social media and question-and-answer services provide insight into the public's health concerns and priorities without the financial, temporal, and spatial encumbrances of more traditional community-engagement methods and may prove a useful starting point for public-engagement health research (infodemiology). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to describe user characteristics and health-related queries of the ChaCha question-and-answer platform, and discuss how these data may be used to better understand the perceptions, concerns, and stated needs of health care consumers and the public at large. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective automated textual analysis of anonymous user-generated queries submitted to ChaCha between January 2009 and November 2012. A total of 2.004 billion queries were read, of which 3.50% (70,083,796/2,004,243,249) were missing 1 or more data fields, leaving 1.934 billion complete lines of data for these analyses. RESULTS: Males and females submitted roughly equal numbers of health queries, but content differed by sex. Questions from females predominantly focused on pregnancy, menstruation, and vaginal health. Questions from males predominantly focused on body image, drug use, and sexuality. Adolescents aged 12-19 years submitted more queries than any other age group. Their queries were largely centered on sexual and reproductive health, and pregnancy in particular. CONCLUSIONS: The private nature of the ChaCha service provided a perfect environment for maximum frankness among users, especially among adolescents posing sensitive health questions. Adolescents' sexual health queries reveal knowledge gaps with serious, lifelong consequences. The nature of questions to the service provides opportunities for rapid understanding of health concerns and may lead to development of more effective tailored interventions.",2016,10.2196/jmir.5033,18,3,e44,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Information Seeking Behavior and *Internet and adolescent and Adolescent and Adult and big data and ChaCha and Consumer Health Information/*statistics & numerical data and Datasets as Topic and Female and health information seeking and Humans and infodemiology and infoveillance and Male and patient engagement and Pregnancy and question-and-answer service and Reproductive Health and Retrospective Studies and Sex Factors and Sexual Behavior and sexual health and social meda and Social Media,NA,NA,2016/03/09/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use advanced deep learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and to explore potential risk factors involved in progressive asthma. METHODS: We proposed a novel time-sensitive, attentive neural network to predict asthma exacerbation using clinical variables from large electronic health records. The clinical variables were collected from the Cerner Health Facts database between 1992 and 2015, including 31,433 adult patients with asthma. Interpretations on both patient and cohort levels were investigated based on the model parameters. RESULTS: The proposed model obtained an area under the curve value of 0.7003 through a five-fold cross-validation, which outperformed the baseline methods. The results also demonstrated that the addition of elapsed time embeddings considerably improved the prediction performance. Further analysis observed diverse distributions of contributing factors across patients as well as some possible cohort-level risk factors, which could be found supporting evidence from peer-reviewed literature such as respiratory diseases and esophageal reflux.

Browne_2015_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Let Visuals Tell the Story: Medication Adherence in Patients with Type II Diabetes Captured by a Novel Ingestion Sensor Platform,"Browne, Sara H. and Behzadi, Yashar and Littlewort, Gwen",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases such as diabetes require high levels of medication adherence and patient self-management for optimal health outcomes. A novel sensing platform, Digital Health Feedback System (Proteus Digital Health, Redwood City, CA), can for the first time detect medication ingestion events and physiological measures simultaneously, using an edible sensor, personal monitor patch, and paired mobile device. The Digital Health Feedback System (DHFS) generates a large amount of data. Visual analytics of this rich dataset may provide insights into longitudinal patterns of medication adherence in the natural setting and potential relationships between medication adherence and physiological measures that were previously unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to use modern methods of visual analytics to represent continuous and discrete data from the DHFS, plotting multiple different data types simultaneously to evaluate the potential of the DHFS to capture longitudinal patterns of medication-taking behavior and self-management in individual patients with type II diabetes. METHODS: Visualizations were generated using time domain methods of oral metformin medication adherence and physiological data obtained by the DHFS use in 5 patients with type II diabetes over 37-42 days. The DHFS captured at-home metformin adherence, heart rate, activity, and sleep/rest. A mobile glucose monitor captured glucose testing and level (mg/dl). Algorithms were developed to analyze data over varying time periods: across the entire study, daily, and weekly. Following visualization analysis, correlations between sleep/rest and medication ingestion were calculated across all subjects. RESULTS: A total of 197 subject days, encompassing 141,840 data events were analyzed. Individual continuous patch use varied between 87-98%. On average, the cohort took 78% (SD 12) of prescribed medication and took 77% (SD 26) within the prescribed <c2><b1>2-hour time window. Average activity levels per subjects ranged from 4000-12,000 steps per day. The combination of activity level and heart rate indicated different levels of cardiovascular fitness between subjects. Visualizations over the entire study captured the longitudinal pattern of missed doses (the majority of which took place in the evening), the timing of ingestions in individual subjects, and the range of medication ingestion timing, which varied from 1.5-2.4 hours (Subject 3) to 11 hours (Subject 2). Individual morning self-management patterns over the study period were obtained by combining the times of waking, metformin ingestion, and glucose measurement. Visualizations combining multiple data streams over a 24-hour period captured patterns of broad daily events: when subjects rose in the morning, tested their blood glucose, took their medications, went to bed, hours of sleep/rest, and level of activity during the day. Visualizations identified highly consistent daily patterns in Subject 3, the most adherent participant. Erratic daily patterns including sleep/rest were demonstrated in Subject 2, the least adherent subject. Correlation between sleep /rest and medication ingestion in each individual subject was evaluated. Subjects 2 and 4 showed correlation between amount of sleep/rest over a 24-hour period and medication-taking the following day (Subject 2: r=.47, P<.02; Subject 4: r=.35, P<.05). With Subject 2, sleep/rest disruptions during the night were highly correlated (r=.47, P<.009) with missing doses the following day. CONCLUSIONS: Visualizations integrating medication ingestion and physiological data from the DHFS over varying time intervals captured detailed individual longitudinal patterns of medication adherence and self-management in the natural setting. Visualizing multiple data streams simultaneously, providing a data-rich representation, revealed information that would not have been shown by plotting data streams individually. Such analyses provided data far beyond traditional adherence summary statistics and may form the foundation of future personalized predictive interventions to drive longitudinal adherence and support optimal self-management in chronic diseases such as diabetes.",2015,10.2196/mhealth.4292,3,4,e108,eng,2291-5222,data visualization and ingestion sensor platform and medication adherence and patient self-management and time domain methods,NA,NA,2015/12/31/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ford_2016_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Extracting information from the text of electronic medical records to improve case detection: a systematic review,"Ford, Elizabeth and Carroll, John A. and Smith, Helen E. and Scott, Donia and Cassell, Jackie A.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are revolutionizing health-related research. One key issue for study quality is the accurate identification of patients with the condition of interest. Information in EMRs can be entered as structured codes or unstructured free text. The majority of research studies have used only coded parts of EMRs for case-detection, which may bias findings, miss cases, and reduce study quality. This review examines whether incorporating information from text into case-detection algorithms can improve research quality. METHODS: A systematic search returned 9659 papers, 67 of which reported on the extraction of information from free text of EMRs with the stated purpose of detecting cases of a named clinical condition. Methods for extracting information from text and the technical accuracy of case-detection algorithms were reviewed. RESULTS: Studies mainly used US hospital-based EMRs, and extracted information from text for 41 conditions using keyword searches, rule-based algorithms, and machine learning methods. There was no clear difference in case-detection algorithm accuracy between rule-based and machine learning methods of extraction. Inclusion of information from text resulted in a significant improvement in algorithm sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic in comparison to codes alone (median sensitivity 78% (codes + text) vs 62% (codes), P = .03; median area under the receiver operating characteristic 95% (codes + text) vs 88% (codes), P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: Text in EMRs is accessible, especially with open source information extraction algorithms, and significantly improves case detection when combined with codes. More harmonization of reporting within EMR studies is needed, particularly standardized reporting of algorithm accuracy metrics like positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall).",2016,10.1093/jamia/ocv180,23,5,1007-1015,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Algorithms and *case detection and *data quality and *electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records and *Information Storage and Retrieval and *review and *text mining and case detection and Data Mining and data quality and Diagnosis and electronic health records and Humans and Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and review and Sensitivity and Specificity and text mining,NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The World Health Organization underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context, automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges, deep neural networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation. Specifically, we opted for a joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce lexical variability, we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas. We compared this approach with supervised event extraction approaches based on either symbolic or dense representations.

However, there is still a lack of general understanding of the status quo of HWPAs and the quality of the articles they release. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess the conformity of HWPAs to the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) and to evaluate the suitability of articles disseminated by HWPAs. METHODS: The survey was conducted from April 23 to May 5, 2019. Based on the monthly (March 1-31, 2019) WeChat Index provided by Qingbo Big Data, the top 100 HWPAs were examined to evaluate their HONcode compliance. The first four articles published by each HWPA on the survey dates were selected as samples to evaluate their suitability. All materials were assessed by three raters. The materials were assessed using the HONcode checklist and the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) score sheet. Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and Excel version 2013 (Microsoft Inc, Washington DC, USA). RESULTS: A total of 93 HWPAs and 210 of their released articles were included in this study. For six of the eight principles, the 93 HWPAs nearly consistently did not meet the requirements of the HONcode. The HWPAs certified by Tencent Corporation (66/93, 71%) were generally slightly superior to those without such certification (27/93, 29%) in terms of compliance with HONcode principles. The mean SAM score for the 210 articles was 67.72 (SD 10.930), which indicated ""adequate"" suitability. There was no significant difference between the SAM scores of the articles published by certified and uncertified HWPAs (P=.07), except in the literacy requirements dimension (t(df=97)=-2.418, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The HWPAs had low HONcode conformity.

We developed a 3D densely connected convolutional neural network (termed De-COVID19-Net) to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients belonging to the high-risk or low-risk group, combining CT and clinical information. The area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation techniques were used to assess our model.

Advances in artificial intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized support at scale. OBJECTIVE: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach. METHODS: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide, Australia, from March to August 2019. Participants were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years, recruited through news stories, social media posts, and flyers. The program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot, Paola, who guided participants through a computer-based individualized introductory session, weekly check-ins, and goal setting, and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps, a website with educational materials and recipes, and a printed diet and activity log sheet. Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure.

Population-based surveys represent an underinvestigated source to identify individuals at risk of dementia. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to identify participants with high likelihood of dementia in population-based surveys without the need of the clinical diagnosis of dementia in a subsample. METHODS: Unsupervised machine learning classification (hierarchical clustering on principal components) was developed in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; 2002-2003, N=18,165 individuals) and validated in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2010-2012, N=58,202 individuals). RESULTS: Unsupervised machine learning classification identified three clusters in HRS: cluster 1 (n=12,231) without any functional or motor limitations, cluster 2 (N=4841) with walking/climbing limitations, and cluster 3 (N=1093) with both functional and walking/climbing limitations. Comparison of cluster 3 with previously published predicted probabilities of dementia in HRS showed that it identified high likelihood of dementia (probability of dementia >0.95; area under the curve [AUC]=0.91). Removing either cognitive or both cognitive and behavioral measures did not impede accurate classification (AUC=0.91 and AUC=0.90, respectively). Three clusters with similar profiles were identified in SHARE (cluster 1: n=40,223; cluster 2: n=15,644; cluster 3: n=2335). Survival rate of participants from cluster 3 reached 39.2% (n=665 deceased) in HRS and 62.2% (n=811 deceased) in SHARE after a 3.9-year follow-up. Surviving participants from cluster 3 in both cohorts worsened their functional and mobility performance over the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised machine learning identifies high likelihood of dementia in population-based surveys, even without cognitive and behavioral measures and without the need of clinical diagnosis of dementia in a subsample of the population.

PCC provides the opportunity to identify, prevent, and treat modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors to optimize the health of couples trying to become pregnant. The prevalence of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors in these couples is high, but the uptake of PCC remains low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the preferences and experiences of women and men (patients) trying to become pregnant and of health care providers and other involved professionals regarding mobile health (mHealth), in particular the coaching platform Smarter Pregnancy, and its potential role in PCC. METHODS: Patients who participated in the Smarter Pregnancy randomized controlled trial (RCT) and health care providers and professionals also involved in PCC were invited to participate in a qualitative study. The barriers, benefits, and opportunities of big data collection by mHealth were discussed in focus group sessions, prompted with statements regarding PCC. RESULTS: We composed five focus groups, consisting of 27 patients in total (23 women and 4 men), who participated in the RCT, and nine health care providers and other professionals. Of the patients, 67% (18/27) were familiar with the concept of PCC, but only 15% (4/27) received any form of PCC. A majority of 56% (combined percentages of statements 1 [n=18], 2 [n=11], and 3 [n=16]) of the patients believed in the benefit of receiving PCC, and all agreed that men should be involved in PCC as well. Patients did not have a problem using anonymized data obtained from mHealth tools for scientific purposes. Patients and health care providers and other professionals both acknowledged the lack of awareness regarding the importance of PCC and stated that mHealth provides several opportunities to support clinical PCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings substantiate previous studies addressing the low uptake of PCC due to unawareness or lack of perception of its relevance by couples who are trying to become pregnant. The positive judgment and experiences with mHealth, in particular Smarter Pregnancy, will stimulate future research and further development of effective and cost-effective personalized mHealth apps for patients, health care providers, and other professionals as an add-on to clinical PCC.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7834,5,8,e123,eng,2291-5222,Focus group and Lifestyle and mHealth and Nutrition and Personalized medicine and Preconception care,NA,NA,2017/08/17/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fiske_2019_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,"Your Robot Therapist Will See You Now: Ethical Implications of Embodied Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy","Fiske, Amelia and Henningsen, Peter and Buyx, Alena",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. OBJECTIVE: This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. METHODS: Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. RESULTS: From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",2019,10.2196/13216,21,5,e13216,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *ethics and *medicine and *psychiatry and *psychology and *psychotherapy and *robotics and artificial intelligence and Artificial Intelligence/*ethics and ethics and Humans and medicine and psychiatry and Psychiatry/*ethics and psychology and Psychology/*ethics and psychotherapy and Psychotherapy/*ethics and robotics and Robotics/*methods,NA,NA,2019/05/09/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unlike most medical treatments, its primary mechanisms are linguistic; i.e., the treatment relies directly on a conversation between a patient and provider. However, the evaluation of patient-provider conversation suffers from critical shortcomings, including intensive labor requirements, coder error, nonstandardized coding systems, and inability to scale up to larger data sets. To overcome these shortcomings, psychotherapy analysis needs a reliable and scalable method for summarizing the content of treatment encounters. We used a publicly available psychotherapy corpus from Alexander Street press comprising a large collection of transcripts of patient-provider conversations to compare coding performance for two machine learning methods. We used the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (L-LDA) model to learn associations between text and codes, to predict codes in psychotherapy sessions, and to localize specific passages of within-session text representative of a session code. We compared the L-LDA model to a baseline lasso regression model using predictive accuracy and model generalizability (measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve). The L-LDA model outperforms the lasso logistic regression model at predicting session-level codes with average AUC scores of 0.79, and 0.70, respectively. For fine-grained level coding, L-LDA and logistic regression are able to identify specific talk-turns representative of symptom codes. However, model performance for talk-turn identification is not yet as reliable as human coders. We conclude that the L-LDA model has the potential to be an objective, scalable method for accurate automated coding of psychotherapy sessions that perform better than comparable discriminative methods at session-level coding and can also predict fine-grained codes.",2017,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2503985,21,2,476-487,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,*Interdisciplinary Communication and Algorithms and Clinical Coding/*methods and Electronic Health Records/*classification and Humans and Machine Learning and Psychotherapy/*methods and Semantics,NA,NA,2017/03//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Park_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Detection of Bacteremia in Surgical In-Patients Using Recurrent Neural Network Based on Time Series Records: Development and Validation Study,"Park, Hyung Jun and Jung, Dae Yon and Ji, Wonjun and Choi, Chang-Min",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Detecting bacteremia among surgical in-patients is more obscure than other patients due to the inflammatory condition caused by the surgery. The previous criteria such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome or Sepsis-3 are not available for use in general wards, and thus, many clinicians usually rely on practical senses to diagnose postoperative infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the performance of continuous monitoring with a deep learning model for early detection of bacteremia for surgical in-patients in the general ward and the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 36,023 consecutive patients who underwent general surgery between October and December 2017 at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for detecting bacteremia by the deep learning model, and the secondary outcome was the feature explainability of the model by occlusion analysis. RESULTS: Out of the 36,023 patients in the data set, 720 cases of bacteremia were included. Our deep learning-based model showed an AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.974-0.981) and an AUPRC of 0.17 (95% CI 0.147-0.203) for detecting bacteremia in surgical in-patients. For predicting bacteremia within the previous 24-hour period, the AUROC and AUPRC values were 0.93 and 0.15, respectively. Occlusion analysis showed that vital signs and laboratory measurements (eg, kidney function test and white blood cell group) were the most important variables for detecting bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model based on time series electronic health records data had a high detective ability for bacteremia for surgical in-patients in the general ward and the ICU.

D. and Zhai, Chengxiang",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Online health forums provide a convenient way for patients to obtain medical information and connect with physicians and peers outside of clinical settings. However, large quantities of unstructured and diversified content generated on these forums make it difficult for users to digest and extract useful information. Understanding user intents would enable forums to find and recommend relevant information to users by filtering out threads that do not match particular intents. In this paper, we derive a taxonomy of intents to capture user information needs in online health forums and propose novel pattern-based features for use with a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify original thread posts according to their underlying intents. Since no dataset existed for this task, we employ three annotators to manually label a dataset of 1192 HealthBoards posts spanning four forum topics. Experimental results show that a SVM using pattern-based features is highly capable of identifying user intents in forum posts, reaching a maximum precision of 75%, and that a SVM-based hierarchical classifier using both pattern and word features outperforms its SVM counterpart that uses only word features. Furthermore, comparable classification performance can be achieved by training and testing on posts from different forum topics.",2015,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2416252,19,4,1392-1398,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Intention and *Internet and *Support Vector Machine and Computational Biology and Health Information Exchange/*classification and Humans and Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Barr",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to reduce target symptoms in a scalable, affordable, and empirically supported way. DHIs that involve coaching or clinical support often collect text data from 2 sources: (1) open correspondence between users and the trained practitioners supporting them through a messaging system and (2) text data recorded during the intervention by users, such as diary entries. Natural language processing (NLP) offers methods for analyzing text, augmenting the understanding of intervention effects, and informing therapeutic decision making. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a technical framework that supports the automated analysis of both types of text data often present in DHIs. This framework generates text features and helps to build statistical models to predict target variables, including user engagement, symptom change, and therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: We first discussed various NLP techniques and demonstrated how they are implemented in the presented framework. We then applied the framework in a case study of the Healthy Body Image Program, a Web-based intervention trial for eating disorders (EDs). A total of 372 participants who screened positive for an ED received a DHI aimed at reducing ED psychopathology (including binge eating and purging behaviors) and improving body image. These users generated 37,228 intervention text snippets and exchanged 4285 user-coach messages, which were analyzed using the proposed model. RESULTS: We applied the framework to predict binge eating behavior, resulting in an area under the curve between 0.57 (when applied to new users) and 0.72 (when applied to new symptom reports of known users). In addition, initial evidence indicated that specific text features predicted the therapeutic outcome of reducing ED symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The case study demonstrates the usefulness of a structured approach to text data analytics. NLP techniques improve the prediction of symptom changes in DHIs.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of mobile phone usage among medical residents and to explore their attitudes, perceptions, and the challenges they experience when using mobile phones in academic and clinical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on all 133 residents in 17 different specialties across two large academic hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The Web-based validated questionnaire measured mobile phone platform preferences, and their uses in general and medical practice. The perception of confidentiality and safety impact of using mobile phones for communication and accessing patient's data was also explored, alongside challenges of use and how residents learn to use their mobile phone. RESULTS: With a response rate of 101/133 (75.9%) and mean age of 27.8 (SD 3.0) years, we found that 100/101 (99.0%) of participants were mobile phone users with mean duration of use of 5.12 (SD 2.4) years, and a range from 1 to 12 years. There was no significant difference in use between male and female respondents. A negative linear correlation was found between age and use duration (P=.004). The most common operating system used by participants was the iOS platform (55/101, 54.5%), with English the most commonly used language to operate residents' mobile phones (96/100, 96.0%) despite their native language being Arabic. For communication outside medical practice, chatting applications such as WhatsApp matched phone calls as most commonly used tools (each 88/101, 87.1%). These were also the primary tools for medical communication, but used at a lower rate (each 65/101, 64.4%). In medical practice, drug (83/101, 82.2%) and medical (80/101, 79.2%) references and medical calculation applications (61/101, 60.4%) were the most commonly used. Short battery life (48/92, 52%) was the most common technical difficulty, and distraction at least on a weekly basis (54/92, 58%) was the most likely side effect of using a mobile phone in medical practice. Practically, all participants agreed with the idea of integrating medical staff mobile phones with the hospital information system. Most residents described themselves as self-learners, while half learned from peers, and a quarter learned from the Internet. Only 7/101 (6.9%) had received formal training on the medical use of mobile phones. Over half of residents thought it was safe to discuss patients over their personal, nonencrypted email.

B.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Unlocking the data contained within both structured and unstructured components of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to provide a step change in data available for secondary research use, generation of actionable medical insights, hospital management, and trial recruitment. To achieve this, we implemented SemEHR, an open source semantic search and analytics tool for EHRs. METHODS: SemEHR implements a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval infrastructure by identifying contextualized mentions of a wide range of biomedical concepts within EHRs. Natural language processing annotations are further assembled at the patient level and extended with EHR-specific knowledge to generate a timeline for each patient. The semantic data are serviced via ontology-based search and analytics interfaces. RESULTS: SemEHR has been deployed at a number of UK hospitals, including the Clinical Record Interactive Search, an anonymized replica of the EHR of the UK South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, one of Europe's largest providers of mental health services. In 2 Clinical Record Interactive Search-based studies, SemEHR achieved 93% (hepatitis C) and 99% (HIV) F-measure results in identifying true positive patients. At King's College Hospital in London, as part of the CogStack program (github.com/cogstack), SemEHR is being used to recruit patients into the UK Department of Health 100 000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk). The validation study suggests that the tool can validate previously recruited cases and is very fast at searching phenotypes; time for recruitment criteria checking was reduced from days to minutes. Validated on open intensive care EHR data, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, the vital signs extracted by SemEHR can achieve around 97% accuracy.

Trained staff (or ""moderators"") may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. OBJECTIVE: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. METHODS: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. RESULTS: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (""drink,"" ""relapse,"" ""depression,"" and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in language use can distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive issues.",2018,10.2196/10136,20,6,e10136,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*health communication and *self-help groups and *social support and *substance-related disorders and *supervised machine learning and Education, Distance and Female and health communication and Humans and Linguistics/*methods and Machine Learning/*trends and Male and self-help groups and social support and substance-related disorders and Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology and supervised machine learning",NA,NA,2018/06/12/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The MOSAIC dashboard system is based on predictive modeling, longitudinal data analytics, and the reuse and integration of data from hospitals and public health repositories. Data are merged into an i2b2 data warehouse, which feeds a set of advanced temporal analytic models, including temporal abstractions, care-flow mining, drug exposure pattern detection, and risk-prediction models for type 2 diabetes complications. The dashboard has 2 components, designed for (1) clinical decision support during follow-up consultations and (2) outcome assessment on populations of interest. To assess the impact of the clinical decision support component, a pre-post study was conducted considering visit duration, number of screening examinations, and lifestyle interventions. A pilot sample of 700 Italian patients was investigated. Judgments on the outcome assessment component were obtained via focus groups with clinicians and health care managers. RESULTS: The use of the decision support component in clinical activities produced a reduction in visit duration (P << .01) and an increase in the number of screening exams for complications (P < .01). We also observed a relevant, although nonstatistically significant, increase in the proportion of patients receiving lifestyle interventions (from 69% to 77%). Regarding the outcome assessment component, focus groups highlighted the system's capability of identifying and understanding the characteristics of patient subgroups treated at the center.

Lowres_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Use of a Machine Learning Program to Correctly Triage Incoming Text Messaging Replies From a Cardiovascular Text-Based Secondary Prevention Program: Feasibility Study,"Lowres, Nicole and Duckworth, Andrew and Redfern, Julie and Thiagalingam, Aravinda and Chow, Clara K.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: SMS text messaging programs are increasingly being used for secondary prevention, and have been shown to be effective in a number of health conditions including cardiovascular disease. SMS text messaging programs have the potential to increase the reach of an intervention, at a reduced cost, to larger numbers of people who may not access traditional programs. However, patients regularly reply to the SMS text messages, leading to additional staffing requirements to monitor and moderate the patients' SMS text messaging replies. This additional staff requirement directly impacts the cost-effectiveness and scalability of SMS text messaging interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the feasibility and accuracy of developing a machine learning (ML) program to triage SMS text messaging replies (ie, identify which SMS text messaging replies require a health professional review). METHODS: SMS text messaging replies received from 2 clinical trials were manually coded (1) into ""Is staff review required?"" (binary response of yes/no); and then (2) into 12 general categories. Five ML models (Naive Bayes, OneVsRest, Random Forest Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Multilayer Perceptron) and an ensemble model were tested. For each model run, data were randomly allocated into training set (2183/3118, 70.01%) and test set (935/3118, 29.98%). Accuracy for the yes/no classification was calculated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), false positives, and false negatives. Accuracy for classification into 12 categories was compared using multiclass classification evaluators. RESULTS: A manual review of 3118 SMS text messaging replies showed that 22.00% (686/3118) required staff review. For determining need for staff review, the Multilayer Perceptron model had highest accuracy (AUC 0.86; 4.85% false negatives; and 4.63% false positives); with addition of heuristics (specified keywords) fewer false negatives were identified (3.19%), with small increase in false positives (7.66%) and AUC 0.79. Application of this model would result in 26.7% of SMS text messaging replies requiring review (true + false positives). The ensemble model produced the lowest false negatives (1.43%) at the expense of higher false positives (16.19%). OneVsRest was the most accurate (72.3%) for the 12-category classification. CONCLUSIONS: The ML program has high sensitivity for identifying the SMS text messaging replies requiring staff input; however, future research is required to validate the models against larger data sets. Incorporation of an ML program to review SMS text messaging replies could significantly reduce staff workload, as staff would not have to review all incoming SMS text messages. This could lead to substantial improvements in cost-effectiveness, scalability, and capacity of SMS text messaging-based interventions.",2020,10.2196/19200,8,6,e19200,eng,2291-5222,"*eHealth and *machine learning, secondary prevention, SMS text messaging, cardiovascular, mHealth, digital health, mobile phone and *Text Messaging and Bayes Theorem and eHealth and Feasibility Studies and Humans and Machine Learning and machine learning, secondary prevention, SMS text messaging, cardiovascular, mHealth, digital health, mobile phone and Secondary Prevention and Triage",NA,NA,2020/06/16/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lin_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Exploring Public Awareness of Overwork Prevention With Big Data From Google Trends: Retrospective Analysis,"Lin, Ro-Ting and Cheng, Yawen and Jiang, Yan-Cheng",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: To improve working conditions and prevent illness and deaths related to overwork, the Taiwanese government in 2015, 2016, and 2018 amended regulations regarding working time, overtime, shifts, and rest days. Such policy changes may lead to a rising public awareness of overwork-related issues, which may in turn reinforce policy development. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate to what extent public awareness of overwork-related issues correlated with policy changes. METHODS: Policies, laws, and regulations promulgated or amended in Taiwan between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified. We defined 3 working conditions (overwork, long working hours, and high job stress) related to overwork prevention, generated a keyword for each condition, and extracted the search volumes for each keyword on the Google search engine as proxy indicators of public awareness. We then calculated the monthly percentage change in the search volumes using the Joinpoint Regression Program. RESULTS: Apparent peaks in search volumes were observed immediately after policy changes. Especially, policy changes in 2010 were followed by a remarkable peak in search volumes for both overwork and working hours, with the search volumes for overwork increased by 29% per month from June 2010 to March 2011. This increase was preceded by the implementation of new overwork recognition guidelines and media reports of several suspected overwork-related events. The search volumes for working hours also steadily increased, by 2% per month in September 2013 and afterward, reaching a peak in January 2017. The peak was likely due to the amendment to the Labor Standards Act, which called for ""1 fixed and 1 flexible day off per week,"" in 2016. The search volumes for job stress significantly increased (P=.026) but only by 0.4% per month since March 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 15 years, Taiwanese authorities have revised and implemented several policies to prevent overwork-related health problems. Our study suggests a relationship between the implementation of policies that clearly defined the criteria for overwork and working hours and the rising public awareness of the importance of overwork prevention and shorter working hours.",2020,10.2196/18181,22,6,e18181,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*big data and *Big Data and *overwork and *policy and *working hours and big data and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Humans and overwork and policy and Retrospective Studies and Search Engine/*methods and Work Schedule Tolerance/*psychology and working hours",NA,NA,2020/06/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test has a high risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis; therefore, it is not routinely recommended. Rather, men are encouraged to make individualized decisions with their medical providers, after being fully informed about its potential benefits, limitations, and risks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development and pilot testing of an interactive Web-based decision aid (DA; Prostate Cancer Screening Preparation [PCSPrep]) for African American men, designed to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening. METHODS: Four focus groups (n=33) were conducted to assess men's reactions to DAs developed in prior studies and gather information to modify the content and format. The pilot test employed a pre-posttest evaluation design. A convenience sample of 41 men aged 45-70 years with no history of prostate cancer was recruited from community settings. Participants completed online surveys before and after using PCSPrep that assessed prostate cancer screening knowledge, decision self-efficacy, decisional conflict, and preparation for decision making. RESULTS: Use of PCSPrep was associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer knowledge (49% vs 62% correct responses; P<.001), and men also experienced less decisional conflict (24 vs 15 on a scale of 0-100; P=.008). No changes in self-efficacy about decision making or screening preferences were observed. Most men (81%) reported that using PCSPrep prepared them to make informed decisions in partnership with their provider. CONCLUSIONS: PCSPrep was an acceptable DA that improved men's knowledge, reduced decisional conflict, and promoted the perception of being prepared for shared decision making.

This has prompted hospital initiatives to increase patient flow and minimize nonvalue added care time. Real-time demand capacity management (RTDC) is one such initiative whereby clinicians convene each morning to predict patients able to leave the same day and prioritize their remaining tasks for early discharge. Our objective is to automate and improve these discharge predictions by applying supervised machine learning methods to readily available health information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors use supervised machine learning methods to predict patients' likelihood of discharge by 2 p.m. and by midnight each day for an inpatient medical unit. Using data collected over 8000 patient stays and 20 000 patient days, the predictive performance of the model is compared to clinicians using sensitivity, specificity, Youden's Index (i.e., sensitivity + specificity - 1), and aggregate accuracy measures. RESULTS: The model compared to clinician predictions demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (P < .01), lower specificity (P < .01), and a comparable Youden Index (P > .10). Early discharges were less predictable than midnight discharges. The model was more accurate than clinicians in predicting the total number of daily discharges and capable of ranking patients closest to future discharge. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential to use readily available health information to predict daily patient discharges with accuracies comparable to clinician predictions. This approach may be used to automate and support daily RTDC predictions aimed at improving patient flow.",2016,10.1093/jamia/ocv106,23,e1,e10-e2,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Hospital Administration and *Length of Stay and *Machine Learning and *Patient Discharge and Academic Medical Centers and Adult and Aged and Female and Humans and length of stay and machine learning and Male and Maryland and Middle Aged and operational forecasting and patient flow and Workflow and Workload,NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the multiplicity of sources and flow of data mean that efficient access to useful information and knowledge production has become a major challenge. This challenge can be addressed by taking inspiration from Web 2.0 and particularly social networks, which are at the forefront of big data exploration and human-data interaction. OBJECTIVE: MyGeneFriends is a Web platform inspired by social networks, devoted to genetic disease analysis, and organized around three types of proactive agents: genes, humans, and genetic diseases. The aim of this study was to improve exploration and exploitation of biological, postgenomic era big data. METHODS: MyGeneFriends leverages conventions popularized by top social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc), such as networks of friends, profile pages, friendship recommendations, affinity scores, news feeds, content recommendation, and data visualization. RESULTS: MyGeneFriends provides simple and intuitive interactions with data through evaluation and visualization of connections (friendships) between genes, humans, and diseases. The platform suggests new friends and publications and allows agents to follow the activity of their friends. It dynamically personalizes information depending on the user's specific interests and provides an efficient way to share information with collaborators. Furthermore, the user's behavior itself generates new information that constitutes an added value integrated in the network, which can be used to discover new connections between biological agents.

Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard. RESULTS: The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier's performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85).

Yet medical organizations must establish unambiguous rules about patient and parental access to electronic patient portals. We conducted a national interview study to characterize the diversity in adolescent portal policies across a range of institutions and determine the factors influencing decisions about these policies. METHODS: Within a sampling framework that ensured diversity of geography and medical organization type, we used purposive and snowball sampling to identify key informants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis, followed by a member check. RESULTS: We interviewed informants from 25 medical organizations. Policies established different degrees of adolescent access (from none to partial to complete), access ages (from 10 to 18 years), degrees of parental access, and types of information considered sensitive. Federal and state law did not dominate policy decisions. Other factors in the decision process were: technology capabilities; differing patient population needs; resources; community expectations; balance between information access and privacy; balance between promoting autonomy and promoting family shared decision-making; and tension between teen privacy and parental preferences. Some informants believed that clearer standards would simplify policy-making; others worried that standards could restrict high-quality polices.

We investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for automated annotation of medical topics in patient-provider dialog transcripts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to predict talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers, support vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential models that integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional random fields, hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent units). RESULTS: Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1) classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1 scores at the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential models had higher classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher precision at the visit level. Independent models had higher recall scores at the visit level compared with sequential models. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out noisy information from talk-turns.

Supervised machine learning methods can be used to train phenotype classifiers in a high-throughput manner using imperfectly labeled data. We developed 10 phenotype classifiers using this approach and evaluated performance across multiple sites within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed classifiers using the Automated PHenotype Routine for Observational Definition, Identification, Training and Evaluation (APHRODITE) R-package, an open-source framework for learning phenotype classifiers using datasets in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. We labeled training data based on the presence of multiple mentions of disease-specific codes. Performance was evaluated on cohorts derived using rule-based definitions and real-world disease prevalence. Classifiers were developed and evaluated across 3 medical centers, including 1 international site. RESULTS: Compared to the multiple mentions labeling heuristic, classifiers showed a mean recall boost of 0.43 with a mean precision loss of 0.17. Performance decreased slightly when classifiers were shared across medical centers, with mean recall and precision decreasing by 0.08 and 0.01, respectively, at a site within the USA, and by 0.18 and 0.10, respectively, at an international site. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a high-throughput pipeline for constructing and sharing phenotype classifiers across sites within the OHDSI network using APHRODITE.

Razavi_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Depression screening using mobile phone usage metadata: a machine learning approach,"Razavi, Rouzbeh and Gharipour, Amin and Gharipour, Mojgan",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Depression is currently the second most significant contributor to non-fatal disease burdens globally. While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients' mobile usage patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory-2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score <e2><89><a5> 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified. RESULTS: Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants' age and gender were included. DISCUSSIONS/CONCLUSION: The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments. Moreover, the input variables used in this study were aggregated mobile usage metadata attributes, which has low privacy sensitivity making it more likely for patients to grant required application permissions.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocz221,27,4,522-530,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Algorithms and *depression and *machine learning and *Machine Learning and *Mobile Applications and *mobile health and *mobile usage and *Telemedicine and Adult and Area Under Curve and Cell Phone Use/*statistics & numerical data and depression and Depression/classification/*diagnosis and Depressive Disorder/diagnosis and Humans and Logistic Models and machine learning and mobile health and mobile usage and Neural Networks, Computer and Sensitivity and Specificity and Severity of Illness Index and Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,NA,2020/04/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

A generally accepted criterion to formulate evidence is to use the PICO framework, where PICO stands for Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome. Automatic extraction of PICO-related sentences from medical literature is crucial to the success of many EBM applications. In this work, we present our Aceso system, which automatically generates PICO-based evidence summaries from medical literature. In Aceso (1), we adopt an active learning paradigm, which helps to minimize the cost of manual labeling and to optimize the quality of summarization with limited labeled data. An UMLS2Vec model is proposed to learn a vector representation of medical concepts in UMLS (2), and we fuse the embedding of medical knowledge with textual features in summarization.

Adams",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: In the context of the Affordable Care Act, there is extensive emphasis on making provider quality transparent and publicly available. Online public reports of quality exist, but little is known about how visitors find reports or about their purpose in visiting. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we gathered website analytics data from a national group of online public reports of hospital or physician quality and surveyed real-time visitors to those websites. METHODS: Websites were recruited from a national group of online public reports of hospital or physician quality. Analytics data were gathered from each website: number of unique visitors, method of arrival for each unique visitor, and search terms resulting in visits. Depending on the website, a survey invitation was launched for unique visitors on landing pages or on pages with quality information. Survey topics included type of respondent (eg, consumer, health care professional), purpose of visit, areas of interest, website experience, and demographics. RESULTS: There were 116,657 unique visitors to the 18 participating websites (1440 unique visitors/month per website), with most unique visitors arriving through search (63.95%, 74,606/116,657). Websites with a higher percent of traffic from search engines garnered more unique visitors (P=.001). The most common search terms were for individual hospitals (23.25%, 27,122/74,606) and website names (19.43%, 22,672/74,606); medical condition terms were uncommon (0.81%, 605/74,606). Survey view rate was 42.48% (49,560/116,657 invited) resulting in 1755 respondents (participation rate=3.6%). There were substantial proportions of consumer (48.43%, 850/1755) and health care professional respondents (31.39%, 551/1755). Across websites, proportions of consumer (21%-71%) and health care professional respondents (16%-48%) varied. Consumers were frequently interested in using the information to choose providers or assess the quality of their provider (52.7%, 225/427); the majority of those choosing a provider reported that they had used the information to do so (78%, 40/51). Health care professional (26.6%, 115/443) and consumer (20.8%, 92/442) respondents wanted cost information and consumers wanted patient narrative comments (31.5%, 139/442) on the public reports. Health care professional respondents rated the experience on the reports higher than consumers did (mean 7.2, SD 2.2 vs mean 6.2, SD 2.7; scale 0-10; P<.001).

The ability to analyze conversations about e-cigarettes in real-time can provide important insight into trends in the public's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding e-cigarettes, and subsequently guide public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to establish a supervised machine learning algorithm to build predictive classification models that assess Twitter data for a range of factors related to e-cigarettes. METHODS: Manual content analysis was conducted for 17,098 tweets. These tweets were coded for five categories: e-cigarette relevance, sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Machine learning classification models were then built for each of these five categories, and word groupings (n-grams) were used to define the feature space for each classifier. RESULTS: Predictive performance scores for classification models indicated that the models correctly labeled the tweets with the appropriate variables between 68.40% and 99.34% of the time, and the percentage of maximum possible improvement over a random baseline that was achieved by the classification models ranged from 41.59% to 80.62%. Classifiers with the highest performance scores that also achieved the highest percentage of the maximum possible improvement over a random baseline were Policy/Government (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 80.62%), Relevance (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 75.26%), Ad or Promotion (performance: 0.89; % improvement: 72.69%), and Marketing (performance: 0.91; % improvement: 72.56%). The most appropriate word-grouping unit (n-gram) was 1 for the majority of classifiers. Performance continued to marginally increase with the size of the training dataset of manually annotated data, but eventually leveled off. Even at low dataset sizes of 4000 observations, performance characteristics were fairly sound. CONCLUSIONS: Social media outlets like Twitter can uncover real-time snapshots of personal sentiment, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior that are not as accessible, at this scale, through any other offline platform. Using the vast data available through social media presents an opportunity for social science and public health methodologies to utilize computational methodologies to enhance and extend research and practice. This study was successful in automating a complex five-category manual content analysis of e-cigarette-related content on Twitter using machine learning techniques.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cancer Registry Control Panel (CRCP) was developed to detect mentions of reportable cancer cases using a pipeline built on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture - Asynchronous Scaleout (UIMA-AS) architecture containing the National Library of Medicine's UIMA MetaMap annotator as well as a variety of rule-based UIMA annotators that primarily act to filter out concepts referring to nonreportable cancers. CRCP inspects pathology reports nightly to identify pathology records containing relevant cancer concepts and combines this with diagnosis codes from the Clinical Electronic Data Warehouse to identify candidate cancer patients using supervised machine learning. Cancer mentions are highlighted in all candidate clinical notes and then sorted in CRCP's web interface for faster validation by cancer registrars. RESULTS: CRCP achieved an accuracy of 0.872 and detected reportable cancer cases with a precision of 0.843 and a recall of 0.848. CRCP increases throughput by 22.6% over a baseline (manual review) pathology report inspection system while achieving a higher precision and recall. Depending on registrar time constraints, CRCP can increase recall to 0.939 at the expense of precision by incorporating a data source information feature. CONCLUSION: CRCP demonstrates accurate results when applying natural language processing features to the problem of detecting patients with cases of reportable cancer from clinical notes.

Our task is to determine whether the goal assigned by the CM can be achieved in a timely manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our data consists of CM structured and unstructured records from a private firm in Orlando, FL. The CM data is based on phone interactions between the CM and the patient. A portion of the data has been manually annotated to indicate engagement. We present 2 machine learning classifiers: an engagement model and a goal attainment model. RESULTS: We can successfully distinguish automatically between engagement and lack of engagement. Subsequently, incorporating engagement and features from textual information from the unstructured notes significantly improves goal attainment classification. DISCUSSION: Two key challenges in this task were the time-consuming annotation effort for engagement classification and the limited amount of data for the more difficult goal attainment class (specifically, for people who take a long time to achieve their goals). We successfully explore domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques to improve performance on the under-represented classes. We also explore the value of using features from unstructured notes to improve the model and interpretability.

Roland_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Preliminary Evidence for the Emergence of a Health Care Online Community of Practice: Using a Netnographic Framework for Twitter Hashtag Analytics,"Roland, Damian and Spurr, Jesse and Cabrera, Daniel",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Online communities of practice (oCoPs) may emerge from interactions on social media. These communities offer an open digital space and flat role hierarchy for information sharing and provide a strong group identity, rapid flow of information, content curation, and knowledge translation. To date, there is only a small body of evidence in medicine or health care to verify the existence of an oCoP. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the emergence of an oCoP through the study of social media interactions of the free open access medical education (FOAM) movement. METHODS: We examined social media activity in Twitter by analyzing the network centrality metrics of tweets with the #FOAMed hashtag and compared them with previously validated criteria of a community of practice (CoP). RESULTS: The centrality analytics of the FOAM community showed concordance with aspects of a general CoP (in terms of community, domain, and practice), as well as some specific traits of a health care community, including social control, common purpose, flat hierarchy, and network-based and concrete achievement. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated preliminary evidence of an oCoP focused on education and based on social media interactions.

M. and Linn, Annemiek J.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly taking an active role in their health. In doing so, they combine both mass and interpersonal media to gratify their cognitive and affective needs (ie, convergence). Owing to methodological challenges when studying convergence, a detailed view of how patients are using different types of media for needs fulfillment is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain insight into the frequency of reported convergence, how convergence affects what posters write online, motives for posting, and the needs posters are trying to fulfill. METHODS: Using a hybrid method of content analysis and supervised machine learning, this study used naturally available data to fill this research gap. We analyzed opening posts (N=1708) of an online forum targeting cancer patients and their relatives (Kanker.nl). RESULTS: Nearly one-third of the forum opening posts contained signs of convergence in mass or interpersonal media. Posts containing mass media references disclosed less personal information and were more geared toward community enhancement and sharing experiences compared to posts without convergence. Furthermore, compared to posts without signs of convergence, posts that included interpersonal media references disclosed more personal information, and posters were more likely to ask for the experiences of fellow users to fulfill their needs. Within posts containing signs of convergence, posts including interpersonal media references reported fewer shortages of information, disclosed more information about the disease, and were more active in seeking other posters' experiences compared to posts containing mass media references. CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights the intertwining of media platforms for patients. The insights of this study can be used to adapt the health care system toward a new type of health information-seeking behavior in which one medium is not trusted to fulfill all needs.

METHODS: Large-scale qualitative data were obtained from Dailystrength.org. Based on a hand-coded training dataset, all posts were classified into informational or emotional using a Bayesian classification algorithm to generalize the findings. Posts that could not be classified with a probability of at least 75% were excluded. RESULTS: The overall tendency toward emotional posts differs by condition: mental health (depression, schizophrenia) and Alzheimer's disease consist of more emotional posts, while informational posts relate more to nonterminal physical conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, asthma). There is no gender difference across conditions, although prostate cancer forums are oriented toward informational support, whereas breast cancer forums rather feature emotional support. Across diseases, the best predictors for emotional content are lower age and a higher number of overall posts by the support group member. DISCUSSION: The results are in line with previous empirical research and unify empirical findings from single/2-condition research. Limitations include the analytical restriction to predefined categories (informational, emotional) through the chosen machine-learning approach.

Johnson_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Use of Mobile Health Apps and Wearable Technology to Assess Changes and Predict Pain During Treatment of Acute Pain in Sickle Cell Disease: Feasibility Study,"Johnson, Amanda and Yang, Fan and Gollarahalli, Siddharth and Banerjee, Tanvi and Abrams, Daniel and Jonassaint, Jude and Jonassaint, Charles and Shah, Nirmish",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder affecting millions worldwide, and it results in many potential medical complications throughout the life course. The hallmark of SCD is pain. Many patients experience daily chronic pain as well as intermittent, unpredictable acute vaso-occlusive painful episodes called pain crises. These pain crises often require acute medical care through the day hospital or emergency department. Following presentation, a number of these patients are subsequently admitted with continued efforts of treatment focused on palliative pain control and hydration for management. Mitigating pain crises is challenging for both the patients and their providers, given the perceived unpredictability and subjective nature of pain. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to show the feasibility of using objective, physiologic measurements obtained from a wearable device during an acute pain crisis to predict patient-reported pain scores (in an app and to nursing staff) using machine learning techniques. METHODS: For this feasibility study, we enrolled 27 adult patients presenting to the day hospital with acute pain. At the beginning of pain treatment, each participant was given a wearable device (Microsoft Band 2) that collected physiologic measurements. Pain scores from our mobile app, Technology Resources to Understand Pain Assessment in Patients with Pain, and those obtained by nursing staff were both used with wearable signals to complete time stamp matching and feature extraction and selection. Following this, we constructed regression and classification machine learning algorithms to build between-subject pain prediction models. RESULTS: Patients were monitored for an average of 3.79 (SD 2.23) hours, with an average of 5826 (SD 2667) objective data values per patient. As expected, we found that pain scores and heart rate decreased for most patients during the course of their stay. Using the wearable sensor data and pain scores, we were able to create a regression model to predict subjective pain scores with a root mean square error of 1.430 and correlation between observations and predictions of 0.706. Furthermore, we verified the hypothesis that the regression model outperformed the classification model by comparing the performances of the support vector machines (SVM) and the SVM for regression. CONCLUSIONS: The Microsoft Band 2 allowed easy collection of objective, physiologic markers during an acute pain crisis in adults with SCD. Features can be extracted from these data signals and matched with pain scores. Machine learning models can then use these features to feasibly predict patient pain scores.",2019,10.2196/13671,7,12,e13671,eng,2291-5222,"*machine learning and *pain and *SCD and *sickle cell disease and Acute Pain/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology and Adult and Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use and Anemia, Sickle Cell/epidemiology/*physiopathology and Emergency Service, Hospital and Feasibility Studies and Female and Heart Rate/physiology and Hospitalization and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and Male and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications and Nursing Staff and pain and Pain Management/methods and Pain Measurement/instrumentation and Predictive Value of Tests and SCD and sickle cell disease and Support Vector Machine and Telemedicine/*instrumentation and Wearable Electronic Devices/*adverse effects",NA,NA,2019/12/02/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are emerging to improve smoking cessation treatments. Previous approaches have proposed supporting cessation with tailored motivational messages. Some managed to provide short-term improvements in smoking cessation. Yet, these approaches were either static in terms of personalization or human-based nonscalable solutions. Additionally, long-term effects were neither presented nor assessed in combination with existing psychopharmacological therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the long-term efficacy of a mobile app supporting psychopharmacological therapy for smoking cessation and complementarily assess the involved innovative technology. METHODS: A 12-month, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial comparing smoking cessation rates was performed at Virgen del Rocio University Hospital in Seville (Spain). Smokers were randomly allocated to a control group (CG) receiving usual care (psychopharmacological treatment, n=120) or an intervention group (IG) receiving psychopharmacological treatment and using a mobile app providing artificial intelligence-generated and tailored smoking cessation support messages (n=120). The secondary objectives were to analyze health-related quality of life and monitor healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits. Safety was assessed according to the presence of adverse events related to the pharmacological therapy. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Incomplete data and multinomial regression analyses were performed to assess the variables influencing participant cessation probability. The technical solution was assessed according to the precision of the tailored motivational smoking cessation messages and user engagement. Cessation and no cessation subgroups were compared using t tests. A voluntary satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of the intervention to all participants who completed the trial. RESULTS: In the IG, abstinence was 2.75 times higher (adjusted OR 3.45, P=.01) in the per-protocol analysis and 2.15 times higher (adjusted OR 3.13, P=.002) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Lost data analysis and multinomial logistic models showed different patterns in participants who dropped out. Regarding safety, 14 of 120 (11.7%) IG participants and 13 of 120 (10.8%) CG participants had 19 and 23 adverse events, respectively (P=.84). None of the clinical secondary objective measures showed relevant differences between the groups. The system was able to learn and tailor messages for improved effectiveness in supporting smoking cessation but was unable to reduce the time between a message being sent and opened. In either case, there was no relevant difference between the cessation and no cessation subgroups. However, a significant difference was found in system engagement at 6 months (P=.04) but not in all subsequent months. High system appreciation was reported at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed mHealth solution complementing psychopharmacological therapy showed greater efficacy for achieving 1-year tobacco abstinence as compared with psychopharmacological therapy alone. It provides a basis for artificial intelligence-based future approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03553173; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03553173.

The development of mobile technologies and apps shows similar trends in PTSD treatment. Therefore, this emerging research field has received substantial attention. Consequently, various research settings are planned for current and further studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the scientific patterns of research domains related to mobile apps and other technologies for PTSD treatment in scholarly publications, and to suggest further studies for this emerging research field. METHODS: We conducted a bibliometric analysis to identify publication patterns, most important keywords, trends for topicality, and text analysis, along with construction of a word cloud for papers published in the last decade (2010 to 2019). Research questions were formulated based on the relevant literature. In particular, we concentrated on highly ranked sources. Based on the proven bibliometric approach, the data were ultimately retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics). RESULTS: A total of 64 studies were found concerning the research domains. The vast majority of the papers were written in the English language (63/64, 98%) with the remaining article (1/64, 2%) written in French. The articles were written by 323 authors/coauthors from 11 different countries, with the United States predominating, followed by England, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Sweden, and Vietnam. The most common publication type was peer-reviewed journal articles (48/64, 75%), followed by reviews (8/64, 13%), meeting abstracts (5/64, 8%), news items (2/64, 3%), and a proceeding (1/64, 2%). There was a mean of 6.4 papers published per year over the study period. There was a 100% increase in the number of publications published from 2016 to 2019 with a mean of 13.33 papers published per year during this latter period. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of papers on mobile technologies for PTSD was quite low in the early period, there has been an overall increase in this research domain in recent years (2016-2019). Overall, these findings indicate that mobile health tools in combination with traditional treatment for mental disorders among veterans increase the efficiency of health interventions, including reducing PTSD symptoms, improving quality of life, conducting intervention evaluation, and monitoring of improvements. Mobile apps and technologies can be used as supportive tools in managing pain, anger, stress, and sleep disturbance. These findings therefore provide a useful overview of the publication trends on research domains that can inform further studies and highlight potential gaps in this field.",2020,10.2196/19391,8,11,e19391,eng,2291-5222,"*bibliometric and *Bibliometrics and *co-word analysis and *Mobile Applications and *mobile apps and *mobile technologies and *posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and *Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/therapy and *text analysis and *treatment and *Web of Science and bibliometric and co-word analysis and Humans and mobile apps and mobile technologies and Periodicals as Topic and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Quality of Life and text analysis and treatment and United States and Web of Science",NA,NA,2020/11/26/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the global development of scientific publications and constructed interdisciplinary research topics on the theory and practice of AI in medicine from 1977 to 2018. METHODS: We obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape. RESULTS: The applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources. CONCLUSIONS: The application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies.

Social networks allow individuals with mental disorders to communicate with others sufferers via online communities, providing an invaluable resource for studies on textual signs of psychological health problems. Mental disorders often occur in combinations, e.g., a patient with an anxiety disorder may also develop depression. This co-occurring mental health condition provides the focus for our work on classifying online communities with an interest in depression. For this, we have crawled a large body of 620 000 posts made by 80 000 users in 247 online communities. We have extracted the topics and psycholinguistic features expressed in the posts, using these as inputs to our model. Following a machine learning technique, we have formulated a joint modeling framework in order to classify mental health-related co-occurring online communities from these features.

User input is commonly limited to ""like/dislike"" post- intervention consumer satisfaction ratings or device or application specific user analytics such as usability. However, to produce successful mHealth applications with lasting effects on health behaviors it is crucial to obtain user input from the start of each project and throughout development. The aim of this tutorial is to illustrate how qualitative methods in an iterative process of development have been used in two separate behavior change interventions (targeting smoking and alcohol) delivered through mobile technologies (ie, text messaging). A series of focus groups were conducted to assist in translating a face-to-face smoking cessation intervention onto a text message (short message service, SMS) delivered format. Both focus groups and an advisory panel were used to shape the delivery and content of a text message delivered intervention for alcohol risk reduction. An in vivo method of constructing message content was used to develop text message content that was consistent with the notion of texting as ""fingered speech"". Formative research conducted with the target population using a participatory framework led to important changes in our approach to intervention structure, content development, and delivery. Using qualitative methods and an iterative approach that blends consumer-driven and investigator-driven aims can produce paradigm-shifting, novel intervention applications that maximize the likelihood of use by the target audience and their potential impact on health behaviors.",2015,10.2196/mhealth.3779,3,1,e22,eng,2291-5222,alcohol and mHealth and qualitative methods and smoking cessation and text message,NA,NA,2015/02/24/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bent_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Wearables in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: What Are They Good for?,"Bent, Brinnae and Dunn, Jessilyn P.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Recently, companies such as Apple Inc, Fitbit Inc, and Garmin Ltd have released new wearable blood oxygenation measurement technologies. Although the release of these technologies has great potential for generating health-related information, it is important to acknowledge the repercussions of consumer-targeted biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs), which in practice, are often used for medical decision making. BioMeTs are bodily connected digital medicine products that process data captured by mobile sensors that use algorithms to generate measures of behavioral and physiological function. These BioMeTs span both general wellness products and medical devices, and consumer-targeted BioMeTs intended for general wellness purposes are not required to undergo a standardized and transparent evaluation process for ensuring their quality and accuracy. The combination of product functionality, marketing, and the circumstances of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have inevitably led to the use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs for reporting health-related measurements to drive medical decision making. In this viewpoint, we urge consumer-targeted BioMeT manufacturers to go beyond the bare minimum requirements described in US Food and Drug Administration guidance when releasing information on wellness BioMeTs. We also explore new methods and incentive systems that may result in a clearer public understanding of the performance and intended use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs.",2020,10.2196/25137,8,12,e25137,eng,2291-5222,*COVID-19 and *digital health and *digital medicine and *mHealth and *pandemic and *Pandemics and *sensors and *validation and *wearables and COVID-19 and digital health and digital medicine and Fitness Trackers/*trends and Humans and mHealth and pandemic and sensors and validation and Wearable Electronic Devices/adverse effects/*standards and wearables,NA,NA,2020/12/22/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which has infected over 2,300,000 individuals and caused over 150,000 deaths, is an example of one of these catastrophic events. OBJECTIVE: We present a timely and novel methodology that combines disease estimates from mechanistic models and digital traces, via interpretable machine learning methodologies, to reliably forecast COVID-19 activity in Chinese provinces in real time. METHODS: Our method uses the following as inputs: (a) official health reports, (b) COVID-19-related internet search activity, (c) news media activity, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from a metapopulation mechanistic model. Our machine learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geospatial synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease observations characteristic of emerging outbreaks. RESULTS: Our model is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of the current time and outperforms a collection of baseline models in 27 out of 32 Chinese provinces.

CDRs are increasingly being used in research along with other forms of big data and represent an emerging data type with potential for public good. Many jurisdictions have infrastructures for health data research that could benefit from the integration of CDRs with health data. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review how CDRs have been used in health research and to identify challenges and potential opportunities for their wider use in conjunction with health data. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using structured search terms making use of major search engines. Initially, 4066 items were identified. Following screening, 46 full text articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Information extracted included research topic area, population of study, datasets used, information governance and ethical considerations, study findings, and data limitations. RESULTS: The majority of published studies were focused on low-income and middle-income countries. Making use of the location element in CDRs, studies often modeled the transmission of infectious diseases or estimated population movement following natural disasters with a view to implementing interventions. CDRs were used in anonymized or aggregated form, and the process of gaining regulatory approvals varied with data provider and by jurisdiction. None included public views on the use of CDRs in health research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite various challenges and limitations, anonymized mobile phone CDRs have been used successfully in health research. The use of aggregated data is a safeguard but also a further limitation. Greater opportunities could be gained if validated anonymized CDRs were integrated with routine health records at an individual level, provided that permissions and safeguards could be put in place.

In this paper, we examine the actual benefits of smart home-based analysis by monitoring daily behavior in the home and predicting clinical scores of the residents. To accomplish this goal, we propose a clinical assessment using activity behavior (CAAB) approach to model a smart home resident's daily behavior and predict the corresponding clinical scores. CAAB uses statistical features that describe characteristics of a resident's daily activity performance to train machine learning algorithms that predict the clinical scores. We evaluate the performance of CAAB utilizing smart home sensor data collected from 18 smart homes over two years. We obtain a statistically significant correlation ( r=0.72) between CAAB-predicted and clinician-provided cognitive scores and a statistically significant correlation ( r=0.45) between CAAB-predicted and clinician-provided mobility scores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records from 7 large health systems identified 19 061 056 outpatient visits to mental health specialty or general medical providers between 2009 and 2015. Machine learning models (logistic regression with penalized LASSO [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator] variable selection) were developed to predict suicide death (n = 1240) or probable suicide attempt (n = 24 133) in the following 90 days. Base models were used only historical insurance claims data and were then augmented with data regarding sociodemographic characteristics (race, ethnicity, and neighborhood characteristics), past patient-reported outcome questionnaires from electronic health records, and data (diagnoses and questionnaires) recorded during the visit. RESULTS: For prediction of any attempt following mental health specialty visits, a model limited to historical insurance claims data performed approximately as well (C-statistic 0.843) as a model using all available data (C-statistic 0.850). For prediction of suicide attempt following a general medical visit, addition of data recorded during the visit yielded a meaningful improvement over a model using all data up to the prior day (C-statistic 0.853 vs 0.838). DISCUSSION: Results may not generalize to setting with less comprehensive data or different patterns of care. Even the poorest-performing models were superior to brief self-report questionnaires or traditional clinical assessment.

The data contained in these records are irregular and contain multiple modalities such as notes, and medical codes. They are preempted by medical conditions the patient may have, and are typically recorded by medical staff. Accompanying codes are notes containing valuable information about patients beyond the structured information contained in electronic health records.

METHODS: Participatory design was used to develop Glucolyzer, an interactive tool featuring hierarchical clustering and a heatmap visualization to help registered dietitians (RDs) identify associative patterns between blood glucose levels and per-meal macronutrient composition for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Ten RDs participated in a within-subjects experiment to compare Glucolyzer to a static logbook format. For each representation, participants had 25 minutes to examine 1 month of diabetes self-monitoring data captured by an individual with T2DM and identify clinically meaningful patterns. We compared the quality and accuracy of the observations generated using each representation. RESULTS: Participants generated 50% more observations when using Glucolyzer (98) than when using the logbook format (64) without any loss in accuracy (69% accuracy vs 62%, respectively, p = .17). Participants identified more observations that included ingredients other than carbohydrates using Glucolyzer (36% vs 16%, p = .027). Fewer RDs reported feelings of information overload using Glucolyzer compared to the logbook format. Study participants displayed variable acceptance of hierarchical clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Visual analytics have the potential to mitigate provider concerns about the volume of self-monitoring data. Glucolyzer helped dietitians identify meaningful patterns in self-monitoring data without incurring perceived information overload.

Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. METHODS: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score>40) and low (<e2><89><a4>40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. RESULTS: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9% [107/160] and post=73.1% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17% and confidence=92%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31% and confidence=92%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 29 253 hospitalized adult sepsis patients between 2010 and 2013 in Northern California. We applied an unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to the orders, medications, and procedures recorded in the electronic health record within the first 24 hours of each patient's hospitalization to uncover empiric treatment topics across the cohort and to develop computable clinical signatures for each patient based on proportions of these topics. We evaluated how these topics correlated with common sepsis treatment and outcome metrics including inpatient mortality, time to first antibiotic, and fluids given within 24 hours. RESULTS: Mean age was 70 <c2><b1> 17 years with hospital mortality of 9.6%. We empirically identified 42 clinically recognizable treatment topics (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis, wound care, shock). Only 43.1% of hospitalizations had a single dominant topic, and a small minority (7.3%) had a single topic comprising at least 80% of their overall clinical signature. Across the entire sepsis cohort, clinical signatures were highly variable. DISCUSSION: Heterogeneity in sepsis is a major barrier to improving targeted treatments, yet existing approaches to characterizing clinical heterogeneity are narrowly defined. A machine learning approach captured substantial patient- and population-level heterogeneity in treatment during early sepsis hospitalization.

Park_2020_JoofmeInre_2,JOUR,Conversations and Medical News Frames on Twitter: Infodemiological Study on COVID-19 in South Korea,"Park, Han Woo and Park, Sejung and Chong, Miyoung",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles applying ML models to improve clinical decision-making using EHR data. We limited our search to papers published between 2015 and 2019. RESULTS: Across the 164 studies reviewed, demographic variables were inconsistently reported and/or included as model inputs. Race/ethnicity was not reported in 64%; gender and age were not reported in 24% and 21% of studies, respectively. Socioeconomic status of the population was not reported in 92% of studies. Studies that mentioned these variables often did not report if they were included as model inputs. Few models (12%) were validated using external populations.

Many studies have examined the technical performance of AI within an experimental context. These studies provide limited insights into the issues that its use in a real-world context of care and services raises. To help decision makers address these issues in a systemic and holistic manner, this viewpoint paper relies on the health technology assessment core model to contrast the expectations of the health sector toward the use of AI with the risks that should be mitigated for its responsible deployment. The analysis adopts the perspective of payers (ie, health system organizations and agencies) because of their central role in regulating, financing, and reimbursing novel technologies. This paper suggests that AI-based systems should be seen as a health system transformation lever, rather than a discrete set of technological devices. Their use could bring significant changes and impacts at several levels: technological, clinical, human and cognitive (patient and clinician), professional and organizational, economic, legal, and ethical. The assessment of AI's value proposition should thus go beyond technical performance and cost logic by performing a holistic analysis of its value in a real-world context of care and services.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed n = 6346 men and women enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2014. Prediabetes was defined using American Diabetes Association guidelines. The sample was randomly partitioned to training (n = 3174) and internal validation (n = 3172) sets. Feature selection algorithms were run on training data containing 156 preselected exposure variables. Four machine learning algorithms were applied on 46 exposure variables in original and resampled training datasets built using 4 resampling methods. Predictive models were tested on internal validation data (n = 3172) and external validation data (n = 3000) prepared from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Predictors were assessed by odds ratios in logistic models and variable importance in others. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prediabetes screening tool was the benchmark to compare model performance. RESULTS: Prediabetes prevalence was 23.43%. The CDC prediabetes screening tool produced 64.40% AUROC. Seven optimal (<e2><89><a5> 70% AUROC) models identified 25 predictors including 4 potentially novel associations; 20 by both logistic and other nonlinear/ensemble models and 5 solely by the latter. All optimal models outperformed the CDC prediabetes screening tool (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Combined use of feature selection and machine learning increased predictive performance outperforming the recommended screening tool. A range of predictors of prediabetes was identified.

Dental plaque can be identified using the light-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique that emits light at 405 nm. The LIF technique is more convenient than the commercial technique using a disclosing agent, but the result may vary for each individual as it still requires visual identification. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to introduce and validate a deep learning-based oral hygiene monitoring system that makes it easy to identify dental plaques at home. METHODS: We developed a LIF-based system consisting of a device that can visually identify dental plaques and a mobile app that displays the location and area of dental plaques on oral images. The mobile app is programmed to automatically determine the location and distribution of dental plaques using a deep learning-based algorithm and present the results to the user as time series data. The mobile app is also built with convergence of naive and web applications so that the algorithm is executed on a cloud server to efficiently distribute computing resources. RESULTS: The location and distribution of users' dental plaques could be identified via the hand-held LIF device or mobile app. The color correction filter in the device was developed using a color mixing technique. The mobile app was built as a hybrid app combining the functionalities of a native application and a web application. Through the scrollable WebView on the mobile app, changes in the time series of dental plaque could be confirmed. The algorithm for dental plaque detection was implemented to run on Amazon Web Services for object detection by single shot multibox detector and instance segmentation by Mask region-based convolutional neural network.

This is a complex and expensive process where investigators aim to enroll volunteers with predetermined characteristics, administer treatment(s), and collect safety and efficacy data. Therefore, choosing top-enrolling investigators is essential for efficient clinical trial execution and is 1 of the primary drivers of drug development cost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To facilitate clinical trials optimization, we propose DeepMatch (DM), a novel approach that builds on top of advances in deep learning. DM is designed to learn from both investigator and trial-related heterogeneous data sources and rank investigators based on their expected enrollment performance on new clinical trials. RESULTS: Large-scale evaluation conducted on 2618 studies provides evidence that the proposed ranking-based framework improves the current state-of-the-art by up to 19% on ranking investigators and up to 10% on detecting top/bottom performers when recruiting investigators for new clinical trials. DISCUSSION: The extensive experimental section suggests that DM can provide substantial improvement over current industry standards in several regards: (1) the enrollment potential of the investigator list, (2) the time it takes to generate the list, and (3) data-informed decisions about new investigators.

However, a common challenge in health care settings is low adherence, leading to low handwashing quality. Recent advances in machine learning and wearable sensing have made it possible to accurately measure handwashing quality for the purposes of training, feedback, or accreditation. OBJECTIVE: We measured the accuracy of a sensor armband (Myo armband) in detecting the steps and duration of the WHO procedures for handwashing and handrubbing. METHODS: We recruited 20 participants (10 females; mean age 26.5 years, SD 3.3). In a semistructured environment, we collected armband data (acceleration, gyroscope, orientation, and surface electromyography data) and video data from each participant during 15 handrub and 15 handwash sessions. We evaluated the detection accuracy for different armband placements, sensor configurations, user-dependent vs user-independent models, and the use of bootstrapping. RESULTS: Using a single armband, the accuracy was 96% (SD 0.01) for the user-dependent model and 82% (SD 0.08) for the user-independent model. This increased when using two armbands to 97% (SD 0.01) and 91% (SD 0.04), respectively. Performance increased when the armband was placed on the forearm (user dependent: 97%, SD 0.01; and user independent: 91%, SD 0.04) and decreased when placed on the arm (user dependent: 96%, SD 0.01; and user independent: 80%, SD 0.06). In terms of bootstrapping, user-dependent models can achieve more than 80% accuracy after six training sessions and 90% with 16 sessions. Finally, we found that the combination of accelerometer and gyroscope minimizes power consumption and cost while maximizing performance. CONCLUSIONS: A sensor armband can be used to measure hand hygiene quality relatively accurately, in terms of both handwashing and handrubbing. The performance is acceptable using a single armband worn in the upper arm but can substantially improve by placing the armband on the forearm or by using two armbands.",2020,10.2196/17001,8,3,e17001,eng,2291-5222,*Hand Disinfection and *hand hygiene and *machine learning and *wearable devices and Adult and Electromyography and Female and hand hygiene and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and Male and Pilot Projects and wearable devices and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/03/26/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Measuring eye gaze and emotion recognition in children with autism is challenging, as standard clinical assessments must be delivered in clinical settings by a trained clinician. Wearable technologies may be able to bring eye gaze and emotion recognition into natural social interactions and settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test: (1) the feasibility of tracking gaze using wearable smart glasses during a facial expression recognition task and (2) the ability of these gaze-tracking data, together with facial expression recognition responses, to distinguish children with autism from neurotypical controls (NCs). METHODS: We compared the eye gaze and emotion recognition patterns of 16 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 17 children without ASD via wearable smart glasses fitted with a custom eye tracker. Children identified static facial expressions of images presented on a computer screen along with nonsocial distractors while wearing Google Glass and the eye tracker. Faces were presented in three trials, during one of which children received feedback in the form of the correct classification. We employed hybrid human-labeling and computer vision-enabled methods for pupil tracking and world-gaze translation calibration. We analyzed the impact of gaze and emotion recognition features in a prediction task aiming to distinguish children with ASD from NC participants. RESULTS: Gaze and emotion recognition patterns enabled the training of a classifier that distinguished ASD and NC groups. However, it was unable to significantly outperform other classifiers that used only age and gender features, suggesting that further work is necessary to disentangle these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although wearable smart glasses show promise in identifying subtle differences in gaze tracking and emotion recognition patterns in children with and without ASD, the present form factor and data do not allow for these differences to be reliably exploited by machine learning systems. Resolving these challenges will be an important step toward continuous tracking of the ASD phenotype.",2020,10.2196/13810,22,4,e13810,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*artificial intelligence and *autism spectrum disorder and *digital therapy and *eye tracking and *machine learning and *precision health and *translational medicine and *wearable technologies and Adolescent and artificial intelligence and autism spectrum disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*therapy and Child and digital therapy and Emotions/*physiology and eye tracking and Female and Humans and machine learning and Male and Phenotype and precision health and Smart Glasses/*standards and translational medicine and Wearable Electronic Devices/*standards and wearable technologies,NA,NA,2020/04/22/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because it has highly heterogeneous phenotypes, phenotyping of ischemic stroke is an essential task for medical research and clinical prognostication. However, this task is not a trivial one when the study population is large. Phenotyping of ischemic stroke depends primarily on manual annotation of medical records in previous studies. This article evaluated various strategies for automated phenotyping of ischemic stroke into the four subtypes of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification based on structured and unstructured data from electronical medical records (EMRs). A total of 4640 adult patients who were hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke in a teaching hospital were included. In addition to the structured items in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, unstructured clinical narratives were preprocessed using MetaMap to identify medical concepts, which were then encoded into feature vectors. Various supervised machine learning algorithms were used to build classifiers. The study results indicate that textual information from EMRs could facilitate phenotyping of ischemic stroke when this information was combined with structured information. Furthermore, decomposition of this multi-class problem into binary classification tasks followed by aggregation of classification results could improve the performance.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2020.2976931,24,10,2922-2931,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Electronic Health Records and *Supervised Machine Learning and Aged and Algorithms and Data Mining/*methods and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Female and Humans and Ischemic Stroke/classification/*diagnosis and Male and Natural Language Processing",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bouayad_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Patient Health Record Systems Scope and Functionalities: Literature Review and Future Directions,"Bouayad, Lina and Ialynytchev, Anna and Padmanabhan, Balaji",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: A new generation of user-centric information systems is emerging in health care as patient health record (PHR) systems. These systems create a platform supporting the new vision of health services that empowers patients and enables patient-provider communication, with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing costs. This evolution has generated new sets of data and capabilities, providing opportunities and challenges at the user, system, and industry levels. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess PHR data types and functionalities through a review of the literature to inform the health care informatics community, and to provide recommendations for PHR design, research, and practice. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature to assess PHR data types and functionalities. We searched PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE databases from 1966 to 2015 for studies of PHRs, resulting in 1822 articles, from which we selected a total of 106 articles for a detailed review of PHR data content. RESULTS: We present several key findings related to the scope and functionalities in PHR systems. We also present a functional taxonomy and chronological analysis of PHR data types and functionalities, to improve understanding and provide insights for future directions. Functional taxonomy analysis of the extracted data revealed the presence of new PHR data sources such as tracking devices and data types such as time-series data. Chronological data analysis showed an evolution of PHR system functionalities over time, from simple data access to data modification and, more recently, automated assessment, prediction, and recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are needed to improve (1) PHR data quality through patient-centered user interface design and standardized patient-generated data guidelines, (2) data integrity through consolidation of various types and sources, (3) PHR functionality through application of new data analytics methods, and (4) metrics to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with automated PHR system use, and costs associated with PHR data storage and analytics.",2017,10.2196/jmir.8073,19,11,e388,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*data analytics and *electronic health records and *health platforms and *health records, personal and *medical informatics and *multiorganizational systems and *patient-centered care and *personal health record systems and *review and *ultralarge systems and data analytics and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and health platforms and health records, personal and Health Records, Personal/*psychology and Humans and medical informatics and multiorganizational systems and patient-centered care and personal health record systems and review and ultralarge systems",NA,NA,2017/11/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

As GPs are restricted by time, distance, and demanding workloads, a health virtual community of practice (HVCoP) is an ideal solution to replace face-to-face CPD with Web-based CPD. However, barriers such as time and work schedules may limit participation in an HVCoP. Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge whether GPs engage actively or passively in HVCoP knowledge-acquisition for Web-based CPD, as GPs' competencies are usually measured with pre- and posttests. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated a method for measuring the engagement features needed for an HVCoP (the Community Fracture Capture [CFC] Learning Hub) for learning and knowledge sharing among GPs for their CPD activity. METHODS: A prototype CFC Learning Hub was developed using an Igloo Web-based social media software platform and involved a convenience sample of GPs interested in bone health topics. This Hub, a secure Web-based community site, included 2 key components: an online discussion forum and a knowledge repository (the Knowledge Hub). The discussion forum contained anonymized case studies (contributed by GP participants) and topical discussions (topics that were not case studies). Using 2 complementary tools (Google Analytics and Igloo Statistical Tool), we characterized individual participating GPs' engagement with the Hub. We measured the GP participants' behavior by quantifying the number of online sessions of the participants, activities undertaken within these online sessions, written posts made per learning topic, and their time spent per topic. We calculated time spent in both active and passive engagement for each topic. RESULTS: Seven GPs participated in the CFC Learning Hub HVCoP from September to November 2017. The complementary tools successfully captured the GP participants' engagement in the Hub. GPs were more active in topics in the discussion forum that had direct clinical application as opposed to didactic, evidence-based discussion topics (ie, topical discussions). From our knowledge hub, About Osteoporosis and Prevention were the most engaging topics, whereas shared decision making was the least active topic. CONCLUSIONS: We showcased a novel complementary analysis method that allowed us to quantify the CFC Learning Hub's usage data into (1) sessions, (2) activities, (3) active or passive time spent, and (4) posts made to evaluate the potential engagement features needed for an HVCoP focused on GP participants' CPD process. Our design and evaluation methods for ongoing use and engagement in this Hub may be useful to evaluate future learning and knowledge-sharing projects for GPs and may allow for extension to other HPs' environments. However, owing to the limited number of GP participants in this study, we suggest that further research with a larger cohort should be performed to validate and extend these findings.",2019,10.2196/14545,21,11,e14545,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*continuing education and *evaluation methodology and *general practitioners and *information sharing and *knowledgebases and *online learning and *online social networking and *online systems and *professional education and *quantitative evaluation and *use-effectiveness and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and continuing education and Education, Medical, Continuing/*methods and evaluation methodology and Female and general practitioners and General Practitioners/*education and Humans and information sharing and knowledgebases and Male and Middle Aged and online learning and online social networking and online systems and Pilot Projects and professional education and quantitative evaluation and Telemedicine and use-effectiveness",NA,NA,2019/11/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pumps are shared among hospital units, often without central management of their distribution. This study seeks to characterize unit-to-unit pump sharing and its impact on shortages, and to evaluate a system-control tool that balances inventory across all care areas, enabling increased availability of pumps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 3832 pumps moving in a network of 5292 radiofrequency and infrared sensors from January to November 2017 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. We used network analysis to determine whether pump inventory in one unit was associated with inventory fluctuations in others. We used a quasi-experimental design and segmented regressions to evaluate the effect of the system-control tool on enabling safe inventory levels in all care areas. RESULTS: We found 93 care areas connected through 67,111 pump transactions and 4 discernible clusters of pump sharing. Up to 17% (95% confidence interval, 7%-27%) of a unit's pump inventory was explained by the inventory of other units within its cluster. The network analysis supported design and deployment of a hospital-wide inventory balancing system, which resulted in a 44% (95% confidence interval, 36%-53%) increase in the number of care areas above safe inventory levels.

METHODS: We tracked the practice productivity (ie, number of patient visits) and reimbursement of 30 ambulatory practices for 2 years after EHR implementation and compared each practice to their pre-EHR implementation baseline. RESULTS: Reimbursements significantly increased after EHR implementation even though practice productivity (ie, the number of patient visits) decreased over the 2-year observation period. We saw no evidence of upcoding or increased reimbursement rates to explain the increased revenues. Instead, they were associated with an increase in ancillary office procedures (eg, drawing blood, immunizations, wound care, ultrasounds). DISCUSSION: The bottom line result-that EHR implementation is associated with increased revenues-is reassuring and offers a basis for further EHR investment. While the productivity losses are consistent with field reports, they also reflect a type of efficiency-the practices are receiving more reimbursement for fewer seeing patients. For the practices still seeing fewer patients after 2 years, the solution likely involves advancing their EHR functionality to include analytics. Although they may still see fewer patients, with EHR analytics, they can focus on seeing the right patients.

Kim_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Scaling Up Research on Drug Abuse and Addiction Through Social Media Big Data,"Kim, Sunny Jung and Marsch, Lisa A. and Hancock, Jeffrey T. and Das, Amarendra K.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Substance use-related communication for drug use promotion and its prevention is widely prevalent on social media. Social media big data involve naturally occurring communication phenomena that are observable through social media platforms, which can be used in computational or scalable solutions to generate data-driven inferences. Despite the promising potential to utilize social media big data to monitor and treat substance use problems, the characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes of substance use-related communications on social media are largely unknown. Understanding these aspects can help researchers effectively leverage social media big data and platforms for observation and health communication outreach for people with substance use problems. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this critical review was to determine how social media big data can be used to understand communication and behavioral patterns of problematic use of prescription drugs. We elaborate on theoretical applications, ethical challenges and methodological considerations when using social media big data for research on drug abuse and addiction. Based on a critical review process, we propose a typology with key initiatives to address the knowledge gap in the use of social media for research on prescription drug abuse and addiction. METHODS: First, we provided a narrative summary of the literature on drug use-related communication on social media. We also examined ethical considerations in the research processes of (1) social media big data mining, (2) subgroup or follow-up investigation, and (3) dissemination of social media data-driven findings. To develop a critical review-based typology, we searched the PubMed database and the entire e-collection theme of ""infodemiology and infoveillance"" in the Journal of Medical Internet Research / JMIR Publications. Studies that met our inclusion criteria (eg, use of social media data concerning non-medical use of prescription drugs, data informatics-driven findings) were reviewed for knowledge synthesis. User characteristics, communication characteristics, mechanisms and predictors of such communications, and the psychological and behavioral outcomes of social media use for problematic drug use-related communications are the dimensions of our typology. In addition to ethical practices and considerations, we also reviewed the methodological and computational approaches used in each study to develop our typology. RESULTS: We developed a typology to better understand non-medical, problematic use of prescription drugs through the lens of social media big data. Highly relevant studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed for knowledge synthesis. The characteristics of users who shared problematic substance use-related communications on social media were reported by general group terms, such as adolescents, Twitter users, and Instagram users. All reviewed studies examined the communication characteristics, such as linguistic properties, and social networks of problematic drug use-related communications on social media. The mechanisms and predictors of such social media communications were not directly examined or empirically identified in the reviewed studies. The psychological or behavioral consequence (eg, increased behavioral intention for mimicking risky health behaviors) of engaging with and being exposed to social media communications regarding problematic drug use was another area of research that has been understudied. CONCLUSIONS: We offer theoretical applications, ethical considerations, and empirical evidence within the scope of social media communication and prescription drug abuse and addiction.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to implement and evaluate a structured social media strategy, using multiple platforms, to disseminate Cochrane Child Health evidence to health care providers caring for children. METHODS: Our social media strategy had three components: daily ""tweets"" using the Cochrane Child Health Twitter account, weekly WordPress blog posts, and a monthly journal club on Twitter (""tweet chat""). Each tweet, blog, and journal club shared Cochrane evidence on a child health topic. We evaluated the strategy through (1) Twitter and blog site analytics, (2) traceable link (Bitly) statistics, (3) Altmetric.com scores for promoted evidence, and (4) participant feedback. We also tracked the resources required to write the blog, tweet content, and manage the strategy. RESULTS: The 22-week social media strategy ran between November 2014 and April 2015. We created 25 blog posts, sent 585 tweets, and hosted 3 tweet chats. Monthly blog visits and views and Twitter account followers increased over time. During the study period, the blog received 2555 visitors and 3967 page views from a geographically diverse audience of health care providers, academics, and health care organizations. In total, 183 traceable Bitly links received 3463 clicks, and the Twitter account gained 469 new followers. The most visited and viewed blog posts included gastrointestinal topics (lactose avoidance), research on respiratory conditions (honey for cough and treatments for asthma), and maternal newborn care (skin-to-skin contact). On Twitter, popular topics were related to public health (vaccination) and pain management. We collected Altmetric.com scores for 61 studies promoted during the study period and recorded an average increase of 11 points. Research staff (n=3) contributed approximately 433 hours to promotion activities and planning (6.5 hours each per week) to implement the social media strategy, and study investigators reviewed all content (blog posts and tweets). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence on the use of a coordinated social media strategy for the dissemination of evidence to professionals providing health services to children and youth. The results and lessons learned from our study provide guidance for future knowledge dissemination activities using social media tools.",2017,10.2196/jmir.7819,19,9,e308,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*health knowledge, attitudes, practice and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *pediatrics and *social media and *translational medical research and Child and Child Health/*trends and Evaluation Studies as Topic and health knowledge, attitudes, practice and Humans and pediatrics and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and translational medical research",NA,NA,2017/09/01/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Holdener_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Applicability of the User Engagement Scale to Mobile Health: A Survey-Based Quantitative Study,"Holdener, Marianne and Gut, Alain and Angerer, Alfred",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: There has recently been exponential growth in the development and use of health apps on mobile phones. As with most mobile apps, however, the majority of users abandon them quickly and after minimal use. One of the most critical factors for the success of a health app is how to support users' commitment to their health. Despite increased interest from researchers in mobile health, few studies have examined the measurement of user engagement with health apps. OBJECTIVE: User engagement is a multidimensional, complex phenomenon. The aim of this study was to understand the concept of user engagement and, in particular, to demonstrate the applicability of a user engagement scale (UES) to mobile health apps. METHODS: To determine the measurability of user engagement in a mobile health context, a UES was employed, which is a psychometric tool to measure user engagement with a digital system. This was adapted to Ada, developed by Ada Health, an artificial intelligence-powered personalized health guide that helps people understand their health. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was conducted on 30 items. In addition, sum scores as means of each subscale were calculated. RESULTS: Survey data from 73 Ada users were analyzed. PCA was determined to be suitable, as verified by the sampling adequacy of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.858, a significant Bartlett test of sphericity (<cf><87>(2)(300)=1127.1; P<.001), and communalities mostly within the 0.7 range. Although 5 items had to be removed because of low factor loadings, the results of the remaining 25 items revealed 4 attributes: perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, reward, and focused attention. Ada users showed the highest engagement level with perceived usability, with a value of 294, followed by aesthetic appeal, reward, and focused attention. CONCLUSIONS: Although the UES was deployed in German and adapted to another digital domain, PCA yielded consistent subscales and a 4-factor structure. This indicates that user engagement with health apps can be assessed with the German version of the UES. These results can benefit related mobile health app engagement research and may be of importance to marketers and app developers.",2020,10.2196/13244,8,1,e13244,eng,2291-5222,*chatbot and *measurement and *mhealth and *Mobile Applications/statistics & numerical data and *mobile apps and *mobile health and *Telemedicine and *user engagement and *user engagement scale and Artificial Intelligence and chatbot and Confidentiality and Humans and measurement and mhealth and mobile apps and mobile health and Qualitative Research and Surveys and Questionnaires and user engagement and user engagement scale,NA,NA,2020/01/03/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the ""best fit"" framework synthesis approach. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts, and Engineering Village. Two authors reviewed articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data abstraction and content analysis of 443 published papers were used to create a model in which every element was supported by empirical research. RESULTS: The CIIM documents how primary care clinicians interact with information as they make point-of-care clinical decisions. The model highlights 3 major process components: (1) context, (2) activity (usual and contingent), and (3) influence. Usual activities include information processing, source-user interaction, information evaluation, selection of information, information use, clinical reasoning, and clinical decisions. Clinician characteristics, patient behaviors, and other professionals influence the process. DISCUSSION: The CIIM depicts the complete process of information interaction, enabling a grasp of relationships previously difficult to discern. The CIIM suggests potentially helpful functionality for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support primary care, including a greater focus on information processing and use. The CIIM also documents the role of influence in clinical information interaction; influencers may affect the success of CDSS implementations. CONCLUSION: The CIIM offers a new framework for achieving CDSS workflow integration and new directions for CDSS design that can support the work of diverse primary care clinicians.",2018,10.1093/jamia/ocx085,25,6,746-758,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Medical Informatics/organization & administration and *Primary Health Care/organization & administration and Decision Making and Delivery of Health Care/methods and Humans and Information Seeking Behavior and Models, Theoretical and Workflow",NA,NA,2018/06/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Plenty of mechanisms have been developed to detect the health condition of the elderly based on the explicit irregularity of several biomedical parameters or some specific behaviors. However, few research works focus on detecting the implicit irregularity involving the combination of diverse behaviors, which can assess the cognitive and physical wellbeing of elders but cannot be directly identified based on sensor data. This paper proposes an Implicit IRregularity Detection (IIRD) mechanism that aims to detect the implicit irregularity by developing the unsupervised learning algorithm based on daily behaviors. The proposed IIRD mechanism identifies the distance and similarity between daily behaviors, which are important features to distinguish the regular and irregular daily behaviors and detect the implicit irregularity of elderly health condition. Performance results show that the proposed IIRD outperforms the existing unsupervised machine-learning mechanisms in terms of the detection accuracy and irregularity recall.",2020,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2896976,24,1,131-143,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Home Care Services and *Unsupervised Machine Learning and Aged and Algorithms and Databases, Factual and Human Activities/*classification and Humans and Monitoring, Physiologic",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: In a study conducted in Karnataka, India, 1583 women (pregnant and non-pregnant) of childbearing age, with Hb values ranging between 1.6 to 14.8 g/dL, had their Hb values estimated using intravenous blood samples and concurrently by a finger sensor custom designed and prototyped for this study. The finger sensor collected PPG signals at four wavelengths: 590 nm, 660 nm, 810 nm, and 940 nm. A novel feature vector was derived from these PPGs. A machine learning model comprising of a two-layer stack of regressors including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge, Elastic Net, Adaptive (Ada) Boost and Support Vector Regressors (SVR) was designed and tested. RESULTS: We report a statistically significant Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.81 (p < 0.01) between the Hb value estimated by the proposed methodology and gold standard values of Hb, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.353 <c2><b1> 0.042 g/dL. The performance of the stacked regressor model was significantly better than the performance of individual regressors (low RMSE, and better CC; p < 0.05). Post-hoc analysis showed that including pregnant women in the training data set significantly improved the performance of the algorithm. CONCLUSION: This article demonstrates the feasibility of a machine learning based non-invasive hemoglobin measurement system, especially for maternal anemia detection.

Clustering, which can be used for classification, presents opportunities for identifying hard-to-reach groups for the development of customized health interventions. Due to a desire to convert abundant DNA gene co-expression data into networks, many graph inference methods have been developed. Likewise there are many clustering and classification tools. This paper presents a comparison of techniques for graph inference and clustering, using different numbers of features, in order to select the best tuple of graph inference method, clustering method, and number of features according to a particular phenotype. An extensive machine learning based analysis of the REGARDS dataset is conducted, evaluating the CoNet and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) network inference methods, along with the Louvain, Leiden and NBR-Clust clustering techniques.

Traditional methods of disseminating clinical guidelines and tools cannot keep pace with the rapid expansion of available therapeutic agents, approved indications for use, and published medical evidence, so a mobile app, Management of Anticoagulation in the Periprocedural Period (MAPPP), was developed and disseminated to provide clinicians with guidance that reflects the most current medical evidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the global, national, and state-level acquisition of a mobile app since its initial release and characterize individual episodes of use based on drug selection, procedural bleeding risk, and patient thromboembolic risk. METHODS: Data were extracted from a mobile app usage tracker (Google Analytics) to characterize new users and completed episodes temporally (by calendar quarter) and geographically (globally, nationally, and in the targeted US state of New York) for the period between April 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017. RESULTS: The app was acquired by 2866 new users in the measurement period, and the users completed nearly 10,000 individual episodes of use. Acquisition and utilization spanned 51 countries globally, predominantly in the United States and particularly in New York State. Warfarin and rivaroxaban were the most frequently selected drugs, and completed episodes most frequently included the selection of high bleeding risk (4888/9963, 49.06%) and high thromboembolic risk categories (4500/9963, 45.17%). CONCLUSIONS: The MAPPP app is a successful means of disseminating current guidance on periprocedural anticoagulant use, as indicated by broad global uptake and upward trends in utilization. Limitations in access to provider and patient-specific data preclude objective evaluation of the clinical impact of the app. An ongoing study incorporating app logic into electronic health record systems at participant health systems will provide a more definitive evaluation of the clinical impact of the app logic.",2018,10.2196/11090,6,12,e11090,eng,2291-5222,adverse drug event and anticoagulant and app and mobile phone and periprocedural and warfarin,NA,NA,2018/12/21/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the degree to which people use mobile devices to help them make medical decisions remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore factors associated with self-reported use of tablets or smartphones to support medical decision making in a nationally representative sample of US adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from participants in the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, Cycle 2) were evaluated. There were 3504 responses in the full HINTS 5 Cycle 2 data set; 2321 remained after eliminating respondents who did not have complete data for all the variables of interest. The primary outcome was use of a tablet or smartphone to help make a decision about how to treat an illness or condition. Sociodemographic factors including gender, race/ethnicity, and education were evaluated. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth)- and electronic health (eHealth)-related factors were evaluated including (1) the presence of health and wellness apps on a tablet or smartphone, (2) use of electronic devices other than tablets and smartphones to monitor health (eg, Fitbit, blood glucose monitor, and blood pressure monitor), and (3) whether people shared health information from an electronic monitoring device or smartphone with a health professional within the last 12 months. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted using SAS version 9.4. Weighted population estimates and standard errors, univariate odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, comparing respondents who used tablets or smartphones to help make medical decisions (n=944) with those who did not (n=1377), separately for each factor. Factors of interest with a P value of <.10 were included in a subsequent multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Compared with women, men had lower odds of reporting that a tablet or smartphone helped them make a medical decision. Respondents aged 75 and older also had lower odds of using a tablet or smartphone compared with younger respondents aged 18-34. By contrast, those who had health and wellness apps on tablets or smartphones, used other electronic devices to monitor health, and shared information from devices or smartphones with health care professionals had higher odds of reporting that tablets or smartphones helped them make a medical decision, compared with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: A limitation of this research is that information was not available regarding the specific health condition for which a tablet or smartphone helped people make a decision or the type of decision made (eg, surgery, medication changes).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published between January 2004 and June 2015 using three large databases: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, and Medline. Studies that reported qualitative data about the types and causes of these errors were included. A narrative synthesis of all eligible studies was undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 1185 publications were identified, of which 34 were included in the review. We identified 8 key themes associated with CPOE-related prescribing errors: computer screen display, drop-down menus and auto-population, wording, default settings, nonintuitive or inflexible ordering, repeat prescriptions and automated processes, users' work processes, and clinical decision support systems. Displaying an incomplete list of a patient's medications on the computer screen often contributed to prescribing errors. Lack of system flexibility resulted in users employing error-prone workarounds, such as the addition of contradictory free-text comments. Users' misinterpretations of how text was presented in CPOE systems were also linked with the occurrence of prescribing errors. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Human factors design is important to reduce error rates. Drop-down menus should be designed with safeguards to decrease the likelihood of selection errors. Development of more sophisticated clinical decision support, which can perform checks on free-text, may also prevent errors. Further research is needed to ensure that systems minimize error likelihood and meet users' workflow expectations.",2017,10.1093/jamia/ocw119,24,2,432-440,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Medical Order Entry Systems and *Medication Errors/prevention & control and alerts and clinical decision support and computerized provider order entry and decision-making and Drug Prescriptions and Ergonomics and Humans and medication errors and patient safety,NA,NA,2017/03/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ren_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Understanding the Dimensions of Medical Crowdfunding: A Visual Analytics Approach,"Ren, Jie and Raghupathi, Viju and Raghupathi, Wullianallur",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Medical crowdfunding has emerged as a growing field for fundraising opportunities. Some environmental trends have driven the emergence of campaigns to raise funds for medical care. These trends include lack of medical insurance, economic backlash following the 2008 financial collapse, and shortcomings of health care regulations. OBJECTIVE: Research regarding crowdfunding campaign use, reasons, and effects on the provision of medical care and individual relationships in health systems is limited. This study aimed to explore the nature and dimensions of the phenomenon of medical crowdfunding using a visual analytics approach and data crawled from the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform in 2019. We aimed to explore and identify the factors that contribute to a successful campaign. METHODS: This data-driven study used a visual analytics approach. It focused on descriptive analytics to obtain a panoramic insight into medical projects funded through the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform. RESULTS: This study highlighted the relevance of positioning the campaign for fundraising. In terms of motivating donors, it appears that people are typically more generous in contributing to campaigns for children rather than those for adults. The results emphasized the differing dynamics that a picture posted in the campaign brings to the potential for medical crowdfunding. In terms of donor's motivation, the results show that a picture depicting the pediatric patient by himself or herself is the most effective. In addition, a picture depicting the current medical condition of the patient as severe is more effective than one depicting relative normalcy in the condition. This study also drew attention to the optimum length of the title. Finally, an interesting trend in the trajectory of donations is that the average amount of a donation decreases with an increase in the number of donors. This indicates that the first donors tend to be the most generous. CONCLUSIONS: This study examines the relationship between social media, the characteristics of a campaign, and the potential for fundraising. Its analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns across the states offers a window into the status of the country's health care affordability.

When the fathers of medicine started writing down their experience, knowledge, and observations, treating medical conditions became a structured process, with textbooks and professors sharing their methods over generations. After evidence-based medicine was established as the new form of medical science, the art and science of medicine had to be connected. As a result, by the end of the 20th century, health care had become highly dependent on technology. From electronic medical records, telemedicine, three-dimensional printing, algorithms, and sensors, technology has started to influence medical decisions and the lives of patients. While digital health technologies might be considered a threat to the art of medicine, I argue that advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, will initiate the real era of the art of medicine.

D. and Giardina, Traber D. and Spitzmueller, Christiane and Shahid, Umber and Scott, Taylor M. T. and Singh, Hardeep",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly seeking Web-based symptom checkers to obtain diagnoses. However, little is known about the characteristics of the patients who use these resources, their rationale for use, and whether they find them accurate and useful. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine patients' experiences using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted online symptom checker. METHODS: An online survey was administered between March 2, 2018, through March 15, 2018, to US users of the Isabel Symptom Checker within 6 months of their use. User characteristics, experiences of symptom checker use, experiences discussing results with physicians, and prior personal history of experiencing a diagnostic error were collected. RESULTS: A total of 329 usable responses was obtained. The mean respondent age was 48.0 (SD 16.7) years; most were women (230/304, 75.7%) and white (271/304, 89.1%). Patients most commonly used the symptom checker to better understand the causes of their symptoms (232/304, 76.3%), followed by for deciding whether to seek care (101/304, 33.2%) or where (eg, primary or urgent care: 63/304, 20.7%), obtaining medical advice without going to a doctor (48/304, 15.8%), and understanding their diagnoses better (39/304, 12.8%). Most patients reported receiving useful information for their health problems (274/304, 90.1%), with half reporting positive health effects (154/302, 51.0%). Most patients perceived it to be useful as a diagnostic tool (253/301, 84.1%), as a tool providing insights leading them closer to correct diagnoses (231/303, 76.2%), and reported they would use it again (278/304, 91.4%). Patients who discussed findings with their physicians (103/213, 48.4%) more often felt physicians were interested (42/103, 40.8%) than not interested in learning about the tool's results (24/103, 23.3%) and more often felt physicians were open (62/103, 60.2%) than not open (21/103, 20.4%) to discussing the results. Compared with patients who had not previously experienced diagnostic errors (missed or delayed diagnoses: 123/304, 40.5%), patients who had previously experienced diagnostic errors (181/304, 59.5%) were more likely to use the symptom checker to determine where they should seek care (15/123, 12.2% vs 48/181, 26.5%; P=.002), but they less often felt that physicians were interested in discussing the tool's results (20/34, 59% vs 22/69, 32%; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing concerns about symptom checker accuracy, a large patient-user group perceived an AI-assisted symptom checker as useful for diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built multiple deep learning models with increased complexity, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and a CapNet model for single-domain relation extraction and fully shared (FS), shared-private (SP), and adversarial training (ADV) modes for multidomain relation extraction. Our models were evaluated in 2 ways: first, we compared our models using our expert-annotated cancer (the MADE1.0 corpus) and cardio corpora; second, we compared our models with the systems in the MADE1.0 and i2b2 challenges. RESULTS: Multidomain models outperform single-domain models by 0.7%-1.4% in F1 (t test P < .05), but the results of FS, SP, and ADV modes are mixed. Our results show that the MLP model generally outperforms the CapNet model by 0.1%-1.0% in F1. In the comparisons with other systems, the CapNet model achieves the state-of-the-art result (87.2% in F1) in the cancer corpus and the MLP model generally outperforms MedEx in the cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and i2b2 corpora. CONCLUSIONS: Our MLP or CapNet model generally outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in medication and adverse drug event relation extraction. Multidomain models perform better than single-domain models. However, neither the SP nor the ADV mode can always outperform the FS mode significantly.

Chen_2018_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Vaccine Images on Twitter: Analysis of What Images are Shared,"Chen, Tao and Dredze, Mark",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Visual imagery plays a key role in health communication; however, there is little understanding of what aspects of vaccine-related images make them effective communication aids. Twitter, a popular venue for discussions related to vaccination, provides numerous images that are shared with tweets. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to understand how images are used in vaccine-related tweets and provide guidance with respect to the characteristics of vaccine-related images that correlate with the higher likelihood of being retweeted. METHODS: We collected more than one million vaccine image messages from Twitter and characterized various properties of these images using automated image analytics. We fit a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a vaccine image tweet was retweeted, thus identifying characteristics that correlate with a higher likelihood of being shared. For comparison, we built similar models for the sharing of vaccine news on Facebook and for general image tweets. RESULTS: Most vaccine-related images are duplicates (125,916/237,478; 53.02%) or taken from other sources, not necessarily created by the author of the tweet. Almost half of the images contain embedded text, and many include images of people and syringes. The visual content is highly correlated with a tweet's textual topics. Vaccine image tweets are twice as likely to be shared as nonimage tweets. The sentiment of an image and the objects shown in the image were the predictive factors in determining whether an image was retweeted. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to study vaccine images on Twitter. Our findings suggest future directions for the study and use of vaccine imagery and may inform communication strategies around vaccination.

Wahle_2016_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Mobile Sensing and Support for People With Depression: A Pilot Trial in the Wild,"Wahle, Fabian and Kowatsch, Tobias and Fleisch, Elgar and Rufer, Michael and Weidt, Steffi",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. METHODS: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. RESULTS: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for <e2><89><a5>2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9<e2><89><a5>11) at baseline and adherence <e2><89><a5>8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9<e2><89><a5>11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification.

However, developing phenotyping algorithms in a scalable way remains a challenge due to the extensive human resources required. This paper introduces a high-throughput unsupervised feature selection method, which improves the robustness and scalability of electronic medical record phenotyping without compromising its accuracy. METHODS: The proposed Surrogate-Assisted Feature Extraction (SAFE) method selects candidate features from a pool of comprehensive medical concepts found in publicly available knowledge sources. The target phenotype's International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and natural language processing counts, acting as noisy surrogates to the gold-standard labels, are used to create silver-standard labels. Candidate features highly predictive of the silver-standard labels are selected as the final features. RESULTS: Algorithms were trained to identify patients with coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis using various numbers of labels to compare the performance of features selected by SAFE, a previously published automated feature extraction for phenotyping procedure, and domain experts. The out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F -score from SAFE algorithms were remarkably higher than those from the other two, especially at small label sizes. CONCLUSION: SAFE advances high-throughput phenotyping methods by automatically selecting a succinct set of informative features for algorithm training, which in turn reduces overfitting and the needed number of gold-standard labels.

Tay_2015_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,The effect of sample age and prediction resolution on myocardial infarction risk prediction,"Tay, Darwin and Poh, Chueh Loo and Van Reeth, Eric and Kitney, Richard I.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death in many developed countries. Hence, early detection of MI events is critical for effective preventative therapies, potentially reducing avoidable mortality. One approach for early disease prediction is the use of risk prediction models developed using machine learning techniques. One important component of these models is to provide clinicians with the flexibility to customize (e.g., the prediction range) and use the risk prediction model that they deemed most beneficial for their patients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop MI prediction models and investigate the effect of sample age and prediction resolution on the performance of MI risk prediction models. The cardiovascular health study dataset was used in this study. Results indicate that the prediction model developed using SVM algorithm is capable of achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 95.3%, 84.8%, and 90.1%, respectively, over a time span of 6 years. Both sample age and prediction resolution were found not to have a significant impact on the performance of MI risk prediction models developed using subjects aged 65 and above. This implies that risk prediction models developed using different sample age and prediction resolution is a feasible approach. These models can be integrated into a computer aided screening tool which clinicians can use to interpret and predict the MI risk status of the individual patients after performing the necessary clinical assessments (e.g., cognitive function, physical function, electrocardiography, general changes to health/lifestyle, and medications) required by the models. This could offer a means for clinicians to screen the patients at risk of having MI in the near future and prescribe early medical intervention to reduce the risk.",2015,10.1109/JBHI.2014.2330898,19,3,1178-1185,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Models, Statistical and Algorithms and Databases, Factual and Humans and Myocardial Infarction/*diagnosis/*physiopathology and Risk Assessment and Sensitivity and Specificity",NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Strict restrictions in terms of visiting hours and the number of visitors have made it difficult to arrange in-person family conferences. Phone-based telehealth consultations may be a solution, but the lack of nonverbal cues may diminish the clinician-patient relationship. In this context, video-based, smartphone-enabled family conferences have become important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish a smartphone-enabled telehealth model for palliative care family conferences. Our model integrates principles from the concept of shared decision making (SDM) and the value, acknowledge, listen, understand, and elicit (VALUE) approach. METHODS: Family conferences comprised three phases designed according to telehealth implementation guidelines-the previsit, during-visit, and postvisit phases. We incorporated the following SDM elements into the model: ""team talk,"" ""option talk,"" and ""decision talk."" The model has been implemented at a national cancer treatment center in Taiwan since February 2020. RESULTS: From February to April 2020, 14 telehealth family conferences in the palliative care unit were analyzed. The patients' mean age was 73 (SD 10.1) years; 6 out of 14 patients (43%) were female and 12 (86%) were married. The primary caregiver joining the conference virtually comprised mostly of spouses and children (n=10, 71%). The majority of participants were terminally ill patients with cancer (n=13, 93%), with the exception of 1 patient with stroke. Consensus on care goals related to discharge planning and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments was reached in 93% (n=13) of cases during the family conferences. In total, 5 families rated the family conferences as good or very good (36%), whereas 9 were neutral (64%). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-enabled telehealth for palliative care family conferences with SDM and VALUE integration demonstrated high satisfaction for families.

Recent advances in sensing technology bring the ease to acquire space-time electrical activity of the heart such as vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals. Recurrence analysis of successive heartbeats is conducive to detect the disease-altered cardiac activities.

This paper presents a new framework of heterogeneous recurrence analysis for the characterization and modeling of disease-altered spatiotemporal patterns in multi-channel cardiac signals. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 96.9%, a sensitivity of 95.0%, and a specificity of 98.7% for the identification of myocardial infarctions.

Recently, a number of studies have explored the possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. OBJECTIVE: This study discusses the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication abuse-related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also described. METHODS: We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and then grouped them into 4 broad classes-abuse or misuse, personal consumption, mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic classification on these data. RESULTS: Our final annotated set consisted of 16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa), which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use, nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set (n=3271). CONCLUSIONS: Our manual analysis and annotations of a large number of tweets have revealed types of information posted on Twitter about a set of abuse-prone prescription medications and their distributions.

The frequency of potentially identifiable disclosures online during periods of active engagement is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify potentially identifiable content shared on social media by physicians and other health care providers using the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. METHODS: We accessed and searched Twitter's API using Symplur software for tweets that included the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. We identified 1206 tweets by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals out of 43,374 tweets shared in May 2018. Tweet content was evaluated in January 2019 to determine the incidence of instances where names or potentially identifiable information about patients were shared; content analysis of tweets in which information about others had been disclosed was performed. The study also evaluated whether participants raised concerns about privacy breaches and estimated the frequency of deleted tweets. The study used dual, blinded coding for a 10% sample to estimate intercoder reliability using Cohen <ce><ba> statistic for identifying the potential identifiability of tweet content. RESULTS: Health care professionals (n=656) disclosing information about others included 486 doctors (74.1%) and 98 nurses (14.9%). Health care professionals sharing stories about patient care disclosed the time frame in 95 tweets (95/754, 12.6%) and included patient names in 15 tweets (15/754, 2.0%). It is estimated that friends or families could likely identify the clinical scenario described in 242 of the 754 tweets (32.1%). Among 348 tweets about potentially living patients, it was estimated that 162 (46.6%) were likely identifiable by patients. Intercoder reliability in rating the potential identifiability demonstrated 86.8% agreement, with a Cohen <ce><ba> of 0.8 suggesting substantial agreement. We also identified 78 out of 754 tweets (6.5%) that had been deleted on the website but were still viewable in the analytics software data set.

Zhao_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Managing Illicit Online Pharmacies: Web Analytics and Predictive Models Study,"Zhao, Hui and Muthupandi, Sowmyasri and Kumara, Soundar",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Online pharmacies have grown significantly in recent years, from US $29.35 billion in 2014 to an expected US $128 billion in 2023 worldwide. Although legitimate online pharmacies (LOPs) provide a channel of convenience and potentially lower costs for patients, illicit online pharmacies (IOPs) open the doors to unfettered access to prescription drugs, controlled substances (eg, opioids), and potentially counterfeits, posing a dramatic risk to the drug supply chain and the health of the patient. Unfortunately, we know little about IOPs, and even identifying and monitoring IOPs is challenging because of the large number of online pharmacies (at least 30,000-35,000) and the dynamic nature of the online channel (online pharmacies open and shut down easily). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase our understanding of IOPs through web data traffic analysis and propose a novel framework using referral links to predict and identify IOPs, the first step in fighting IOPs. METHODS: We first collected web traffic and engagement data to study and compare how consumers access and engage with LOPs and IOPs. We then proposed a simple but novel framework for predicting the status of online pharmacies (legitimate or illicit) through the referral links between websites. Under this framework, we developed 2 prediction models, the reference rating prediction method (RRPM) and the reference-based K-nearest neighbor. RESULTS: We found that direct (typing URL), search, and referral are the 3 major traffic sources, representing more than 95% traffic to both LOPs and IOPs. It is alarming to see that direct represents the second-highest traffic source (34.32%) to IOPs. When tested on a data set with 763 online pharmacies, both RRPM and R2NN performed well, achieving an accuracy above 95% in their predictions of the status for the online pharmacies. R2NN outperformed RRPM in full performance metrics (accuracy, kappa, specificity, and sensitivity). On implementing the 2 models on Google search results for popular drugs (Xanax [alprazolam], OxyContin, and opioids), they produced an error rate of only 7.96% (R2NN) and 6.20% (RRPM). CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction models use what we know (referral links) to tackle the many unknown aspects of IOPs. They have many potential applications for patients, search engines, social media, payment companies, policy makers or government agencies, and drug manufacturers to help fight IOPs. With scarce work in this area, we hope to help address the current opioid crisis from this perspective and inspire future research in the critical area of drug safety.",2020,10.2196/17239,22,8,e17239,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Humans and classification and *classification and *illicit online pharmacies and *online pharmacy and *online traffic analysis and *web analytics and Internet/*legislation & jurisprudence and Pharmaceutical Services, Online/*legislation & jurisprudence and illicit online pharmacies and online pharmacy and online traffic analysis and web analytics",NA,NA,2020/08/25/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the mobile health (mHealth) domain, researchers are increasingly discovering the opportunities of log data to assess the usage of their mobile apps. To date, however, the analysis of these data are often limited to descriptive statistics. Using data mining techniques, log data can offer significantly deeper insights. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess how Markov Chain and sequence clustering analysis can be used to find meaningful usage patterns of mHealth apps. METHODS: Using the data of a 25-day field trial (n=22) of the Start2Cycle app, an app developed to encourage recreational cycling in adults, a transition matrix between the different pages of the app was composed. From this matrix, a Markov Chain was constructed, enabling intuitive user behavior analysis. RESULTS: Through visual inspection of the transitions, 3 types of app use could be distinguished (route tracking, gamification, and bug reporting). Markov Chain-based sequence clustering was subsequently used to demonstrate how clusters of session types can otherwise be obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Using Markov Chains to assess in-app navigation presents a sound method to evaluate use of mHealth interventions. The insights can be used to evaluate app use and improve user experience.",2019,10.2196/11934,21,6,e11934,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*data analytics and *eHealth and *log data and *Markov Chain and *Markov Chains and *mHealth and data analytics and Data Mining/*methods and eHealth and Female and Humans and log data and Male and Markov Chain and mHealth and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2019/06/07/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-end networking, packet-filter firewalls, network intrusion-detection systems. RESULTS: We describe a ""Medical Science DMZ"" concept as an option for secure, high-volume transport of large, sensitive datasets between research institutions over national research networks, and give 3 detailed descriptions of implemented Medical Science DMZs. DISCUSSION: The exponentially increasing amounts of ""omics"" data, high-quality imaging, and other rapidly growing clinical datasets have resulted in the rise of biomedical research ""Big Data."" The storage, analysis, and network resources required to process these data and integrate them into patient diagnoses and treatments have grown to scales that strain the capabilities of academic health centers. Some data are not generated locally and cannot be sustained locally, and shared data repositories such as those provided by the National Library of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and international partners such as the European Bioinformatics Institute are rapidly growing. The ability to store and compute using these data must therefore be addressed by a combination of local, national, and industry resources that exchange large datasets. Maintaining data-intensive flows that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulations presents a new challenge for biomedical research. We describe a strategy that marries performance and security by borrowing from and redefining the concept of a Science DMZ, a framework that is used in physical sciences and engineering research to manage high-capacity data flows.

However, each new data research network that wishes to support its own analytics tends to develop its own data model. Joining these different networks without new data extraction, transform, and load (ETL) processes can reduce the time and expense needed to participate. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project supports data network interoperability through an ontology-driven approach. We use i2b2 as a hub, to rapidly reconfigure data to meet new analytical requirements without new ETL programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 12-site National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) uses i2b2 to query data. We developed a process to generate a PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) physical database directly from existing i2b2 systems, thereby supporting PCORnet analytic queries without new ETL programming. This involved: a formalized process for representing i2b2 information models (the specification of data types and formats); an information model that represents CDM Version 1.0; and a program that generates CDM tables, driven by this information model. This approach is generalizable to any logical information model. RESULTS: Eight PCORnet CDRN sites have implemented this approach and generated a CDM database without a new ETL process from the EHR. This enables federated querying within the CDRN and compatibility with the national PCORnet Distributed Research Network. DISCUSSION: We have established a way to adapt i2b2 to new information models without requiring changes to the underlying data. Eight Scalable Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Health System sites vetted this methodology, resulting in a network that, at present, supports research on 10 million patients' data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 43 physicians entered orders for 5 simulated clinical cases using a clinical order entry interface with or without access to a previously developed automated order recommender system. Cases were randomly allocated to the recommender system in a 3:2 ratio. A panel of clinicians scored whether the orders placed were clinically appropriate. Our primary outcome included the difference in clinical appropriateness scores. Secondary outcomes included total number of orders, case time, and survey responses. RESULTS: Clinical appropriateness scores per order were comparable for cases randomized to the order recommender system (mean difference -0.11 order per score, 95% CI: [-0.41, 0.20]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (median 16 vs 15 orders, incidence rate ratio 1.09, 95%CI: [1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Physicians used recommender suggestions in 98% of available cases. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows. DISCUSSION: User testing with a simulated electronic medical record interface can assess the value of machine learning and clinical decision support tools for clinician usability and acceptance before live deployments.

Hong_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,What Do Patients Say About Doctors Online? A Systematic Review of Studies on Patient Online Reviews,"Hong, Y. Alicia and Liang, Chen and Radcliff, Tiffany A. and Wigfall, Lisa T. and Street, Richard L.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The number of patient online reviews (PORs) has grown significantly, and PORs have played an increasingly important role in patients' choice of health care providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to systematically review studies on PORs, summarize the major findings and study characteristics, identify literature gaps, and make recommendations for future research. METHODS: A major database search was completed in January 2019. Studies were included if they (1) focused on PORs of physicians and hospitals, (2) reported qualitative or quantitative results from analysis of PORs, and (3) peer-reviewed empirical studies. Study characteristics and major findings were synthesized using predesigned tables. RESULTS: A total of 63 studies (69 articles) that met the above criteria were included in the review. Most studies (n=48) were conducted in the United States, including Puerto Rico, and the remaining were from Europe, Australia, and China. Earlier studies (published before 2010) used content analysis with small sample sizes; more recent studies retrieved and analyzed larger datasets using machine learning technologies. The number of PORs ranged from fewer than 200 to over 700,000. About 90% of the studies were focused on clinicians, typically specialists such as surgeons; 27% covered health care organizations, typically hospitals; and some studied both. A majority of PORs were positive and patients' comments on their providers were favorable. Although most studies were descriptive, some compared PORs with traditional surveys of patient experience and found a high degree of correlation and some compared PORs with clinical outcomes but found a low level of correlation. CONCLUSIONS: PORs contain valuable information that can generate insights into quality of care and patient-provider relationship, but it has not been systematically used for studies of health care quality. With the advancement of machine learning and data analysis tools, we anticipate more research on PORs based on testable hypotheses and rigorous analytic methods.

Here, we develop and validate a model to identify individuals at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) by analyzing blood counts, age, and sex, then determine the model's value when used to supplement conventional screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary care data were collected from a cohort of 606 403 Israelis (of whom 3135 were diagnosed with CRC) and a case control UK dataset of 5061 CRC cases and 25 613 controls. The model was developed on 80% of the Israeli dataset and validated using the remaining Israeli and UK datasets. Performance was evaluated according to the area under the curve, specificity, and odds ratio at several working points. RESULTS: Using blood counts obtained 3-6 months before diagnosis, the area under the curve for detecting CRC was 0.82 <c2><b1> 0.01 for the Israeli validation set. The specificity was 88 <c2><b1> 2% in the Israeli validation set and 94 <c2><b1> 1% in the UK dataset. Detecting 50% of CRC cases, the odds ratio was 26 <c2><b1> 5 and 40 <c2><b1> 6, respectively, for a false-positive rate of 0.5%. Specificity for 50% detection was 87 <c2><b1> 2% a year before diagnosis and 85 <c2><b1> 2% for localized cancers. When used in addition to the fecal occult blood test, our model enabled more than a 2-fold increase in CRC detection. DISCUSSION: Comparable results in 2 unrelated populations suggest that the model should generally apply to the detection of CRC in other groups. The model's performance is superior to current iron deficiency anemia management guidelines, and may help physicians to identify individuals requiring additional clinical evaluation.

Syred_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Would you tell everyone this? Facebook conversations as health promotion interventions,"Syred, Jonathan and Naidoo, Carla and Woodhall, Sarah C. and Baraitser, Paula",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Health promotion interventions on social networking sites can communicate individually tailored content to a large audience. User-generated content helps to maximize engagement, but health promotion websites have had variable success in supporting user engagement. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine which elements of moderator and participant behavior stimulated and maintained interaction with a sexual health promotion site on Facebook. METHODS: We examined the pattern and content of posts on a Facebook page. Google analytics was used to describe the number of people using the page and viewing patterns. A qualitative, thematic approach was used to analyze content. RESULTS: During the study period (January 18, 2010, to June 27, 2010), 576 users interacted 888 times with the site through 508 posts and 380 comments with 93% of content generated by users. The user-generated conversation continued while new participants were driven to the site by advertising, but interaction with the site ceased rapidly after the advertising stopped. Conversations covered key issues on chlamydia and chlamydia testing. Users endorsed testing, celebrated their negative results, and modified and questioned key messages. There was variation in user approach to the site from sharing of personal experience and requesting help to joking about sexually transmitted infection. The moderator voice was reactive, unengaged, tolerant, simplistic, and was professional in tone. There was no change in the moderator approach throughout the period studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest this health promotion site provided a space for single user posts but not a self-sustaining conversation. Possible explanations for this include little new content from the moderator, a definition of content too narrow to hold the interest of participants, and limited responsiveness to user needs. Implications for health promotion practice include the need to consider a life cycle approach to online community development for health promotion and the need for a developing moderator strategy to reflect this. This strategy should reflect two facets of moderation for online health promotion interventions: (1) unengaged and professional oversight to provide a safe space for discussion and to maintain information quality, and (2) a more engaged and interactive presence designed to maintain interest that generates new material for discussion and is responsive to user requests.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3231,16,4,e108,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Chlamydia trachomatis and *Reproductive Health and *Social Media and Adolescent and Adult and chlamydia and Chlamydia Infections/*prevention & control and Female and health promotion and Health Promotion/*methods and Humans and Interviews as Topic and Male and Middle Aged and Sexual Behavior and social media and Social Networking and United Kingdom and Young Adult,NA,NA,2014/04/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Simultaneously, social media data have exploded in availability and have been shown to correlate with the prevalence of certain health conditions. OBJECTIVE: Facebook likes may be a source of digital data that can complement traditional public health surveillance systems and provide data at a local level. We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants. METHODS: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System. RESULTS: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R(2)) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R(2)=.77).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed semantic relationships reported in the literature and developed a manual annotation schema. We used the initial schema to annotate sentences extracted from narrative note sections of cardiology, urology, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) notes. We audio recorded ENT visits and annotated their parsed transcripts. We combined the results of each annotation into a consolidated set of concept-relationship-concept tuples. We then compared the tuples used within and across the multiple data sources. RESULTS: We annotated a total of 626 sentences. Starting with 8 relationships from the literature, we annotated 182 sentences from 8 inpatient consult notes (initial set of tuples = 43). Next, we annotated 232 sentences from 10 outpatient visit notes (enhanced set of tuples = 75). Then, we annotated 212 sentences from transcripts of 5 outpatient visits (final set of tuples = 82).

Recently, however, more advanced embedding methods and representations (eg, ELMo, BERT) have further pushed the state of the art in NLP, yet there are no common best practices for how to integrate these representations into clinical tasks. The purpose of this study, then, is to explore the space of possible options in utilizing these new models for clinical concept extraction, including comparing these to traditional word embedding methods (word2vec, GloVe, fastText). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both off-the-shelf, open-domain embeddings and pretrained clinical embeddings from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) are evaluated. We explore a battery of embedding methods consisting of traditional word embeddings and contextual embeddings and compare these on 4 concept extraction corpora: i2b2 2010, i2b2 2012, SemEval 2014, and SemEval 2015. We also analyze the impact of the pretraining time of a large language model like ELMo or BERT on the extraction performance. Last, we present an intuitive way to understand the semantic information encoded by contextual embeddings. RESULTS: Contextual embeddings pretrained on a large clinical corpus achieves new state-of-the-art performances across all concept extraction tasks.

Kumar_2017_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,An Ensemble of Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification,"Kumar, Ashnil and Kim, Jinman and Lyndon, David and Fulham, Michael and Feng, Dagan",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"The availability of medical imaging data from clinical archives, research literature, and clinical manuals, coupled with recent advances in computer vision offer the opportunity for image-based diagnosis, teaching, and biomedical research. However, the content and semantics of an image can vary depending on its modality and as such the identification of image modality is an important preliminary step. The key challenge for automatically classifying the modality of a medical image is due to the visual characteristics of different modalities: some are visually distinct while others may have only subtle differences. This challenge is compounded by variations in the appearance of images based on the diseases depicted and a lack of sufficient training data for some modalities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for classifying medical images that uses an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. CNNs are a state-of-the-art image classification technique that learns the optimal image features for a given classification task. We hypothesise that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic image representation and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable higher quality features to be extracted. Our method develops a new feature extractor by fine-tuning CNNs that have been initialized on a large dataset of natural images. The fine-tuning process leverages the generic image features from natural images that are fundamental for all images and optimizes them for the variety of medical imaging modalities. These features are used to train numerous multiclass classifiers whose posterior probabilities are fused to predict the modalities of unseen images. Our experiments on the ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset (30 modalities; 6776 training images, and 4166 test images) show that our ensemble of fine-tuned CNNs achieves a higher accuracy than established CNNs. Our ensemble also achieves a higher accuracy than methods in the literature evaluated on the same benchmark dataset and is only overtaken by those methods that source additional training data.",2017,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635663,21,1,31-40,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Machine Learning and *Neural Networks, Computer and Diagnostic Imaging/*classification and Electronic Health Records/*classification and Humans and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods",NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

To promote PA, smartphone apps have great potential, but there is no evidence for their effectiveness in this population. To increase the likelihood that a newly developed app will be effective, formative research and user testing are required. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the development, usability, acceptability, and feasibility of a new theory- and evidence-based smartphone app to promote an active lifestyle in lower-educated working young adults. METHODS: The new app was developed by applying 4 steps. First, determinants important to promote an active lifestyle in this population were selected. Second, evidence-based behavior change techniques were selected to convert the determinants into practical applications. Third, a new smartphone app was developed. Fourth, volunteers (n=11, both lower and higher educated) tested the app on usability, and lower-educated working young adults (n=16) tested its acceptability and feasibility via (think aloud) interviews, a questionnaire, and Google Analytics. The app was accordingly adapted for the final version. RESULTS: A new Android app, Active Coach, was developed that focused on knowledge, attitude, social support, and self-efficacy (based on outcomes from step 1), and that applied self-regulation techniques (based on outcomes from step 2). The app consists of a 9-week program with personal goals, practical tips, and scientific facts to encourage an active lifestyle. To ensure all-day and automatic self-monitoring of the activity behavior, the Active Coach app works in combination with a wearable activity tracker, the Fitbit Charge. Issues detected by the usability test (eg, text errors, wrong messages) were all fixed. The acceptability and feasibility test showed that participants found the app clear, understandable, and motivating, although some aspects needed to be more personal. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a stepwise, user-centered approach that regularly consulted the target group, the new app is adapted to their specific needs and preferences. The Active Coach app was overall positively evaluated by the lower-educated working young adults at the end of the development process.",2018,10.2196/mhealth.8287,6,2,e44,eng,2291-5222,active transport and health promotion and mHealth and mobile applications and physical activity and young adult,NA,NA,2018/02/20/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, existing machine learning approaches are often regarded by clinicians as black boxes. Moreover, training data for these automated approaches at often sparsely annotated at best. The authors target unsupervised learning for modeling clinical narrative text, aiming at improving both accuracy and interpretability. METHODS: The authors introduce a novel framework named subgraph augmented non-negative tensor factorization (SANTF). In addition to relying on atomic features (e.g., words in clinical narrative text), SANTF automatically mines higher-order features (e.g., relations of lymphoid cells expressing antigens) from clinical narrative text by converting sentences into a graph representation and identifying important subgraphs. The authors compose a tensor using patients, higher-order features, and atomic features as its respective modes. We then apply non-negative tensor factorization to cluster patients, and simultaneously identify latent groups of higher-order features that link to patient clusters, as in clinical guidelines where a panel of immunophenotypic features and laboratory results are used to specify diagnostic criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: SANTF demonstrated over 10% improvement in averaged F-measure on patient clustering compared to widely used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means clustering methods. Multiple baselines were established by modeling patient data using patient-by-features matrices with different feature configurations and then performing NMF or k-means to cluster patients. Feature analysis identified latent groups of higher-order features that lead to medical insights. We also found that the latent groups of atomic features help to better correlate the latent groups of higher-order features.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocv016,22,5,1009-1019,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Electronic Health Records and *Natural Language Processing and *Unsupervised Machine Learning and Data Mining/*methods and Hodgkin Disease and Humans and Narration and natural language processing and non-negative tensor factorization and subgraph mining and unsupervised learning,NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

One conceptual space where this collision is brought into sharp relief is with the open availability of patient medical photographs from peer-reviewed journal articles in the search results of online image databases such as Google Images. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the availability of patient medical photographs from published journal articles in Google Images search results and the factors impacting this availability. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from an evidence map of research with transgender, gender non-binary, and other gender diverse (trans) participants. For the original evidence map, a comprehensive search of 15 academic databases was developed in collaboration with a health sciences librarian. Initial search results produced 25,230 references after duplicates were removed. Eligibility criteria were established to include empirical research of any design that included trans participants or their personal information and that was published in English in peer-reviewed journals. We identified all articles published between 2008 and 2015 with medical photographs of trans participants. For each reference, images were individually numbered in order to track the total number of medical photographs. We used odds ratios (OR) to assess the association between availability of the clinical photograph on Google Images and the following factors: whether the article was openly available online (open access, Researchgate.net, or Academia.edu), whether the article included genital images, if the photographs were published in color, and whether the photographs were located on the journal article landing page. RESULTS: We identified 94 articles with medical photographs of trans participants, including a total of 605 photographs. Of the 94 publications, 35 (37%) included at least one medical photograph that was found on Google Images. The ability to locate the article freely online contributes to the availability of at least one image from the article on Google Images (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.20-7.45). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to document the existence of medical photographs from peer-reviewed journals appearing in Google Images search results. Almost all of the images we searched for included sensitive photographs of patient genitals, chests, or breasts. Given that it is unlikely that patients consented to sharing their personal health information in these ways, this constitutes a risk to patient privacy.

Although these stringent regulations effectively slowed the spread of COVID-19, they may have posed challenges to the well-being of residents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effects of residential lockdown on the subjective well-being (SWB) of individuals in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1790 Sina Weibo users who were residents of cities that imposed residential lockdowns, of which 1310 users (73.18%) were female, and 3580 users who were residents of cities that were not locked down (gender-matched with the 1790 lockdown residents). In both the lockdown and nonlockdown groups, we calculated SWB indicators during the 2 weeks before and after the enforcement date of the residential lockdown using individuals' original posts on Sina Weibo. SWB was calculated via online ecological recognition, which is based on established machine learning predictive models. RESULTS: The interactions of time (before the residential lockdown or after the residential lockdown) * area (lockdown or nonlockdown) in the integral analysis (N=5370) showed that after the residential lockdown, compared with the nonlockdown group, the lockdown group scored lower in some negative SWB indicators, including somatization (F(1,5368)=13.593, P<.001) and paranoid ideation (F(1,5368)=14.333, P<.001). The interactions of time (before the residential lockdown or after the residential lockdown) * area (developed or underdeveloped) in the comparison of residential lockdown areas with different levels of economic development (N=1790) indicated that the SWB of residents in underdeveloped areas showed no significant change after the residential lockdown (P>.05), while that of residents in developed areas changed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings increase our understanding of the psychological impact and cost of residential lockdown during an epidemic. The more negative changes in the SWB of residents in developed areas imply a greater need for psychological intervention under residential lockdown in such areas.",2020,10.2196/24775,22,12,e24775,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*COVID-19 and *Machine Learning and *online ecological recognition and *residential lockdown and *subjective well-being and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Algorithms and Asian Continental Ancestry Group and Asians and China/epidemiology and COVID-19 and COVID-19/*epidemiology and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and online ecological recognition and Pandemics and Public Health Surveillance/methods and Quarantine/*psychology and residential lockdown and Social Isolation/*psychology and Social Media and subjective well-being and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/12/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kagashe_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Enhancing Seasonal Influenza Surveillance: Topic Analysis of Widely Used Medicinal Drugs Using Twitter Data,"Kagashe, Ireneus and Yan, Zhijun and Suheryani, Imran",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Uptake of medicinal drugs (preventive or treatment) is among the approaches used to control disease outbreaks, and therefore, it is of vital importance to be aware of the counts or frequencies of most commonly used drugs and trending topics about these drugs from consumers for successful implementation of control measures. Traditional survey methods would have accomplished this study, but they are too costly in terms of resources needed, and they are subject to social desirability bias for topics discovery. Hence, there is a need to use alternative efficient means such as Twitter data and machine learning (ML) techniques. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter data, the aim of the study was to (1) provide a methodological extension for efficiently extracting widely consumed drugs during seasonal influenza and (2) extract topics from the tweets of these drugs and to infer how the insights provided by these topics can enhance seasonal influenza surveillance. METHODS: From tweets collected during the 2012-13 flu season, we first identified tweets with mentions of drugs and then constructed an ML classifier using dependency words as features. The classifier was used to extract tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs, out of which we identified the mostly consumed drugs. Finally, we extracted trending topics from each of these widely used drugs' tweets using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). RESULTS: Our proposed classifier obtained an F(1) score of 0.82, which significantly outperformed the two benchmark classifiers (ie, P<.001 with the lexicon-based and P=.048 with the 1-gram term frequency [TF]). The classifier extracted 40,428 tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs out of 50,828 tweets with mentions of drugs. The most widely consumed drugs were influenza virus vaccines that had around 76.95% (31,111/40,428) share of the total; other notable drugs were Theraflu, DayQuil, NyQuil, vitamins, acetaminophen, and oseltamivir. The topics of each of these drugs exhibited common themes or experiences from people who have consumed these drugs. Among these were the enabling and deterrent factors to influenza drugs uptake, which are keys to mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed the feasibility of using tweets of widely consumed drugs to enhance seasonal influenza surveillance in lieu of the traditional or conventional surveillance approaches. Public health officials and other stakeholders can benefit from the findings of this study, especially in enhancing strategies for mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. The proposed methods can be extended to the outbreaks of other diseases.",2017,10.2196/jmir.7393,19,9,e315,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*disease outbreaks and *influenza and *influenza vaccines and *machine learning and *natural language processing and *public health surveillance and *social media and *Twitter messaging and disease outbreaks and Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data and Drug Therapy/*methods and Humans and influenza and influenza vaccines and Influenza, Human/*epidemiology and machine learning and Machine Learning/*statistics & numerical data and natural language processing and public health surveillance and Public Health/*methods and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and Twitter messaging",NA,NA,2017/09/12/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schmidt_2017_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,User Participation and Engagement With the See Me Smoke-Free mHealth App: Prospective Feasibility Trial,"Schmidt, Chris A. and Romine, James K. and Bell, Melanie L. and Armin, Julie and Gordon, Judith S.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: The See Me Smoke-Free (SMSF) mobile health (mHealth) app was developed to help women quit smoking by targeting concerns about body weight, body image, and self-efficacy through cognitive behavioral techniques and guided imagery audio files addressing smoking, diet, and physical activity. A feasibility trial found associations between SMSF usage and positive treatment outcomes. This paper reports a detailed exploration of program use among eligible individuals consenting to study participation and completing the baseline survey (participants) and ineligible or nonconsenting app installers (nonparticipants), as well as the relationship between program use and treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether (1) participants were more likely to set quit dates, be current smokers, and report higher levels of smoking at baseline than nonparticipants; (2) participants opened the app and listened to audio files more frequently than nonparticipants; and (3) participants with more app usage had a higher likelihood of self-reported smoking abstinence at follow up. METHODS: The SMSF feasibility trial was a single arm, within-subjects, prospective cohort study with assessments at baseline and 30 and 90 days post enrollment. The SMSF app was deployed on the Google Play Store for download, and basic profile characteristics were obtained for all app installers. Additional variables were assessed for study participants. Participants were prompted to use the app daily during study participation. Crude differences in baseline characteristics between trial participants and nonparticipants were evaluated using t tests (continuous variables) and Fisher exact tests (categorical variables). Exact Poisson tests were used to assess group-level differences in mean usage rates over the full study period using aggregate Google Analytics data on participation and usage. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate associations of app usage with participant baseline characteristics after adjustment for putative confounders. Associations between app usage and self-reported smoking abstinence were assessed using separate logistic regression models for each outcome measure. RESULTS: Participants (n=151) were more likely than nonparticipants (n=96) to report female gender (P<.02) and smoking in the 30 days before enrollment (P<.001). Participants and nonparticipants opened the app and updated quit dates at the same average rate (rate ratio [RR] 0.98; 95% CI 0.92-1.04; P=.43), but participants started audio files (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00-1.13; P<.04) and completed audio files (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.18; P<.003) at significantly higher rates than nonparticipants. Higher app usage among participants was positively associated with some smoking cessation outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests potential efficacy of the SMSF app, as increased usage was generally associated with higher self-reported smoking abstinence. A planned randomized controlled trial will assess the SMSF app's efficacy as an intervention tool to help women quit smoking.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7900,5,10,e142,eng,2291-5222,diet and intervention and mHealth and mobile health and physical activity and smoking,NA,NA,2017/10/09/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, we lack such a theory of decision support itself and a model to describe clinical decisions and the systems to support them. This article outlines such a framework. We present a two-stream model of information flow within clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs): reasoning about the patient (the clinical stream), and reasoning about the user (the cognitive-behavioral stream). We propose that CDSS ""effectiveness"" be measured not only in terms of a system's impact on clinical care, but also in terms of how (and by whom) the system is used, its effect on work processes, and whether it facilitates appropriate decisions by clinicians and patients.

While CDSS research papers have focused on benefits of these systems, there is a smaller body of literature showing that CDSSs may also produce unintended adverse consequences (UACs). Detailed here are 2 cases of UACs resulting from a CDSS. Both of these cases were related to external systems that fed data into the CDSS. In the first case, lack of knowledge of data categorization in an external pharmacy system produced a UAC; in the second case, the change of a clinical laboratory instrument produced the UAC. CDSSs rely on data from many external systems. These systems are dynamic and may have changes in hardware, software, vendors, or processes. Such changes can affect the accuracy of CDSSs. These cases point to the need for the CDSS team to be familiar with these external systems.

Among the many advantages of digital technology is that it allows preventive and clinical interventions, both of which are needed to reduce the prevalence of mental health disorders, to be feasibly integrated into health care and community delivery systems and delivered at scale. However, the use of digital technology also presents several challenges, including how systems can manage and implement interventions in a rapidly changing digital environment and handle critical issues that affect population-wide outcomes, including reaching the targeted population, obtaining meaningful levels of uptake and use of interventions, and achieving significant outcomes. We describe a possible solution, which is to have an outcome optimization team that focuses on the dynamic use of data to adapt interventions for populations, while at the same time, addressing the complex relationships among reach, uptake, use, and outcome. We use the example of eating disorders in young people to illustrate how this solution could be implemented at scale. We also discuss system, practitioner-related, and other issues related to the adaptation of such an approach. Digital technology has great potential for facilitating the reduction of mental illness rates in populations. However, achieving this goal will require the implementation of new approaches.

DESIGN: CHIEF is based on the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture framework, and uses a combination of rules, dictionaries, and machine learning methods to extract left ventricular function mentions and values, CHF medications, and documented reasons for a patient not receiving these medications. MEASUREMENTS: The training and evaluation of CHIEF were based on subsets of a reference standard of various clinical notes from 1083 Veterans Health Administration patients. Domain experts manually annotated these notes to create our reference standard. Metrics used included recall, precision, and the F 1 -measure. RESULTS: In general, CHIEF extracted CHF medications with high recall (>0.990) and good precision (0.960-0.978). Mentions of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction were also extracted with high recall (0.978-0.986) and precision (0.986-0.994), and quantitative values of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction were found with 0.910-0.945 recall and with high precision (0.939-0.976). Reasons for not prescribing CHF medications were more difficult to extract, only reaching fair accuracy with about 0.310-0.400 recall and 0.250-0.320 precision.

Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a multipurpose surgery decision-making website providing medical information, psychological support, and decision-related simulation for women during breast cancer surgery-related decision making. METHODS: Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle. RESULTS: Using the action research approach, we completed the development of our website, which includes the following: (1) ""Woman's Voice""-an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) ""Cancer Information Treasure House""-providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) ""Decision-making Simulator""-helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including ""Stairs Climbing"" and ""Fruit of Hope""; and (4) ""Recommended Links""-providing reliable websites for further reference. Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients' and health providers' needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.

Syrowatka_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Features of Computer-Based Decision Aids: Systematic Review, Thematic Synthesis, and Meta-Analyses","Syrowatka, Ania and Kromker, Dorthe and Meguerditchian, Ari N. and Tamblyn, Robyn",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Patient information and education, such as decision aids, are gradually moving toward online, computer-based environments. Considerable research has been conducted to guide content and presentation of decision aids. However, given the relatively new shift to computer-based support, little attention has been given to how multimedia and interactivity can improve upon paper-based decision aids. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this review was to summarize published literature into a proposed classification of features that have been integrated into computer-based decision aids. Building on this classification, the second objective was to assess whether integration of specific features was associated with higher-quality decision making. METHODS: Relevant studies were located by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. The review identified studies that evaluated computer-based decision aids for adults faced with preference-sensitive medical decisions and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. A thematic synthesis was conducted to develop the classification of features. Subsequently, meta-analyses were conducted based on standardized mean differences (SMD) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported knowledge or decisional conflict. Further subgroup analyses compared pooled SMDs for decision aids that incorporated a specific feature to other computer-based decision aids that did not incorporate the feature, to assess whether specific features improved quality of decision making. RESULTS: Of 3541 unique publications, 58 studies met the target criteria and were included in the thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified six features: content control, tailoring, patient narratives, explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. A subset of 26 RCTs from the thematic synthesis was used to conduct the meta-analyses. As expected, computer-based decision aids performed better than usual care or alternative aids; however, some features performed better than others. Integration of content control improved quality of decision making (SMD 0.59 vs 0.23 for knowledge; SMD 0.39 vs 0.29 for decisional conflict). In contrast, tailoring reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.40 vs 0.71 for knowledge; SMD 0.25 vs 0.52 for decisional conflict). Similarly, patient narratives also reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.43 vs 0.65 for knowledge; SMD 0.17 vs 0.46 for decisional conflict). Results were varied for different types of explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of media rich or interactive features into computer-based decision aids can improve quality of preference-sensitive decision making. However, this is an emerging field with limited evidence to guide use. The systematic review and thematic synthesis identified features that have been integrated into available computer-based decision aids, in an effort to facilitate reporting of these features and to promote integration of such features into decision aids. The meta-analyses and associated subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence to support integration of specific features into future decision aids. Further research can focus on clarifying independent contributions of specific features through experimental designs and refining the designs of features to improve effectiveness.",2016,10.2196/jmir.4982,18,1,e20,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Computers and *Decision Making and *Decision Support Techniques and Adult and computers and decision making and decision support systems, clinical and Humans and internet and medical informatics and Multimedia and Online Systems and patient participation and patient preference and patients and Social Support and Systems Integration",NA,NA,2016/01/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Franco_2016_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Popular Nutrition-Related Mobile Apps: A Feature Assessment,"Franco, Rodrigo Zenun and Fallaize, Rosalind and Lovegrove, Julie A. and Hwang, Faustina",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: A key challenge in human nutrition is the assessment of usual food intake. This is of particular interest given recent proposals of eHealth personalized interventions. The adoption of mobile phones has created an opportunity for assessing and improving nutrient intake as they can be used for digitalizing dietary assessments and providing feedback. In the last few years, hundreds of nutrition-related mobile apps have been launched and installed by millions of users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the main features of the most popular nutrition apps and to compare their strategies and technologies for dietary assessment and user feedback. METHODS: Apps were selected from the two largest online stores of the most popular mobile operating systems-the Google Play Store for Android and the iTunes App Store for iOS-based on popularity as measured by the number of installs and reviews. The keywords used in the search were as follows: calorie(s), diet, diet tracker, dietician, dietitian, eating, fit, fitness, food, food diary, food tracker, health, lose weight, nutrition, nutritionist, weight, weight loss, weight management, weight watcher, and ww calculator. The inclusion criteria were as follows: English language, minimum number of installs (1 million for Google Play Store) or reviews (7500 for iTunes App Store), relation to nutrition (ie, diet monitoring or recommendation), and independence from any device (eg, wearable) or subscription. RESULTS: A total of 13 apps were classified as popular for inclusion in the analysis. Nine apps offered prospective recording of food intake using a food diary feature. Food selection was available via text search or barcode scanner technologies. Portion size selection was only textual (ie, without images or icons). All nine of these apps were also capable of collecting physical activity (PA) information using self-report, the global positioning system (GPS), or wearable integrations. Their outputs focused predominantly on energy balance between dietary intake and PA. None of these nine apps offered features directly related to diet plans and motivational coaching. In contrast, the remaining four of the 13 apps focused on these opportunities, but without food diaries. One app-FatSecret-also had an innovative feature for connecting users with health professionals, and another-S Health-provided a nutrient balance score. CONCLUSIONS: The high number of installs indicates that there is a clear interest and opportunity for diet monitoring and recommendation using mobile apps. All the apps collecting dietary intake used the same nutrition assessment method (ie, food diary record) and technologies for data input (ie, text search and barcode scanner). Emerging technologies, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, were not identified. None of the apps had a decision engine capable of providing personalized diet advice.",2016,10.2196/mhealth.5846,4,3,e85,eng,2291-5222,diet apps and eHealth and food diary and mHealth and mobile phone and mobile technology and nutrition apps and nutritional assessment,NA,NA,2016/08/01/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The authors-an interdisciplinary team from academia, the private sector, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-participated in the Code-a-Thon as part of the prevention track. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and deploy a methodology using machine learning to accurately detect the marketing and sale of opioids by illicit online sellers via Twitter as part of participation at the HHS Opioid Code-a-Thon event. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public application programming interface stream filtered for common prescription opioid keywords in conjunction with participation in the Code-a-Thon from November 15, 2017 to December 5, 2017. An unsupervised machine learning-based approach was developed and used during the Code-a-Thon competition (24 hours) to obtain a summary of the content of the tweets to isolate those clusters associated with illegal online marketing and sale using a biterm topic model (BTM). After isolating relevant tweets, hyperlinks associated with these tweets were reviewed to assess the characteristics of illegal online sellers. RESULTS: We collected and analyzed 213,041 tweets over the course of the Code-a-Thon containing keywords codeine, percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, oxycodone, fentanyl, and hydrocodone. Using BTM, 0.32% (692/213,041) tweets were identified as being associated with illegal online marketing and sale of prescription opioids. After removing duplicates and dead links, we identified 34 unique ""live"" tweets, with 44% (15/34) directing consumers to illicit online pharmacies, 32% (11/34) linked to individual drug sellers, and 21% (7/34) used by marketing affiliates. In addition to offering the ""no prescription"" sale of opioids, many of these vendors also sold other controlled substances and illicit drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are in line with prior studies that have identified social media platforms, including Twitter, as a potential conduit for supply and sale of illicit opioids. To translate these results into action, authors also developed a prototype wireframe for the purposes of detecting, classifying, and reporting illicit online pharmacy tweets selling controlled substances illegally to the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Further development of solutions based on these methods has the potential to proactively alert regulators and law enforcement agencies of illegal opioid sales, while also making the online environment safer for the public.",2018,10.2196/10029,20,4,e10029,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*drug abuse and *machine learning and *online pharmacies and *opioid abuse and *prescription drug misuse and *unsupervised machine learning and Analgesics, Opioid/*supply & distribution and Controlled Substances/*supply & distribution and drug abuse and Humans and Internet and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Marketing and online pharmacies and opioid abuse and Pharmaceutical Services, Online/*standards and prescription drug misuse and Prescription Drug Misuse/*prevention & control and Social Media and unsupervised machine learning",NA,NA,2018/04/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Masud_2017_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Resource-Aware Mobile-Based Health Monitoring,"Masud, Mohammad M. and Adel Serhani, Mohamed and Navaz, Alramzana Nujum",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Monitoring heart diseases often requires frequent measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at different periods of the day, and at different situations (e.g., traveling, and exercising). This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth. Compared to several greedy but nonoptimal solutions, the execution time of our approach was at least 10 times faster and consumed 90% less energy.",2017,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2525006,21,2,349-360,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted and Algorithms and Data Mining/*methods and Electrocardiography, Ambulatory/methods and Humans and Machine Learning and Telemedicine/*methods",NA,NA,2017/03//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 1 Deadly Step program involves community-based events that use a sporting platform and cultural ambassadors to improve chronic disease prevention and management in New South Wales (NSW). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based chronic disease screening program for Aboriginal people. METHODS: In 2015, the program was enhanced to include an iPad app for screening assessments, a results portal for nominated care providers, and a reporting portal for program administrators and implemented in 9 NSW community events. A mixed methods evaluation comprising survey data, analytics obtained from iPad and Web portal usage, and key informant interviews was conducted. RESULTS: Overall, 1046 people were screened between April 2015 and April 2016 (mean age 40.3 years, 640 (61.19%) female, 957 (91.49%) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander). High chronic disease rates were observed (231 [22.08%] participants at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, 173 [16.54%] with diabetes, and 181 [17.30%] with albuminuria). A minority at high risk of CVD (99/231 [42.9%]) and with diabetes (73/173 [42.2%]) were meeting guideline-recommended management goals. Overall, 297 participants completed surveys (response rate 37.4%) with 85.1% reporting satisfaction with event organization and information gained and 6.1% experiencing problems with certain screening activities. Furthermore, 21 interviews were conducted. A strong local working group and processes that harnessed community social networks were key to implementation success. Although software enhancements facilitated screening and data management, some technical difficulties (eg, time delays in processing blood test results) impeded smooth processing of information. Only 51.43% of participants had a medical review recorded postevent with wide intersite variability (10.5%-85.6%). Factors associated with successful follow-up included clinic managers with overall program responsibility and availability of medical staff for immediate discussion of results on event day. The program was considered highly resource intensive to implement and support from a central coordinating body and integration with existing operational processes was essential. CONCLUSIONS: 1 Deadly Step offers an effective and acceptable strategy to engage Aboriginal communities in chronic disease screening. High rates of risk factors and management gaps were encountered, including people with no previous knowledge of these issues.

METHODS: We systematically explored 4 widely used transformer-based architectures, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for extracting various types of clinical concepts using 3 public datasets from the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 challenges and the 2018 n2c2 challenge. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora as well as clinical transformer models pretrained using a clinical corpus and compared them with a long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRFs) mode as a baseline. Furthermore, we integrated the 4 clinical transformer-based models into an open-source package. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The RoBERTa-MIMIC model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3 public clinical concept extraction datasets with F1-scores of 0.8994, 0.8053, and 0.8907, respectively. Compared to the baseline LSTM-CRFs model, RoBERTa-MIMIC remarkably improved the F1-score by approximately 4% and 6% on the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 datasets.

However, the bulk of this research has been conducted in the context of social support interventions that specifically address stressful situations or health improvements. Little research has examined social support received from artificial agents in everyday contexts. OBJECTIVE: Considering that social support manifests in not only crises but also everyday situations and that everyday social support forms the basis of support received during more stressful events, we aimed to investigate the types of everyday social support that can be received from artificial agents. METHODS: In Study 1, we examined publicly available user reviews (N=1854) of Replika, a popular companion chatbot. In Study 2, a sample (n=66) of Replika users provided detailed open-ended responses regarding their experiences of using Replika. We conducted thematic analysis on both datasets to gain insight into the kind of everyday social support that users receive through interactions with Replika. RESULTS: Replika provides some level of companionship that can help curtail loneliness, provide a ""safe space"" in which users can discuss any topic without the fear of judgment or retaliation, increase positive affect through uplifting and nurturing messages, and provide helpful information/advice when normal sources of informational support are not available. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial agents may be a promising source of everyday social support, particularly companionship, emotional, informational, and appraisal support, but not as tangible support.

The BG level is preferably maintained close to normality through self-management practices, which involves actively tracking BG levels and taking proper actions including adjusting diet and insulin medications. BG anomalies could be defined as any undesirable reading because of either a precisely known reason (normal cause variation) or an unknown reason (special cause variation) to the patient. Recently, machine-learning applications have been widely introduced within diabetes research in general and BG anomaly detection in particular. However, irrespective of their expanding and increasing popularity, there is a lack of up-to-date reviews that materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies for BG anomaly classification and detection in people with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify, assess, and analyze the state-of-the-art machine-learning strategies and their hybrid systems focusing on BG anomaly classification and detection including glycemic variability (GV), hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes within the context of personalized decision support systems and BG alarm events applications, which are important constituents for optimal diabetes self-management. METHODS: A rigorous literature search was conducted between September 1 and October 1, 2017, and October 15 and November 5, 2018, through various Web-based databases. Peer-reviewed journals and articles were considered. Information from the selected literature was extracted based on predefined categories, which were based on previous research and further elaborated through brainstorming. RESULTS: The initial results were vetted using the title, abstract, and keywords and retrieved 496 papers. After a thorough assessment and screening, 47 articles remained, which were critically analyzed. The interrater agreement was measured using a Cohen kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. The state-of-the-art classes of machine learning have been developed and tested up to the task and achieved promising performance including artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, genetic algorithm, Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, deep belief network, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity of BG dynamics, there are many attempts to capture hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia incidences and the extent of an individual's GV using different approaches. Recently, the advancement of diabetes technologies and continuous accumulation of self-collected health data have paved the way for popularity of machine learning in these tasks. According to the review, most of the identified studies used a theoretical threshold, which suffers from inter- and intrapatient variation. Therefore, future studies should consider the difference among patients and also track its temporal change over time. Moreover, studies should also give more emphasis on the types of inputs used and their associated time lag. Generally, we foresee that these developments might encourage researchers to further develop and test these systems on a large-scale basis.",2019,10.2196/11030,21,5,e11030,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*anomalies detection and *blood glucose dynamics and *machine learning and *type 1 diabetes and Algorithms and anomalies detection and blood glucose dynamics and Blood Glucose/analysis/*metabolism and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/*classification/complications and Female and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning and Male and type 1 diabetes",NA,NA,2019/05/01/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Web-based technologies, including smartphones, are novel means to enable evidence-based care and improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design, develop, and assess the utilization of an asthma collaborative self-management (CSM) platform (breathe) using content based on international evidence-based clinical guidelines. METHODS: We designed and developed breathe as a Web-based mobile health (mHealth) platform accessible on smartphones, tablets, or desktop with user-centered design methods and International Organization for Standardization-certified quality development processes. Moreover, breathe was envisioned as a multifunctional, CSM mHealth platform, with content based on international clinical practice guidelines and compliant with national privacy and security specifications. The system enabled CSM (patient, provider, and breathe) and self-monitoring of asthma patients through (1) assessment of asthma control, (2) real-time access to a dynamic asthma action plan, (3) access to real-time environmental conditions, and (4) risk-reduction messaging. The data collection protocol collected user data for 12 months, with clinic visits at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Utilization outcomes included user interactions with the platform, user impressions, self-reported medication use, asthma symptom profile, reported peak flow measurement, and the delivery and impact of email reminders. RESULTS: We enrolled 138 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years to receive the breathe intervention. Majority were female (100/138, 72.5%), had a smartphone (92/138, 66.7%), and had a mean Asthma Control Test score of 18.3 (SD 4.9). A majority reported that breathe helped in the management of their asthma. Moreover, breathe scored 71.1 (SD 18.9) on the System Usability Scale. Overall, 123 patients had complete usage analytics datasets. The platform sent 7.96 reminder emails per patient per week (pppw), patients accessed breathe 3.08 times, journaled symptoms 2.56 times, reported medication usage 0.30 times, and reported peak flow measurements 0.92 times pppw. Furthermore, breathe calculated patients' action plan zone of control 2.72 times pppw, with patients being in the green (well-controlled) zone in 47.71% (8300/17,396) of the total calculations. Usage analysis showed that 67.5% (83/123) of the participants used the app at week 4 and only 57.7% (71/123) by week 45. Physician visits, email reminders, and aged 50 years and above were associated with higher utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with asthma reported good usability and high satisfaction levels, reacted to breathe notifications, and had confidence in the platform's assessment of asthma control. Strong utilization was seen at the intervention's initiation, followed by a rapid reduction in use.

However, pregnant women living in low- and middle-income areas or countries often fail to receive early clinical interventions at local medical facilities due to restricted availability of GDM diagnosis. The outstanding performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in disease diagnosis in previous studies demonstrates its promising applications in GDM diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the implementation of a well-performing AI algorithm in GDM diagnosis in a setting, which requires fewer medical equipment and staff and to establish an app based on the AI algorithm. This study also explores possible progress if our app is widely used. METHODS: An AI model that included 9 algorithms was trained on 12,304 pregnant outpatients with their consent who received a test for GDM in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, a local hospital in South China, between November 2010 and October 2017. GDM was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2011 diagnostic criteria. Age and fasting blood glucose were chosen as critical parameters. For validation, we performed k-fold cross-validation (k=5) for the internal dataset and an external validation dataset that included 1655 cases from the Prince of Wales Hospital, the affiliated teaching hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a non-local hospital. Accuracy, sensitivity, and other criteria were calculated for each algorithm. RESULTS: The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of external validation dataset for support vector machine (SVM), random forest, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, logistic regression (LR), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were 0.780, 0.657, 0.736, 0.669, 0.774, 0.614, 0.769, 0.742, and 0.757, respectively. SVM also retained high performance in other criteria. The specificity for SVM retained 100% in the external validation set with an accuracy of 88.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective and multicenter study is the first clinical study that supports the GDM diagnosis for pregnant women in resource-limited areas, using only fasting blood glucose value, patients' age, and a smartphone connected to the internet. Our study proved that SVM can achieve accurate diagnosis with less operation cost and higher efficacy. Our study (referred to as GDM-AI study, ie, the study of AI-based diagnosis of GDM) also shows our app has a promising future in improving the quality of maternal health for pregnant women, precision medicine, and long-distance medical care.

An electronic health record (EHR)-integrated machine learning (ML) algorithm is a potentially powerful tool to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of CDS alerts and positively impact the clinician's interaction with these alerts in general. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development and implementation of an ML-based signal-to-noise optimization system (SmartCDS) to increase the signal of alerts by decreasing the volume of low-value herpes zoster (shingles) vaccination alerts. METHODS: We built and deployed SmartCDS, which builds personalized user activity profiles to suppress shingles vaccination alerts unlikely to yield a clinician's interaction. We extracted all records of shingles alerts from January 2017 to March 2019 from our EHR system, including 327,737 encounters, 780 providers, and 144,438 patients. RESULTS: During the 6 weeks of pilot deployment, the SmartCDS system suppressed an average of 43.67% (15,425/35,315) potential shingles alerts (appointments) and maintained stable counts of weekly shingles vaccination orders (326.3 with system active vs 331.3 in the control group; P=.38) and weekly user-alert interactions (1118.3 with system active vs 1166.3 in the control group; P=.20). CONCLUSIONS: All key statistics remained stable while the system was turned on. Although the results are promising, the characteristics of the system can be subject to future data shifts, which require automated logging and monitoring. We demonstrated that an automated, ML-based method and data architecture to suppress alerts are feasible without detriment to overall order rates.

The role of mHealth in facilitating evidence-based clinical decision-making through data collection, decision algorithms, and evidence-based guidelines, for example, is established in resource-rich settings. However, the extent to which mobile clinical decision support systems (mCDSS) have been adopted specifically in resource-poor settings such as Africa and the lessons learned about their use in such settings are yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence on the use of mHealth for point-of-care decision support and improved quality of care by health care workers in Africa. METHODS: A scoping review of 4 peer-reviewed and 1 grey literature databases was conducted. No date limits were applied, but only articles in English language were selected. Using pre-established criteria, 2 reviewers screened articles and extracted data. Articles were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and MAXQDA. RESULTS: We retained 22 articles representing 11 different studies in 7 sub-Saharan African countries. Interventions were mainly in the domain of maternal health and ranged from simple text messaging (short message service, SMS) to complex multicomponent interventions. Although health workers are generally supportive of mCDSS and perceive them as useful, concerns about increased workload and altered workflow hinder sustainability. Facilitators and barriers to use of mCDSS include technical and infrastructural support, ownership, health system challenges, and training. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mCDSS in sub-Saharan Africa is an indication of progress in mHealth, although their effect on quality of service delivery is yet to be fully explored. Lessons learned are useful for informing future research, policy, and practice for technologically supported health care delivery, especially in resource-poor settings.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.7185,5,3,e38,eng,2291-5222,"clinical decision-making and decision support systems, clinical and mHealth and sub-Saharan Africa",NA,NA,2017/03/23/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A reliable and valid survey was used to measure IT sophistication. The target goal was 10% from each state in the United States, 1570 nursing homes. A random sample of homes from each state was recruited from Nursing Home Compare. RESULTS: The team reached 2627 nursing home administrators, among whom 1799 administrators agreed to participate and were sent a survey. A total of 815 surveys were completed (45.3% response rate), which was below the goal. Facilities in the participating sample have similar demographic characteristics (ownership, total population in a location, and bed size) to the remaining homes not participating. There are greater IT capabilities in resident care and administrative activities, less in clinical support. The extent of use of these capabilities appears to be highest in administrative activities and lowest in clinical support. IT in resident care appears to be the most integrated with internal and external stakeholders. IT capabilities appear to be greater than IT extent of use in all health domains, with the greatest difference in resident care. DISCUSSION: National evaluations of nursing home IT are rare. Measuring trends in IT adoption in a nationally representative sample provides meaningful analytics that could be more useful for policy makers and nursing home leaders in the future.

Kline_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Using Item Response Theory for Explainable Machine Learning in Predicting Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: Case-Based Approach,"Kline, Adrienne and Kline, Theresa and Shakeri Hossein Abad, Zahra and Lee, Joon",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Supervised machine learning (ML) is being featured in the health care literature with study results frequently reported using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, or F1 score. Although each metric provides a different perspective on the performance, they remain to be overall measures for the whole sample, discounting the uniqueness of each case or patient. Intuitively, we know that all cases are not equal, but the present evaluative approaches do not take case difficulty into account. OBJECTIVE: A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar value. METHODS: Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the interaction between them in predicting accuracy. RESULTS: The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.",2020,10.2196/20268,22,9,e20268,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*item response theory and *machine learning and *mortality and *statistical model and Aged and Algorithms and Humans and Intensive Care Units/*standards and item response theory and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and mortality and statistical model and Survival Analysis,NA,NA,2020/09/25/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is based on a de-identified cohort of 2,521 hypertension patients from a chronic care coordination program at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Patients were modeled as vectors of features derived from electronic health records (EHRs) over a six-year period. We applied a stepwise regression to identify risk factors associated with a decrease in mean arterial pressure of at least 2 mmHg after program enrollment. The resulting features were subsequently validated via a logistic regression classifier. Finally, risk factors were applied to group the patients through model-based clustering. RESULTS: We identified a set of predictive features that consisted of a mix of demographic, medication, and diagnostic concepts. Logistic regression over these features yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% CI: [0.67, 0.76]). Based on these features, four clinically meaningful groups are identified through clustering - two of which represented patients with more severe disease profiles, while the remaining represented patients with mild disease profiles. DISCUSSION: Patients with hypertension can exhibit significant variation in their blood pressure control status and responsiveness to therapy. Yet this work shows that a clustering analysis can generate more homogeneous patient groups, which may aid clinicians in designing and implementing customized care programs. CONCLUSION: The study shows that predictive modeling and clustering using EHR data can be beneficial for providing a systematic, generalized approach for care providers to tailor their management approach based upon patient-level factors.",2016,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2514264,NA,NA,NA,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,NA,NA,NA,2016/01/04/,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The increasing public awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) leads more parents to suspect ASD in their child. Early identification of ASD is important for early intervention. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the symptoms mentioned in online queries posed by parents who suspect that their child might have ASD and determine whether they are age-specific. To test the efficacy of machine learning tools in classifying the child's risk of ASD based on the parent's narrative. METHODS: To this end, we analyzed online queries posed by parents who were concerned that their child might have ASD and categorized the warning signs they mentioned according to ASD-specific and non-ASD-specific domains. We then used the data to test the efficacy with which a trained machine learning tool classified the degree of ASD risk. Yahoo Answers, a social site for posting queries and finding answers, was mined for queries of parents asking the community whether their child has ASD. A total of 195 queries were sampled for this study (mean child age=38.0 months; 84.7% [160/189] boys). Content text analysis of the queries aimed to categorize the types of symptoms described and obtain clinical judgment of the child's ASD-risk level. RESULTS: Concerns related to repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests (RRBI) were the most prevalent (75.4%, 147/195), followed by concerns related to language (61.5%, 120/195) and emotional markers (50.3%, 98/195). Of the 195 queries, 18.5% (36/195) were rated by clinical experts as low-risk, 30.8% (60/195) as medium-risk, and 50.8% (99/195) as high-risk. Risk groups differed significantly (P<.001) in the rate of concerns in the language, social, communication, and RRBI domains. When testing whether an automatic classifier (decision tree) could predict if a query was medium- or high-risk based on the text of the query and the coded symptoms, performance reached an area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) curve of 0.67 (CI 95% 0.50-0.78), whereas predicting from the text and the coded signs resulted in an area under the curve of 0.82 (0.80-0.86).

Key factors include those associated with behavioral change and those associated with technology acceptance. However, the literature regarding these subjects is fragmented and originates from two traditionally separate disciplines: implementation science and technology acceptance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to propose an integrated framework that bridges the gap between the behavioral change and technology acceptance aspects of the implementation of CDSSs.

Structured data resources are often incomplete and lack reason information. In this article, we assessed the ability of natural language processing (NLP) systems to unlock DDC information from clinical narratives automatically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 1867 de-identified providers' notes from the University of Massachusetts Medical School hospital electronic health record system. Then 2 human experts chart reviewed those clinical notes to annotate DDC events and their reasons. Using the annotated data, we developed and evaluated NLP systems to automatically identify drug discontinuations and reasons at the sentence level using a novel semantic enrichment-based vector representation (SEVR) method for enhanced feature representation. RESULTS: Our SEVR-based NLP system achieved the best performance of 0.785 (AUC-ROC) for detecting discontinuation events and 0.745 (AUC-ROC) for identifying reasons when testing this highly imbalanced data, outperforming 2 state-of-the-art non-SEVR-based models. Compared with a rule-based baseline system for discontinuation detection, our system improved the sensitivity significantly (57.75% vs 18.31%, absolute value) while retaining a high specificity of 99.25%, leading to a significant improvement in AUC-ROC by 32.83% (absolute value). CONCLUSION: Experiments have shown that a high-performance NLP system can be developed to automatically identify DDCs and their reasons from providers' notes.

METHODS: We used the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort (VACS-VC), an electronic health record-based cohort of 146 530 veterans for whom radiology reports were available (N=2 977 739). We created a reference standard of radiology reports, represented each report by a feature set of words and Unified Medical Language System concepts, and then developed several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for falls. We compared mutual information (MI) ranking and embedded feature selection approaches. The SVM classifier with MI feature selection was chosen to classify all radiology reports in VACS-VC. RESULTS: Our SVM classifier with MI feature selection achieved an area under the curve score of 97.04 on the test set. When applied to all the radiology reports in VACS-VC, 80 416 of these reports were classified as positive for a fall. Of these, 11 484 were associated with a fall-related external cause of injury code (E-code) and 68 932 were not, corresponding to 29 280 patients with potential fall-related injuries who could not have been found using E-codes. DISCUSSION: Feature selection was crucial to improving the classifier's performance. Feature selection with MI allowed us to select the number of discriminative features to use for classification, in contrast to the embedded feature selection method, in which the number of features is chosen automatically. CONCLUSION: Machine learning is an effective method of identifying patients who have suffered a fall.

Through the support of UW Medicine (https://uwmedicine.org), the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (https://www.iths.org), and the National Center for Data to Health (https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/), Leaf source code has been released into the public domain at https://github.com/uwrit/leaf. DISCUSSION: Leaf allows the querying of single or multiple clinical databases simultaneously, even those of different data models. This enables fast installation without costly extraction or duplication. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf differs from existing cohort discovery tools because it does not specify a required data model and is designed to seamlessly leverage existing user authentication systems and clinical databases in situ. We believe Leaf to be useful for health system analytics, clinical research data warehouses, precision medicine biobanks, and clinical studies involving large patient cohorts.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocz165,27,1,109-118,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*biomedical informatics and *cloud computing and *cohort discovery and *data integration and *Data Warehousing and *leaf and *observational health data sciences and informatics and *Translational Medical Research and *Translational Research, Biomedical and *User-Computer Interface and *Vocabulary, Controlled and biomedical informatics and cloud computing and cohort discovery and data integration and Databases as Topic and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Internet and leaf and observational health data sciences and informatics and Unified Medical Language System",NA,NA,2020/01/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the potential of mHealth to improve patient care in radiotherapy by acquiring electronic patient reported outcome measures (ePROMs) during treatment has been poorly studied so far. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and implement a novel Web app (PROMetheus) for patients undergoing radiotherapy. Herein, we have reported our experience with a focus on feasibility, patient acceptance, and a correlation of ePROMs with the clinical course of the patients. METHODS: In the period between January and June 2018, 21 patients used PROMetheus to score side effects, symptoms, and quality of life-related parameters during and after their treatment. Items of the Patient Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) were chosen based on the primary site of disease, 27 items for head and neck tumors, 21 items for thoracic tumors, and 24 items for pelvic tumors. RESULTS: In total, 17 out of the 21 patients (81%) regularly submitted ePROMs and more than 2500 data points were acquired. An average of 5.2, 3.5, and 3.3 min was required to complete the head and neck, thorax, and pelvis questionnaires, respectively. ePROMS were able to detect the occurrence of both expected and unexpected side effects during the treatment. In addition, a gradual increase in the severity of side effects over the course the treatment and their remission afterward could be observed with ePROMs. In total, 9 out of the 17 patients (53%), mostly those with head and neck and thoracic cancers, reported PRO-CTCAE grade III or IV fatigue with severe impairments of activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the successful implementation of an ePROM system and a high patient acceptance. ePROMs have a great potential to improve patient care in radiotherapy by providing a comprehensive documentation of symptoms and side effects, especially of ones that are otherwise underreported.",2019,10.2196/12345,7,7,e12345,eng,2291-5222,*eHealth and *mHealth and *patient reported outcome measures and *radiation oncology and Activities of Daily Living/psychology and Aged and Big Data and eHealth and Electronic Data Processing/*instrumentation and Fatigue/epidemiology and Feasibility Studies and Female and Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy and Humans and Implementation Science and Male and mHealth and Middle Aged and Neoplasm Staging and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology/statistics & numerical data and patient reported outcome measures and Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Pelvic Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy and Quality of Life and radiation oncology and Radiation Oncology/*statistics & numerical data and Radiotherapy/adverse effects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Telemedicine/*instrumentation and Thoracic Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy and Workflow,NA,NA,2019/07/24/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chart review as well as rule-based and supervised phenotyping approaches require laborious expert input, hampering applicability to studies that require many phenotypes to be defined and labeled de novo. Though International Classification of Diseases codes are often used as surrogates for true labels in this setting, these sometimes suffer from poor specificity. We propose a fully automated topic modeling algorithm to simultaneously annotate multiple phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surrogate-guided ensemble latent Dirichlet allocation (sureLDA) is a label-free multidimensional phenotyping method. It first uses the PheNorm algorithm to initialize probabilities based on 2 surrogate features for each target phenotype, and then leverages these probabilities to constrain the LDA topic model to generate phenotype-specific topics. Finally, it combines phenotype-feature counts with surrogates via clustering ensemble to yield final phenotype probabilities. RESULTS: sureLDA achieves reliably high accuracy and precision across a range of simulated and real-world phenotypes. Its performance is robust to phenotype prevalence and relative informativeness of surogate vs nonsurrogate features. It also exhibits powerful feature selection properties. DISCUSSION: sureLDA combines attractive properties of PheNorm and LDA to achieve high accuracy and precision robust to diverse phenotype characteristics. It offers particular improvement for phenotypes insufficiently captured by a few surrogate features. Moreover, sureLDA's feature selection ability enables it to handle high feature dimensions and produce interpretable computational phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: sureLDA is well suited toward large-scale electronic health record phenotyping for highly multiphenotype applications such as phenome-wide association studies .",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa079,27,8,1235-1243,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Algorithms and *electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records/classification and *high-throughput phenotyping and *Natural Language Processing and *phenotypic big data and *precision medicine and *topic modeling applications and electronic health records and high-throughput phenotyping and Humans and phenotypic big data and precision medicine and Precision Medicine and ROC Curve and topic modeling applications and Translational Medical Research and Translational Research, Biomedical",NA,NA,2020/08/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the objective of a fully computable and machine-readable cancer synoptic report remains elusive due to insufficient definitional content in Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). To address this terminology gap, investigators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) are developing, authoring, and testing a SNOMED CT observable ontology to represent the data elements identified by the synoptic worksheets of CAP. METHODS: Investigators along with collaborators from the US National Library of Medicine, CAP, the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, and the UK Health and Social Care Information Centre analyzed and assessed required data elements for colorectal cancer and invasive breast cancer synoptic reporting. SNOMED CT concept expressions were developed at UNMC in the Nebraska Lexicon(C) SNOMED CT namespace. LOINC codes for each SNOMED CT expression were issued by the Regenstrief Institute. SNOMED CT concepts represented observation answer value sets. RESULTS: UNMC investigators created a total of 194 SNOMED CT observable entity concept definitions to represent required data elements for CAP colorectal and breast cancer synoptic worksheets, including biomarkers. Concepts were bound to colorectal and invasive breast cancer reports in the UNMC pathology system and successfully used to populate a UNMC biobank.

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City; to develop machine learning models for making predictions about the hospital course of the patients over clinically meaningful time horizons based on patient characteristics at admission; and to assess the performance of these models at multiple hospitals and time points. METHODS: We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days from admission. Our study population included harmonized EHR data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19-positive patients admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. The models were first trained on patients from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383). Finally, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions. RESULTS: Upon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days. XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. In external validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction. Similarly, the unimputed XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. Trends in performance on prospective validation sets were similar. At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the strongest drivers of mortality prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We externally and prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons.

Zhou_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Cyberphysical Human Sexual Behavior Acquisition System (SeBA): Development and Implementation Study in China,"Zhou, Xiaoping and Zhao, Jichao and Liang, Xun",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Sexual health is one of the principal components of human well-being. Traditional methods for observing human sexual behavior typically adopt manual intervention approaches (eg, interviews). However, the data obtained by such traditional approaches suffer from intrinsic bias and limited sample sizes. Sexual behavioral data that are more reflective of the actual situation can be collected by equipping sex toys with sensors. OBJECTIVE: To address the limitations of traditional human sexual behavior data observation methods, a novel cyberphysical system is proposed to capture natural human sexual behavior data in China at the nationwide level. METHODS: A cyberphysical human sexual behavior acquisition system (SeBA) was designed and implemented. SeBA jointly utilizes state of the art information and communication technologies such as smart sex toys, smartphones, and mobile social networks. Smart sex toys enable objective collection of data on human sexual behavior, while the mobile social network provides the possibility of partnered sex in a cyberphysical manner. The objectives and function settings are discussed, and the overall framework of the system architecture is presented. RESULTS: Operation and privacy policies are proposed and the technical solution of SeBA is described. The effectiveness of SeBA was verified based on analysis of users' human sexual behavior data collected from January 2016 to June 2017. A total of 103,424 solo sexual behaviors were recorded involving 13,047 users, and 61,007 partnered sexual behaviors from 7,140 users were observed. The proportions of males and females in the solo and partnered sex groups were fairly consistent with recent statistics on unmarried individuals in China. We also found that only a small portion of individuals provided information on at least one other attribute besides the required input of gender, such as age, height, location, job, sex preferences, purposes, and interests. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze objective human sexual behavior data at the nationwide level. Although the data are restricted to China, this study can provide insight for further research on human sexual behavior based on the huge amount of data available from wireless smart sex toys worldwide. It is anticipated that findings from such objective big data analyses can help deepen our understanding of sexual behavior, as well as improve sexual health and sexual wellness.",2020,10.2196/12677,8,4,e12677,eng,2291-5222,China and Humans and Female and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and *Communication and Cell Phone and *Sexual Behavior and *cyberphysical system and *mobile social network and *sexual behavior and *smart sex toys and cyberphysical system and mobile social network and sexual behavior and smart sex toys,NA,NA,2020/04/03/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Digital solutions can potentially improve efficiency and quality of care, but these initiatives struggle with nonusage attrition. Machine learning methods have been proven to predict dropouts in other settings but lack implementation in health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gain insight into the causes of attrition for patients in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention for chronic lifestyle diseases and evaluate if attrition can be predicted and consequently prevented. We aimed to build predictive models that can identify patients in a digital lifestyle intervention at high risk of dropout by analyzing several predictor variables applied in different models and to further assess the possibilities and impact of implementing such models into an eHealth platform. METHODS: Data from 2684 patients using an eHealth platform were iteratively analyzed using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models. The dataset was split into a 79.99% (2147/2684) training and cross-validation set and a 20.0% (537/2684) holdout test set. Trends in activity patterns were analyzed to assess engagement over time. Development and implementation were performed iteratively with health coaches. RESULTS: Patients in the test dataset were classified as dropouts with an 89% precision using a random forest model and 11 predictor variables. The most significant predictors were the provider of the intervention, 2 weeks inactivity, and the number of advices received from the health coach. Engagement in the platform dropped significantly leading up to the time of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Dropouts from eHealth lifestyle interventions can be predicted using various data mining methods. This can support health coaches in preventing attrition by receiving proactive warnings.

Luo_2016_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Efficient Execution Methods of Pivoting for Bulk Extraction of Entity-Attribute-Value-Modeled Data,"Luo, Gang and Frey, Lewis J.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Entity-attribute-value (EAV) tables are widely used to store data in electronic medical records and clinical study data management systems. Before they can be used by various analytical (e.g., data mining and machine learning) programs, EAV-modeled data usually must be transformed into conventional relational table format through pivot operations. This time-consuming and resource-intensive process is often performed repeatedly on a regular basis, e.g., to provide a daily refresh of the content in a clinical data warehouse. Thus, it would be beneficial to make pivot operations as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present three techniques for improving the efficiency of pivot operations: 1) filtering out EAV tuples related to unneeded clinical parameters early on; 2) supporting pivoting across multiple EAV tables; and 3) conducting multi-query optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques through implementation. We show that our optimized execution method of pivoting using these techniques significantly outperforms the current basic execution method of pivoting. Our techniques can be used to build a data extraction tool to simplify the specification of and improve the efficiency of extracting data from the EAV tables in electronic medical records and clinical study data management systems.",2016,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2392553,20,2,644-654,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Database Management Systems and *Electronic Health Records and *Models, Theoretical and Clinical Studies as Topic and Data Mining/*methods and Humans",NA,NA,2016/03//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schwab_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Clinical Predictive Models for COVID-19: Systematic Study,"Schwab, Patrick and DuMont Schutte, August and Dietz, Benedikt and Bauer, Stefan",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many health care systems are at risk of exceeding their health care capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on health care systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalized, or admitted to the ICU. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop, study, and evaluate clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or require hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: Using a systematic approach to model development and optimization, we trained and compared various types of machine learning models, including logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting. To evaluate the developed models, we performed a retrospective evaluation on demographic, clinical, and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. In addition, we determined which clinical features were predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks using causal explanations. RESULTS: Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identified patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 67%-81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI 46%-51%), patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require hospitalization with 0.92 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI 0.81-0.98), and patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI 0.95-1.00).

However, most risk prediction models developed to date have focused on AKI in a specific group of patients during hospitalization, and there is limited knowledge on the baseline risk in the general population for preventing CA-AKI-associated hospitalization. OBJECTIVE: To gain further insight into risk exploration, the aim of this study was to develop, validate, and establish a scoring system to facilitate health professionals in enabling early recognition and intervention of CA-AKI to prevent permanent kidney damage using different machine-learning techniques. METHODS: A nested case-control study design was employed using electronic health records derived from a group of Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals in Taiwan from 2010 to 2017 to identify 234,867 adults with at least two measures of serum creatinine at hospital admission. Patients were classified into a derivation cohort (2010-2016) and a temporal validation cohort (2017). Patients with the first episode of CA-AKI at hospital admission were classified into the case group and those without CA-AKI were classified in the control group. A total of 47 potential candidate variables, including age, gender, prior use of nephrotoxic medications, Charlson comorbid conditions, commonly measured laboratory results, and recent use of health services, were tested to develop a CA-AKI hospitalization risk model. Permutation-based selection with both the extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms was performed to determine the top 10 important features for scoring function development. RESULTS: The discriminative ability of the risk model was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the predictive CA-AKI risk model derived by the logistic regression algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.767 (95% CI 0.764-0.770) on derivation and 0.761 on validation for any stage of AKI, with positive and negative predictive values of 19.2% and 96.1%, respectively. The risk model for prediction of CA-AKI stages 2 and 3 had an AUC value of 0.818 for the validation cohort with positive and negative predictive values of 13.3% and 98.4%, respectively. These metrics were evaluated at a cut-off value of 7.993, which was determined as the threshold to discriminate the risk of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-generated risk score model can identify patients at risk of developing CA-AKI-related hospitalization through a routine care data-driven approach. The validated multivariate risk assessment tool could help clinicians to stratify patients in primary care, and to provide monitoring and early intervention for preventing AKI while improving the quality of AKI care in the general population.",2020,10.2196/16903,22,8,e16903,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*clinical decision support system and *community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and *feature selection with extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) and *hospitalization and *least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and *machine learning and *risk prediction and *treatment decision making and Acute Kidney Injury/*epidemiology and Aged and Case-Control Studies and clinical decision support system and Cohort Studies and community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and Community-Acquired Infections/*epidemiology and Electronic Health Records and feature selection with extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) and Female and hospitalization and Hospitalization and Humans and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment/*methods and risk prediction and treatment decision making,NA,NA,2020/08/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed as much as possible and searches were conducted in 5 databases using CPOE, CDSS, alerts, and allergic or allergy as keywords. Bias could not be evaluated according to PRISMA guidelines due to the heterogeneity of study types included in the review. RESULTS: Of the 3160 articles considered, 60 met the inclusion criteria. A further 9 articles were added based on expert opinion, resulting in a total of 69 articles. An interrater agreement of 90.9% with a reliability <ce><9a>=.787 (95% CI 0.686-0.888) was reached. Large heterogeneity across study objectives, study designs, study populations, and reported results was found. Several key findings were identified. Evidence of the usefulness of clinical decision support for drug allergies has been documented. Nevertheless, there are some important problems associated with their use. Accurate and structured documenting of information on drug allergies in electronic health records (EHRs) is difficult, as it is often not clear to healthcare providers how and where to document drug allergies. Besides the underreporting of drug allergies, outdated or inaccurate drug allergy information in EHRs poses an important problem. Research on the use of coding terminologies for documenting drug allergies is sparse. There is no generally accepted standard terminology for structured documentation of allergy information. The final key finding is the consistently reported low specificity of drug allergy alerts. Current systems have high alert override rates of up to 90%, leading to alert fatigue. Important challenges remain for increasing the specificity of drug allergy alerts. We found only one study specifically reporting outcomes related to CDSS for drug allergies. It showed that adverse drug events resulting from overridden drug allergy alerts do not occur frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate and comprehensive recording of drug allergies is required for good use of CDSS for drug allergy screening. We found considerable variation in the way drug allergy are recorded in EHRs. It remains difficult to reduce drug allergy alert overload while maintaining patient safety as the highest priority. Future research should focus on improving alert specificity, thereby reducing override rates and alert fatigue. Also, the effect on patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness should be evaluated.",2018,10.2196/jmir.8206,20,9,e258,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*alert and *clinical decision support systems and *computerized physician order entry and *drug allergy and *patient safety and alert and clinical decision support systems and computerized physician order entry and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and drug allergy and Drug Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis/pathology and Humans and patient safety and Reproducibility of Results",NA,NA,2018/09/07/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using information from the writings of a patient can potentially be a valuable source of information, especially now that more and more treatments involve computer-based exercises or electronic conversations between patient and therapist. In this paper, we study predictive modeling using writings of patients under treatment for a social anxiety disorder. We extract a wealth of information from the text written by patients including their usage of words, the topics they talk about, the sentiment of the messages, and the style of writing. In addition, we study trends over time with respect to those measures. We then apply machine learning algorithms to generate the predictive models. Based on a dataset of 69 patients, we are able to show that we can predict therapy outcome with an area under the curve of 0.83 halfway through the therapy and with a precision of 0.78 when using the full data (i.e., the entire treatment period).

Different types of depression pose different levels of risk. Individuals who suffer from mild forms of depression may recover without any assistance or be effectively managed by primary care or family practitioners. However, other forms of depression are far more severe and require advanced care by certified mental health providers. However, identifying cases of depression that require advanced care may be challenging to primary care providers and health care team members whose skill sets run broad rather than deep. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to leverage a comprehensive range of patient-level diagnostic, behavioral, and demographic data, as well as past visit history data from a statewide health information exchange to build decision models capable of predicting the need of advanced care for depression across patients presenting at Eskenazi Health, the public safety net health system for Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana. METHODS: Patient-level diagnostic, behavioral, demographic, and past visit history data extracted from structured datasets were merged with outcome variables extracted from unstructured free-text datasets and were used to train random forest decision models that predicted the need of advanced care for depression across (1) the overall patient population and (2) various subsets of patients at higher risk for depression-related adverse events; patients with a past diagnosis of depression; patients with a Charlson comorbidity index of <e2><89><a5>1; patients with a Charlson comorbidity index of <e2><89><a5>2; and all unique patients identified across the 3 above-mentioned high-risk groups. RESULTS: The overall patient population consisted of 84,317 adult (aged <e2><89><a5>18 years) patients. A total of 6992 (8.29%) of these patients were in need of advanced care for depression. Decision models for high-risk patient groups yielded area under the curve (AUC) scores between 86.31% and 94.43%. The decision model for the overall patient population yielded a comparatively lower AUC score of 78.87%. The variance of optimal sensitivity and specificity for all decision models, as identified using Youden J Index, is as follows: sensitivity=68.79% to 83.91% and specificity=76.03% to 92.18%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to automate screening for patients in need of advanced care for depression across (1) an overall patient population or (2) various high-risk patient groups using structured datasets covering acute and chronic conditions, patient demographics, behaviors, and past visit history. Furthermore, these results show considerable potential to enable preventative care and can be easily integrated into existing clinical workflows to improve access to wraparound health care services.",2019,10.2196/13809,21,7,e13809,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*delivery of health care and *depression and *supervised machine learning and Adolescent and Adult and delivery of health care and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and depression and Depression/*therapy and Female and Health Information Exchange/*standards and Humans and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and supervised machine learning,NA,NA,2019/07/22/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We developed an open-source framework for clinical abbreviation recognition and disambiguation (CARD) that leverages our previously developed methods, including: (1) machine learning based approaches to recognize abbreviations from a clinical corpus, (2) clustering-based semiautomated methods to generate possible senses of abbreviations, and (3) profile-based word sense disambiguation methods for clinical abbreviations. We applied CARD to clinical corpora from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and generated 2 comprehensive sense inventories for abbreviations in discharge summaries and clinic visit notes. Furthermore, we developed a wrapper that integrates CARD with MetaMap, a widely used general clinical NLP system. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: CARD detected 27 317 and 107 303 distinct abbreviations from discharge summaries and clinic visit notes, respectively. Two sense inventories were constructed for the 1000 most frequent abbreviations in these 2 corpora. Using the sense inventories created from discharge summaries, CARD achieved an F1 score of 0.755 for identifying and disambiguating all abbreviations in a corpus from the VUMC discharge summaries, which is superior to MetaMap and Apache's clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES). Using additional external corpora, we also demonstrated that the MetaMap-CARD wrapper improved MetaMap's performance in recognizing disorder entities in clinical notes. The CARD framework, 2 sense inventories, and the wrapper for MetaMap are publicly available at https://sbmi.uth.edu/ccb/resources/abbreviation.htm .

Ferrario_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Social Reminiscence in Older Adults' Everyday Conversations: Automated Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Ferrario, Andrea and Demiray, Burcu and Yordanova, Kristina and Luo, Minxia and Martin, Mike",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Reminiscence is the act of thinking or talking about personal experiences that occurred in the past. It is a central task of old age that is essential for healthy aging, and it serves multiple functions, such as decision-making and introspection, transmitting life lessons, and bonding with others. The study of social reminiscence behavior in everyday life can be used to generate data and detect reminiscence from general conversations. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this original paper are to (1) preprocess coded transcripts of conversations in German of older adults with natural language processing (NLP), and (2) implement and evaluate learning strategies using different NLP features and machine learning algorithms to detect reminiscence in a corpus of transcripts. METHODS: The methods in this study comprise (1) collecting and coding of transcripts of older adults' conversations in German, (2) preprocessing transcripts to generate NLP features (bag-of-words models, part-of-speech tags, pretrained German word embeddings), and (3) training machine learning models to detect reminiscence using random forests, support vector machines, and adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The data set comprises 2214 transcripts, including 109 transcripts with reminiscence. Due to class imbalance in the data, we introduced three learning strategies: (1) class-weighted learning, (2) a meta-classifier consisting of a voting ensemble, and (3) data augmentation with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm. For each learning strategy, we performed cross-validation on a random sample of the training data set of transcripts. We computed the area under the curve (AUC), the average precision (AP), precision, recall, as well as F1 score and specificity measures on the test data, for all combinations of NLP features, algorithms, and learning strategies. RESULTS: Class-weighted support vector machines on bag-of-words features outperformed all other classifiers (AUC=0.91, AP=0.56, precision=0.5, recall=0.45, F1=0.48, specificity=0.98), followed by support vector machines on SMOTE-augmented data and word embeddings features (AUC=0.89, AP=0.54, precision=0.35, recall=0.59, F1=0.44, specificity=0.94). For the meta-classifier strategy, adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms trained on word embeddings and bag-of-words outperformed all other classifiers and NLP features; however, the performance of the meta-classifier learning strategy was lower compared to other strategies, with highly imbalanced precision-recall trade-offs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the applicability of NLP and machine learning pipelines for the automated detection of reminiscence in older adults' everyday conversations in German. The methods and findings of this study could be relevant for designing unobtrusive computer systems for the real-time detection of social reminiscence in the everyday life of older adults and classifying their functions. With further improvements, these systems could be deployed in health interventions aimed at improving older adults' well-being by promoting self-reflection and suggesting coping strategies to be used in the case of dysfunctional reminiscence cases, which can undermine physical and mental health.",2020,10.2196/19133,22,9,e19133,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*aging and *dementia and *electronically activated recorder (EAR) and *imbalanced learning and *machine learning and *natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and *real-life conversations and *reminiscence and Aged and aging and Algorithms and Communication and dementia and electronically activated recorder (EAR) and Humans and imbalanced learning and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Memory, Long-Term/*physiology and natural language processing and real-life conversations and reminiscence",NA,NA,2020/09/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In our previous work, we demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning classifiers to accelerate the process by collecting home videos of US-based children, identifying a reduced subset of behavioral features that are scored by untrained raters using a machine learning classifier to determine children's ""risk scores"" for autism. We achieved an accuracy of 92% (95% CI 88%-97%) on US videos using a classifier built on five features. OBJECTIVE: Using videos of Bangladeshi children collected from Dhaka Shishu Children's Hospital, we aim to scale our pipeline to another culture and other developmental delays, including speech and language conditions. METHODS: Although our previously published and validated pipeline and set of classifiers perform reasonably well on Bangladeshi videos (75% accuracy, 95% CI 71%-78%), this work improves on that accuracy through the development and application of a powerful new technique for adaptive aggregation of crowdsourced labels. We enhance both the utility and performance of our model by building two classification layers: The first layer distinguishes between typical and atypical behavior, and the second layer distinguishes between ASD and non-ASD. In each of the layers, we use a unique rater weighting scheme to aggregate classification scores from different raters based on their expertise. We also determine Shapley values for the most important features in the classifier to understand how the classifiers' process aligns with clinical intuition. RESULTS: Using these techniques, we achieved an accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) of 76% (SD 3%) and sensitivity of 76% (SD 4%) for identifying atypical children from among developmentally delayed children, and an accuracy (AUC) of 85% (SD 5%) and sensitivity of 76% (SD 6%) for identifying children with ASD from those predicted to have other developmental delays. CONCLUSIONS: These results show promise for using a mobile video-based and machine learning-directed approach for early and remote detection of autism in Bangladeshi children. This strategy could provide important resources for developmental health in developing countries with few clinical resources for diagnosis, helping children get access to care at an early age. Future research aimed at extending the application of this approach to identify a range of other conditions and determine the population-level burden of developmental disabilities and impairments will be of high value.",2019,10.2196/13822,21,4,e13822,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*autism and *autism spectrum disorder and *Bangladesh and *Biomedical Data Science and *clinical resources and *developmental delays and *machine learning and autism and autism spectrum disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*diagnosis and Bangladesh and Biomedical Data Science and Child and Child, Preschool and clinical resources and developmental delays and Developmental Disabilities/*diagnosis and Female and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Validation Studies as Topic and Video Recording/*methods",NA,NA,2019/04/24/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This burdens the medical licentiate practitioner (MLP) program for training nonphysician clinical students in Zambia because of the shortage of qualified medical lecturers and learning resources at training sites. To address this shortage and strengthen the MLP program, a self-directed electronic health (eHealth) platform was introduced, comprising technology-supported learning (e-learning) for medical education and support for health care practice. MLP students were provided with tablets that were preloaded with content for offline access. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore MLP students' and medical lecturers' perceptions of the self-directed eHealth platform with an offline-based tablet as a training and health care practice support tool during the first year of full implementation. METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 8 MLP students and 5 lecturers and 2 focus group discussions with 16 students to gain insights on perceptions of the usefulness, ease of use, and adequacy of self-directed e-learning and health care practice support accessible through the offline-based tablet. Participants were purposively sampled. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed following hypothesis coding. RESULTS: The eHealth platform (e-platform), comprising e-learning for medical education and health care practice support, was positively received by students and medical lecturers and was seen as a step toward modernizing the MLP program. Tablets enabled equal access to offline learning contents, thus bridging the gap of slow or no internet connections. The study results indicated that the e-platform appears adequate to strengthen medical education within this low-resource setting. However, student self-reported usage was low, and medical lecturer usage was even lower. One stated reason was the lack of training in tablet usage and another was the quality of the tablets. The mediocre quality and quantity of most e-learning contents were perceived as a primary concern as materials were reported to be outdated, missing multimedia features, and addressing only part of the curriculum. Medical lecturers were noted to have little commitment to updating or creating new learning materials. Suggestions for improving the e-platform were given. CONCLUSIONS: To address identified major challenges, we plan to (1) introduce half-day training sessions at the beginning of each study year to better prepare users for tablet usage, (2) further update and expand e-learning content by fostering collaborations with MLP program stakeholders and nominating an e-platform coordinator, (3) set up an e-platform steering committee including medical lecturers, (4) incorporate e-learning and e-based health care practice support across the curriculum, as well as (5) implement processes to promote user-generated content.

Algorithm development is often iterative, depends on fallible investigator intuition, and is time- and labor-intensive. We developed and evaluated 4 types of phenotyping algorithms and categories of EHR information to identify hypertensive individuals and controls and provide a portable module for implementation at other sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the EHRs of 631 individuals followed at Vanderbilt for hypertension status. We developed features and phenotyping algorithms of increasing complexity. Input categories included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) codes, medications, vital signs, narrative-text search results, and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts extracted using natural language processing (NLP). We developed a module and tested portability by replicating 10 of the best-performing algorithms at the Marshfield Clinic. RESULTS: Random forests using billing codes, medications, vitals, and concepts had the best performance with a median area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.976. Normalized sums of all 4 categories also performed well (0.959 AUC). The best non-NLP algorithm combined normalized ICD9 codes, medications, and blood pressure readings with a median AUC of 0.948.

Approaches such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be used to gather accurate real-time data in an individual's natural environment by asking questions at any given instant. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate user engagement and responses to EMA questions using InspireD, an app used for reminiscence by persons with dementia and their caregivers. Research findings can be used to inform EMA use within digital health interventions. METHODS: A feasibility trial was conducted in which participants (n=56) used the InspireD app over a 12-week period. Participants were a mean age of 73 (SD 13) and were either persons with dementia (n=28) or their caregivers (n=28). Questions, which they could either answer or choose to dismiss, were presented to participants at various instants after reminiscence with personal or generic photos, videos, and music. Presentation and dismissal rates for questions were compared by hour of the day and by trial week to investigate user engagement. RESULTS: Overall engagement was high, with 69.1% of questions answered when presented. Questions that were presented in the evening had the lowest dismissal rate; the dismissal rate for questions presented at 9 PM was significantly lower than the dismissal rate for questions presented at 11 AM (9 PM: 10%; 11 AM: 50%; <cf><87>(2)(1)=21.4, P<.001). Questions asked following reminiscence with personal media, especially those asked after personal photos, were less likely to be answered compared to those asked after other media. In contrast, questions asked after the user had listened to generic media, in particular those asked after generic music, were much more likely to be answered. CONCLUSIONS: The main limitation of our study was the lack of generalizability of results to a larger population given the quasi-experimental design and older demographic where half of participants were persons with dementia; however, this study shows that older people are willing to participate and engage in EMA. Based on this study, we propose a series of recommendations for app design to increase user engagement with EMA. These include presenting questions no more than once per day, after 8 PM in the evening, and only if the user is not trying to complete a task within the app.",2020,10.2196/17120,8,7,e17120,eng,2291-5222,"*app and *behaviour analytics and *Caregivers and *carers and *dementia and *Dementia/therapy and *ecological momentary assessment and *Ecological Momentary Assessment and *EMA and *event logging and *mHealth and *reminiscence and *reminiscing and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and app and behaviour analytics and carers and dementia and ecological momentary assessment and EMA and event logging and Female and Humans and Male and mHealth and reminiscence and reminiscing and Research Design",NA,NA,2020/07/06/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

We showcase the ""Model to Data"" (MTD) approach as a new mechanism to make private clinical data available for the development of predictive models. Under this framework, we eliminate researchers' direct interaction with patient data by delivering containerized models to the EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We operationalize the MTD framework using the Synapse collaboration platform and an on-premises secure computing environment at the University of Washington hosting EHR data. Containerized mortality prediction models developed by a model developer, were delivered to the University of Washington via Synapse, where the models were trained and evaluated. Model performance metrics were returned to the model developer. RESULTS: The model developer was able to develop 3 mortality prediction models under the MTD framework using simple demographic features (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.693), demographics and 5 common chronic diseases (AUROC, 0.861), and the 1000 most common features from the EHR's condition/procedure/drug domains (AUROC, 0.921). DISCUSSION: We demonstrate the feasibility of the MTD framework to facilitate the development of predictive models on private EHR data, enabled by common data models and containerization software. We identify challenges that both the model developer and the health system information technology group encountered and propose future efforts to improve implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD framework lowers the barrier of access to EHR data and can accelerate the development and evaluation of clinical prediction models.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa083,27,9,1393-1400,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*clinical informatics and *Computer Simulation and *data science and *data sharing and *electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records and *Mortality and *privacy and *Prognosis and *Software and clinical informatics and Confidentiality and data science and data sharing and Data Warehousing and electronic health records and Feasibility Studies and Humans and Information Dissemination and Pilot Projects and privacy and ROC Curve,NA,NA,2020/07/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zuo_2016_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Comparison of Three Different Types of Wrist Pulse Signals by Their Physical Meanings and Diagnosis Performance,"Zuo, Wangmeng and Wang, Peng and Zhang, David",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Increasing interest has been focused on computational pulse diagnosis where sensors are developed to acquire pulse signals, and machine learning techniques are exploited to analyze health conditions based on the acquired pulse signals. By far, a number of sensors have been employed for pulse signal acquisition, which can be grouped into three major categories, i.e., pressure, photoelectric, and ultrasonic sensors. To guide the sensor selection for computational pulse diagnosis, in this paper, we analyze the physical meanings and sensitivities of signals acquired by these three types of sensors. The dependence and complementarity of the different sensors are discussed from both the perspective of cardiovascular fluid dynamics and comparative experiments by evaluating disease classification performance. Experimental results indicate that each sensor is more appropriate for the diagnosis of some specific disease that the changes of physiological factors can be effectively reflected by the sensor, e.g., ultrasonic sensor for diabetes and pressure sensor for arteriosclerosis, and improved diagnosis performance can be obtained by combining three types of signals.",2016,10.1109/JBHI.2014.2369821,20,1,119-127,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted and Adolescent and Adult and Atherosclerosis and Child and Child, Preschool and Diabetes Mellitus and Female and Heart Rate/*physiology and Humans and Infant and Male and Medicine, Chinese Traditional and Middle Aged and Pulse/*methods and Wrist/*blood supply/physiology and Young Adult",NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The MDRs can be imaging diagnostic reports and DICOM images, laboratory reports and clinical summaries which can have clinical information relating to medical status of human organs or body parts. METHODS: the concept and method included three steps. First, a VP data model called visual index object (VIO) and a VP graphic model called visual anatomic object (VAO) were introduced. Second, a series of processing methods of parsing and extracting key information from MDRs were used to fill the attributes of the VIO model of a patient. Third, a VP system (VPS) was designed to map VIO to VAO, to create a VP instance for each patient. RESULTS: a prototype VPS has been implemented in a simulated hospital PACS/RIS integrated environment. Two evaluation results showed that more than 70% participating radiologists would like to use the VPS in their radiological imaging tasks, and the efficiency of using VPS to review the tested patients' MDRs was 2.24 times higher than that of using PACS/RIS, while the average accuracy <P(ac)> by using PACS/RIS was better than that by using VPS; however, this difference was only about 4%. CONCLUSION: the developed VPS can show the medical status of patient organs/sub-organs with 3-D anatomical graphic pattern and will be welcomed by radiologists with better efficiency in reviewing the patients' MDRs and with acceptable accuracy.

Hassounah_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Digital Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia,"Hassounah, Marwah and Raheel, Hafsa and Alhefzi, Mohammed",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia was confirmed on March 3, 2020. Saudi Arabia, like many other countries worldwide, implemented lockdown of most public and private services in response to the pandemic and established population movement restrictions nationwide. With the implementation of these strict mitigation regulations, technology and digital solutions have enabled the provision of essential services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to highlight how Saudi Arabia has used digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in the domains of public health, health care services, education, telecommunication, commerce, and risk communication. METHODS: We documented the use of digital technology in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic using publicly available official announcements, press briefings and releases, news clips, published data, peer-reviewed literature, and professional discussions. RESULTS: Saudi Arabia's government and private sectors combined developed and launched approximately 19 apps and platforms that serve public health functions and provide health care services. A detailed account of each is provided. Education processes continued using an established electronic learning infrastructure with a promising direction toward wider adoption in the future. Telecommunication companies exhibited smooth collaboration as well as innovative initiatives to support ongoing efforts. Risk communication activities using social media, websites, and SMS text messaging followed best practice guides. CONCLUSIONS: The Saudi Vision 2030 framework, released in 2017, has paved the path for digital transformation. COVID-19 enabled the promotion and testing of this transition.

However, there are divergent views on what constitute the minimum standards for inclusion in the development of mobile phone apps. Mobile phone apps require an evidence-based approach to development which will consequently impact on their effectiveness. Therefore, comprehensive information on developmental considerations could help designers and researchers to develop innovative and effective patient-centered self-management mobile phone apps for diabetes patients. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examined the developmental considerations adopted in trials that engaged mobile phone applications for diabetes self-management. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across 5 electronic databases; Medline, Scopus, Social Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINALHL) and supplemented by reference list from identified studies. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Critical appraisal checklist for trials. Information on developmental factors (health behavioral theory, functionality, pilot testing, user and clinical expert involvements, data privacy and app security) were assessed across experimental studies using a template developed for the review. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies (10 randomized controlled trials and 1 quasi-experimental trial) that fitted the inclusion criteria were identified. All the included studies had the functionality of self-monitoring of blood glucose. However, only some of them included functions for data analytics (7/11, 63.6%), education (6/11, 54.5%) and reminder (6/11, 54.5%). There were 5/11(45.5%) studies with significantly improved glycosylated hemoglobin in the intervention groups where educational functionality was present in the apps used in the 5 trials. Only 1 (1/11, 9.1%) study considered health behavioral theory and user involvement, while 2 (2/11, 18.1%) other studies reported the involvement of clinical experts in the development of their apps. There were 4 (4/11, 36.4%) studies which referred to data security and privacy considerations during their app development while 7 (7/12, 63.6%) studies provided information on pilot testing of apps before use in the full trial. Overall, none of the studies provided information on all developmental factors assessed in the review. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the development of apps used as interventions for diabetes self-management. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of practical and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients.",2018,10.2196/10115,6,6,e10115,eng,2291-5222,developmental consideration and diabetes melitus and mobile phone apps and self-management and systematic review,NA,NA,2018/06/21/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The developmental period of adolescence represents a critical window of opportunity to optimize and solidify positive health behaviors and minimize future pain-related disability and impaired work productivity. This research focuses on the development and evaluation of a smartphone-based pain self-management app for adolescents with chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to characterize (1) the feasibility of deploying a mobile health (mHealth) app (iCanCope) to the personal smartphones of adolescent research participants; (2) adherence to daily symptom tracking over 55 consecutive days; (3) participant interaction with their symptom history; and (4) daily pain-related experiences of adolescents with chronic pain. METHODS: We recruited adolescents aged 15-18 years from 3 Canadian pediatric tertiary care chronic pain clinics. Participants received standardized instructions to download the iCanCope app and use it once a day for 55 days. Detailed app analytics were captured at the user level. Adherence was operationally defined as per the relative proportion of completed symptom reports. Linear mixed models were used to examine the trajectories of daily symptom reporting. RESULTS: We recruited 60 participants between March 2017 and April 2018. The mean age of the participants was 16.4 (SD 0.9) years, and 88% (53/60) of them were female. The app was deployed to 98% (59/60) devices. Among the 59 participants, adherence was as follows: low (4, 7%), low-moderate (14, 24%), high-moderate (16, 27%), and high (25, 42%). Most (49/59, 83%) participants chose to view their historical symptom trends. Participants reported pain intensity and pain-related symptoms of moderate severity, and these ratings tended to be stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that (1) the iCanCope app can be deployed to adolescents' personal smartphones with high feasibility; (2) adolescents demonstrated moderate-to-high adherence over 55 days; (3) most participants chose to view their symptom history; and (4) adolescents with chronic pain experience stable symptomology of moderate severity.

Lu_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Impact of Physician-Patient Communication in Online Health Communities on Patient Compliance: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study,"Lu, Xinyi and Zhang, Runtong",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: In China, the utilization of medical resources is tense, and most hospitals are highly congested because of the large population and uneven distribution of medical resources. Online health communities (OHCs) play an important role in alleviating hospital congestions, thereby improving the utilization of medical resources and relieving medical resource shortages. OHCs have positive effects on physician-patient relationships and health outcomes. Moreover, as one of the main ways for patients to seek health-related information in OHCs, physician-patient communication may affect patient compliance in various ways. In consideration of the inevitable development of OHCs, although they have several shortcomings, identifying how physician-patient communication can impact patient compliance is important to improve patients' health outcomes through OHCs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of physician-patient communication on patient compliance in OHCs through the mediation of the perceived quality of internet health information, decision-making preference, and physician-patient concordance, using an empirical study based on the self-determination theory. METHODS: A research model was established, including 1 independent variable (physician-patient communication), 3 mediators (perceived quality of internet health information, decision-making preference, and physician-patient concordance), 1 dependent variable (patient compliance), and 4 control variables (age, gender, living area, and education level). Furthermore, a Web-based survey involving 423 valid responses was conducted in China to collect data, and structural equation modeling and partial least squares were adopted to analyze data and test the hypotheses. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 79.2% (487/615) and the validity rate was 86.9% (423/487); reliability and validity are acceptable. The communication between physicians and patients in OHCs positively affects patient compliance through the mediation of the perceived quality of internet health information, decision-making preference, and physician-patient concordance. Moreover, physician-patient communication exhibits similar impacts on the perceived quality of internet health information, decision-making preference, and physician-patient concordance. Patients' decision-making preference shows the weakest impact on patient compliance compared with the other 2 mediators. Ultimately, all 3 mediators play a partially mediating role between physician-patient communication and patient compliance. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that physician-patient communication in OHCs exhibits a positive impact on patient compliance; thus, patient compliance can be improved by guiding physician-patient communication in OHCs. Furthermore, our findings suggest that physicians can share high-quality health information with patients, discuss benefits, risks, and costs of treatment options with patients, encourage patients to express their attitudes and participate in health-related decision making, and strengthen the emotional connection with patients in OHCs, thereby decreasing patients' misunderstanding of information and increasing concordance between physicians and patients. OHCs are required to not only strengthen the management of their published health information quality but also understand users' actual attitudes toward information quality and then try to reduce the gap between the perceived and actual quality of information.",2019,10.2196/12891,21,5,e12891,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*communication and *consumer health information and *decision making and *patient compliance and *patient portals and *personal autonomy and *physician-patient relations and *Physician-Patient Relations and communication and Communication and consumer health information and Consumer Health Information/*methods and Cross-Sectional Studies and decision making and Decision Making and Female and Humans and Internet and Male and Middle Aged and patient compliance and Patient Compliance/*psychology and patient portals and personal autonomy and physician-patient relations and Reproducibility of Results and Surveys and Questionnaires and Telemedicine/*methods and Young Adult,NA,NA,2019/05/13/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. METHODS: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. RESULTS: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.",2019,10.2196/14658,21,10,e14658,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *Artificial Intelligence and *communication and *learning and *nursing education and *patients and *technology and *virtual reality and artificial intelligence and Clinical Competence and communication and Communication and Counseling/*methods and Education, Nursing/*methods and Female and Humans and learning and nursing education and patients and technology and virtual reality and Virtual Reality",NA,NA,2019/10/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Novel probabilistic DQ control methods based on information theory and geometry are applied to the Public Health Mortality Registry of the Region of Valencia, Spain, with 512 143 entries from 2000 to 2012, disaggregated into 24 health departments. The methods provide DQ metrics and exploratory visualizations for (1) assessing the variability among multiple sources and (2) monitoring and exploring changes with time. The methods are suited to big data and multitype, multivariate, and multimodal data. RESULTS: The repository was partitioned into 2 probabilistically separated temporal subgroups following a change in the Spanish National Death Certificate in 2009. Punctual temporal anomalies were noticed due to a punctual increment in the missing data, along with outlying and clustered health departments due to differences in populations or in practices. DISCUSSION: Changes in protocols, differences in populations, biased practices, or other systematic DQ problems affected data variability. Even if semantic and integration aspects are addressed in data sharing infrastructures, probabilistic variability may still be present. Solutions include fixing or excluding data and analyzing different sites or time periods separately. A systematic approach to assessing temporal and multisite variability is proposed.

Leroy_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Automated Extraction of Diagnostic Criteria From Electronic Health Records for Autism Spectrum Disorders: Development, Evaluation, and Application","Leroy, Gondy and Gu, Yang and Pettygrove, Sydney and Galindo, Maureen K. and Arora, Ananyaa and Kurzius-Spencer, Margaret",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) bring many opportunities for information utilization. One such use is the surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This process currently comprises manual collection and review of EHRs of 4- and 8-year old children in 11 US states for the presence of ASD criteria. The work is time-consuming and expensive. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to automatically extract from EHRs the description of behaviors noted by the clinicians in evidence of the diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Previously, we reported on the classification of entire EHRs as ASD or not. In this work, we focus on the extraction of individual expressions of the different ASD criteria in the text. We intend to facilitate large-scale surveillance efforts for ASD and support analysis of changes over time as well as enable integration with other relevant data. METHODS: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) parser to extract expressions of 12 DSM criteria using 104 patterns and 92 lexicons (1787 terms). The parser is rule-based to enable precise extraction of the entities from the text. The entities themselves are encompassed in the EHRs as very diverse expressions of the diagnostic criteria written by different people at different times (clinicians, speech pathologists, among others). Due to the sparsity of the data, a rule-based approach is best suited until larger datasets can be generated for machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: We evaluated our rule-based parser and compared it with a machine learning baseline (decision tree). Using a test set of 6636 sentences (50 EHRs), we found that our parser achieved 76% precision, 43% recall (ie, sensitivity), and >99% specificity for criterion extraction. The performance was better for the rule-based approach than for the machine learning baseline (60% precision and 30% recall). For some individual criteria, precision was as high as 97% and recall 57%. Since precision was very high, we were assured that criteria were rarely assigned incorrectly, and our numbers presented a lower bound of their presence in EHRs. We then conducted a case study and parsed 4480 new EHRs covering 10 years of surveillance records from the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program. The social criteria (A1 criteria) showed the biggest change over the years. The communication criteria (A2 criteria) did not distinguish the ASD from the non-ASD records. Among behaviors and interests criteria (A3 criteria), 1 (A3b) was present with much greater frequency in the ASD than in the non-ASD EHRs.

Previous research in how best to transport RCT results to target populations has focused on weighting RCT data to look like the target data. Simulation work, however, has suggested that an outcome model approach may be preferable. Here, we describe such an approach using source data from the 2 * 2 factorial NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research) trial, which evaluated the impact of valsartan and nateglinide on cardiovascular outcomes and new-onset diabetes in a prediabetic population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our target data consisted of people with prediabetes serviced at the Duke University Health System. We used random survival forests to develop separate outcome models for each of the 4 treatments, estimating the 5-year risk difference for progression to diabetes, and estimated the treatment effect in our local patient populations, as well as subpopulations, and compared the results with the traditional weighting approach. RESULTS: Our models suggested that the treatment effect for valsartan in our patient population was the same as in the trial, whereas for nateglinide treatment effect was stronger than observed in the original trial. Our effect estimates were more efficient than the weighting approach and we effectively estimated subgroup differences.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a mobile personal health care system for noninvasive, pervasive, and continuous estimation of BP level and variability, which is user friendly for elderly people. METHODS: The proposed approach was integrated by a self-designed cuffless, calibration-free, wireless, and wearable PPG-only sensor and a native purposely designed smartphone app using multilayer perceptron machine learning techniques from raw signals. We performed a development and usability study with three older adults (mean age 61.3 years, SD 1.5 years; 66% women) to test the usability and accuracy of the smartphone-based BP monitor.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate prospectively a risk prediction model of incident essential hypertension within the following year. METHODS: Data from individual patient electronic health records (EHRs) were extracted from the Maine Health Information Exchange network. Retrospective (N=823,627, calendar year 2013) and prospective (N=680,810, calendar year 2014) cohorts were formed. A machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, was adopted in the process of feature selection and model building. It generated an ensemble of classification trees and assigned a final predictive risk score to each individual. RESULTS: The 1-year incident hypertension risk model attained areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.917 and 0.870 in the retrospective and prospective cohorts, respectively. Risk scores were calculated and stratified into five risk categories, with 4526 out of 381,544 patients (1.19%) in the lowest risk category (score 0-0.05) and 21,050 out of 41,329 patients (50.93%) in the highest risk category (score 0.4-1) receiving a diagnosis of incident hypertension in the following 1 year.

Ashraf_2016_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Automated Video Analysis of Handwashing Behavior as a Potential Marker of Cognitive Health in Older Adults,"Ashraf, Ahmed and Taati, Babak",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"The identification of different stages of cognitive impairment can allow older adults to receive timely care and plan for the level of caregiving. People with existing diagnosis of cognitive impairment go through episodic phases of dementia requiring different levels of care at different times. Monitoring the cognitive status of existing patients is, thus, critical to deciding the level of care required by older adults. In this paper, we present a system to assess the cognitive status of older adults by monitoring a common activity of daily living, namely handwashing. Specifically, we extract features from handwashing trials of participants diagnosed with different levels of dementia ranging from cognitively intact to severe cognitive impairment, as assessed by the mini-mental state exam (MMSE). Based on videos of handwashing trials, we extract two classes of features: one characterizing the occupancy of different sink regions by the participant, and the other capturing the path tortuosity of the motion trajectory of participant's hands. We perform correlation analysis to assess univariate capacity of individual features to predict MMSE scores. To assess multivariate performance, we use machine learning methods to train models that predict the cognitive status (aware, mild, moderate, severe), as well as the MMSE scores. We present results demonstrating that features derived from hand washing behavior can be potential surrogate markers of a person's dementia, which can be instrumental in developing automated tools for continuously monitoring the cognitive status of older adults.",2016,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2413358,20,2,682-690,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Hand Disinfection and *Psychological Tests and Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnostic imaging and Health Behavior/*classification and Humans and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Video Recording/*methods",NA,NA,2016/03//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

The traditional blood glucose tests are traumatic and cannot effectively monitor the development of diabetic complications. The development of mobile health is changing rapidly. Therefore, we are interested in developing a new noninvasive, economical, and instant-result method to accurately diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes and its complications. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether type 2 diabetes and its complications, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, could be diagnosed and monitored by using pulse wave. METHODS: We collected the pulse wave parameters from 50 healthy people, 139 diabetic patients without hypertension and hyperlipidemia, 133 diabetic patients with hypertension, 70 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia, and 75 diabetic patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The pulse wave parameters showing significant differences among these groups were identified. Various machine learning models such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests were applied to classify the control group, diabetic patients, and diabetic patients with complications. RESULTS: There were significant differences in several pulse wave parameters among the 5 groups. The parameters height of tidal wave (h(3)), time distance between the start point of pulse wave and dominant wave (t(1)), and width of percussion wave in its one-third height position (W) increase and the height of dicrotic wave (h(5)) decreases when people develop diabetes. The parameters height of dominant wave (h(1)), h(3), and height of dicrotic notch (h(4)) are found to be higher in diabetic patients with hypertension, whereas h(5) is lower in diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. For detecting diabetes, the method with the highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy is SVM with polynomial kernel. The algorithm can detect diabetes with 96.35% accuracy. However, all the algorithms have a low accuracy when predicting diabetic patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (below 70%). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the noninvasive and convenient pulse-taking diagnosis described in this paper has the potential to become a low-cost and accurate method to monitor the development of diabetes. We are collecting more data to improve the accuracy for detecting hypertension and hyperlipidemia among diabetic patients.

The migration of data processing from the local node, achieved by decoupling the node hardware from the required processing capabilities, is only possible through implementation of network virtualization. The virtualization which brings new services that are executed remotely has led to security challenges, yet to be resolved, due to the increasing amount of data being continually exchanged between the sensor node hub and remote servers. In this regard, we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for data security with a powerful security architecture that performs one-time key, single block enciphering instead of a block chaining or weak stream enciphering. The algorithm architecture produces variable (stealthy) keys and data that adopt the white noise statistical behavior, therefore, having high immunity to cryptanalysis. The algorithm combines gene fusion and horizontal gene transfer inspired from the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A salt extracted from the data block hash value adds the stealthy-key feature to the cipher. In fact, the avalanche effect for a block of encrypted sensors data of 16 * 16 B achieves an average of 98% with a single bit flipped in the data.

Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learning-based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular. RESULTS: A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them. CONCLUSIONS: This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons.

However, there is still room for innovation in the types of technologies that are developed, used, and implemented. The smart thermostat solutions provided in this study can expand beyond typically defined features and be used for improved holistic health monitoring purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to validate the hypothesis that remote motion sensors could be used to quantify and track an individual's movements around the house. On the basis of our results, the next step would be to determine if using remote motion sensors could be a novel data collection method compared with the national census-level surveys administered by governmental bodies. The results will be used to inform a more extensive implementation study of similar smart home technologies to gather data for machine learning algorithms and to build upon pattern recognition and comprehensive health monitoring. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study with a sample size of 8 to validate the use of remote motion sensors to quantify movement in the house. A large database containing data from smart home thermostats was analyzed to compare the following indicators; sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. These indicators were developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and are collected through traditional survey methods. RESULTS: The results showed a significant Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.8 (P<.001), which indicates a positive linear association between the total number of sensors activated and the total number of indoor steps traveled by study participants. In addition, the indicators of sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behavior were all found to be highly comparable with those attained by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

On the other hand, to better assist those individuals with essential health care services in the event of an emergency, their regular activities should be monitored. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors may be employed to track the sequence of activities of individuals via ambient sensors, providing real-time insights on daily activity patterns and easy access to the data through the connected ecosystem. Previous surveys to identify the regular activity patterns of older adults were deficient in the limited number of participants, short period of activity tracking, and high reliance on predefined normal activity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to overcome the aforementioned challenges by performing a pilot study to evaluate the utilization of large-scale data from smart home thermostats that collect the motion status of individuals for every 5-minute interval over a long period of time. METHODS: From a large-scale dataset, we selected a group of 30 households who met the inclusion criteria (having at least 8 sensors, being connected to the system for at least 355 days in 2018, and having up to 4 occupants). The indoor activity patterns were captured through motion sensors. We used the unsupervised, time-based, deep neural-network architecture long short-term memory-variational autoencoder to identify the regular activity pattern for each household on 2 time scales: annual and weekday. The results were validated using 2019 records. The area under the curve as well as loss in 2018 were compatible with the 2019 schedule. Daily abnormal behaviors were identified based on deviation from the regular activity model. RESULTS: The utilization of this approach not only enabled us to identify the regular activity pattern for each household but also provided other insights by assessing sleep behavior using the sleep time and wake-up time. We could also compare the average time individuals spent at home for the different days of the week. From our study sample, there was a significant difference in the time individuals spent indoors during the weekend versus on weekdays.

Such transliterations introduce high variability in text and challenge text-analytics methods. To reduce their variability, medical terms must be normalized, such as linking them to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts. We present a method to identify both transliterated and translated Hebrew medical terms and link them with UMLS entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigate the effect of linking terms in Camoni, a popular Israeli online health community in Hebrew. Our method, MDTEL (Medical Deep Transliteration Entity Linking), includes (1) an attention-based recurrent neural network encoder-decoder to transliterate words and mapping UMLS from English to Hebrew, (2) an unsupervised method for creating a transliteration dataset in any language without manually labeled data, and (3) an efficient way to identify and link medical entities in the Hebrew corpus to UMLS concepts, by producing a high-recall list of candidate medical terms in the corpus, and then filtering the candidates to relevant medical terms. RESULTS: We carry out experiments on 3 disease-specific communities: diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and depression. MDTEL tagging and normalizing on Camoni posts achieved 99% accuracy, 92% recall, and 87% precision. When tagging and normalizing terms in queries from the Camoni search logs, UMLS-normalized queries improved search results in 46% of the cases.

Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. METHODS: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. RESULTS: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation.

Huang_2019_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Adversarial MACE Prediction After Acute Coronary Syndrome Using Electronic Health Records,"Huang, Zhengxing and Dong, Wei",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as an emergent and severe syndrome due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries, is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability globally. ACS is usually caused by one of three problems: ST elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) prediction, as a critical tool to estimate the likelihood an individual is at risk of ACS, has been widely adopted in the early prevention and intervention of ACS. Although valuable, existing MACE prediction models are designed to predict the overall probability of MACE occurrence for ACS patients, and lack the ability to look for insight into the disease to distinguish the different subtypes of ACS in a fine-grained manner. It is interesting to exploit the different subtypes of ACS and mine their private and shared underlying knowledge to improve the performance of MACE prediction. In this study, we propose utilizing a large volume of heterogeneous electronic health records for the application of MACE prediction. In detail, we address the multi-subtype-oriented MACE prediction for ACS as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, present a MTL-based model to predict MACE of ACS patients with the different subtypes, and incorporate adversarial learning into the model to alleviate both the shared and private latent feature spaces of each subtype of ACS from interfering with each other. A real clinical dataset containing 2,863 ACS patient samples is collected from a Chinese hospital to validate the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction performance of our proposed model obtains a significant improvement, compared to single-subtype-oriented MACE prediction models.",2019,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2882518,23,5,2117-2126,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Acute Coronary Syndrome/complications/epidemiology and *Deep Learning and *Electronic Health Records and *Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/mortality and Aged and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Humans and Medical Informatics and Middle Aged and Models, Statistical",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

Now clinicians and patients together choose the list of problems that represent the patient's current state of health and illness. As the physician's role slides closer to consultant and the medical paternalism of the twentieth century falls further into the background of our technology-infused present, who holds the power of delineating a patient's clinical identity?

Han_2017_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,An Intelligible Risk Stratification Model Based on Pairwise and Size Constrained Kmeans,"Han, Longfei and Luo, Senlin and Wang, Huaiqing and Pan, Limin and Ma, Xincheng and Zhang, Tiemei",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Having a system to stratify individuals according to risk is key to clinical disease prevention. This allows individuals identified at different risk tiers to benefit from further investigation and intervention. But the same risk score estimated for two different persons does not mean they need the same further investigation or represent the similarity health condition between two persons. Meanwhile, users still do not know a prior what most of the risk tiers are, and how many tiers should be found in risk stratification. In this paper, the proposed pairwise and size constrained Kmeans (PSCKmeans) method simultaneously integrates the limited supervised information and the size constraints to screen the high-risk population based on similarity measurement, and gets a feasible and balanced stratification solution to avoid cluster with few points. Results on China Health and Nutrition Survey public dataset and follow-up dataset show that the proposed PSCKmeans method can naturally grade the risk of diabetes into four tiers, and achieve 73.8%, 85.1%, and 0.95% sensitivity, specificity, and ratio of minimum to expected on testing data. The proposed method compares favorably with eight previous semisupervised clustering methods; it demonstrates that semisupervised clustering by unifying multiple forms of constraints can guide a good partition that is more relevant for the domain and find new categories through prior knowledge.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A targeted convenience sample of 465 individuals and 134 researchers completed an extensive online survey. Thirty-five hour-long semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of 11 individuals and 9 researchers, as well as 15 company/key informants. RESULTS: Challenges to the use of PHD for research were identified in six areas: data ownership; data access for research; privacy; informed consent and ethics; research methods and data quality; and the unpredictable nature of the rapidly evolving ecosystem of devices, apps, and other services that leave ""digital footprints."" Individuals reported willingness to anonymously share PHD if it would be used to advance research for the good of the public. Researchers were enthusiastic about using PHD for research, but noted barriers related to intellectual property, licensing, and the need for legal agreements with companies. Companies were interested in research but stressed that their first priority was maintaining customer relationships.

Adolescents have various unmet needs. Regarding self-report of symptoms and health status, users of mobile apps showed enhanced compliance. Currently, HSCT aftercare at the HSCT outpatient clinic of the St. Anna Children's Hospital in Vienna, Austria, is based on handwritten diaries, carrying various disadvantages. Recently, we developed the prototype of a web-based, self-monitoring gamified mobile app tailored for adolescents: the INTERACCT (Integrating Entertainment and Reaction Assessment into Child Cancer Therapy) app. OBJECTIVE: This observational, prospective study evaluated the usability of the INTERACCT app for tracking real-time self-reported symptoms and health status data in adolescent HSCT patients and a healthy matched control group. The primary outcome of the study was the quality of the self-reported medical information. We hypothesized that the mobile app would provide superior medical information for the clinicians than would the handwritten diaries. METHODS: Health data were reported via paper diary and mobile app for 5 consecutive days each. The quality of medical information was rated on a 5-point scale independently and blinded by two HSCT clinicians, and the duration of use was evaluated. A total of 52 participant questionnaires were assessed for gaming patterns and device preferences, self-efficacy, users' satisfaction, acceptability, and suggestions for improvement of the mobile app. Interrater reliability was calculated with the intraclass correlation coefficient, based on a two-way mixed model; one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and t tests were conducted post hoc. Descriptive methods were used for correlation with participants' demographics. For users' satisfaction and acceptability of the mobile app, the median and the IQR were calculated. RESULTS: Data from 42 participants-15 patients and 27 healthy students-with comparable demographics were evaluated. The results of our study indicated a superiority of the quality of self-reported medical data in the INTERACCT app over traditional paper-and-pencil assessment (mobile app: 4.14 points, vs paper-based diary: 3.77 points, P=.02). The mobile app outperformed paper-and-pencil assessments mainly among the patients, in particular among patients with treatment-associated complications (mobile app: 4.43 points, vs paper-based diary: 3.73 points, P=.01). The mobile app was used significantly longer by adolescents (<e2><89><a5>14 years: 4.57 days, vs <e2><89><a4>13 years: 3.14 days, P=.03) and females (4.76 days for females vs 2.95 days for males, P=.004). This corresponds with a longer duration of use among impaired patients with comorbidities. User satisfaction and acceptability ratings for the mobile app were high across all groups, but adherence to entering a large amount of data decreased over time. Based on our results, we developed a case vignette of the target group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first to show that the quality of patient-reported medical information submitted via the INTERACCT app embedded in a serious game is superior to that submitted via a handwritten diary. In light of these results, a refinement of the mobile app supported by a machine learning approach is planned within an international research project.",2020,10.2196/18781,8,6,e18781,eng,2291-5222,*adolescents and *cancer and *Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and *medical information exchange and *mobile app and *Mobile Applications and *mobile phone and *Neoplasms and *self-reported heath status and *stem cell transplant and Adolescent and adolescents and Aftercare and cancer and Child and Female and Humans and Internet and Male and medical information exchange and mobile app and mobile phone and Prospective Studies and Reproducibility of Results and self-reported heath status and stem cell transplant,NA,NA,2020/06/30/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is difficult to capture the smoking behaviors of individuals in actual locations as well as the extent of exposure to tobacco promotional efforts. With the high ownership of smartphones in the United States-when used alongside data sources on TRO locations-apps could potentially improve tobacco control efforts. Health apps could be used to assess individual-level exposure to tobacco marketing, particularly in relation to the locations of TROs as well as locations where they were most likely to smoke. To date, it remains unclear how health apps could be used practically by health promotion organizations to better reach underserved communities in their tobacco control efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate how smartphone apps could augment existing data on locations of TROs within underserved communities in Massachusetts and Texas to help inform tobacco control efforts. METHODS: Data for this study were collected from 2 sources: (1) geolocations of TROs from the North American Industry Classification System 2016 and (2) 95 participants (aged 18 to 34 years) from underserved communities who resided in Massachusetts and Texas and took part in an 8-week study using location tracking on their smartphones. We analyzed the data using spatial autocorrelation, optimized hot spot analysis, and fitted power-law distribution to identify the TROs that attracted the most human traffic using mobility data. RESULTS: Participants reported encountering protobacco messages mostly from store signs and displays and antitobacco messages predominantly through television. In Massachusetts, clusters of TROs (Dorchester Center and Jamaica Plain) and reported smoking behaviors (Dorchester Center, Roxbury Crossing, Lawrence) were found in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Despite the widespread distribution of TROs throughout the communities, participants overwhelmingly visited a relatively small number of TROs in Roxbury and Methuen. In Texas, clusters of TROs (Spring, Jersey Village, Bunker Hill Village, Sugar Land, and Missouri City) were found primarily in Houston, whereas clusters of reported smoking behaviors were concentrated in West University Place, Aldine, Jersey Village, Spring, and Baytown. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps could be used to pair geolocation data with self-reported smoking behavior in order to gain a better understanding of how tobacco product marketing and promotion influence smoking behavior within vulnerable communities. Public health officials could take advantage of smartphone data collection capabilities to implement targeted tobacco control efforts in these strategic locations to reach underserved communities in their built environment.",2020,10.2196/17451,22,7,e17451,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*big data and *data science and *mobile health and *mobile phone and *spatial analysis and *tobacco use and Adolescent and Adult and big data and data science and Female and Humans and Longitudinal Studies and Male and Marketing/*standards and Mobile Applications/*standards and mobile health and mobile phone and spatial analysis and Tobacco Industry/*standards and tobacco use and Vulnerable Populations and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/07/07/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hao_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Voice of Chinese Health Consumers: A Text Mining Approach to Web-Based Physician Reviews,"Hao, Haijing and Zhang, Kunpeng",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Many Web-based health care platforms allow patients to evaluate physicians by posting open-end textual reviews based on their experiences. These reviews are helpful resources for other patients to choose high-quality doctors, especially in countries like China where no doctor referral systems exist. Analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content to understand the voice of health consumers has attracted much attention from health care providers and health care researchers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from Web-based physician reviews using text-mining techniques to examine what Chinese patients have said about their doctors and whether these topics differ across various specialties. This knowledge will help health care consumers, providers, and researchers better understand this information. METHODS: We conducted two-fold analyses on the data collected from the ""Good Doctor Online"" platform, the largest online health community in China. First, we explored all reviews from 2006-2014 using descriptive statistics. Second, we applied the well-known topic extraction algorithm Latent Dirichlet Allocation to more than 500,000 textual reviews from over 75,000 Chinese doctors across four major specialty areas to understand what Chinese health consumers said online about their doctor visits. RESULTS: On the ""Good Doctor Online"" platform, 112,873 out of 314,624 doctors had been reviewed at least once by April 11, 2014. Among the 772,979 textual reviews, we chose to focus on four major specialty areas that received the most reviews: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology and Pediatrics, and Chinese Traditional Medicine. Among the doctors who received reviews from those four medical specialties, two-thirds of them received more than two reviews and in a few extreme cases, some doctors received more than 500 reviews. Across the four major areas, the most popular topics reviewers found were the experience of finding doctors, doctors' technical skills and bedside manner, general appreciation from patients, and description of various symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using an automated text-mining approach to analyze a large amount of unstructured textual data of Web-based physician reviews in China. Based on our analysis, we found that Chinese reviewers mainly concentrate on a few popular topics. This is consistent with the goal of Chinese online health platforms and demonstrates the health care focus in China's health care system. Our text-mining approach reveals a new research area on how to use big data to help health care providers, health care administrators, and policy makers hear patient voices, target patient concerns, and improve the quality of care in this age of patient-centered care. Also, on the health care consumer side, our text mining technique helps patients make more informed decisions about which specialists to see without reading thousands of reviews, which is simply not feasible. In addition, our comparison analysis of Web-based physician reviews in China and the United States also indicates some cultural differences.",2016,10.2196/jmir.4430,18,5,e108,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,China and China health consumers and Data Mining/*methods and Female and Humans and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and Male and online doctor review and physician ratings and Physicians and Telemedicine/*statistics & numerical data and Text Messaging/*statistics & numerical data and text mining,NA,NA,2016/05/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Other studies analyzed librarian-provided literature searching services and instruction in question formulation as well as the impact of librarian-provided services on patient length of stay in hospital. No studies were found that investigated librarians providing direct services to researchers or patients in healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: Librarian-provided services directed to participants in training programs (eg, students, residents) improve skills in searching the literature to facilitate the integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making.

Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world's mental health and health care systems. Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool. RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.",2020,10.2196/21418,22,12,e21418,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*analytics and *COVID-19 and *infodemiology and *informatics and *infoveillance and *mental health and *sentiment analysis and *social media and *Twitter and *United States and analytics and Cohort Studies and COVID-19 and COVID-19/epidemiology/*psychology and Humans and infodemiology and informatics and infoveillance and Longitudinal Studies and mental health and Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data and Pandemics and SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification and sentiment analysis and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and Twitter and United States and United States/epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/12/14/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Benjamin and Kum, Hye-Chung",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: There is substantial prior research on the perspectives of patients on the use of health information for research. Numerous communication barriers challenge transparency between researchers and data participants in secondary database research (eg, waiver of informed consent and knowledge gaps). Individual concerns and misconceptions challenge the trust in researchers among patients despite efforts to protect data. Technical software used to protect research data can further complicate the public's understanding of research. For example, MiNDFIRL (Minimum Necessary Disclosure For Interactive Record Linkage) is a prototype software that can be used to enhance the confidentiality of data sets by restricting disclosures of identifying information during the record linkage process. However, software, such as MiNDFIRL, which is used to protect data, must overcome the aforementioned communication barriers. One proposed solution is the creation of an interactive web-based frequently asked question (FAQ) template that can be adapted and used to communicate research issues to data subjects. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve communication with patients and transparency about how complex software, such as MiNDFIRL, is used to enhance privacy in secondary database studies to maintain the public's trust in researchers. METHODS: A Delphi technique with 3 rounds of the survey was used to develop the FAQ document to communicate privacy issues related to a generic secondary database study using the MiNDFIRL software. The Delphi panel consisted of 38 patients with chronic health conditions. We revised the FAQ between Delphi rounds and provided participants with a summary of the feedback. We adopted a conservative consensus threshold of less than 10% negative feedback per FAQ section. RESULTS: We developed a consensus language for 21 of the 24 FAQ sections. Participant feedback demonstrated preference differences (eg, brevity vs comprehensiveness). We adapted the final FAQ into an interactive web-based format that 94% (31/33) of the participants found helpful or very helpful. The template FAQ and MiNDFIRL source code are available on GitHub. The results indicate the following patient communication considerations: patients have diverse and varied preferences; the tone is important but challenging; and patients want information on security, identifiers, and final disposition of information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide insights into what research-related information is useful to patients and how researchers can communicate such information. These findings align with the current understanding of health literacy and its challenges. Communication is essential to transparency and ethical data use, yet it is exceedingly challenging. Developing FAQ template language to accompany a complex software may enable researchers to provide greater transparency when informed consent is not possible.",2020,10.2196/20783,22,12,e20783,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*big data and *communication barriers and *Delphi technique and *medical record linkage and *privacy and *research subjects and Adult and Aged and big data and Communication and communication barriers and Confidentiality/*standards and Databases, Factual and Delphi technique and Delphi Technique and Health Literacy/*standards and Humans and medical record linkage and Middle Aged and privacy and research subjects and Software/*standards and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/12/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS: We first benchmarked the accuracy of the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in a manually annotated, publically available dataset from the 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge. We then applied the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL to 9 million clinical notes from the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) and used the resulting data for three research tasks. RESULTS: There is no significant difference between using the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in the results of the three research tasks when using large datasets. In one subtask, REVEAL achieved higher sensitivity with smaller datasets. CONCLUSIONS: For a variety of tasks, employing simple term recognition methods instead of advanced NLP methods results in little or no impact on accuracy when using large datasets. Simpler dictionary-based methods have the advantage of scaling well to very large datasets. Promoting the use of simple, dictionary-based methods for population level analyses can advance adoption of NLP in practice.",2015,10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002902,22,1,121-131,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Databases as Topic and *Electronic Health Records and *Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining/*methods and Drug Interactions and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and electronic health records and Humans and natural language processing and Obesity and text mining,NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Milne_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Improving Moderator Responsiveness in Online Peer Support Through Automated Triage,"Milne, David N. and McCabe, Kathryn L. and Calvo, Rafael A.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Online peer support forums require oversight to ensure they remain safe and therapeutic. As online communities grow, they place a greater burden on their human moderators, which increases the likelihood that people at risk may be overlooked. This study evaluated the potential for machine learning to assist online peer support by directing moderators' attention where it is most needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an automated triage system and the extent to which it influences moderator behavior. METHODS: A machine learning classifier was trained to prioritize forum messages as green, amber, red, or crisis depending on how urgently they require attention from a moderator. This was then launched as a set of widgets injected into a popular online peer support forum hosted by ReachOut.com, an Australian Web-based youth mental health service that aims to intervene early in the onset of mental health problems in young people. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a holdout test set of manually prioritized messages. The impact on moderator behavior was measured as response ratio and response latency, that is, the proportion of messages that receive at least one reply from a moderator and how long it took for these replies to be made. These measures were compared across 3 periods: before launch, after an informal launch, and after a formal launch accompanied by training. RESULTS: The algorithm achieved 84% f-measure in identifying content that required a moderator response. Between prelaunch and post-training periods, response ratios increased by 0.9, 4.4, and 10.5 percentage points for messages labelled as crisis, red, and green, respectively, but decreased by 5.0 percentage points for amber messages. Logistic regression indicated that the triage system was a significant contributor to response ratios for green, amber, and red messages, but not for crisis messages. Response latency was significantly reduced (P<.001), between the same periods, by factors of 80%, 80%, 77%, and 12% for crisis, red, amber, and green messages, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the triage system made a significant and unique contribution to reducing the time taken to respond to green, amber, and red messages, but not to crisis messages, after accounting for moderator and community activity. CONCLUSIONS: The triage system was generally accurate, and moderators were largely in agreement with how messages were prioritized. It had a modest effect on response ratios, primarily because moderators were already more likely to respond to high priority content before the introduction of triage. However, it significantly and substantially reduced the time taken for moderators to respond to prioritized content. Further evaluations are needed to assess the impact of mistakes made by the triage algorithm and how changes to moderator responsiveness impact the well-being of forum members.",2019,10.2196/11410,21,4,e11410,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*classification and *natural language processing and *social support and *Social Support and *triage and classification and Education, Distance and Female and Humans and Internet and Male and natural language processing and social support and triage and Triage/*methods",NA,NA,2019/04/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lee_2016_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Identification of Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factors Using Phenotypes Consisting of Anthropometry and Triglycerides based on Machine Learning,"Lee, Bum Ju and Kim, Jong Yeol",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"The hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes; however, to date, no study has assessed the predictive power of phenotypes based on individual anthropometric measurements and triglyceride (TG) levels. The aims of the present study were to assess the association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes in Korean adults and to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes consisting of combinations of individual anthropometric measurements and TG levels. Between November 2006 and August 2013, 11,937 subjects participated in this retrospective cross-sectional study. We measured fasting plasma glucose and TG levels and performed anthropometric measurements. We employed binary logistic regression (LR) to examine statistically significant differences between normal subjects and those with type 2 diabetes using HW and individual anthropometric measurements. For more reliable prediction results, two machine learning algorithms, naive Bayes (NB) and LR, were used to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes. All prediction experiments were performed using a tenfold cross validation method. Among all of the variables, the presence of HW was most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.07 [95% CI, 1.72-2.49] in men; p < 0.001, adjusted OR = 2.09 [1.79-2.45] in women). When comparing waist circumference (WC) and TG levels as components of the HW phenotype, the association between WC and type 2 diabetes was greater than the association between TG and type 2 diabetes. The phenotypes tended to have higher predictive power in women than in men. Among the phenotypes, the best predictors of type 2 diabetes were waist-to-hip ratio + TG in men (AUC by NB = 0.653, AUC by LR = 0.661) and rib-to-hip ratio + TG in women (AUC by NB = 0.73, AUC by LR = 0.735). Although the presence of HW demonstrated the strongest association with type 2 diabetes, the predictive power of the combined measurements of the actual WC and TG values may not be the best manner of predicting type 2 diabetes. Our findings may provide clinical information concerning the development of clinical decision support systems for the initial screening of type 2 diabetes.",2016,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2396520,20,1,39-46,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Anthropometry and *Machine Learning and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Cross-Sectional Studies and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*epidemiology/physiopathology and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Phenotype and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors and Triglycerides/*blood",NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tully_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Investigating the Extent to Which Patients Should Control Access to Patient Records for Research: A Deliberative Process Using Citizens' Juries,"Tully, Mary P. and Bozentko, Kyle and Clement, Sarah and Hunn, Amanda and Hassan, Lamiece and Norris, Ruth and Oswald, Malcolm and Peek, Niels",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The secondary use of health data for research raises complex questions of privacy and governance. Such questions are ill-suited to opinion polling where citizens must choose quickly between multiple-choice answers based on little information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project was to extend knowledge about what control informed citizens would seek over the use of health records for research after participating in a deliberative process using citizens' juries. METHODS: Two 3-day citizens' juries, of 17 citizens each, were convened to reflect UK national demographics from 355 eligible applicants. Each jury addressed the mission ""To what extent should patients control access to patient records for secondary use?"" Jurors heard from and questioned 5 expert witnesses (chosen either to inform the jury, or to argue for and against the secondary use of data), interspersed with structured opportunities to deliberate among themselves, including discussion and role-play. Jurors voted on a series of questions associated with the jury mission, giving their rationale. Individual views were polled using questionnaires at the beginning and at end of the process. RESULTS: At the end of the process, 33 out of 34 jurors voted in support of the secondary use of data for research, with 24 wanting individuals to be able to opt out, 6 favoring opt in, and 3 voting that all records should be available without any consent process. When considering who should get access to data, both juries had very similar rationales. Both thought that public benefit was a key justification for access. Jury 1 was more strongly supportive of sharing patient records for public benefit, whereas jury 2 was more cautious and sought to give patients more control. Many jurors changed their opinion about who should get access to health records: 17 people became more willing to support wider information sharing of health data for public benefit, whereas 2 moved toward more patient control over patient records. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight that, when informed of both risks and opportunities associated with data sharing, citizens believe an individual's right to privacy should not prevent research that can benefit the general public. The juries also concluded that patients should be notified of any such scheme and have the right to opt out if they so choose. Many jurors changed their minds about this complex policy question when they became more informed. Many, but not all, jurors became less skeptical about health data sharing, as they became better informed of its benefits and risks.",2018,10.2196/jmir.7763,20,3,e112,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*confidentiality and *data linkage and *medical research and *national health services and *patient engagement and *privacy and *public opinion and *public participation and *public policy, decision making, organizational and Biomedical Research/*legislation & jurisprudence and confidentiality and data linkage and Decision Making/*ethics and Humans and Information Dissemination/*ethics and Medical Records/*legislation & jurisprudence and medical research and national health services and patient engagement and privacy and Privacy/*legislation & jurisprudence and public opinion and public participation and public policy, decision making, organizational and Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,NA,2018/03/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Carbonnel_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Identifying Frameworks for Validation and Monitoring of Consensual Behavioral Intervention Technologies: Narrative Review,"Carbonnel, Francois and Ninot, Gregory",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Changing health behaviors, such as smoking, unhealthy eating, inactivity, and alcohol abuse, may have a greater impact on population health than any curative strategy. One of the suggested strategies is the use of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). They open up new opportunities in the area of prevention and therapy and have begun to show benefits in the durable change of health behaviors in patients or those at risk. A consensual and international paradigm was adopted by health authorities for drugs 50 years ago. It guides their development from research units to their authorization and surveillance. BITs' generalization brings into question their upstream evaluation before being placed on the market and their downstream monitoring once on the market; this is especially the case in view of the marketing information provided by manufacturers and the scarcity and methodological limits of scientific studies on these tools. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and categorize the frameworks for the validation and monitoring of BITs proposed in the literature. METHODS: We conducted a narrative literature review using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The review items included the following: name, publication year, name of the creator (ie, first author), country, funding organization, health focus, target group, and design (ie, linear, iterative, evolutive, and/or concurrent). The frameworks were then categorized based on (1) translational research thanks to a continuum of steps and (2) the three paradigms that may have inspired the frameworks: biomedical, engineering, and/or behavioral. RESULTS: We identified 46 frameworks besides the classic US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) five-phase drug development model. A total of 57% (26/46) of frameworks were created in the 2010s and 61% (28/46) involved the final user in an early and systematic way. A total of 4% (2/46) of frameworks had a linear-only sequence of their phases, 37% (17/46) had a linear and iterative structure, 33% (15/46) added an evolutive structure, and 24% (11/46) were associated with a parallel process. Only 12 out of 46 (26%) frameworks covered the continuum of steps and 12 (26%) relied on the three paradigms. CONCLUSIONS: To date, 46 frameworks of BIT validation and surveillance coexist, besides the classic FDA five-phase drug development model, without the predominance of one of them or convergence in a consensual model. Their number has increased exponentially in the last three decades. Three dangerous scenarios are possible: (1) anarchic continuous development of BITs that depend on companies amalgamating health benefits and usability (ie, user experience, data security, and ergonomics) and limiting implementation to several countries; (2) the movement toward the type of framework for drug evaluation centered on establishing its effectiveness before marketing authorization to guarantee its safety for users, which is heavy and costly; and (3) the implementation of a framework reliant on big data analysis based on a posteriori research and an autoregulation of a market, but that does not address the safety risk for the health user, as the market will not regulate safety or efficacy issues. This paper recommends convergence toward an international validation and surveillance framework based on the specificities of BITs, not equivalent to medical devices, to guarantee their effectiveness and safety for users.",2019,10.2196/13606,21,10,e13606,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*behavioral intervention technology and *framework and *nonpharmacological interventions and *paradigm and *surveillance and *validation and Behavior Therapy/*methods and behavioral intervention technology and Female and framework and Health Behavior/*physiology and Humans and Male and nonpharmacological interventions and paradigm and surveillance and validation and Validation Studies as Topic,NA,NA,2019/10/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Park_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Clustering Insomnia Patterns by Data From Wearable Devices: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"Park, Sungkyu and Lee, Sang Won and Han, Sungwon and Cha, Meeyoung",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: As societies become more complex, larger populations suffer from insomnia. In 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that sleep disorders should be dealt with as a public health epidemic. However, it is hard to provide adequate treatment for each insomnia sufferer, since various behavioral characteristics influence symptoms of insomnia collectively. OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a neural-net based unsupervised user clustering method towards insomnia sufferers in order to clarify the unique traits for each derived groups. Unlike the current diagnosis of insomnia that requires qualitative analysis from interview results, the classification of individuals with insomnia by using various information modalities from smart bands and neural-nets can provide better insight into insomnia treatments. METHODS: This study, as part of the precision psychiatry initiative, is based on a smart band experiment conducted over 6 weeks on individuals with insomnia. During the experiment period, a total of 42 participants (19 male; average age 22.00 [SD 2.79]) from a large university wore smart bands 24/7, and 3 modalities were collected and examined: sleep patterns, daily activities, and personal demographics. We considered the consecutive daily information as a form of images, learned the latent variables of the images via a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and clustered and labeled the input images based on the derived features. We then converted consecutive daily information into a sequence of the labels for each subject and finally clustered the people with insomnia based on their predominant labels. RESULTS: Our method identified 5 new insomnia-activity clusters of participants that conventional methods have not recognized, and significant differences in sleep and behavioral characteristics were shown among groups (analysis of variance on rank: F(4,37)=2.36, P=.07 for the sleep_min feature; F(4,37)=9.05, P<.001 for sleep_efficiency; F(4,37)=8.16, P<.001 for active_calorie; F(4,37)=6.53, P<.001 for walks; and F(4,37)=3.51, P=.02 for stairs). Analyzing the consecutive data through a CAE and clustering could reveal intricate connections between insomnia and various everyday activity markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that unsupervised learning allows health practitioners to devise precise and tailored interventions at the level of data-guided user clusters (ie, precision psychiatry), which could be a novel solution to treating insomnia and other mental disorders.",2019,10.2196/14473,7,12,e14473,eng,2291-5222,*cluster analysis and *convolutional autoencoder and *insomnia and *precision psychiatry and *time-series data and *unsupervised learning and Algorithms and Body Mass Index and cluster analysis and Cluster Analysis and convolutional autoencoder and Evaluation Studies as Topic and Female and Humans and insomnia and Male and Precision Medicine/*methods and precision psychiatry and Psychiatry/instrumentation and Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology/psychology and Sleep/*physiology and time-series data and unsupervised learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning/economics and Wearable Electronic Devices/*adverse effects and Young Adult,NA,NA,2019/12/05/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tongue diagnosis is an important component of TCM, but also plays a role in Western medicine, for example in dermatology. However, the procedure of obtaining tongue images has not been standardized and the reliability of tongue diagnosis by smartphone tongue images has yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study was to develop an operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. The second and main objective of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of tongue coating diagnosis using the operating classification scheme. METHODS: An operating classification scheme for tongue coating was developed using a stepwise approach and a quasi-Delphi method. First, tongue images (n=2023) were analyzed by 2 groups of assessors to develop the operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. Based on clinicians' (n=17) own interpretations as well as their use of the operating classification scheme, the results of tongue diagnosis on a representative tongue image set (n=24) were compared. After gathering consensus for the operating classification scheme, the clinicians were instructed to use the scheme to assess tongue features of their patients under direct visual inspection. At the same time, the clinicians took tongue images of the patients with smartphones and assessed tongue features observed in the smartphone image using the same classification scheme. The intra-rater agreements of these two assessments were calculated to determine which features of tongue coating were better retained by the image. Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated. RESULTS: Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen <ce><ba> range 0.69-1.0). Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good (<ce><ba> range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (<ce><ba>=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (<ce><ba>=0.1). Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis.

We then performed a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of the fields of vision and gaze points attracting attention as well as the visual itinerary. RESULTS: Eye-tracking technology was used in the OSCE with no major issues. This portable system was of the greatest value in the patient simulators and mannequin stations, where interaction with the simulated patient or areas of interest in the mannequin can be quantified. This technology proved useful to better identify the areas of interest in the medical images provided. CONCLUSIONS: Portable eye trackers offer the opportunity to improve the objective evaluation of candidates and the self-evaluation of the stations used as well as medical simulations by examiners.

Du_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Public Perception Analysis of Tweets During the 2015 Measles Outbreak: Comparative Study Using Convolutional Neural Network Models,"Du, Jingcheng and Tang, Lu and Xiang, Yang and Zhi, Degui and Xu, Jun and Song, Hsing-Yi and Tao, Cui",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Timely understanding of public perceptions allows public health agencies to provide up-to-date responses to health crises such as infectious diseases outbreaks. Social media such as Twitter provide an unprecedented way for the prompt assessment of the large-scale public response. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to develop a scheme for a comprehensive public perception analysis of a measles outbreak based on Twitter data and demonstrate the superiority of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models (compared with conventional machine learning methods) on measles outbreak-related tweets classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard training set. METHODS: We first designed a comprehensive scheme for the analysis of public perception of measles based on tweets, including 3 dimensions: discussion themes, emotions expressed, and attitude toward vaccination. All 1,154,156 tweets containing the word ""measles"" posted between December 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, were purchased and downloaded from DiscoverText.com. Two expert annotators curated a gold standard of 1151 tweets (approximately 0.1% of all tweets) based on the 3-dimensional scheme. Next, a tweet classification system based on the CNN framework was developed. We compared the performance of the CNN models to those of 4 conventional machine learning models and another neural network model. We also compared the impact of different word embeddings configurations for the CNN models: (1) Stanford GloVe embedding trained on billions of tweets in the general domain, (2) measles-specific embedding trained on our 1 million measles related tweets, and (3) a combination of the 2 embeddings. RESULTS: Cohen kappa intercoder reliability values for the annotation were: 0.78, 0.72, and 0.80 on the 3 dimensions, respectively. Class distributions within the gold standard were highly unbalanced for all dimensions. The CNN models performed better on all classification tasks than k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, support vector machines, or random forest. Detailed comparison between support vector machines and the CNN models showed that the major contributor to the overall superiority of the CNN models is the improvement on recall, especially for classes with low occurrence. The CNN model with the 2 embedding combination led to better performance on discussion themes and emotions expressed (microaveraging F1 scores of 0.7811 and 0.8592, respectively), while the CNN model with Stanford embedding achieved best performance on attitude toward vaccination (microaveraging F1 score of 0.8642). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed scheme can successfully classify the public's opinions and emotions in multiple dimensions, which would facilitate the timely understanding of public perceptions during the outbreak of an infectious disease. Compared with conventional machine learning methods, our CNN models showed superiority on measles-related tweet classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard. With the success of these tasks, our proposed scheme and CNN-based tweets classification system is expected to be useful for the analysis of tweets about other infectious diseases such as influenza and Ebola.",2018,10.2196/jmir.9413,20,7,e236,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*convolutional neural networks and *measles and *Neural Networks, Computer and *public perception and *social media and convolutional neural networks and Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data and History, 21st Century and Humans and measles and Measles/*epidemiology/pathology and Perception and Public Opinion and public perception and Reproducibility of Results and social media and Social Media/*trends",NA,NA,2018/07/09/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Liu_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Proactive Suicide Prevention Online (PSPO): Machine Identification and Crisis Management for Chinese Social Media Users With Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors,"Liu, Xingyun and Liu, Xiaoqian and Sun, Jiumo and Yu, Nancy Xiaonan and Sun, Bingli and Li, Qing and Zhu, Tingshao",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a great public health challenge. Two hundred million people attempt suicide in China annually. Existing suicide prevention programs require the help-seeking initiative of suicidal individuals, but many of them have a low motivation to seek the required help. We propose that a proactive and targeted suicide prevention strategy can prompt more people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors to seek help. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to test the feasibility and acceptability of Proactive Suicide Prevention Online (PSPO), a new approach based on social media that combines proactive identification of suicide-prone individuals with specialized crisis management. METHODS: We first located a microblog group online. Their comments on a suicide note were analyzed by experts to provide a training set for the machine learning models for suicide identification. The best-performing model was used to automatically identify posts that suggested suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Next, a microblog direct message containing crisis management information, including measures that covered suicide-related issues, depression, help-seeking behavior and an acceptability test, was sent to users who had been identified by the model to be at risk of suicide. For those who replied to the message, trained counselors provided tailored crisis management. The Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was also used to analyze the users' psycholinguistic texts in 1-month time slots prior to and postconsultation. RESULTS: A total of 27,007 comments made in April 2017 were analyzed. Among these, 2786 (10.32%) were classified as indicative of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The performance of the detection model was good, with high precision (.86), recall (.78), F-measure (.86), and accuracy (.88). Between July 3, 2017, and July 3, 2018, we sent out a total of 24,727 direct messages to 12,486 social media users, and 5542 (44.39%) responded. Over one-third of the users who were contacted completed the questionnaires included in the direct message. Of the valid responses, 89.73% (1259/1403) reported suicidal ideation, but more than half (725/1403, 51.67%) reported that they had not sought help. The 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) mean score was 17.40 (SD 5.98). More than two-thirds of the participants (968/1403, 69.00%) thought the PSPO approach was acceptable. Moreover, 2321 users replied to the direct message. In a comparison of the frequency of word usage in their microblog posts 1-month before and after the consultation, we found that the frequency of death-oriented words significantly declined while the frequency of future-oriented words significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: The PSPO model is suitable for identifying populations that are at risk of suicide. When followed up with proactive crisis management, it may be a useful supplement to existing prevention programs because it has the potential to increase the accessibility of antisuicide information to people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors but a low motivation to seek help.",2019,10.2196/11705,21,5,e11705,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Chinese young people and *crisis management and *machine learning and *microblog direct message and *social network and *Suicidal Ideation and *suicide identification and Asian Continental Ancestry Group and Asians and Chinese young people and crisis management and Female and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*trends and Male and microblog direct message and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and social network and suicide identification and Suicide/*prevention & control and Surveys and Questionnaires,NA,NA,2019/05/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nazi_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Decade of Veteran Voices: Examining Patient Portal Enhancements Through the Lens of User-Centered Design,"Nazi, Kim M. and Turvey, Carolyn L. and Klein, Dawn M. and Hogan, Timothy P.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Health care systems have entered a new era focused on patient engagement. Patient portals linked to electronic health records are recognized as a promising multifaceted tool to help achieve patient engagement goals. Achieving significant growth in adoption and use requires agile evaluation methods to complement periodic formal research efforts. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes one of the implementation strategies that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has used to foster the adoption and sustained use of its patient portal, My HealtheVet, over the last decade: an ongoing focus on user-centered design (UCD). This strategy entails understanding the users and their tasks and goals and optimizing portal design and functionality accordingly. Using a case study approach, we present a comparison of early user demographics and preferences with more recent data and several examples to illustrate how a UCD can serve as an effective implementation strategy for a patient portal within a large integrated health care system. METHODS: VA has employed a customer experience analytics (CXA) survey on its patient portal since 2007 to enable ongoing direct user feedback. In a continuous cycle, a random sample of site visitors is invited to participate in the Web-based survey. CXA model questions are used to track and trend satisfaction, while custom questions collect data about users' characteristics, needs, and preferences. In this case study, we performed analyses of descriptive statistics comparing user characteristics and preferences from FY2008 (wherein ""FY"" means ""fiscal year"") to FY2017 and user trends regarding satisfaction with and utilization of specific portal functions over the last decade, as well as qualitative content analysis of user's open-ended survey comments. RESULTS: User feedback has guided the development of enhancements to core components of the My HealtheVet portal including available features, content, interface design, prospective functional design, and related policies. Ten-year data regarding user characteristics and portal utilization demonstrate trends toward greater patient engagement and satisfaction. Administration of a continuous voluntary Web-based survey is an efficient and effective way to capture veterans' voices about who they are, how they use the patient portal, needed system improvements, and desired additional services. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging ""voice-of-the-customer"" techniques as part of patient portal implementation can ensure that such systems meet users' needs in ways that are agile and most effective. Through this strategy, VA has fostered significant adoption and use of My HealtheVet to engage patients in managing their health.",2018,10.2196/10413,20,7,e10413,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*eHealth and *patient portal and *user-centered design and *veteran and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and eHealth and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and patient portal and Patient Portals/*trends and Prospective Studies and Telemedicine/*methods and Time Factors and United States and user-centered design and veteran and Veterans and Young Adult",NA,NA,2018/07/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chen_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Understanding User Experience: Exploring Participants' Messages With a Web-Based Behavioral Health Intervention for Adolescents With Chronic Pain,"Chen, Annie T. and Swaminathan, Aarti and Kearns, William R. and Alberts, Nicole M. and Law, Emily F. and Palermo, Tonya M.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Delivery of behavioral health interventions on the internet offers many benefits, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, convenience, and anonymity. In recent years, an increased number of internet interventions have been developed, targeting a range of conditions and behaviors, including depression, pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. Human support (coaching) is a common component of internet interventions that is intended to boost engagement; however, little is known about how participants interact with coaches and how this may relate to their experience with the intervention. By examining the data that participants produce during an intervention, we can characterize their interaction patterns and refine treatments to address different needs. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we employed text mining and visual analytics techniques to analyze messages exchanged between coaches and participants in an internet-delivered pain management intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their parents. METHODS: We explored the main themes in coaches' and participants' messages using an automated textual analysis method, topic modeling. We then clustered participants' messages to identify subgroups of participants with similar engagement patterns. RESULTS: First, we performed topic modeling on coaches' messages. The themes in coaches' messages fell into 3 categories: Treatment Content, Administrative and Technical, and Rapport Building. Next, we employed topic modeling to identify topics from participants' message histories. Similar to the coaches' topics, these were subsumed under 3 high-level categories: Health Management and Treatment Content, Questions and Concerns, and Activities and Interests. Finally, the cluster analysis identified 4 clusters, each with a distinguishing characteristic: Assignment-Focused, Short Message Histories, Pain-Focused, and Activity-Focused. The name of each cluster exemplifies the main engagement patterns of that cluster. CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary data analysis, we demonstrated how automated text analysis techniques could be used to identify messages of interest, such as questions and concerns from users. In addition, we demonstrated how cluster analysis could be used to identify subgroups of individuals who share communication and engagement patterns, and in turn facilitate personalization of interventions for different subgroups of patients. This work makes 2 key methodological contributions. First, this study is innovative in its use of topic modeling to provide a rich characterization of the textual content produced by coaches and participants in an internet-delivered behavioral health intervention. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of a visual analysis method to cluster participants and identify similar patterns of behavior based on intervention message content.",2019,10.2196/11756,21,4,e11756,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*chronic pain and *cluster analysis and *data visualization and *natural language processing and *technology and Adolescent and Behavior Therapy/*methods and chronic pain and Chronic Pain and cluster analysis and data visualization and Female and Humans and Internet and Male and natural language processing and technology,NA,NA,2019/04/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) might be effective in reducing blood pressure with a potential impact in reducing cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and utility of a CDSS, TeleHAS (tele-hipertensao arterial sistemica, or arterial hypertension system), in the care of patients with hypertension in the context of a primary care setting in a middle-income country. METHODS: The TeleHAS app consists of a platform integrating clinical and laboratory data on a particular patient, from which it performs cardiovascular risk calculation and provides evidence-based recommendations derived from Brazilian and international guidelines for the management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk. Ten family physicians from different primary care units in the city of Montes Claros, Brazil, were randomly selected to use the CDSS for the care of hypertensive patients for 6 months. After 3 and 6 months, the feasibility, usability, and utility of the CDSS in the routine care of the health team was evaluated through a standardized questionnaire and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Throughout the study, clinicians registered 535 patients with hypertension, at an average of 1.24 consultations per patient. Women accounted for 80% (8/10) of participant doctors, median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 27 to 59 years). As for feasibility, 100% of medical users claimed it was possible to use the app in the primary care setting, and for 80% (8/10) of them it was easy to incorporate its use into the daily routine and home visits. Nevertheless, 70% (7/10) of physicians claimed that the time taken to fill out the CDSS causes significant delays in service. Clinicians evaluated TeleHAS as good (8/10, 80% of users), with easy completion and friendly interface (10/10, 100%) and the potential to improve patients' treatment (10/10, 100%). A total of 90% (9/10) of physicians had access to new knowledge about cardiovascular risk and hypertension through the app recommendations and found it useful to promote prevention and optimize treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a CDSS developed to assist the management of patients with hypertension was feasible in the context of a primary health care setting in a middle-income country, with good user satisfaction and the potential to improve adherence to evidence-based practices.",2019,10.2196/mhealth.9869,7,3,e9869,eng,2291-5222,"*cardiovascular disease and *clinical decision support system and *Decision Support Techniques and *hypertension and *Software Design and *telemedicine and Adult and Brazil and cardiovascular disease and clinical decision support system and Feasibility Studies and Female and Humans and hypertension and Hypertension/psychology/*therapy and Male and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications/*standards/trends and Primary Health Care/methods/standards and Self-Management/*methods and Surveys and Questionnaires and Technology Assessment, Biomedical/methods and telemedicine",NA,NA,2019/03/25/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, some barriers to adoption persist. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the social, organizational, and technical factors affecting clinicians' adoption of a clinical photo documentation mHealth app and its implications for clinical workflows and quality of care. METHODS: A qualitative case study of a clinical photo and wound documentation app called imitoCam was conducted. The data were collected through 20 in-depth interviews with mHealth providers, clinicians, and medical informatics experts from 8 clinics and hospitals in Switzerland and Germany. RESULTS: According to the study participants, the use of mHealth in clinical photo and wound documentation provides numerous benefits such as time-saving and efficacy, better patient safety and quality of care, enhanced data security and validation, and better accessibility. The clinical workflow may also improve when the app is a good fit, resulting in better collaboration and transparency, streamlined daily work, clinician empowerment, and improved quality of care. The findings included important factors that may contribute to or hinder adoption. Factors may be related to the material nature of the tool, such as the perceived usefulness, ease of use, interoperability, cost, or security of the app, or social aspects such as personal experience, attitudes, awareness, or culture. Organizational and policy barriers include the available clinical practice infrastructure, workload and resources, the complexity of decision making, training, and ambiguity or lack of regulations. User engagement in the development and implementation process is a vital contributor to the successful adoption of mHealth apps. CONCLUSIONS: The promising potential of mHealth in clinical photo and wound documentation is clear and may enhance clinical workflow and quality of care; however, the factors affecting adoption go beyond the technical features of the tool itself to embrace significant social and organizational elements.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the ""Wuhan pneumonia""-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized. Understanding the nomenclature and biased terms employed in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak is paramount. We propose solidarity with communication professionals in combating the COVID-19 outbreak and the infodemic.

Accurate forecasting of symptom scores can be used to improve disease monitoring, enable early intervention, and eventually help prevent costly hospitalizations. Although several studies have examined the use of smartphone data to detect mood, only few studies deal with forecasting mood for one or more days. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the feasibility of forecasting daily subjective mood scores based on daily self-assessments collected from patients with bipolar disorder via a smartphone-based system in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: We applied hierarchical Bayesian regression models, a multi-task learning method, to account for individual differences and forecast mood for up to seven days based on 15,975 smartphone self-assessments from 84 patients with bipolar disorder participating in a randomized clinical trial. We reported the results of two time-series cross-validation 1-day forecast experiments corresponding to two different real-world scenarios and compared the outcomes with commonly used baseline methods. We then applied the best model to evaluate a 7-day forecast. RESULTS: The best performing model used a history of 4 days of self-assessment to predict future mood scores with historical mood being the most important predictor variable. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian regression model outperformed pooled and separate models in a 1-day forecast time-series cross-validation experiment and achieved the predicted metrics, R(2)=0.51 and root mean squared error of 0.32, for mood scores on a scale of -3 to 3. When increasing the forecast horizon, forecast errors also increased and the forecast regressed toward the mean of data distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method can forecast mood for several days with low error compared with common baseline methods. The applicability of a mood forecast in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder has also been discussed.",2020,10.2196/15028,8,4,e15028,eng,2291-5222,*Affect and *Bayesian analysis and *bipolar disorder and *Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis and *digital phenotyping and *early medical intervention and *forecasting and *machine learning and *mood and *Smartphone and Bayes Theorem and Bayesian analysis and bipolar disorder and digital phenotyping and early medical intervention and forecasting and Forecasting and Humans and machine learning and mood,NA,NA,2020/04/01/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. RESULTS: We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. CONCLUSION: While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocy160,26,3,198-210,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Artificial Intelligence and *Precision Medicine and *Self-Management and *Telemedicine and Chronic Disease/*therapy and Health Behavior and Humans and Software,NA,NA,2019/03/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zarkogianni_2018_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches Toward Assessing the Risk of Developing Cardiovascular Disease as a Long-Term Diabetes Complication,"Zarkogianni, Konstantia and Athanasiou, Maria and Thanopoulou, Anastasia C.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,The estimation of long-term diabetes complications risk is essential in the process of medical decision making. Guidelines for the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) advocate calculating the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk to initiate appropriate treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques toward the development of personalized models able to predict the risk of fatal or nonfatal CVD incidence in T2DM patients. The important challenge of handling the unbalanced nature of the available dataset is addressed by applying novel ensemble strategies. Hybrid Wavelet Neural Networks (HWNNs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) constitute the primary models for building ensembles following a subsampling approach. Different methods for combining the decisions of the primary models are applied and comparatively assessed. Data from the 5-year follow up of 560 patients with T2DM are used for development and evaluation purposes. The highest discrimination performance (Area Under the Curve (AUC): 71.48%) is achieved by taking into account both the HWNN- and SOM- based primary models' outputs. The proposed method is superior to the Binomial Linear Regression (BLR) model justifying the need to apply more sophisticated techniques in order to produce reliable CVD risk scores.,2018,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2765639,22,5,1637-1647,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Machine Learning and Aged and Area Under Curve and Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology and Databases, Factual and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/*epidemiology and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Neural Networks, Computer and Risk Assessment",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chen_2019_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Detecting Hypoglycemia Incidents Reported in Patients' Secure Messages: Using Cost-Sensitive Learning and Oversampling to Reduce Data Imbalance,"Chen, Jinying and Lalor, John and Liu, Weisong and Druhl, Emily and Granillo, Edgard and Vimalananda, Varsha G. and Yu, Hong",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Improper dosing of medications such as insulin can cause hypoglycemic episodes, which may lead to severe morbidity or even death. Although secure messaging was designed for exchanging nonurgent messages, patients sometimes report hypoglycemia events through secure messaging. Detecting these patient-reported adverse events may help alert clinical teams and enable early corrective actions to improve patient safety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a natural language processing system, called HypoDetect (Hypoglycemia Detector), to automatically identify hypoglycemia incidents reported in patients' secure messages. METHODS: An expert in public health annotated 3000 secure message threads between patients with diabetes and US Department of Veterans Affairs clinical teams as containing patient-reported hypoglycemia incidents or not. A physician independently annotated 100 threads randomly selected from this dataset to determine interannotator agreement. We used this dataset to develop and evaluate HypoDetect. HypoDetect incorporates 3 machine learning algorithms widely used for text classification: linear support vector machines, random forest, and logistic regression. We explored different learning features, including new knowledge-driven features. Because only 114 (3.80%) messages were annotated as positive, we investigated cost-sensitive learning and oversampling methods to mitigate the challenge of imbalanced data. RESULTS: The interannotator agreement was Cohen kappa=.976. Using cross-validation, logistic regression with cost-sensitive learning achieved the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.954, sensitivity=0.693, specificity 0.974, F1 score=0.590). Cost-sensitive learning and the ensembled synthetic minority oversampling technique improved the sensitivity of the baseline systems substantially (by 0.123 to 0.728 absolute gains). Our results show that a variety of features contributed to the best performance of HypoDetect. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenge of data imbalance, HypoDetect achieved promising results for the task of detecting hypoglycemia incidents from secure messages.

Thus, health-related events, such as activities of daily living (ADLs; eg, mobility patterns, feeding, sleeping, ...) can be captured without patients' active participation. We designed a system to detect changes in the mobility patterns based on the smartphone's native sensors and advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques. OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this work is to assess the feasibility of detecting mobility pattern changes in a sample of outpatients with depression using the smartphone's sensors. The proposed method processed the data acquired by the smartphone using an unsupervised detection technique. METHODS: In this study, 38 outpatients from the Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz Psychiatry Department (Madrid, Spain) participated. The Evidence-Based Behavior (eB(2)) app was downloaded by patients on the day of recruitment and configured with the assistance of a physician. The app captured the following data: inertial sensors, physical activity, phone calls and message logs, app usage, nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, and location. We applied a change-point detection technique to location data on a sample of 9 outpatients recruited between April 6, 2017 and December 14, 2017. The change-point detection was based only on location information, but the eB(2) platform allowed for an easy integration of additional data. The app remained running in the background on patients' smartphone during the study participation. RESULTS: The principal outcome measure was the identification of mobility pattern changes based on an unsupervised detection technique applied to the smartphone's native sensors data. Here, results from 5 patients' records are presented as a case series. The eB(2) system detected specific mobility pattern changes according to the patients' activity, which may be used as indicators of behavioral and clinical state changes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed technique could automatically detect changes in the mobility patterns of outpatients who took part in this study. Assuming these mobility pattern changes correlated with behavioral changes, we have developed a technique that may identify possible relapses or clinical changes. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the detected changes are not always related to relapses and that some clinical changes cannot be detected by the proposed method.",2018,10.2196/mhealth.9472,6,12,e197,eng,2291-5222,behavioral changes and data mining and mental disorders and sensors and wearables,NA,NA,2018/12/10/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shen_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Using Reports of Symptoms and Diagnoses on Social Media to Predict COVID-19 Case Counts in Mainland China: Observational Infoveillance Study,"Shen, Cuihua and Chen, Anfan and Luo, Chen and Zhang, Jingwen and Feng, Bo and Liao, Wang",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify ""sick posts,"" in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.",2020,10.2196/19421,22,5,e19421,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Public Health Surveillance and Betacoronavirus and China and China/epidemiology and Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology and COVID-19 and Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data and disease surveillance and Humans and infectious disease and infodemiology and Information Dissemination and infoveillance and novel coronavirus and Pandemics and Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology and Public Health/*methods and SARS-CoV-2 and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and surveillance and Weibo",NA,NA,2020/05/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jacobson_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Digital Biomarkers of Social Anxiety Severity: Digital Phenotyping Using Passive Smartphone Sensors,"Jacobson, Nicholas C. and Summers, Berta and Wilhelm, Sabine",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset. METHODS: In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity. RESULTS: The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect.",2020,10.2196/16875,22,5,e16875,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*biomarkers and *machine learning and *mobile phone and *social anxiety and *social anxiety disorder and *technology assessment, biomedical and Adolescent and Adult and biomarkers and Biomarkers/*metabolism and Female and Humans and machine learning and Male and mobile phone and Phobia, Social/*psychology and Smartphone/*instrumentation and social anxiety and social anxiety disorder and technology assessment, biomedical and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/05/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, only limited data and results have been published that demonstrate accuracy in target indications, real-world feasibility, or the validity and value of these novel approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish accuracy, feasibility, and validity of continuous digital monitoring of walking speed in frail, elderly patients with sarcopenia and to create an open source repository of raw, derived, and reference data as a resource for the community. METHODS: Data described here were collected as a part of 2 clinical studies: an independent, noninterventional validation study and a phase 2b interventional clinical trial in older adults with sarcopenia. In both studies, participants were monitored by using a waist-worn inertial sensor. The cross-sectional, independent validation study collected data at a single site from 26 naturally slow-walking elderly subjects during a parcours course through the clinic, designed to simulate a real-world environment. In the phase 2b interventional clinical trial, 217 patients with sarcopenia were recruited across 32 sites globally, where patients were monitored over 25 weeks, both during and between visits. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that our approach can capture in-clinic gait speed in frail slow-walking adults with a residual standard error of 0.08 m per second in the independent validation study and 0.08, 0.09, and 0.07 m per second for the 4 m walk test (4mWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), and 400 m walk test (400mWT) standard gait speed assessments, respectively, in the interventional clinical trial. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by capturing 9668 patient-days of real-world data from 192 patients and 32 sites, as part of the interventional clinical trial. We derived inferred contextual information describing the length of a given walking bout and uncovered positive associations between the short 4mWT gait speed assessment and gait speed in bouts between 5 and 20 steps (correlation of 0.23) and longer 6MWT and 400mWT assessments with bouts of 80 to 640 steps (correlations of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed, for the first time, accurate capture of real-world gait speed in slow-walking older adults with sarcopenia. We demonstrated the feasibility of long-term digital monitoring of mobility in geriatric populations, establishing that sufficient data can be collected to allow robust monitoring of gait behaviors outside the clinic, even in the absence of feedback or incentives. Using inferred context, we demonstrated the ecological validity of in-clinic gait assessments, describing positive associations between in-clinic performance and real-world walking behavior.

However, most extant telehealth systems employ individual data sources by offline data processing, which may not recognize health deterioration in a timely way. OBJECTIVE: Our study objective was two-fold: to design and implement an integrated, personalized telehealth system on a community-based level; and to evaluate the system from the perspective of user acceptance. METHODS: The system was designed to capture and record older adults' health-related information (eg, daily activities, continuous vital signs, and gait behaviors) through multiple measuring tools. State-of-the-art data mining techniques can be integrated to detect statistically significant changes in daily records, based on which a decision support system could emit warnings to older adults, their family members, and their caregivers for appropriate interventions to prevent further health deterioration. A total of 45 older adults recruited from 3 elderly care centers in Hong Kong were instructed to use the system for 3 months. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to summarize the collected datasets. For system evaluation, we used a customized acceptance questionnaire to examine users' attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention on the system. RESULTS: A total of 179 follow-up sessions were conducted in the 3 elderly care centers. The results of exploratory data analysis showed some significant differences in the participants' daily records and vital signs (eg, steps, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure) among the 3 centers. The participants perceived that using the system is a good idea (ie, attitude: mean 5.67, SD 1.06), comfortable (ie, self-efficacy: mean 4.92, SD 1.11), useful to improve their health (ie, perceived usefulness: mean 4.99, SD 0.91), and easy to use (ie, perceived ease of use: mean 4.99, SD 1.00). In general, the participants showed a positive intention to use the first version of our personalized telehealth system in their future health management (ie, behavioral intention: mean 4.45, SD 1.78). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed health monitoring system provides an example design for monitoring older adults' health status based on multiple data sources, which can help develop reliable and accurate predictive analytics. The results can serve as a guideline for researchers and stakeholders (eg, policymakers, elderly care centers, and health care providers) who provide care for older adults through such a telehealth system.",2020,10.2196/19223,22,9,e19223,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*digital biomarkers and *digital phenotyping and *elderly population and *falls detection and *fitness tracker and *personalized health and *sensors and *technology acceptance and *telehealth monitoring and *wearables and Aged and Aging and digital biomarkers and digital phenotyping and elderly population and falls detection and Female and fitness tracker and Hong Kong and Humans and Independent Living/*standards and Male and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods and personalized health and Precision Medicine/*methods and sensors and technology acceptance and telehealth monitoring and Telemedicine/methods and wearables",NA,NA,2020/09/30/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a scoping review to characterize clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that generate new knowledge to provide guidance for such cases in real time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, and IEEE Xplore were searched up to May 2020. The abstracts were screened by 2 reviewers. Full texts of the relevant articles were reviewed by the first author and approved by the second reviewer, accompanied by the screening of articles' references. The details of design, implementation and evaluation of included CDSSs were extracted. RESULTS: Our search returned 3427 articles, 53 of which describing 25 CDSSs were selected. We identified 8 expert-based and 17 data-driven tools. Sixteen (64%) tools were developed in the United States, with the others mostly in Europe. Most of the tools (n = 16, 64%) were implemented in 1 site, with only 5 being actively used in clinical practice. Patient or quality outcomes were assessed for 3 (18%) CDSSs, 4 (16%) underwent user acceptance or usage testing and 7 (28%) functional testing. CONCLUSIONS: We found a number of CDSSs that generate new knowledge, although only 1 addressed confounding and bias. Overall, the tools lacked demonstration of their utility.

P. and Dorn, Jonas F. and Dorier, Alexis and Kamm, Christian P. and Steinheimer, Saskia and Dahlke, Frank and Uitdehaag, Bernard M. J. and Kappos, Ludwig and Johnson, Matthew",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: In chronic neurological diseases, especially in multiple sclerosis (MS), clinical assessment of motor dysfunction is crucial to monitor the disease in patients. Traditional scales are not sensitive enough to detect slight changes. Video recordings of patient performance are more accurate and increase the reliability of severity ratings. When these recordings are automated, quantitative disability assessments by machine learning algorithms can be created. Creation of these algorithms involves non-health care professionals, which is a challenge for maintaining data privacy. However, autoencoders can address this issue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test whether coded frame vectors of autoencoders contain relevant information for analyzing videos of the motor performance of patients with MS. METHODS: In this study, 20 pre-rated videos of patients performing the finger-to-nose test were recorded. An autoencoder created encoded frame vectors from the original videos and decoded the videos again. The original and decoded videos were shown to 10 neurologists at an academic MS center in Basel, Switzerland. The neurologists tested whether the 200 videos were human-readable after decoding and rated the severity grade of each original and decoded video according to the Neurostatus-Expanded Disability Status Scale definitions of limb ataxia. Furthermore, the neurologists tested whether ratings were equivalent between the original and decoded videos. RESULTS: In total, 172 of 200 (86.0%) videos were of sufficient quality to be ratable. The intrarater agreement between the original and decoded videos was 0.317 (Cohen weighted kappa). The average difference in the ratings between the original and decoded videos was 0.26, in which the original videos were rated as more severe. The interrater agreement between the original videos was 0.459 and that between the decoded videos was 0.302. The agreement was higher when no deficits or very severe deficits were present. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of videos (172/200, 86.0%) decoded by the autoencoder contained clinically relevant information and had fair intrarater agreement with the original videos. Autoencoders are a potential method for enabling the use of patient videos while preserving data privacy, especially when non-health-care professionals are involved.",2020,10.2196/16669,22,5,e16669,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*autoencoder and *deep neuronal network and *Disability Evaluation and *machine learning algorithms and *Neurostatus-EDSS and *video-rating and Adult and Aged and autoencoder and Confidentiality/*standards and deep neuronal network and Disabled Persons/*rehabilitation and Female and Humans and machine learning algorithms and Male and Middle Aged and Neurostatus-EDSS and Proof of Concept Study and Reproducibility of Results and Video Recording/*methods and video-rating,NA,NA,2020/05/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wang_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Eliciting and receiving online support: using computer-aided content analysis to examine the dynamics of online social support,"Wang, Yi-Chia and Kraut, Robert E. and Levine, John M.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Although many people with serious diseases participate in online support communities, little research has investigated how participants elicit and provide social support on these sites. OBJECTIVE: The first goal was to propose and test a model of the dynamic process through which participants in online support communities elicit and provide emotional and informational support. The second was to demonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational data using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating results derived from human-coded data about how people elicit support and (2) by answering questions that are intractable with small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure to different types of social support predicts continued participation in online support communities. The third was to provide a detailed description of these machine learning techniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale data analysis in these communities. METHODS: Communication among approximately 90,000 registered users of an online cancer support community was analyzed. The corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional and informational support. Their judgments were used to train machine learning models that automatically estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in the messages. Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65. RESULTS: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate relationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of emotional and informational support in the first reply. Self-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001), negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In contrast, asking questions increased informational support (beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive informational self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003). Self-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs, which elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led to the perception of informational needs, which elicited informational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that exposure to more emotional support predicted staying in the group longer 33% (hazard ratio=0.67, P<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support predicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-disclosure is effective in eliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is effective in eliciting informational support. Moreover, perceptions that people desire particular kinds of support influence the support they receive. Finally, the type of support people receive affects the likelihood of their staying in or leaving the group. These results demonstrate the utility of machine learning methods for investigating the dynamics of social support exchange in online support communities.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3558,17,4,e99,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Internet and *Self Disclosure and *Social Support and Adult and Chronic Disease and emotions and Emotions and Female and health communication and Humans and Interpersonal Relations and Male and natural language processing and Neoplasms/psychology and self-disclosure and Self-Help Groups/*organization & administration/trends and social media and social support and support groups,NA,NA,2015/04/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Khundaqji_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Smart Shirts for Monitoring Physiological Parameters: Scoping Review,"Khundaqji, Hamzeh and Hing, Wayne and Furness, James and Climstein, Mike",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: The recent trends of technological innovation and widescale digitization as potential solutions to challenges in health care, sports, and emergency service operations have led to the conception of smart textile technology. In health care, these smart textile systems present the potential to aid preventative medicine and early diagnosis through continuous, noninvasive tracking of physical and mental health while promoting proactive involvement of patients in their medical management. In areas such as sports and emergency response, the potential to provide comprehensive and simultaneous physiological insights across multiple body systems is promising. However, it is currently unclear what type of evidence exists surrounding the use of smart textiles for the monitoring of physiological outcome measures across different settings. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to systematically survey the existing body of scientific literature surrounding smart textiles in their most prevalent form, the smart shirt, for monitoring physiological outcome measures. METHODS: A total of 5 electronic bibliographic databases were systematically searched (Ovid Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and SPORTDiscus). Publications from the inception of the database to June 24, 2019 were reviewed. Nonindexed literature relevant to this review was also systematically searched. The results were then collated, summarized, and reported. RESULTS: Following the removal of duplicates, 7871 citations were identified. On the basis of title and abstract screening, 7632 citations were excluded, whereas 239 were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 101 citations were included in the final analysis. Included studies were categorized into four themes: (1) prototype design, (2) validation, (3) observational, and (4) reviews. Among the 101 analyzed studies, prototype design was the most prevalent theme (50/101, 49.5%), followed by validation (29/101, 28.7%), observational studies (21/101, 20.8%), and reviews (1/101, 0.1%). Presented prototype designs ranged from those capable of monitoring one physiological metric to those capable of monitoring several simultaneously. In 29 validation studies, 16 distinct smart shirts were validated against reference technology under various conditions and work rates, including rest, submaximal exercise, and maximal exercise. The identified observational studies used smart shirts in clinical, healthy, and occupational populations for aims such as early diagnosis and stress detection. One scoping review was identified, investigating the use of smart shirts for electrocardiograph signal monitoring in cardiac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although smart shirts have been found to be valid and reliable in the monitoring of specific physiological metrics, results were variable for others, demonstrating the need for further systematic validation. Analysis of the results has also demonstrated gaps in knowledge, such as a considerable lag of validation and observational studies in comparison with prototype design and limited investigation using smart shirts in pediatric, elite sports, and emergency service populations.",2020,10.2196/18092,8,5,e18092,eng,2291-5222,*biomedical technology and *clinical decision making and *Electrocardiography and *exercise and *Exercise and *fitness trackers and *physiology and *sports and *telemedicine and *vital signs and *wearable electronic devices and biomedical technology and Child and clinical decision making and exercise and fitness trackers and Humans and physiology and sports and Technology and telemedicine and vital signs and wearable electronic devices,NA,NA,2020/05/27/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Changes in technology have provided considerable opportunities for KT strategies to improve access and use of evidence in decision making by public health policy makers and practitioners. Despite this opportunity, there have been no reviews that have assessed the effects of digital technology-enabled KT (TEKT) in the field of public health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies in (1) improving the capacity for evidence-based decision making by public health policy makers and practitioners, (2) changing public health policy or practice, and (3) changes in individual or population health outcomes. METHODS: A search strategy was developed to identify randomized trials assessing the effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies in public health. Any primary research study with a randomized trial design was eligible. Searches for eligible studies were undertaken in multiple electronic bibliographic databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and Scopus) and the reference lists of included studies. A hand search of 2 journals (Implementation Science and Journal of Medical Internet Research) and a gray literature search were also conducted. Pairs of independent review authors screened studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data from relevant studies. RESULTS: Of the 6819 citations screened, 8 eligible randomized trials were included in the review. The studies examined the impact of digital TEKT strategies on health professionals, including nurses, child care health consultants, physiotherapists, primary health care workers, and public health practitioners. Overall, 5 of the interventions were web-training programs. The remaining 3 interventions included simulation games, access to digital resource materials and the use of tailored messaging, and a web-based registry. The findings suggest that digital TEKT interventions may be effective in improving the knowledge of public health professionals, relative to control, and may be as effective as a face-to-face KT approach. The effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies relative to a control or other digital KT interventions on measures of health professional self-efficacy to use evidence to enhance practice behavior or behavioral intention outcomes was mixed. The evidence regarding the effects on changes to health policy or practice following exposure to digital TEKT was mixed. No trials assessed the effects on individual or population-level health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first to synthesize the effectiveness of digital TEKT interventions in a public health setting. Despite its potential, relatively few trials have been undertaken to investigate the impacts of digital TEKT interventions. The findings suggest that although a digital TEKT intervention may improve knowledge, the effects of such interventions on other outcomes are equivocal.",2020,10.2196/17274,22,7,e17274,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*knowledge translation and *public health and Child and Female and Humans and knowledge translation and Male and Prospective Studies and public health and Public Health/*methods and Translational Medical Research/*methods and Translational Research, Biomedical/*methods",NA,NA,2020/07/31/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESULTS: We describe a ""Medical Science DMZ"" concept as an option for secure, high-volume transport of large, sensitive data sets between research institutions over national research networks. DISCUSSION: The exponentially increasing amounts of ""omics"" data, the rapid increase of high-quality imaging, and other rapidly growing clinical data sets have resulted in the rise of biomedical research ""big data."" The storage, analysis, and network resources required to process these data and integrate them into patient diagnoses and treatments have grown to scales that strain the capabilities of academic health centers. Some data are not generated locally and cannot be sustained locally, and shared data repositories such as those provided by the National Library of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and international partners such as the European Bioinformatics Institute are rapidly growing. The ability to store and compute using these data must therefore be addressed by a combination of local, national, and industry resources that exchange large data sets. Maintaining data-intensive flows that comply with HIPAA and other regulations presents a new challenge for biomedical research. Recognizing this, we describe a strategy that marries performance and security by borrowing from and redefining the concept of a ""Science DMZ""-a framework that is used in physical sciences and engineering research to manage high-capacity data flows.

Existing research has identified important, seemingly simple precautions that could significantly reduce preterm birth risk. However, it has proven difficult to communicate even these simple recommendations to women in need of them. Our objective was to draw on methods from behavioral decision research to develop a personalized smartphone app-based medical communication tool to assess and communicate pregnancy risks related to preterm birth. OBJECTIVE: A longitudinal, prospective pilot study was designed to develop an engaging, usable smartphone app that communicates personalized pregnancy risk and gathers risk data, with the goal of decreasing preterm birth rates in a typically hard-to-engage patient population. METHODS: We used semistructured interviews and user testing to develop a smartphone app based on an approach founded in behavioral decision research. For usability evaluation, 16 participants were recruited from the outpatient clinic at a major academic hospital specializing in high-risk pregnancies and provided a smartphone with the preloaded app and a digital weight scale. Through the app, participants were queried daily to assess behavioral risks, mood, and symptomology associated with preterm birth risk. Participants also completed monthly phone interviews to report technical problems and their views on the app's usefulness. RESULTS: App use was higher among participants at higher risk, as reflected in reporting poorer daily moods (Odds ratio, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99-1.47, P=.08), being more likely to smoke (OR 4.00, 95% CI 0.93-16.9, P=.06), being earlier in their pregnancy (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, P=.005), and having a lower body mass index (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.15, P=.05). Participant-reported intention to breastfeed increased from baseline to the end of the trial, t15=-2.76, P=.01. Participants' attendance at prenatal appointments was 84% compared with the clinic norm of 50%, indicating a conservatively estimated cost savings of ~US $450/patient over 3 months.

Blakemore_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Equipping Learners to Evaluate Online Health Care Resources: Longitudinal Study of Learning Design Strategies in a Health Care Massive Open Online Course,"Blakemore, Louise M. and Meek, Sarah E. M. and Marks, Leah K.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The digital revolution has led to a boom in the number of available online health care resources. To navigate these resources successfully, digital literacy education is required. Learners who can evaluate the reliability and validity of online health care information are likely to be more effective at avoiding potentially dangerous misinformation. In addition to providing health care education, massive open online courses (MOOCs) are well positioned to play a role in providing digital literacy education in this context. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on learners enrolled in a MOOC on cancer genomics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a series of digital literacy-related activities within this course. This was an iterative study, with changes made to digital literacy-related activities in 4 of the 8 runs of the course. METHODS: This mixed methods study focused on learner engagement with the digital literacy-related activities, including the final course written assignment. Quantitative data including the number of references listed in each written assignment were compared between successive runs. Qualitative data in the form of learner comments on discussion forums for digital literacy-related tasks were evaluated to determine the impact of these educational activities. RESULTS: Using the number of references included for each final course assignment as an indicator of digital literacy skills, the digital literacy-related activities in the final 2 runs were judged to be the most successful. We found a statistically significant increase in the number of references cited by learners in their final written assignments. The average number of references cited in Run 8 was significantly higher (3.5) than in Run 1 (1.8) of the MOOC (P=.001). Learner comments in Runs 7 and 8 showed that a poll in which learners were asked to select which of 4 online resources was reliable was effective in stimulating learner discussion about how to evaluate resource reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to many health care MOOCs, the course studied here had a heterogeneous group of learners, including patients (and their families), the public, health care students, and practitioners. Carefully designing a range of digital literacy-related activities that would be beneficial to this heterogenous group of learners enabled learners to become more effective at evaluating and citing appropriate online resources within their written assignments.",2020,10.2196/15177,22,2,e15177,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*assessment and *digital health literacy and *digital literacy and *ehealth and *eHealth literacy and *health care education and *learning analytics and *misinformation and *MOOC and *plagiarism and assessment and digital health literacy and digital literacy and Education, Distance/*methods and Educational Measurement/*methods and ehealth and eHealth literacy and health care education and Humans and learning analytics and Longitudinal Studies and misinformation and MOOC and plagiarism and Reproducibility of Results",NA,NA,2020/02/26/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly in the medical field. There has been a gradual tendency to replace traditional diagnosis and treatment with AI. IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) has been proven to be useful for decision-making in breast cancer and lung cancer, but to date, research on gastric cancer is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the concordance of WFO with MDT and investigated the impact on patient prognosis. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed eligible patients (N=235) with gastric cancer who were evaluated by an MDT, received corresponding recommended treatment, and underwent follow-up. Thereafter, physicians inputted the information of all patients into WFO manually, and the results were compared with the treatment programs recommended by the MDT. If the MDT treatment program was classified as ""recommended"" or ""considered"" by WFO, we considered the results concordant. All patients were divided into a concordant group and a nonconcordant group according to whether the WFO and MDT treatment programs were concordant. The prognoses of the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall concordance of WFO and the MDT was 54.5% (128/235) in this study. The subgroup analysis found that concordance was less likely in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors than in patients with HER2-negative tumors (P=.02). Age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, differentiation type, and clinical stage were not found to affect concordance. Among all patients, the survival time was significantly better in concordant patients than in nonconcordant patients (P<.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that concordance was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with gastric cancer (hazard ratio 0.312 [95% CI 0.187-0.521]). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment recommendations made by WFO and the MDT were mostly concordant in gastric cancer patients. If the WFO options are updated to include local treatment programs, the concordance will greatly improve. The HER2 status of patients with gastric cancer had a strong effect on the likelihood of concordance. Generally, survival was better in concordant patients than in nonconcordant patients.",2020,10.2196/14122,22,2,e14122,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *concordance and *gastric cancer and *multidisciplinary team and *Watson for Oncology and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and artificial intelligence and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and concordance and Female and gastric cancer and Humans and Medical Oncology/*methods and Middle Aged and multidisciplinary team and Patient Care Team/*standards and Prognosis and Retrospective Studies and Stomach Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Watson for Oncology and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/02/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous machine learning models mostly ignore relations between different types of clinical data (ie, laboratory components, International Classification of Diseases codes, and medications). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model such relations and build predictive models using the EHR data from intensive care units. We developed innovative neural network models and compared them with the widely used logistic regression model and other state-of-the-art neural network models to predict the patient's mortality using their longitudinal EHR data. METHODS: We built a set of neural network models that we collectively called as long short-term memory (LSTM) outcome prediction using comprehensive feature relations or in short, CLOUT. Our CLOUT models use a correlational neural network model to identify a latent space representation between different types of discrete clinical features during a patient's encounter and integrate the latent representation into an LSTM-based predictive model framework. In addition, we designed an ablation experiment to identify risk factors from our CLOUT models. Using physicians' input as the gold standard, we compared the risk factors identified by both CLOUT and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Experiments on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III dataset (selected patient population: 7537) show that CLOUT (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.89) has surpassed logistic regression (0.82) and other baseline NN models (<0.86). In addition, physicians' agreement with the CLOUT-derived risk factor rankings was statistically significantly higher than the agreement with the logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the applicability of CLOUT for real-world clinical use in identifying patients at high risk of mortality.",2020,10.2196/16374,22,3,e16374,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*ablation and *neural networks and *patient mortality and *predictive modeling and *Validation Studies as Topic and ablation and Aged and Female and Humans and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and neural networks and patient mortality and predictive modeling and Prognosis and Risk Factors,NA,NA,2020/03/23/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

A personal health record app is used to manage medical data such as results from medical checkups, which facilitates decision making for medical personnel. However, an analysis of users' technology acceptance is required to provide appropriate services based on personal health record apps. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors influencing the behavioral intention of health experts and workers to use an app in workers' health centers and to examine differences in their perception of the main variables. METHODS: The study involved health experts and workers who visited 21 workers' health centers in Korea to verify a research model in which perceived risk was added to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a representative theory of information technology acceptance. After receiving ethical approval from the Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy, 1050 questionnaires were distributed over 7 weeks with cooperation of the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency. A multiple linear regression analysis and multigroup path analysis were performed to verify the hypotheses, and independent samples t tests were performed to analyze differences between workers' and health experts' perception of the main variables. RESULTS: The analysis included data from 866 respondents (687 workers and 179 health experts). Effort expectancy (beta=.08, P=.03), social influence (beta=.43, P<.001), performance expectancy (beta=.07, P=.008), and facilitating conditions (beta=.13, P<.001) exerted significant positive effects on behavioral intention, whereas perceived risk (beta=-.29, P<.001) exerted a significant negative effect on behavioral intention. Performance expectancy had a significant effect on path differences depending on gender (critical ratio=-3.38) and age (critical ratio=1.97). Workers' mean scores for the main variables were higher relative to those of health experts for all remaining variables except perceived risk, and significant differences were observed for all remaining variables except facilitating condition. CONCLUSIONS: Social influence exerted the strongest effect on behavioral intention to use the personal health record app. Consequently, it is necessary to coordinate health promotion activities in the workplace as well as the operational direction of community institutions such as in workers' health centers to allow workers to manage their own health via continuous use of the app. In addition, the app should be developed based on a requirement analysis of the balance between both interest groups in consideration of differences in perspective between consumers and service providers.",2020,10.2196/16723,8,6,e16723,eng,2291-5222,"*Health Records, Personal and *perceived risk and *personal health record app and *unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and *Workplace and *workplace health promotion and Cross-Sectional Studies and Female and Health Promotion and Humans and Male and perceived risk and personal health record app and Republic of Korea and Surveys and Questionnaires and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and workplace health promotion",NA,NA,2020/06/04/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shah_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automatically Appraising the Credibility of Vaccine-Related Web Pages Shared on Social Media: A Twitter Surveillance Study,"Shah, Zubair and Surian, Didi and Dyda, Amalie and Coiera, Enrico and Mandl, Kenneth D. and Dunn, Adam G.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are time-consuming to apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their use for quickly identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation as it emerges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of vaccine-related Twitter posts linked to Web pages of low credibility and measure the potential reach of those posts. METHODS: Sampling from 143,003 unique vaccine-related Web pages shared on Twitter between January 2017 and March 2018, we used a 7-point checklist adapted from validated tools and guidelines to manually appraise the credibility of 474 Web pages. These were used to train several classifiers (random forests, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks) using the text from a Web page to predict whether the information satisfies each of the 7 criteria. Estimating the credibility of all other Web pages, we used the follower network to estimate potential exposures relative to a credibility score defined by the 7-point checklist. RESULTS: The best-performing classifiers were able to distinguish between low, medium, and high credibility with an accuracy of 78% and labeled low-credibility Web pages with a precision of over 96%. Across the set of unique Web pages, 11.86% (16,961 of 143,003) were estimated as low credibility and they generated 9.34% (1.64 billion of 17.6 billion) of potential exposures. The 100 most popular links to low credibility Web pages were each potentially seen by an estimated 2 million to 80 million Twitter users globally. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that although a small minority of low-credibility Web pages reach a large audience, low-credibility Web pages tend to reach fewer users than other Web pages overall and are more commonly shared within certain subpopulations. An automatic credibility appraisal tool may be useful for finding communities of users at higher risk of exposure to low-credibility vaccine communications.",2019,10.2196/14007,21,11,e14007,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*credibility appraisal and *health misinformation and *machine learning and *social media and credibility appraisal and Epidemiological Monitoring and health misinformation and Humans and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Retrospective Studies and social media and Social Media/*standards and Social Networking and Vaccines/*supply & distribution,NA,NA,2019/11/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bey_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Fold-stratified cross-validation for unbiased and privacy-preserving federated learning,"Bey, Romain and Goussault, Romain and Grolleau, Francois and Benchoufi, Mehdi and Porcher, Raphael",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: We introduce fold-stratified cross-validation, a validation methodology that is compatible with privacy-preserving federated learning and that prevents data leakage caused by duplicates of electronic health records (EHRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fold-stratified cross-validation complements cross-validation with an initial stratification of EHRs in folds containing patients with similar characteristics, thus ensuring that duplicates of a record are jointly present either in training or in validation folds. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the properties of fold-stratified cross-validation in the case of a model data analysis using both synthetic data and MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) medical records. RESULTS: In situations in which duplicated EHRs could induce overoptimistic estimations of accuracy, applying fold-stratified cross-validation prevented this bias, while not requiring full deduplication. However, a pessimistic bias might appear if the covariate used for the stratification was strongly associated with the outcome. DISCUSSION: Although fold-stratified cross-validation presents low computational overhead, to be efficient it requires the preliminary identification of a covariate that is both shared by duplicated records and weakly associated with the outcome. When available, the hash of a personal identifier or a patient's date of birth provides such a covariate. On the contrary, pseudonymization interferes with fold-stratified cross-validation, as it may break the equality of the stratifying covariate among duplicates. CONCLUSION: Fold-stratified cross-validation is an easy-to-implement methodology that prevents data leakage when a model is trained on distributed EHRs that contain duplicates, while preserving privacy.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa096,27,8,1244-1251,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*Algorithms and *Confidentiality and *Data Anonymization and *data leakage and *duplicated electronic health records and *Electronic Health Records and *federated learning and *Machine Learning and *privacy and *validation and Computer Security and data leakage and duplicated electronic health records and federated learning and Humans and privacy and validation,NA,NA,2020/08/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability and explore the effectiveness of a novel mHealth app to assist Aboriginal people to quit smoking. METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) and process evaluation comprising usage analytics data and in-depth interviews was conducted. Current Aboriginal smokers (>16 years old), who were willing to make a quit attempt in the next month, were recruited from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and a government telephone coaching service. The intervention was a multifaceted Android or iOS app comprising a personalized profile and quit plan, text and in-app motivational messages, and a challenge feature allowing users to compete with others. The comparator was usual cessation support services. Outcome data collection and analysis were conducted blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence verified by carbon monoxide breath testing at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included point prevalence of abstinence and use of smoking cessation therapies and services. RESULTS: A total of 49 participants were recruited. Competing service delivery priorities, the lack of resources for research, and lack of support for randomization to a control group were the major recruitment barriers. At baseline, 23/49 (47%) of participants had tried to quit in recent weeks. At 6-month follow-up, only 1 participant (intervention arm) was abstinent. The process evaluation highlighted low to moderate app usage (3-10 new users per month and 4-8 returning users per month), an average of 2.9 sessions per user per month and 6.3 min per session. Key themes from interviews with intervention participants (n=15) included the following: (1) the powerful influence of prevailing social norms around acceptability of smoking; (2) high usage of mobile devices for phone, text, and social media but very low use of other smartphone apps; (3) the role of family and social group support in supporting quit attempts; and (4) low awareness and utilization of smoking cessation support services. Despite the broad acceptability of the app, participants also recommended technical improvements to improve functionality, greater customization of text messages, integration with existing social media platforms, and gamification features. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation apps need to be integrated with commonly used functions of mobile phones and draw on social networks to support their use. Although they have the potential to increase utilization of cessation support services and treatments, more research is needed to identify optimal implementation models. Robust evaluation is critical to determine their impact; however, an RCT design may not be feasible in this setting.

Our objectives are to present a methodological review of social media-based PM abuse or misuse monitoring studies, and to propose a potential generalizable, data-centric processing pipeline for the curation of data from this resource. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified studies involving social media, PMs, and misuse or abuse (inclusion criteria) from Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We categorized studies based on multiple characteristics including but not limited to data size; social media source(s); medications studied; and primary objectives, methods, and findings. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies met our inclusion criteria, with 31 (<e2><88><bc>79.5%) published since 2015. Twitter has been the most popular resource, with Reddit and Instagram gaining popularity recently. Early studies focused mostly on manual, qualitative analyses, with a growing trend toward the use of data-centric methods involving natural language processing and machine learning. DISCUSSION: There is a paucity of standardized, data-centric frameworks for curating social media data for task-specific analyses and near real-time surveillance of nonmedical PM use. Many existing studies do not quantify human agreements for manual annotation tasks or take into account the presence of noise in data.

Niklas and Rusyn, Ivan and Edwards, Ralph and Tropsha, Alexander",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models can predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and thus provide early warnings of potential hazards. Timely identification of potential safety concerns could protect patients and aid early diagnosis of ADRs among the exposed. Our objective was to determine whether global spontaneous reporting patterns might allow chemical substructures associated with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) to be identified and utilized for ADR prediction by QSAR models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a reference set of 364 drugs having positive or negative reporting correlations with SJS in the VigiBase global repository of individual case safety reports (Uppsala Monitoring Center, Uppsala, Sweden), chemical descriptors were computed from drug molecular structures. Random Forest and Support Vector Machines methods were used to develop QSAR models, which were validated by external 5-fold cross validation. Models were employed for virtual screening of DrugBank to predict SJS actives and inactives, which were corroborated using knowledge bases like VigiBase, ChemoText, and MicroMedex (Truven Health Analytics Inc, Ann Arbor, Michigan). RESULTS: We developed QSAR models that could accurately predict if drugs were associated with SJS (area under the curve of 75%-81%). Our 10 most active and inactive predictions were substantiated by SJS reports (or lack thereof) in the literature. DISCUSSION: Interpretation of QSAR models in terms of significant chemical descriptors suggested novel SJS structural alerts.

Subotin_2016_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,A method for modeling co-occurrence propensity of clinical codes with application to ICD-10-PCS auto-coding,"Subotin, Michael and Davis, Anthony R.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing methods for medical auto-coding, or automatic generation of medical billing codes from electronic health records, generally assign each code independently of the others. They may thus assign codes for closely related procedures or diagnoses to the same document, even when they do not tend to occur together in practice, simply because the right choice can be difficult to infer from the clinical narrative. METHODS: We propose a method that injects awareness of the propensities for code co-occurrence into this process. First, a model is trained to estimate the conditional probability that one code is assigned by a human coder, given than another code is known to have been assigned to the same document. Then, at runtime, an iterative algorithm is used to apply this model to the output of an existing statistical auto-coder to modify the confidence scores of the codes. RESULTS: We tested this method in combination with a primary auto-coder for International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10 procedure codes, achieving a 12% relative improvement in F-score over the primary auto-coder baseline.

Tates_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Effect of Screen-to-Screen Versus Face-to-Face Consultation on Doctor-Patient Communication: An Experimental Study with Simulated Patients,"Tates, Kiek and Antheunis, Marjolijn L. and Kanters, Saskia and Nieboer, Theodoor E. and Gerritse, Maria Be",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Despite the emergence of Web-based patient-provider contact, it is still unclear how the quality of Web-based doctor-patient interactions differs from face-to-face interactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine (1) the impact of a consultation medium on doctors' and patients' communicative behavior in terms of information exchange, interpersonal relationship building, and shared decision making and (2) the mediating role of doctors' and patients' communicative behavior on satisfaction with both types of consultation medium. METHODS: Doctor-patient consultations on pelvic organ prolapse were simulated, both in a face-to-face and in a screen-to-screen (video) setting. Twelve medical interns and 6 simulated patients prepared 4 different written scenarios and were randomized to perform a total of 48 consultations. Effects of the consultations were measured by questionnaires that participants filled out directly after the consultation. RESULTS: With respect to patient-related outcomes, satisfaction, perceived information exchange, interpersonal relationship building, and perceived shared decision making showed no significant differences between face-to-face and screen-to-screen consultations. Patients' attitude toward Web-based communication (b=-.249, P=.02 and patients' perceived time and attention (b=.271, P=.03) significantly predicted patients' perceived interpersonal relationship building. Patients' perceived shared decision making was positively related to their satisfaction with the consultation (b=.254, P=.005). Overall, patients experienced significantly greater shared decision making with a female doctor (mean 4.21, SD 0.49) than with a male doctor (mean 3.66 [SD 0.73]; b=.401, P=.009). Doctor-related outcomes showed no significant differences in satisfaction, perceived information exchange, interpersonal relationship building, and perceived shared decision making between the conditions. There was a positive relationship between perceived information exchange and doctors' satisfaction with the consultation (b=.533, P<.001). Furthermore, doctors' perceived interpersonal relationship building was positively related to doctors' satisfaction with the consultation (b=.331, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the quality of doctor-patient communication, as indicated by information exchange, interpersonal relationship building, and shared decision making, did not differ significantly between Web-based and face-to-face consultations. Doctors and simulated patients were equally satisfied with both types of consultation medium, and no differences were found in the manner in which participants perceived communicative behavior during these consultations. The findings suggest that worries about a negative impact of Web-based video consultation on the quality of patient-provider consultations seem unwarranted as they offer the same interaction quality and satisfaction level as regular face-to-face consultations.",2017,10.2196/jmir.8033,19,12,e421,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Communication and *communication quality and *information exchange and *interpersonal relationship building and *patient satisfaction and *provider satisfaction and *shared decision making and *teleconsultation and Adult and communication quality and Decision Making and Female and Health Information Exchange and Humans and information exchange and Interpersonal Relations and interpersonal relationship building and Male and patient satisfaction and Patient Satisfaction and Patient Simulation and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and provider satisfaction and Referral and Consultation/*standards and shared decision making and teleconsultation and Young Adult,NA,NA,2017/12/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lee_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Generating sequential electronic health records using dual adversarial autoencoder,"Lee, Dongha and Yu, Hwanjo and Jiang, Xiaoqian and Rogith, Deevakar and Gudala, Meghana and Tejani, Mubeen and Zhang, Qiuchen and Xiong, Li",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies on electronic health records (EHRs) started to learn deep generative models and synthesize a huge amount of realistic records, in order to address significant privacy issues surrounding the EHR. However, most of them only focus on structured records about patients' independent visits, rather than on chronological clinical records. In this article, we aim to learn and synthesize realistic sequences of EHRs based on the generative autoencoder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a dual adversarial autoencoder (DAAE), which learns set-valued sequences of medical entities, by combining a recurrent autoencoder with 2 generative adversarial networks (GANs). DAAE improves the mode coverage and quality of generated sequences by adversarially learning both the continuous latent distribution and the discrete data distribution. Using the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) and UT Physicians clinical databases, we evaluated the performances of DAAE in terms of predictive modeling, plausibility, and privacy preservation. RESULTS: Our generated sequences of EHRs showed the comparable performances to real data for a predictive modeling task, and achieved the best score in plausibility evaluation conducted by medical experts among all baseline models. In addition, differentially private optimization of our model enables to generate synthetic sequences without increasing the privacy leakage of patients' data. CONCLUSIONS: DAAE can effectively synthesize sequential EHRs by addressing its main challenges: the synthetic records should be realistic enough not to be distinguished from the real records, and they should cover all the training patients to reproduce the performance of specific downstream tasks.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa119,27,9,1411-1419,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Computer Simulation and *differential privacy and *electornic health records (EHRs) and *Electronic Health Records and *generative adversarial networks (GANs) and *generative autoencoder and *Neural Networks, Computer and *sequential data generation and Confidentiality and differential privacy and electornic health records (EHRs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and generative autoencoder and Humans and Machine Learning and sequential data generation and Software",NA,NA,2020/07/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although online comparative health care information is widely available internationally, and patients have been shown to be interested in this information, its effect on patients' decision making is still limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patients' preferences regarding information presentation and their values concerning tailored comparative health care information. Meeting patients' information presentation needs might increase the perceived relevance and use of the information. METHODS: A total of 38 people participated in 4 focus groups. Comparative health care information about hip and knee replacement surgery was used as a case example. One part of the interview focused on patients' information presentation preferences, whereas the other part focused on patients' values of tailored information (ie, showing reviews of patients with comparable demographics). The qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: The following themes were deduced from the transcripts: number of health care providers to be presented, order in which providers are presented, relevancy of tailoring patient reviews, and concerns about tailoring. Participants' preferences differed concerning how many and in which order health care providers must be presented. Most participants had no interest in patient reviews that were shown for specific subgroups based on age, gender, or ethnicity. Concerns of tailoring were related to the representativeness of results and the complexity of information. A need for information about the medical specialist when choosing a hospital was stressed by several participants. CONCLUSIONS: The preferences for how comparative health care information should be presented differ between people. ""Information on demand"" and information about the medical specialist might be promising ways to increase the relevancy and use of online comparative health care information.

Low_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit During COVID-19: Observational Study,"Low, Daniel M. and Rumker, Laurie and Talkar, Tanya and Torous, John and Cecchi, Guillermo and Ghosh, Satrajit S.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non-mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. METHODS: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ""economic stress,"" ""isolation,"" and ""home,"" while others such as ""motion"" significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (Ï=-0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged. CONCLUSIONS: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.",2020,10.2196/22635,22,10,e22635,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*ADHD and *anxiety and *COVID-19 and *eating disorders and *infodemic and *infodemiology and *infoveillance and *mental health and *natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and *psychiatry and *Reddit and *social media and *suicidality and ADHD and Adolescent and Adult and anxiety and Anxiety/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology and Betacoronavirus and Borderline Personality Disorder/epidemiology/psychology and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology and COVID-19 and eating disorders and Female and Global Health and Humans and infodemic and infodemiology and infoveillance and Male and mental health and Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data and Middle Aged and natural language processing and Pandemics and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology and psychiatry and Reddit and SARS-CoV-2 and Self-Help Groups/*statistics & numerical data and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/psychology and Suicidal Ideation and suicidality and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/10/12/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Warin_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Global Research on Coronaviruses: An R Package,"Warin, Thierry",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: In these trying times, we developed an R package about bibliographic references on coronaviruses. Working with reproducible research principles based on open science, disseminating scientific information, providing easy access to scientific production on this particular issue, and offering a rapid integration in researchers' workflows may help save time in this race against the virus, notably in terms of public health. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to simplify the workflow of interested researchers, with multidisciplinary research in mind. With more than 60,500 medical bibliographic references at the time of publication, this package is among the largest about coronaviruses. METHODS: This package could be of interest to epidemiologists, researchers in scientometrics, biostatisticians, as well as data scientists broadly defined. This package collects references from PubMed and organizes the data in a data frame. We then built functions to sort through this collection of references. Researchers can also integrate the data into their pipeline and implement them in R within their code libraries. RESULTS: We provide a short use case in this paper based on a bibliometric analysis of the references made available by this package. Classification techniques can also be used to go through the large volume of references and allow researchers to save time on this part of their research. Network analysis can be used to filter the data set. Text mining techniques can also help researchers calculate similarity indices and help them focus on the parts of the literature that are relevant for their research. CONCLUSIONS: This package aims at accelerating research on coronaviruses. Epidemiologists can integrate this package into their workflow. It is also possible to add a machine learning layer on top of this package to model the latest advances in research about coronaviruses, as we update this package daily. It is also the only one of this size, to the best of our knowledge, to be built in the R language.",2020,10.2196/19615,22,8,e19615,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Betacoronavirus and *bibliometric and *coronavirus and *Coronavirus Infections and *COVID-19 and *infectious disease and *informatics and *Pandemics and *Pneumonia, Viral and *R package and *reference and *SARS-CoV-2 and *virus and bibliometric and coronavirus and COVID-19 and Humans and infectious disease and informatics and Language and Machine Learning and Publishing and PubMed and R package and reference and SARS-CoV-2 and virus",NA,NA,2020/08/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, low- and middle-income countries are still at the adoption-utilization stage. Evidence on mobile health has been described as a black box, with gaps in theoretical explanations that account for the ecosystem of health care and their effect on adoption mechanisms. Bliss4Midwives, a modular integrated diagnostic kit to support antenatal care service delivery, was piloted for 1 year in Northern Ghana. Although both users and beneficiaries valued Bliss4Midwives, results from the pilot showed wide variations in usage behavior and duration of use across project sites. OBJECTIVE: To strengthen the design and implementation of an improved prototype, the study objectives were two-fold: to identify causal factors underlying the variation in Bliss4Midwives usage behavior and understand how to overcome or leverage these in subsequent implementation cycles. METHODS: Using a multiple case study design, a realist evaluation of Bliss4Midwives was conducted. A total of 3 candidate program theories were developed and empirically tested in 6 health facilities grouped into low and moderate usage clusters. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed using realist thinking to build configurations that link intervention, context, actors, and mechanisms to program outcomes, by employing inductive and deductive reasoning. Nonparametric t test was used to compare the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of Bliss4Midwives between usage clusters. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences between the 2 usage clusters. Low to moderate adoption of Bliss4Midwives was better explained by fear, enthusiasm, and high expectations for service delivery, especially in the absence of alternatives. Recognition from pregnant women, peers, supervisors, and the program itself was a crucial mechanism for device utilization. Other supportive mechanisms included ownership, empowerment, motivation, and adaptive responses to the device, such as realignment and negotiation. Champion users displayed high adoption-utilization behavior in contexts of participative or authoritative supervision, yet used the device inconsistently. Intervention-related (technical challenges, device rotation, lack of performance feedback, and refresher training), context-related (staff turnover, competing priorities, and workload), and individual factors (low technological self-efficacy, baseline knowledge, and internal motivation) suppressed utilization mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: This study shed light on optimal conditions necessary for Bliss4Midwives to thrive in a complex social and organizational setting. Beyond usability and viability studies, advocates of innovative technologies for maternal care need to consider how implementation strategies and contextual factors, such as existing collaborations and supervision styles, trigger mechanisms that influence program outcomes. In addition to informing scale-up of the Bliss4Midwives prototype, our results highlight the need for interventions that are guided by research methods that account for complexity.",2018,10.2196/11468,6,12,e11468,eng,2291-5222,antenatal care and clinical decision support and Ghana and mHealth and program evaluation and systems analysis,NA,NA,2018/12/21/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hwang_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Exploring Abnormal Behavior Patterns of Online Users With Emotional Eating Behavior: Topic Modeling Study,"Hwang, Youjin and Kim, Hyung Jun and Choi, Hyung Jin and Lee, Joonhwan",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Emotional eating (EE) is one of the most significant symptoms of various eating disorders. It has been difficult to collect a large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies of this symptom have been conducted. To provide adequate support for online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system (PSS). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the behavior patterns of emotional eaters as the first step to designing a personalized intervention system. METHODS: The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze behavioral data on EE. Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit, were analyzed. This dataset included all posts and feedback from July 2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. In addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated. Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of 90.64% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users with EE behaviors. The expert group that labeled the dataset to train the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. The experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0). Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA. RESULTS: The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic: addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. The 5 main topics of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation, automatic bot feedback, and health information. The feedback topic distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior (overall P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors. We discovered the possibility of the LDA topic model as an exploratory user study method for abnormal behaviors in medical research. We also investigated the possibilities of ML- and topic modeling-based classifiers to automatically categorize text-based behavioral data, which could be applied to personalized medicine in future research.",2020,10.2196/15700,22,3,e15700,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*behavior analysis and *data-driven research and *eating disorder and *emotional eating and *Latent Dirichlet Allocation and *machine learning and *topic modeling and behavior analysis and data-driven research and eating disorder and emotional eating and Feeding and Eating Disorders/*psychology and Feeding Behavior/*psychology and Female and Humans and Latent Dirichlet Allocation and machine learning and Machine Learning/*standards and Male and Social Media/*standards and topic modeling,NA,NA,2020/03/31/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kim_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Decision Support Capabilities of Telemedicine in Emergency Prehospital Care: Systematic Review,"Kim, Yesul and Groombridge, Christopher and Romero, Lorena and Clare, Steven and Fitzgerald, Mark Christopher",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine offers a unique opportunity to improve coordination and administration for urgent patient care remotely. In an emergency setting, it has been used to support first responders by providing telephone or video consultation with specialists at hospitals and through the exchange of prehospital patient information. This technological solution is evolving rapidly, yet there is a concern that it is being implemented without a demonstrated clinical need and effectiveness as well as without a thorough economic evaluation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to systematically review whether the clinical outcomes achieved, as reported in the literature, favor telemedicine decision support for medical interventions during prehospital care. METHODS: This systematic review included peer-reviewed journal articles. Searches of 7 databases and relevant reviews were conducted. Eligibility criteria consisted of studies that covered telemedicine as data- and information-sharing and two-way teleconsultation platforms, with the objective of supporting medical decisions (eg, diagnosis, treatment, and receiving hospital decision) in a prehospital emergency setting. Simulation studies and studies that included pediatric populations were excluded. The procedures in this review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used for the assessment of risk of bias. The results were synthesized based on predefined aspects of medical decisions that are made in a prehospital setting, which include diagnostic decision support, receiving facility decisions, and medical directions for treatment. All data extractions were done by at least two reviewers independently. RESULTS: Out of 42 full-text reviews, 7 were found eligible. Diagnostic support and medical direction and decision for treatments were often reported. A key finding of this review was the high agreement between prehospital diagnoses via telemedicine and final in-hospital diagnoses, as supported by quantitative evidence. However, a majority of the articles described the clinical value of having access to remote experts without robust quantitative data. Most telemedicine solutions were evaluated within a feasibility or short-term preliminary study. In general, the results were positive for telemedicine use; however, biases, due to preintervention confounding factors and a lack of documentation on quality assurance and protocol for telemedicine activation, make it difficult to determine the direct effect on patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The information-sharing capacity of telemedicine enables access to remote experts to support medical decision making on scene or in prolonged field care. The influence of human and technology factors on patient care is poorly understood and documented.",2020,10.2196/18959,22,12,e18959,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*decision support and *emergency and *resuscitation and *telemedicine and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and decision support and emergency and Emergency Medical Services/*standards and Humans and resuscitation and telemedicine and Telemedicine/*methods,NA,NA,2020/12/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

The development of home telemonitoring systems has made possible to collect symptoms and physiological data in electronic records, boosting the development of decision support systems (DSSs). Current DSSs work with physiological measurements collected by means of several measuring and communication devices as well as with symptoms gathered by questionnaires submitted to COPD subjects. However, this contrasts with the advices provided by the World Health Organization and the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease that recommend to avoid invasive or complex daily measurements. For these reasons this manuscript presents a DSS detecting the onset of worrisome events in COPD subjects. It uses the hearth rate and the oxygen saturation, which can be collected via a pulse oximeter. The DSS consists in a binary finite state machine, whose training stage allows a subject specific personalization of the predictive model, triggering warnings, and alarms as the health status evolves over time. The experiments on data collected from 22 COPD patients tele-monitored at home for six months show that the system recognition performance is better than the one achieved by medical experts.

Korfiatis_2018_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,A New Ensemble Classification System For Fracture Zone Prediction Using Imbalanced Micro-CT Bone Morphometrical Data,"Korfiatis, Vasileios Ch and Tassani, Simone and Matsopoulos, George K. and Korfiatis, Vasileios C. and Tassani, Simone and Matsopoulos, George K.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Trabecular bone fractures constitute a major health issue for the modern societies, with the currently established prediction methods of fracture risk, such as bone mineral density (BMD), resulting in errors up to 40%. Fracture-zone prediction based on bone's microstructure has been recently proposed as an alternative prediction method of fracture risk. In this paper, a classification system (CS) for the automatic fracture-zone prediction based on an Ensemble of Imbalanced Learning methods is proposed, following the observation that the percentage of the actual fractured bone area is significantly smaller than the intact bone in the case of a fracture event. The sample is divided into Volumes of Interest (VOIs) of specific size and 29 morphometrical parameters are calculated from each VOI, which serve as input features for the CS in order for it to separate the input patterns in to two classes: fractured and nonfractured. To this end, two well-established Imbalanced Learning methods, namely Random Undersampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and two popular classification algorithms, namely Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines, are tested and combined accordingly, to provide the best possible performance on a dataset that contains 45 specimens' pre- and postfailure scans. The best combination is then compared with three well-established Ensembles of Imbalanced Learning methods, namely RUSBoost, UnderBagging and SMOTEBagging. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed CS outperforms the competition, scoring in some occasions more than 90% in G-Mean and Area under Curve metrics.

Rivas_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Mental Health-Related Behaviors and Discussions Among Young Adults: Analysis and Classification,"Rivas, Ryan and Shahbazi, Moloud and Garett, Renee and Hristidis, Vagelis and Young, Sean",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: There have been recurring reports of web-based harassment and abuse among adolescents and young adults through anonymous social networks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore discussions on the popular anonymous social network Yik Yak related to social and mental health messaging behaviors among college students, including cyberbullying, to provide insights into mental health behaviors on college campuses. METHODS: From April 6, 2016, to May 7, 2016, we collected anonymous conversations posted on Yik Yak at 19 universities in 4 different states and performed statistical analyses and text classification experiments on a subset of these messages. RESULTS: We found that prosocial messages were 5.23 times more prevalent than bullying messages. The frequency of cyberbullying messages was positively associated with messages seeking emotional help. We found significant geographic variation in the frequency of messages offering supportive vs bullying messages. Across campuses, bullying and political discussions were positively associated. We also achieved a balanced accuracy of over 0.75 for most messaging behaviors and topics with a support vector machine classifier. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that messages containing data about students' mental health-related attitudes and behaviors are prevalent on anonymous social networks, suggesting that these data can be mined for real-time analysis. This information can be used in education and health care services to better engage with students, provide insight into conversations that lead to cyberbullying, and reach out to students who need support.",2020,10.2196/17224,22,5,e17224,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*data analysis and *social media and *students and *supervised machine learning and *universities and Adolescent and Adult and data analysis and Female and Health Behavior/*classification and Humans and Male and Mental Health/*classification and social media and students and supervised machine learning and universities and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/05/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ren_2020_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,A Novel Intelligent Computational Approach to Model Epidemiological Trends and Assess the Impact of Non-Pharmacological Interventions for COVID-19,"Ren, Jinchang and Yan, Yijun and Zhao, Huimin and Ma, Ping and Zabalza, Jaime and Hussain, Zain and Luo, Shaoming and Dai, Qingyun and Zhao, Sophia and Sheikh, Aziz and Hussain, Amir and Li, Huakang",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis in public health. It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values.

Weissenbacher_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Deep neural networks ensemble for detecting medication mentions in tweets,"Weissenbacher, Davy and Sarker, Abeed and Klein, Ari and O'Connor, Karen and Magge, Arjun and Gonzalez-Hernandez, Graciela",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Twitter posts are now recognized as an important source of patient-generated data, providing unique insights into population health. A fundamental step toward incorporating Twitter data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatically recognize medication mentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names suffer from low recall due to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced method to recognize them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning classifier able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary supplements. Kusuri (, ""medication"" in Japanese) is composed of 2 modules: first, 4 different classifiers (lexicon based, spelling variant based, pattern based, and a weakly trained neural network) are applied in parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names; second, an ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantic, and long-range dependencies of important words in the tweets makes the final decision. RESULTS: On a class-balanced (50-50) corpus of 15 005 tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with an F1 score of 93.7%, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of all tweets posted by 112 Twitter users (98 959 tweets, with only 0.26% mentioning medications), Kusuri obtained an F1 score of 78.8%. To the best of our knowledge, Kusuri is the first system to achieve this score on such an extremely imbalanced dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The system identifies tweets mentioning drug names with performance high enough to ensure its usefulness, and is ready to be integrated in pharmacovigilance, toxicovigilance, or more generally, public health pipelines that depend on medication name mentions.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz156,26,12,1618-1626,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*drug name detection and *ensemble learning and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Pharmaceutical Preparations and *pharmacovigilance and *Pharmacovigilance and *social media and *Social Media and *text classification and Deep Learning and drug name detection and ensemble learning and Humans and Natural Language Processing and pharmacovigilance and social media and text classification",NA,NA,2019/12/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Praveen_2014_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,SMARTHealth India: Development and Field Evaluation of a Mobile Clinical Decision Support System for Cardiovascular Diseases in Rural India,"Praveen, Devarsetty and Patel, Anushka and Raghu, Arvind and Clifford, Gari D. and Maulik, Pallab K. and Mohammad Abdul, Ameer and Mogulluru, Kishor and Tarassenko, Lionel and MacMahon, Stephen and Peiris, David",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of premature death and disability in India and yet few people at risk of CVD are able to access best practice health care. Mobile health (mHealth) is a promising solution, but very few mHealth interventions have been subjected to robust evaluation in India. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to develop a multifaceted, mobile clinical decision support system (CDSS) for CVD management and evaluate it for use by public nonphysician health care workers (NPHWs) and physicians in a rural Indian setting. METHODS: Plain language clinical rules were developed based on standard guidelines and programmed into a computer tablet app. The algorithm was validated and field-tested in 11 villages in Andhra Pradesh, involving 11 NPHWs and 3 primary health center (PHC) physicians. A mixed method evaluation was conducted comprising clinical and survey data and in-depth patient and staff interviews to understand barriers and enablers to the use of the system. Then this was thematically analyzed using NVivo 10. RESULTS: During validation of the algorithm, there was an initial agreement for 70% of the 42 calculated variables between the CDSS and SPSS software outputs. Discrepancies were identified and amendments were made until perfect agreement was achieved. During field testing, NPHWs and PHC physicians used the CDSS to screen 227 and 65 adults, respectively. The NPHWs identified 39% (88/227) of patients for referral with 78% (69/88) of these having a definite indication for blood pressure (BP)-lowering medication. However, only 35% (24/69) attended a clinic within 1 month of referral, with 42% (10/24) of these reporting continuing medications at 3-month follow-up. Physicians identified and recommended 17% (11/65) of patients for BP-lowering medications. Qualitative interviews identified 3 interrelated interview themes: (1) the CDSS had potential to change prevailing health care models, (2) task-shifting to NPHWs was the central driver of change, and (3) despite high acceptability by end users, actual transformation was substantially limited by system-level barriers such as patient access to doctors and medicines. CONCLUSIONS: A tablet-based CDSS implemented within primary health care systems has the potential to help improve CVD outcomes in India. However, system-level barriers to accessing medical care limit its full impact. These barriers need to be actively addressed for clinical innovations to be successful.

On the basis of user feedback, we believe that the addition of these rules to the Ottawa Rules App has the potential to increase the app's usability and user acceptability. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceived usefulness, acceptability, and uptake of the enhanced Ottawa Rules App (which now includes CCHR, TIA, and SAH Rules) among ED clinicians (medical students, residents, nurses, and physicians). METHODS: The enhanced Ottawa Rules App was publicly released for free on iOS and Android operating systems in November 2018. This study was conducted across 2 tertiary EDs in Ottawa, Canada. Posters, direct enrollment, snowball sampling, and emails were used for study recruitment. A 24-question Web-based survey was administered to participants via email, and this was used to determine user acceptability of the app and Technology Readiness Index (TRI) scores. In-app user analytics were collected to track user behavior, such as the number of app sessions, length of app sessions, frequency of rule use, and the date app was first opened. RESULTS: A total of 77 ED clinicians completed the study, including 34 nurses, 12 residents, 14 physicians, and 17 medical students completing ED rotations. The median TRI score for this group was 3.38, indicating a higher than average propensity to embrace and adopt new technologies to accomplish goals in their work or daily lives. The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the app helped participants accurately carry out the clinical rules (56/77, 73%) and that they would recommend this app to their colleagues (64/77, 83%). Feedback from study participants suggested further expansion of the app-more clinical decision rules (CDRs) and different versions of the app tailored to the clinician role. Analysis and comparison of Google Analytics data and in-app data revealed similar usage behavior among study-enrolled users and all app users globally. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that using the Ottawa Rules App (version 3.0.2) to improve and guide patient care would be feasible and widely accepted. The ability to verify self-reported user data (via a Web-based survey) against server analytics data is a notable strength of this study. Participants' continued app use and request for the addition of more CDRs warrant the further development of this app and call for additional studies to evaluate its feasibility and usability in different settings as well as assessment of clinical impact.",2020,10.2196/15503,8,1,e15503,eng,2291-5222,"*Clinical Decision-Making and *clinical prediction rule and *decision aids and *emergency departments and *Emergency Service, Hospital and *mHealth and *Mobile Applications and Adult and Canada and clinical prediction rule and decision aids and emergency departments and Female and Humans and Internet and Male and mHealth and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Young Adult",NA,NA,2020/01/29/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: This paper sought out competencies for mobile technologies and/or an approach to define them. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to answer the following research question, ""What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care via mHealth, have they been published, and how can they be made measurable and reproducible to teach and assess them?"" The review was conducted in accordance with the 6-stage scoping review process starting with a keyword search in PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, APA PsycNET, Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus. The literature search focused on keywords in 4 concept areas: (1) competencies, (2) mobile technologies, (3) telemedicine mode, and (4) health. Moreover, 2 authors independently, in parallel, screened the search results for potentially relevant studies based on titles and abstracts. The authors reviewed the full-text articles for final inclusion based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were keywords used from concept area 1 (competencies) and 2 (mobile technologies) and either 3 (telemedicine mode) or 4 (health). Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, keywords used from a concept area in isolation, discussion of skills abstractly, outline or listing of what clinicians need without detail, and listing immeasurable behaviors. RESULTS: From a total of 1232 results, the authors found 78 papers eligible for a full-text review and found 14 papers directly relevant to the 4 key concepts. Although few studies specifically discussed skills, the majority were clinical studies, and the literature included no lists of measurable behaviors or competency sets for mobile technology. Therefore, a framework for mobile technology competencies was built according to the review, expert consensus, and recommendations of the Institute of Medicine's Health Professions Education Summit and Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education framework. This framework borrows from existing competency framework domains in telepsychiatry and social media (patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, systems-based practice, professionalism, and interpersonal skills and communication) and added domains of mHealth clinical decision support, device/technology assessment/selection, and information flow management across an electronic health record platform. mHealth Asynchronous components require additional traditional learning, teaching, supervisory and evaluation practices. Interactive curricula with case-, problem-, and system-based teaching may help faculty focus on decision making and shape skills and attitudes to complement clinical exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed on how to customize implementation and evaluation of mHealth competencies and to ensure skill development is linked to the quality of care. This will require the management of organizational change with technology and the creation of a positive electronic culture in a complex policy and regulatory environment.",2020,10.2196/12229,8,2,e12229,eng,2291-5222,*apps and *behavior and *competency and *education and *framework and *health and *mobile and *Mobile Applications and *mobile phone and *outcome and *Psychiatry and *technology and *Telemedicine and apps and behavior and Clinical Competence and competency and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and education and framework and health and Humans and mobile and mobile phone and outcome and technology and Technology,NA,NA,2020/02/21/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three independent subject matter expert panels drawn from and representative of the 1695 CIS diplomates certified by the American Board of Preventive Medicine contributed to the development of a draft CIS delineation of practice (DoP). An online survey was distributed to all CIS diplomates in July 2018 to validate the draft DoP. A total of 316 (18.8%) diplomates completed the survey. Survey respondents provided domain, task, and knowledge and skill (KS) ratings; qualitative feedback on the completeness of the DoP; and detailed professional background and demographic information. RESULTS: This practice analysis resulted in a validated, comprehensive, and contemporary DoP comprising 5 domains, 42 tasks, and 139 KS statements. DISCUSSION: The DoP that emerged from this study differs from the 2009 CIS Core Content in 2 respects. First, the DoP reflects the growth in amount, types, and utilization of health data through the addition of a practice domain, tasks, and KS statements focused on data analytics and governance. Second, the final DoP describes CIS practice in terms of tasks in addition to identifying knowledge required for competent practice.

Alfonsi_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Carbohydrate Counting App Using Image Recognition for Youth With Type 1 Diabetes: Pilot Randomized Control Trial,"Alfonsi, Jeffrey E. and Choi, Elizabeth E. Y. and Arshad, Taha and Sammott, Stacie-Ann S. and Pais, Vanita and Nguyen, Cynthia and Maguire, Bryan R. and Stinson, Jennifer N. and Palmert, Mark R.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate counting is an important component of diabetes management, but it is challenging, often performed inaccurately, and can be a barrier to optimal diabetes management. iSpy is a novel mobile app that leverages machine learning to allow food identification through images and that was designed to assist youth with type 1 diabetes in counting carbohydrates. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test the app's usability and potential impact on carbohydrate counting accuracy. METHODS: Iterative usability testing (3 cycles) was conducted involving a total of 16 individuals aged 8.5-17.0 years with type 1 diabetes. Participants were provided a mobile device and asked to complete tasks using iSpy app features while thinking aloud. Errors were noted, acceptability was assessed, and refinement and retesting were performed across cycles. Subsequently, iSpy was evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial with 22 iSpy users and 22 usual care controls aged 10-17 years. Primary outcome was change in carbohydrate counting ability over 3 months. Secondary outcomes included levels of engagement and acceptability. Change in HbA(1c) level was also assessed. RESULTS: Use of iSpy was associated with improved carbohydrate counting accuracy (total grams per meal, P=.008), reduced frequency of individual counting errors greater than 10 g (P=.047), and lower HbA(1c) levels (P=.03). Qualitative interviews and acceptability scale scores were positive. No major technical challenges were identified. Moreover, 43% (9/21) of iSpy participants were still engaged, with usage at least once every 2 weeks, at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of efficacy and high acceptability of a novel carbohydrate counting app, supporting the advancement of digital health apps for diabetes care among youth with type 1 diabetes. Further testing is needed, but iSpy may be a useful adjunct to traditional diabetes management.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with reach in a dental Twitter network (1) initially and (2) sustainably at individual and network levels. METHODS: We used instructors' and students' Twitter usernames from a Saudi dental school in 2016-2017 and applied Gephi (a social network analysis tool) and social media analytics to calculate user and network metrics. Content analysis was performed to identify users disseminating oral health information. The study outcomes were reach at baseline and sustainably over 1.5 years. The explanatory variables were indicators of popularity (number of followers, likes, tweets retweeted by others), communication pattern (number of tweets, retweets, replies, tweeting/ retweeting oral health information or not). Multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations. RESULTS: Among dental users, 31.8% had reach at baseline and 62.9% at the end of the study, reaching a total of 749,923 and dropping to 37,169 users at the end. At an individual level, reach was associated with the number of followers (baseline: odds ratio, OR=1.003, 95% CI=1.001-1.005 and sustainability: OR=1.002, 95% CI=1.0001-1.003), likes (baseline: OR=1.001, 95% CI=1.0001-1.002 and sustainability: OR=1.0031, 95% CI=1.0003-1.002), and replies (baseline: OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.005-1.04 and sustainability: OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.004-1.03).

We recently completed a randomized controlled trial of a targeted knowledge translation (KT) intervention delivered through the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal with the goal to increase physical activity and physical mobility in middle-aged and older adults, with results reported elsewhere. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this process evaluation study is to explore which KT strategies were used by both intervention and control group participants, as well as the intervention groups' engagement, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the targeted KT intervention. METHODS: Data on engagement with the intervention materials were gathered quantitatively through Google Analytics and Hootsuite throughout the intervention. Qualitative data were collected through a combination of open-ended surveys and qualitative interviews with a subset of participants at the end of the study to further understand engagement, satisfaction, and usefulness of the KT strategies. RESULTS: Throughout the intervention period, engagement with content delivered through weekly emails was highest, and participants rated email content most favorably in both surveys and interviews. Participants were generally satisfied with the intervention, noting the ease of participating and the distillation of information in an easy-to-access format being beneficial features. Participants who did not find the intervention useful were those with already high levels of baseline physical activity or physical function and those who were looking for more specific or individualized content.

Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to describe the digital solutions that have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19-related literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas. RESULTS: The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years.",2020,10.2196/22280,22,11,e22280,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Artificial Intelligence and *Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology and *COVID-19 and *digital heath and *eHealth and *impact and *literature and *mitigate and *pandemic and *Pandemics/prevention & control and *Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology and *review and *SARS-CoV-2 and Betacoronavirus and COVID-19 and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and digital heath and eHealth and Humans and impact and literature and mitigate and pandemic and Privacy and review and SARS-CoV-2 and Social Media/statistics & numerical data and Technology and Telemedicine/*methods",NA,NA,2020/11/06/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and clinically validate an adaptable, personalized diagnostic model to assist clinicians in ruling in and ruling out COVID-19 in potential patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of probabilistic, graphical, and machine learning models against a previously published benchmark model. METHODS: We integrated patient symptoms and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on 13 symptoms and estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19-compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over the course of 14 days starting in March 2020. RESULTS: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (n=43, 78%) or cough (n=42, 77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11, 20%) or hospital care (n=44, 80%). In total, 51% (n=28) were female and 49% (n=27) were aged <60 years. Common comorbidities included diabetes (n=12, 22%), hypertension (n=15, 27%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and cardiovascular disease (n=7, 13%). Of these, 69% (n=38) were confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 20% (n=11) had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6%-84.2%, specificities of 58.8%-70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4%-71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices.

However, alongside these anticipated benefits of information-sharing are risks of unwanted disclosure of sensitive information. Approaches to identifying the optimal balance between access to digital health information to facilitate engagement and protecting patient privacy are urgently needed. We identified eight themes that should be considered in balancing health information access and patient privacy: 1) potential benefits to patients from PDM data access; 2) potential harms to patients from such access; 3) the moral status of families within the patient-clinician relationship; 4) the scope of relevant information provided to PDMs; 5) issues around defining PDMs' authority; 6) methods for eliciting and documenting patient preferences about their family's information access; 7) the relevance of methods for ascertaining the identity of PDMs; and 8) the obligations of hospitals to prevent privacy breaches by PDMs. We conclude that PDMs should typically have access to health information from the current episode of care when the patient is decisionally impaired, unless the patient has previously expressed a clear preference that PDMs not have such access.",2016,10.1093/jamia/ocv182,23,5,1000-995,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*access and *Confidentiality and *Decision Making and *digital information and *ethics and *Family and *Information Dissemination and *intensive care unit and *patient engagement and *patient privacy and *patient-centered care and *personal health records and *shared decision making and access and digital information and ethics and Humans and intensive care unit and Intensive Care Units and patient engagement and Patient Preference and patient privacy and patient-centered care and personal health records and Professional-Family Relations and Proxy and shared decision making,NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

This technology has the potential to facilitate the active involvement of research participants. Digital platforms that enable participants to be involved in the research process are called participant-centric initiatives (PCIs). Several PCIs have been reported in the literature, but no scoping reviews have been carried out. Moreover, detailed methods and features to aid in developing a clear definition of PCIs have not been sufficiently elucidated to date. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to describe the recent trends in, and features of, PCIs across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. METHODS: We applied a methodology suggested by Levac et al to conduct this scoping review. We searched electronic databases-MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycINFO, and Ichushi-Web-and sources of grey literature, as well as internet search engines-Google and Bing. We hand-searched through key journals and reference lists of the relevant articles. Medical research using ICT was eligible for inclusion if there was a description of the active involvement of the participants. RESULTS: Ultimately, 21 PCIs were identified that have implemented practical methods and modes of various communication activities, such as patient forums and use of social media, in the field of medical research. Various methods of decision making that enable participants to become involved in setting the agenda were also evident. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review is the first study to analyze the detailed features of PCIs and how they are being implemented. By clarifying the modes and methods of various forms of communication and decision making with patients, this review contributes to a better understanding of patient-centric involvement, which can be facilitated by PCIs.

Juen_2015_IEjoofbianhein,JOUR,A natural walking monitor for pulmonary patients using mobile phones,"Juen, Joshua and Cheng, Qian and Schatz, Bruce",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Mobile devices have the potential to continuously monitor health by collecting movement data including walking speed during natural walking. Natural walking is walking without artificial speed constraints present in both treadmill and nurse-assisted walking. Fitness trackers have become popular which record steps taken and distance, typically using a fixed stride length. While useful for everyday purposes, medical monitoring requires precise accuracy and testing on real patients with a scientifically valid measure. Walking speed is closely linked to morbidity in patients and widely used for medical assessment via measured walking. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a standard assessment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Current generation smartphone hardware contains similar sensor chips as in medical devices and popular fitness devices. We developed a middleware software, MoveSense, which runs on standalone smartphones while providing comparable readings to medical accelerometers. We evaluate six machine learning methods to obtain gait speed during natural walking training models to predict natural walking speed and distance during a 6MWT with 28 pulmonary patients and ten subjects without pulmonary condition. We also compare our model's accuracy to popular fitness devices. Our universally trained support vector machine models produce 6MWT distance with 3.23% error during a controlled 6MWT and 11.2% during natural free walking. Furthermore, our model attains 7.9% error when tested on five subjects for distance estimation compared to the 50-400% error seen in fitness devices during natural walking.",2015,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2427511,19,4,1399-1405,eng,2168-2208 2168-2194,"*Cell Phone and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Exercise Test/*instrumentation and Female and Gait/*physiology and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Monitoring, Ambulatory/*instrumentation/methods and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*physiopathology and Walking/physiology and Young Adult",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has also been suggested that these tools can help further our understanding of the clinical characteristics of this new disease. However, there is limited information on the characteristics and use patterns of these tools in practice. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to describe the characteristics of people who use digital health tools to address COVID-19-related concerns; explore their self-reported symptoms and characterize the association of these symptoms with COVID-19; and characterize the recommendations provided by digital health tools. METHODS: This study used data from three digital health tools on the K Health app: a protocol-based COVID-19 self-assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checker, and communication with remote physicians. Deidentified data were extracted on the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults seeking COVID-19-related health information between April 8 and June 20, 2020. Analyses included exploring features associated with COVID-19 positivity and features associated with the choice to communicate with a remote physician. RESULTS: During the period assessed, 71,619 individuals completed the COVID-19 self-assessment, 41,425 also used the AI-driven symptom checker, and 2523 consulted with remote physicians. Individuals who used the COVID-19 self-assessment were predominantly female (51,845/71,619, 72.4%), with a mean age of 34.5 years (SD 13.9). Testing for COVID-19 was reported by 2901 users, of whom 433 (14.9%) reported testing positive. Users who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to have reported loss of smell or taste (relative rate [RR] 6.66, 95% CI 5.53-7.94) and other established COVID-19 symptoms as well as ocular symptoms. Users communicating with a remote physician were more likely to have been recommended by the self-assessment to undergo immediate medical evaluation due to the presence of severe symptoms (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.32). Most consultations with remote physicians (1940/2523, 76.9%) were resolved without need for referral to an in-person visit or to the emergency department.

The heart failure summary use case,"Martinez-Costa, Catalina and Cornet, Ronald and Karlsson, Daniel and Schulz, Stefan and Kalra, Dipak",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To improve semantic interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs) by ontology-based mediation across syntactically heterogeneous representations of the same or similar clinical information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our approach is based on a semantic layer that consists of: (1) a set of ontologies supported by (2) a set of semantic patterns. The first aspect of the semantic layer helps standardize the clinical information modeling task and the second shields modelers from the complexity of ontology modeling. We applied this approach to heterogeneous representations of an excerpt of a heart failure summary. RESULTS: Using a set of finite top-level patterns to derive semantic patterns, we demonstrate that those patterns, or compositions thereof, can be used to represent information from clinical models. Homogeneous querying of the same or similar information, when represented according to heterogeneous clinical models, is feasible. DISCUSSION: Our approach focuses on the meaning embedded in EHRs, regardless of their structure. This complex task requires a clear ontological commitment (ie, agreement to consistently use the shared vocabulary within some context), together with formalization rules. These requirements are supported by semantic patterns. Other potential uses of this approach, such as clinical models validation, require further investigation. CONCLUSION: We show how an ontology-based representation of a clinical summary, guided by semantic patterns, allows homogeneous querying of heterogeneous information structures.

Mangone_2016_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Mobile Phone Apps for the Prevention of Unintended Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Content Analysis,"Mangone, Emily Rose and Lebrun, Victoria and Muessig, Kathryn E.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Over 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, meaning that the pregnancy is mistimed, unplanned, or unwanted. Unintended pregnancy increases health risks for mother and child, leads to high economic costs for society, and increases social disparities. Mobile phone ownership is rapidly increasing, providing opportunities to reach at-risk populations with reproductive health information and tailored unintended pregnancy prevention interventions through mobile phone apps. However, apps that offer support for unintended pregnancy prevention remain unevaluated. OBJECTIVE: To identify, describe, and evaluate mobile phone apps that purport to help users prevent unintended pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted an extensive search of the Apple iTunes and Android Google Play stores for apps that explicitly included or advertised pregnancy prevention or decision-making support in the context of fertility information/tracking, birth control reminders, contraceptive information, pregnancy decision-making, abortion information or counseling, sexual communication/negotiation, and pregnancy tests. We excluded apps that targeted medical professionals or that cost more than US $1.99. Eligible apps were downloaded and categorized by primary purpose. Data extraction was performed on a minimum of 143 attributes in 3 domains: (1) pregnancy prevention best practices, (2) contraceptive methods and clinical services, and (3) user interface. Apps were assigned points for their inclusion of features overall and for pregnancy prevention best practices and contraceptive information. RESULTS: Our search identified 6805 app descriptions in iTunes and Google Play. Of these, 218 unique apps met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Apps were grouped into 9 categories: fertility trackers (n=72), centers and resources (n=38), birth control reminders (n=35), general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information (n=17), SRH information targeted specifically to young adults (YA) (n=16), contraceptive information (n=15), service or condom locators (n=12), pregnancy tests (n=10), and games (n=3). Twelve apps scored at least 50 points (out of 94) for overall number of features and at least 15 points (out of 21) for contraceptive information and pregnancy prevention best practices. Overall, 41% of apps did not mention any modern contraceptive methods and 23% mentioned only 1 method. Of apps that did mention a modern contraceptive method, fewer than 50% of these apps provided information on how to use it. YA SRH apps had the highest percentage of pregnancy prevention best practices in each app. Demographic and interface evaluation found that most apps (72%) did not target any race and only 10% explicitly targeted youth. Communication interface features were present in fewer than 50% of apps. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified several useful, evidence-based apps that support the prevention of unintended pregnancy. However, most apps miss opportunities to provide users with valuable information, interactive decision aids, and evidence-based interventions for unintended pregnancy prevention. Further, some apps in this space may increase the likelihood of unintended pregnancy due to the low effectiveness of the contraceptive methods promoted.",2016,10.2196/mhealth.4846,4,1,e6,eng,2291-5222,app and contraception and eHealth and family planning and mHealth and mobile phone and pregnancy prevention and systematic review and unintended pregnancy,NA,NA,2016/01/19/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lopez.Segui_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Teleconsultation Between Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Catalan Primary Care Service: Message Annotation Analysis in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study,"Lopez Segui, Francesc and Walsh, Sandra and Solans, Oscar and Adroher Mas, Cristina and Ferraro, Gabriela and Garcia-Altes, Anna and Garcia Cuyas, Francesc and Salvador Carulla, Luis and Sagarra Castro, Marta and Vidal-Alaball, Josep",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. METHODS: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. RESULTS: The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question ""Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?"" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79% * 65%) to 79% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage. The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings.",2020,10.2196/19149,22,9,e19149,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology and *face-to-face visits and *message annotation and *Pandemics and *Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology and *primary care and *remote consultation and *teleconsultation and Artificial Intelligence and COVID-19 and Cross-Sectional Studies and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and face-to-face visits and Female and Health Personnel and Humans and Male and message annotation and Middle Aged and primary care and Primary Health Care and remote consultation and Remote Consultation/*methods and Retrospective Studies and teleconsultation",NA,NA,2020/09/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System [BPAS]). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, uses both AR and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills. METHODS: A total of 21 children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The user's tolerability to the smartglasses, user being able to wear the smartglasses for 1 minute (initial tolerability threshold), and user being able to wear the smartglasses for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold) were determined through caregiver report. RESULTS: Of 21 users, 19 (91%) demonstrated tolerability on all 3 measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (91%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 (100%) were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (91%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed caregiver expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94%). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age- and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD.",2017,10.2196/mhealth.8534,5,9,e140,eng,2291-5222,augmented reality and autism and autism spectrum disorder and digital health and education and medtech and smartglasses and tech and technology,NA,NA,2017/09/21/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The generated EHR data will be more realistic than those generated using the existing medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We modified medGAN to obtain two synthetic data generation models-designated as medical Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (medWGAN) and medical boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN)-and compared the results obtained using the three models. We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the models' performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). RESULTS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best. DISCUSSION: To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services.

However, there are many challenges in this regard. In the present study, the solutions and challenges of implementing EHR-based disease surveillance systems (EHR-DS) have been reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the related keywords in ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Then, we assessed and selected articles using the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, finally, classified the identified solutions and challenges. RESULTS: Finally, 50 studies were included, and 52 unique solutions and 47 challenges were organized into 6 main themes (policy and regulatory, technical, management, standardization, financial, and data quality). The results indicate that due to the multifaceted nature of the challenges, the implementation of EHR-DS is not low cost and easy to implement and requires a variety of interventions. On the one hand, the most common challenges include the need to invest significant time and resources; the poor data quality in EHRs; difficulty in analyzing, cleaning, and accessing unstructured data; data privacy and security; and the lack of interoperability standards. On the other hand, the most common solutions are the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for unstructured data; the use of appropriate technical solutions for data retrieval, extraction, identification, and visualization; the collaboration of health and clinical departments to access data; standardizing EHR content for public health; and using a unique health identifier for individuals. CONCLUSIONS: EHR systems have an important role in modernizing disease surveillance systems. However, there are many problems and challenges facing the development and implementation of EHR-DS that need to be appropriately addressed.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa186,27,12,1977-1986,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,*challenges and *disease surveillance and *electronic health record and *Electronic Health Records/standards and *public health and *solutions and challenges and Data Analysis and disease surveillance and electronic health record and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Population Surveillance/*methods and public health and solutions,NA,NA,2020/12/09/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Allam_2017_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Toward automated assessment of health Web page quality using the DISCERN instrument,"Allam, Ahmed and Schulz, Peter J. and Krauthammer, Michael",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"BACKGROUND: As the Internet becomes the number one destination for obtaining health-related information, there is an increasing need to identify health Web pages that convey an accurate and current view of medical knowledge. In response, the research community has created multicriteria instruments for reliably assessing online medical information quality. One such instrument is DISCERN, which measures health Web page quality by assessing an array of features. In order to scale up use of the instrument, there is interest in automating the quality evaluation process by building machine learning (ML)-based DISCERN Web page classifiers. OBJECTIVE: The paper addresses 2 key issues that are essential before constructing automated DISCERN classifiers: (1) generation of a robust DISCERN training corpus useful for training classification algorithms, and (2) assessment of the usefulness of the current DISCERN scoring schema as a metric for evaluating the performance of these algorithms. METHODS: Using DISCERN, 272 Web pages discussing treatment options in breast cancer, arthritis, and depression were evaluated and rated by trained coders. First, different consensus models were compared to obtain a robust aggregated rating among the coders, suitable for a DISCERN ML training corpus. Second, a new DISCERN scoring criterion was proposed (features-based score) as an ML performance metric that is more reflective of the score distribution across different DISCERN quality criteria. RESULTS: First, we found that a probabilistic consensus model applied to the DISCERN instrument was robust against noise (random ratings) and superior to other approaches for building a training corpus. Second, we found that the established DISCERN scoring schema (overall score) is ill-suited to measure ML performance for automated classifiers. CONCLUSION: Use of a probabilistic consensus model is advantageous for building a training corpus for the DISCERN instrument, and use of a features-based score is an appropriate ML metric for automated DISCERN classifiers.

This makes the internet one of the main ways for residents to obtain medical information and knowledge before seeking medical treatment. However, little has been researched on how the internet affects medical decisions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between internet behaviors and medical decisions among Chinese adults aged 18 or over, including whether to go to the hospital and which level of medical institution to choose. METHODS: With the adult residents (<e2><89><a5>18 years old) in 12 regions including urban and rural areas taken as the research objects, the differences in medical choices of adults with various characteristics were analyzed, and generalized linear mixed models were adopted to analyze the longitudinal data of the China Health Nutrition Survey from 2006 to 2015. RESULTS: Adult groups with different ages, genders, education levels, regions, places of residence, severities of illness and injury, years of suffering from hypertension, and history of chronic diseases showed diverse medical decisions, and the differences were statistically significant (P<.05). After controlling for these potential confounding factors and taking self-care as the reference, the probability of Chinese adults who participated in online browsing activities selecting hospital care was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.98; P=.03) times that of residents who did not participate in online browsing activities. In terms of medical institution choices, adults who participated in online browsing activities were 1.86 (95% CI 1.35-2.58; P<.001) times more likely to opt for municipal medical treatment than primary care. However, the effect of online browsing on the selection probability of county-level hospitals was not significant compared with primary hospitals (P=.59). Robust analysis verified that accessing the internet had a similar effect on Chinese adults' medical decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese adults who use the internet are a little less likely to go to the hospital than self-care. The internet has broken down the barriers to obtain knowledge of common diseases and thus has a slight substitution effect of self-care on hospital care. Internet use may increase the probability of adults going to municipal hospitals. The rising tendency of visiting high-level medical institutions may be consequently exacerbated due to knowledge monopoly of severe and complicated diseases that is difficult to eliminate, and the increase in inconsistent and incomplete medical information online will blur the residents' cognitive boundary of common diseases and severe diseases. Exploring the substantive impact of the internet on medical decision making is of great significance for further rational planning and utilization of the internet, in order to guide patients to appropriate medical institution.",2020,10.2196/18481,22,9,e18481,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*adult and *health care provider choice and *hierarchical medical policy and *internet and *Internet and *longitudinal data analysis and *medical decision and Adolescent and adult and Adult and China and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Data Analysis and Female and health care provider choice and hierarchical medical policy and Humans and internet and longitudinal data analysis and Longitudinal Studies and Male and medical decision and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/09/03/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cresswell_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Health Care Robotics: Qualitative Exploration of Key Challenges and Future Directions,"Cresswell, Kathrin and Cunningham-Burley, Sarah and Sheikh, Aziz",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of robotics is transforming industries around the world. Robot technologies are evolving exponentially, particularly as they converge with other functionalities such as artificial intelligence to learn from their environment, from each other, and from humans. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to understand the emerging role of robotics in health care and identify existing and likely future challenges to maximize the benefits associated with robotics and related convergent technologies. METHODS: We conducted qualitative semistructured one-to-one interviews exploring the role of robotic applications in health care contexts. Using purposive sampling, we identified a diverse range of stakeholders involved in conceiving, procuring, developing, and using robotics in a range of national and international health care settings. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically, supported by NVivo 10 (QSR International) software. Theoretically, this work was informed by the sociotechnical perspective, where social and technical systems are understood as being interdependent. RESULTS: We conducted 21 interviews and these accounts suggested that there are significant opportunities for improving the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care through robotics, but our analysis identified 4 major barriers that need to be effectively negotiated to realize these: (1) no clear pull from professionals and patients, (2) appearance of robots and associated expectations and concerns, (3) disruption of the way work is organized and distributed, and (4) new ethical and legal challenges requiring flexible liability and ethical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Sociotechnical challenges associated with the effective integration of robotic applications in health care settings are likely to be significant, particularly for patient-facing functions.

Abdalla_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Using word embeddings to improve the privacy of clinical notes,"Abdalla, Mohamed and Abdalla, Moustafa and Rudzicz, Frank and Hirst, Graeme",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: In this work, we introduce a privacy technique for anonymizing clinical notes that guarantees all private health information is secured (including sensitive data, such as family history, that are not adequately covered by current techniques). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employ a new ""random replacement"" paradigm (replacing each token in clinical notes with neighboring word vectors from the embedding space) to achieve 100% recall on the removal of sensitive information, unachievable with current ""search-and-secure"" paradigms. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm on multiple corpora in a diverse set of classification tasks. RESULTS: We empirically evaluate the effect of our anonymization technique both on upstream and downstream natural language processing tasks to show that our perturbations, while increasing security (ie, achieving 100% recall on any dataset), do not greatly impact the results of end-to-end machine learning approaches. DISCUSSION: As long as current approaches utilize precision and recall to evaluate deidentification algorithms, there will remain a risk of overlooking sensitive information. Inspired by differential privacy, we sought to make it statistically infeasible to recreate the original data, although at the cost of readability. We hope that the work will serve as a catalyst to further research into alternative deidentification methods that can address current weaknesses. CONCLUSION: Our proposed technique can secure clinical texts at a low cost and extremely high recall with a readability trade-off while remaining useful for natural language processing classification tasks. We hope that our work can be used by risk-averse data holders to release clinical texts to researchers.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocaa038,27,6,901-907,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,": privacy and * : privacy and *Algorithms and *Confidentiality and *data anonymization and *Data Anonymization and *Electronic Health Records and *natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and *personal health records and data anonymization and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Records, Personal and Humans and natural language processing and personal health records and United States",NA,NA,2020/06/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

To address the high screening workload at quarantine stations, all staff members with medical licenses are required to work shifts in these stations. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the workflow and decision-making process for physicians and surgeons from all subspecialties. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the National Cheng Kung University Hospital artificial intelligence (AI) trilogy of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm improves medical care and reduces quarantine processing times. METHODS: This observational study on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic included 643 patients. An ""AI trilogy"" of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm on a tablet computer was applied to shorten the quarantine survey process and reduce processing time during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The use of the AI trilogy facilitated the processing of suspected cases of COVID-19 with or without symptoms; also, travel, occupation, contact, and clustering histories were obtained with the tablet computer device. A separate AI-mode function that could quickly recognize pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-rays was merged into the smart clinical assisting system (SCAS), and this model was subsequently trained with COVID-19 pneumonia cases from the GitHub open source data set. The detection rates for posteroanterior and anteroposterior chest x-rays were 55/59 (93%) and 5/11 (45%), respectively. The SCAS algorithm was continuously adjusted based on updates to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control public safety guidelines for faster clinical decision making. Our ex vivo study demonstrated the efficiency of disinfecting the tablet computer surface by wiping it twice with 75% alcohol sanitizer. To further analyze the impact of the AI application in the quarantine station, we subdivided the station group into groups with or without AI. Compared with the conventional ED (n=281), the survey time at the quarantine station (n=1520) was significantly shortened; the median survey time at the ED was 153 minutes (95% CI 108.5-205.0), vs 35 minutes at the quarantine station (95% CI 24-56; P<.001). Furthermore, the use of the AI application in the quarantine station reduced the survey time in the quarantine station; the median survey time without AI was 101 minutes (95% CI 40-153), vs 34 minutes (95% CI 24-53) with AI in the quarantine station (P<.001).

Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence-supported software tools that use a conversational ""chatbot"" format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: This population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24, 2019, to February 1, 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data. RESULTS: A total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years), compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26,646, 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12,357/26,646, 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26,646, 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26,646, 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26,646, 29.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines.

In this process, the first question usually faced is that of how to obtain useful and relevant information. This study investigated the types of information sources that are used widely by patients in choosing a doctor and identified ways in which the preferred sources differ in various situations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the following questions: (1) What is the proportion in which each of the various information sources is used? (2) How does the information source preferred by patients in choosing a doctor change when there is a difference in the difficulty of medical decision making, in the level of the hospital, or in a rural versus urban situation? (3) How do information sources used by patients differ when they choose doctors with different specialties? METHODS: This study overcomes a major limitation in the use of the survey technique by employing data from the Good Doctor website, which is now China's leading online health care community, data which are objective and can be obtained relatively easily and frequently. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to examine whether the proportion of use of these information sources changes in different situations. We then used visual analysis to explore the question of which type of information source patients prefer to use when they seek medical assistance from doctors with different specialties. RESULTS: The 3 main information sources were online reviews (OR), family and friend recommendations (FR), and doctor recommendations (DR), with proportions of use of 32.93% (559,345/1,698,666), 23.68% (402,322/1,698,666), and 17.48% (296,912/1,698,666), respectively. Difficulty in medical decision making, the hospital level, and rural-urban differences were significantly associated with patients' preferred information sources for choosing doctors. Further, the sources of information that patients prefer to use were found to vary when they looked for doctors with different medical specialties. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are less likely to use online reviews when medical decisions are more difficult or when the provider is not a tertiary hospital, the former situation leading to a greater use of online reviews and the latter to a greater use of family and friend recommendations. In addition, patients in large cities are more likely to use information from online reviews than family and friend recommendations. Among different medical specialties, for those in which personal privacy is a concern, online reviews are the most common source. For those related to children, patients are more likely to refer to family and friend recommendations, and for those related to surgery, they value doctor recommendations more highly. Our results can not only contribute to aiding government efforts to further promote the dissemination of health care information but may also help health care industry managers develop better marketing strategies.",2020,10.2196/20910,22,9,e20910,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Female and Male and online reviews and decision making and health information and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and Telemedicine/*methods and *decision making and Physicians/*standards and *health information and *doctor and *information source and *online health care community and *online reviews and doctor and information source and online health care community,NA,NA,2020/09/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Easton_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Virtual Agent to Support Individuals Living With Physical and Mental Comorbidities: Co-Design and Acceptability Testing,"Easton, Katherine and Potter, Stephen and Bec, Remi and Bennion, Matthew and Christensen, Heidi and Grindell, Cheryl and Mirheidari, Bahman and Weich, Scott and de Witte, Luc and Wolstenholme, Daniel and Hawley, Mark S.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. METHODS: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. RESULTS: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. CONCLUSIONS: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.",2019,10.2196/12996,21,5,e12996,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*artificial intelligence and *chatbot and *chronic illness and *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and *comorbidity and *computer-assisted therapy and *conversational agent and *COPD and *mental health and *self-management and *Social Support and *virtual systems and Adult and artificial intelligence and chatbot and chronic illness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbidity and Comorbidity/*trends and computer-assisted therapy and conversational agent and COPD and Female and Humans and Male and mental health and Mental Health/*trends and Middle Aged and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*diagnosis/mortality and self-management and Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy/*methods and virtual systems",NA,NA,2019/05/30/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future. OBJECTIVE: In this study, a statistical approach was proposed to study the correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain and search data provided by Google Trends. METHODS: We assessed the linear correlation between Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain-which is dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III-regarding the number of COVID-19 cases reported with a certain time lag. These data enabled the identification of anticipatory patterns. RESULTS: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that by using our correlation test, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain up to 11 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. This can be of great help given the critical, if not dramatic need for complementary monitoring approaches that work on a population level and inform public health decisions in real time.

Baskerville_2018_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Crush the Crave: Development and Formative Evaluation of a Smartphone App for Smoking Cessation,"Baskerville, Neill B. and Struik, Laura L. and Dash, Darly",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence supports the use of smartphone apps for smoking cessation, especially in young adults given their high smoking rates and high smartphone ownership rates. Although evaluative evidence is encouraging for supporting smoking cessation, there remains a paucity of research describing the design and development processes of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the process of developing Crush the Crave (CTC), an evidence-informed app to support smoking cessation in young adults, and the results of a formative evaluation of app usage behavior, as part of a broader program of research that seeks to establish the effectiveness of the CTC app. METHODS: The Spiral Technology Action Research (STAR) 5-cycle model (listen, plan, do, act, and study) was employed to guide the development, implementation, and dissemination of CTC. The approach to development and formative evaluation included focus groups with young adult smokers (n=78) across 2 phases, analysis of the content of existing apps, 2 sessions with content experts, and Google Analytics to assess user behavior during a 12-month pilot. RESULTS: LISTEN-focus groups revealed young adult smoker preferences of (1) positive reinforcement, (2) personalization, (3) social support, (4) quit support, (5) tracking the behavior, and (6) tracking quit benefits. PLAN-informed by evidence for smoking cessation, young adult preferences and an assessment of popular cessation apps, content experts produced a mind map and a storyboard describing app content and structure. DO-focus groups with young adult smokers provided feedback on the first version of the app with opinions on content and suggestions for improvement such as providing alerts and distractions from craving. ACT-refinements were made, and app content was organized using the 4 key design components informed by principles of persuasive technology for behavior change: credibility, task support, dialogue support, and social support. CTC was launched in April 2013 and piloted from the period July 2013 to June 2014 where 1987 Android users had 18,567 sessions, resulting in 59,384 page views and 89.58% (1780/1987) of users returning within the same day to use CTC. STUDY-a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of CTC was launched in August 2014 to demonstrate that including mHealth technology as a population-based intervention can help young adult smokers to quit. The results of this phase will be presented in a subsequent publication. CONCLUSIONS: CTC is one of the first smoking cessation apps designed to meet the needs of young adult smokers. The development was informed by the inclusion of young adults in the design and the systematic application of multiple stakeholder input, scientific evidence, and theory. The STAR model approach was followed from the beginning of intervention development, which should facilitate optimization of mHealth interventions in the future.

Wei_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Cost-aware active learning for named entity recognition in clinical text,"Wei, Qiang and Chen, Yukun and Salimi, Mandana and Denny, Joshua C. and Mei, Qiaozhu and Lasko, Thomas A. and Chen, Qingxia and Wu, Stephen and Franklin, Amy and Cohen, Trevor and Xu, Hua",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Active Learning (AL) attempts to reduce annotation cost (ie, time) by selecting the most informative examples for annotation. Most approaches tacitly (and unrealistically) assume that the cost for annotating each sample is identical. This study introduces a cost-aware AL method, which simultaneously models both the annotation cost and the informativeness of the samples and evaluates both via simulation and user studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a novel, cost-aware AL algorithm (Cost-CAUSE) for annotating clinical named entities; we first utilized lexical and syntactic features to estimate annotation cost, then we incorporated this cost measure into an existing AL algorithm. Using the 2010 i2b2/VA data set, we then conducted a simulation study comparing Cost-CAUSE with noncost-aware AL methods, and a user study comparing Cost-CAUSE with passive learning. RESULTS: Our cost model fit empirical annotation data well, and Cost-CAUSE increased the simulation area under the learning curve (ALC) scores by up to 5.6% and 4.9%, compared with random sampling and alternate AL methods. Moreover, in a user annotation task, Cost-CAUSE outperformed passive learning on the ALC score and reduced annotation time by 20.5%-30.2%. DISCUSSION: Although AL has proven effective in simulations, our user study shows that a real-world environment is far more complex. Other factors have a noticeable effect on the AL method, such as the annotation accuracy of users, the tiredness of users, and even the physical and mental condition of users. CONCLUSION: Cost-CAUSE saves significant annotation cost compared to random sampling.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz102,26,11,1314-1322,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*active learning and *Algorithms and *electronic health records and *named entity recognition, user study and *natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and active learning and Big Data and Computer Simulation and electronic health records and Electronic Health Records/*economics and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*economics and Models, Economic and named entity recognition, user study and natural language processing and Problem-Based Learning/*economics",NA,NA,2019/11/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chen_2020_JoofmeInre_3,JOUR,Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator Apps in a Taiwanese Population Cohort: Validation Study,"Chen, I.-Hsuan Alan and Chu, Chi-Hsiang and Lin, Jen-Tai and Tsai, Jeng-Yu and Yu, Chia-Cheng and Sridhar, Ashwin Narasimha and Sooriakumaran, Prasanna and Loureiro, Rui C. V. and Chand, Manish",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health apps have emerged as useful tools for patients and clinicians alike, sharing health information or assisting in clinical decision-making. Prostate cancer (PCa) risk calculator mobile apps have been introduced to assess risks of PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score <e2><89><a5>7). The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator and Coral-Prostate Cancer Nomogram Calculator apps were developed from the 2 most-studied PCa risk calculators, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the North American Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculators, respectively. A systematic review has indicated that the Rotterdam and Coral apps perform best during the prebiopsy stage. However, the epidemiology of PCa varies among different populations, and therefore, the applicability of these apps in a Taiwanese population needs to be evaluated. This study is the first to validate the PCa risk calculator apps with both biopsy and prostatectomy cohorts in Taiwan. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective is to validate the PCa risk calculator apps using a Taiwanese cohort of patients. Additionally, we aim to utilize postprostatectomy pathology outcomes to assess the accuracy of both apps with regard to high-grade PCa. METHODS: All male patients who had undergone transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsies in a single Taiwanese tertiary medical center from 2012 to 2018 were identified retrospectively. The probabilities of PCa and high-grade PCa were calculated utilizing the Rotterdam and Coral apps, and compared with biopsy and prostatectomy results. Calibration was graphically evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Discrimination was analyzed utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed for clinical utility. RESULTS: Of 1134 patients, 246 (21.7%) were diagnosed with PCa; of these 246 patients, 155 (63%) had high-grade PCa, according to the biopsy results. After confirmation with prostatectomy pathological outcomes, 47.2% (25/53) of patients were upgraded to high-grade PCa, and 1.2% (1/84) of patients were downgraded to low-grade PCa. Only the Rotterdam app demonstrated good calibration for detecting high-grade PCa in the biopsy cohort. The discriminative ability for both PCa (AUC: 0.779 vs 0.687; DeLong's method: P<.001) and high-grade PCa (AUC: 0.862 vs 0.758; P<.001) was significantly better for the Rotterdam app. In the prostatectomy cohort, there was no significant difference between both apps (AUC: 0.857 vs 0.777; P=.128). CONCLUSIONS: The Rotterdam and Coral apps can be applied to the Taiwanese cohort with accuracy. The Rotterdam app outperformed the Coral app in the prediction of PCa and high-grade PCa. Despite the small size of the prostatectomy cohort, both apps, to some extent, demonstrated the predictive capacity for true high-grade PCa, confirmed by the whole prostate specimen. Following our external validation, the Rotterdam app might be a good alternative to help detect PCa and high-grade PCa for Taiwanese men.",2020,10.2196/16322,22,12,e16322,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*diagnosis and *mHealth and *mobile apps and *prostate cancer and *prostate-specific antigen and *risk calculator and Aged and Cohort Studies and diagnosis and Humans and Male and mHealth and Middle Aged and Mobile Applications/*standards and mobile apps and prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment/*methods and risk calculator and Taiwan,NA,NA,2020/12/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Giesler_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Effect of a Website That Presents Patients' Experiences on Self-Efficacy and Patient Competence of Colorectal Cancer Patients: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial,"Giesler, Jurgen M. and Keller, Bettina and Repke, Tim and Leonhart, Rainer and Weis, Joachim and Muckelbauer, Rebecca and Rieckmann, Nina and Muller-Nordhorn, Jacqueline and Lucius-Hoene, Gabriele and Holmberg, Christine",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Patients often seek other patients' experiences with the disease. The Internet provides a wide range of opportunities to share and learn about other people's health and illness experiences via blogs or patient-initiated online discussion groups. There also exists a range of medical information devices that include experiential patient information. However, there are serious concerns about the use of such experiential information because narratives of others may be powerful and pervasive tools that may hinder informed decision making. The international research network DIPEx (Database of Individual Patients' Experiences) aims to provide scientifically based online information on people's experiences with health and illness to fulfill patients' needs for experiential information, while ensuring that the presented information includes a wide variety of possible experiences. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the colorectal cancer module of the German DIPEx website krankheitserfahrungen.de with regard to self-efficacy for coping with cancer and patient competence. METHODS: In 2015, a Web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted using a two-group between-subjects design and repeated measures. The study sample consisted of individuals who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer within the past 3 years or who had metastasis or recurrent disease. Outcome measures included self-efficacy for coping with cancer and patient competence. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group that had immediate access to the colorectal cancer module for 2 weeks or to a waiting list control group. Outcome criteria were measured at baseline before randomization and at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. RESULTS: The study randomized 212 persons. On average, participants were 54 (SD 11.1) years old, 58.8% (124/211) were female, and 73.6% (156/212) had read or heard stories of other patients online before entering the study, thus excluding any influence of the colorectal cancer module on krankheitserfahrungen.de. No intervention effects were found at 2 and 6 weeks after baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the website studied may increase self-efficacy for coping with cancer or patient competencies such as self-regulation or managing emotional distress. Possible explanations may involve characteristics of the website itself, its use by participants, or methodological reasons. Future studies aimed at evaluating potential effects of websites providing patient experiences on the basis of methodological principles such as those of DIPEx might profit from extending the range of outcome measures, from including additional measures of website usage behavior and users' motivation, and from expanding concepts, such as patient competency to include items that more directly reflect patients' perceived effects of using such a website.

Melville_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Comparison and Calibration of a Wrist-Worn Blood Pressure Monitor for Patient Management: Assessing the Reliability of Innovative Blood Pressure Devices,"Melville, Sarah and Teskey, Robert and Philip, Shona and Simpson, Jeremy A. and Lutchmedial, Sohrab and Brunt, Keith R.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend monitoring of blood pressure at home using an automatic blood pressure device for the management of hypertension. Devices are not often calibrated against direct blood pressure measures, leaving health care providers and patients with less reliable information than is possible with current technology. Rigorous assessments of medical devices are necessary for establishing clinical utility. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was 2-fold: (1) to assess the validity and perform iterative calibration of indirect blood pressure measurements by a noninvasive wrist cuff blood pressure device in direct comparison with simultaneously recorded peripheral and central intra-arterial blood pressure measurements and (2) to assess the validity of the measurements thereafter of the noninvasive wrist cuff blood pressure device in comparison with measurements by a noninvasive upper arm blood pressure device to the Canadian hypertension guidelines. METHODS: The cloud-based blood pressure algorithms for an oscillometric wrist cuff device were iteratively calibrated to direct pressure measures in 20 consented patient participants. We then assessed measurement validity of the device, using Bland-Altman analysis during routine cardiovascular catheterization. RESULTS: The precalibrated absolute mean difference between direct intra-arterial to wrist cuff pressure measurements were 10.8 (SD 9.7) for systolic and 16.1 (SD 6.3) for diastolic. The postcalibrated absolute mean difference was 7.2 (SD 5.1) for systolic and 4.3 (SD 3.3) for diastolic pressures. This is an improvement in accuracy of 33% systolic and 73% diastolic with a 48% reduction in the variability for both measures. Furthermore, the wrist cuff device demonstrated similar sensitivity in measuring high blood pressure compared with the direct intra-arterial method. The device, when calibrated to direct aortic pressures, demonstrated the potential to reduce a treatment gap in high blood pressure measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The systolic pressure measurements of the wrist cuff have been iteratively calibrated using gold standard central (ascending aortic) pressure. This improves the accuracy of the indirect measures and potentially reduces the treatment gap. Devices that undergo auscultatory (indirect) calibration for licensing can be greatly improved by additional iterative calibration via intra-arterial (direct) measures of blood pressure. Further clinical trials with repeated use of the device over time are needed to assess the reliability of the device in accordance with current and evolving guidelines for informed decision making in the management of hypertension.

Frias_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Effectiveness of Digital Medicines to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes: Prospective, Open-Label, Cluster-Randomized Pilot Clinical Trial","Frias, Juan and Virdi, Naunihal and Raja, Praveen and Kim, Yoona and Savage, George and Osterberg, Lars",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are major modifiable risk factors for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and kidney diseases. Reasons for poor disease control include nonadherence, lack of patient engagement, and therapeutic inertia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact on clinic-measured blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using a digital medicine offering (DMO) that measures medication ingestion adherence, physical activity, and rest using digital medicines (medication taken with ingestible sensor), wearable sensor patches, and a mobile device app. METHODS: Participants with elevated systolic BP (SBP <e2><89><a5>140 mm Hg) and HbA1c (<e2><89><a5>7%) failing antihypertensive (<e2><89><a5>2 medications) and oral diabetes therapy were enrolled in this three-arm, 12-week, cluster-randomized study. Participants used DMO (includes digital medicines, the wearable sensor patch, and the mobile device app) for 4 or 12 weeks or received usual care based on site randomization. Providers in the DMO arms could review the DMO data via a Web portal. In all three arms, providers were instructed to make medical decisions (medication titration, adherence counseling, education, and lifestyle coaching) on all available clinical information at each visit. Primary outcome was change in SBP at week 4. Other outcomes included change in SBP and HbA1c at week 12, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at weeks 4 and 12, as well as proportion of patients at BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg) at weeks 4 and 12, medical decisions, and medication adherence patterns. RESULTS: Final analysis included 109 participants (12 sites; age: mean 58.7, SD years; female: 49.5%, 54/109; Hispanic: 45.9%, 50/109; income <e2><89><a4> US $20,000: 56.9%, 62/109; and <e2><89><a4> high school education: 52.3%, 57/109). The DMO groups had 80 participants (7 sites) and usual care had 29 participants (5 sites). At week 4, DMO resulted in a statistically greater SBP reduction than usual care (mean -21.8, SE 1.5 mm Hg vs mean -12.7, SE 2.8 mmHg; mean difference -9.1, 95% CI -14.0 to -3.3 mm Hg) and maintained a greater reduction at week 12. The DMO groups had greater reductions in HbA1c, DBP, and LDL-C, and a greater proportion of participants at BP goal at weeks 4 and 12 compared with usual care. The DMO groups also received more therapeutic interventions than usual care. Medication adherence was <e2><89><a5>80% while using the DMO. The most common adverse event was a self-limited rash at the wearable sensor site (12%, 10/82). CONCLUSIONS: For patients failing hypertension and diabetes oral therapy, this DMO, which provides dose-by-dose feedback on medication ingestion adherence, can help lower BP, HbA1c, and LDL-C, and promote patient engagement and provider decision making.

Iftikhar_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Health-Seeking Influence Reflected by Online Health-Related Messages Received on Social Media: Cross-Sectional Survey,"Iftikhar, Rahila and Abaalkhail, Bahaa",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Major social networking platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter, have become popular means through which people share health-related information, irrespective of whether messages disseminated through these channels are authentic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the demographic characteristics of patients that may demonstrate their attitudes toward medical information shared on social media networks. Second, we address how information found through social media affects the way people deal with their health. Third, we examine whether patients initiate or alter/discontinue their medications based on information derived from social media. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between April and June 2015 on patients attending outpatient clinics at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Patients who used social media (Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter) were included. We designed a questionnaire with closed-ended and multiple-choice questions to assess the type of social media platforms patients used and whether information received on these platforms influenced their health care decisions. We used chi-square test to establish the relationship between categorical variables. RESULTS: Of the 442 patients who filled in the questionnaires, 401 used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Twitter. The majority of respondents (89.8%, 397/442) used WhatsApp, followed by Facebook (58.6%, 259/442) and Twitter (42.3%, 187/442). In most cases, respondents received health-related messages from WhatsApp and approximately 42.6% (171/401) reported ever stopping treatment as advised on a social media platform. A significantly higher proportion of patients without heart disease (P=.001) and obese persons (P=.01) checked the authenticity of information received on social media. Social media messages influenced decision making among patients without heart disease (P=.04). Respondents without heart disease (P=.001) and obese persons (P=.01) were more likely to discuss health-related information received on social media channels with a health care professional. A significant proportion of WhatsApp users reported that health-related information received on this platform influenced decisions regarding their family's health care (P=.001). Respondents' decisions regarding family health care were more likely to be influenced when they used two or all three types of platforms (P=.003).

Meylakhs_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,An AIDS-denialist online community on a Russian social networking service: patterns of interactions with newcomers and rhetorical strategies of persuasion,"Meylakhs, Peter and Rykov, Yuri and Koltsova, Olessia and Koltsov, Sergey",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The rise of social media proved to be a fertile ground for the expansion of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-denialist movement (in the form of online communities). While there is substantial literature devoted to disproving AIDS-denialist views, there is a lack of studies exploring AIDS-denialists online communities that interact with an external environment. OBJECTIVE: We explored three research areas: (1) reasons for newcomers to come to an AIDS-denialist community, (2) the patterns of interactions of the community with the newcomers, and (3) rhetorical strategies that denialists use for persuasion in the veracity of their views. METHODS: We studied the largest AIDS-denialist community on one of the most popular social networking services in Russia. We used netnography as a method for collecting data for qualitative analysis and observed the community for 9 months (at least 2-3 times a week). While doing netnography, we periodically downloaded community discussions. In total, we downloaded 4821 posts and comments for analysis. Grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Most users came to the community for the following reasons: their stories did not fit the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression translated by popular medical discourse, health problems, concern about HIV-positive tests, and desire to dissuade community members from false AIDS beliefs. On the basis of strength in AIDS-denialist beliefs, we constructed a typology of the newcomers consisting of three ideal-typical groups: (1) convinced: those who already had become denialists before coming to the group, (2) doubters: those who were undecided about the truth of either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) science theory or AIDS-denialist theory, and (3) orthodox: those who openly held HIV science views. Reception of a newcomer mainly depended on the newcomer's belief status. Reception was very warm for the convinced, cold or slightly hostile for the doubters, and extremely hostile or derisive for the orthodox. We identified seven main rhetorical strategies of persuasion used by the denialists on the ""undecided"". CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the widespread public health depiction of AIDS denialists as totally irrational, our study suggests that some of those who become AIDS denialists have sufficiently reasonable grounds to suspect that ""something is wrong"" with scientific theory, because their personal experience contradicts the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression. Odd and inexplicable practices of some AIDS centers only fuel these people's suspicions. We can conclude that public health practitioners' practices may play a role in generating AIDS-denialist sentiments. In interactions with the newcomers, the experienced community members highlighted the importance of personal autonomy and freedom of choice in decision making consistent with the consumerist ideology of health care. The study findings suggest that health care workers should change a one-size-fits-all mode of counseling for a more complex and patient-tailored approach, allowing for diversity of disease progression scenarios and scientific uncertainty.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3338,16,11,e261,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Denial, Psychological and *Social Media and *Social Networking and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*psychology and AIDS denialists and consumer health information and Consumer Health Information and Humans and Information Seeking Behavior and Internet and netnography, qualitative research and online communities and Persuasive Communication and quality of health information on the Internet and Russia",NA,NA,2014/11/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Park_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Health-Related Internet Use by Informal Caregivers of Children and Adolescents: An Integrative Literature Review,"Park, Eunhee and Kim, Heejung and Steinhoff, Andreanna",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based health resources can support informal caregivers who are caring for children or adolescents with health care needs. However, few studies discriminate informal caregivers' needs from those of their care recipients or those of people caring for adults. OBJECTIVE: This study reviews the literature of health-related Internet use among informal caregivers of children and adolescents. METHODS: A total of 17 studies were selected from literature searches conducted in 6 electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and EMBASE. All databases searches were limited to articles published in the years 2004 to 2014 in peer-reviewed publications. Search terms consisted of ""health-related Internet use,"" ""eHealth,"" ""Internet use for health-related purpose(s),"" ""Web-based resource(s),"" and ""online resources,"" combined with informal caregiver (or ""parents"") of ""child,"" ""adolescent,"" ""student,"" ""youth,"" and ""teen."" The age range of the children receiving care was limited to younger than 22 years. Their informal caregivers were defined as persons (parents) who provided unpaid care or assistance to a child or an adolescent with health problems. RESULTS: Among 17 empirical studies, the majority of informal caregivers of children with medical issues were the parents. Quantitative studies (14/17, 77%) reported prevalence and predictors of health-related Internet use, while mixed-methods and qualitative studies (3/17, 24%) investigated informal caregiver perceptions of helpful health-related Internet use and barriers of use. The prevalence of health-related Internet use varied (11%-90%) dependent upon how health-related Internet use was operationalized and measured. Disease-specific information was used for decision making about treatment, while social support via virtual communities and email were used for informal caregiver emotional needs. A digital divide of Internet access was identified in lower educated minorities. Most studies had methodological challenges resulting from convenience sampling, cross-sectional surveys, lack of theoretical frameworks, or no clear definitions of health-related Internet use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an important understanding of how family members use Internet-based information and support systems during child caregiving. Healthcare providers and policy makers should integrate family needs into their current practices and policies.

Kazley_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Social Media Use Among Living Kidney Donors and Recipients: Survey on Current Practice and Potential,"Kazley, Abby Swanson and Hamidi, Bashir and Balliet, Wendy and Baliga, Prabhakar",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, there is a national shortage of organs donated for transplant. Among the solid organs, most often kidneys are donated by living donors, but the lack of information and complicated processes limit the number of individuals who serve as living kidney donors. Social media can be a tool for advocacy, educating the public about the need, process, and outcomes of live kidney donors, yet little is known about social media use by kidney transplant patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the social media use of potential kidney transplant patients and their willingness to use social media and their networks to advocate and educate about living kidney donation. METHODS: Using a validated survey, we modified the instrument to apply to the patient population of interest attending the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA. The questions on the survey inquired about current social media use, sites visited, frequency and duration of social media use, and willingness to use social media to share the need for living kidney donors. We asked patients who had received a transplant and those awaiting a transplant to complete the survey during an office visit. Participation was voluntary. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients completed the survey. Approximately half of all kidney transplant patients surveyed used social media (104/199, 52.3%), and approximately one-third (66/199, 33.2%) had more than 100 friends in their social media network. Facebook was the most popular site, and 51% (102/199) reported that they would be willing to post information about living kidney donation on their social networks. More than a quarter of the sample (75/199, 37.7%) had posted about their health status in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Social media holds great promise for health-related education and awareness. Our study shows the current social media use of kidney transplant patients. In turn, such information can be used to design interventions to ensure appropriate decision making about live kidney donation. Transplant programs can help increase the number of living donors by providing guidance to kidney transplant patients in how to use social media, to be advocates, and to provide information about living kidney donation to their social network.",2016,10.2196/jmir.6176,18,12,e328,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,social media and United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Health Status and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and *social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and *Kidney Transplantation and kidney transplant and Health Education/*methods and *kidney transplant and *living kidney donation and Living Donors and living kidney donation,NA,NA,2016/12/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to identify experiences with and barriers to self-monitoring of blood glucose, insulin injection, and insulin titration among patients with T2DM. Our research team developed a computer-assisted insulin self-titration system, called PANDIT. The secondary aim of this study was to evaluate patients' perceptions of computer-assisted insulin self-titration. We included patients who used PANDIT in a 4-week pilot study as well as patients who had never used such a system. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with patients on insulin therapy who were randomly recruited from a university hospital and surrounding general practices in the Netherlands. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed qualitatively. To classify the textual remarks, we created a codebook during the analysis, in a bottom-up and iterative fashion. To support examination of the final coded data, we used three theories from the field of health psychology and the integrated model of user satisfaction and technology acceptance by Wixom and Todd. RESULTS: When starting insulin therapy, some patients feared a lifelong commitment to insulin therapy and disease progression. Also, many barriers arose when implementing insulin therapy (eg, some patients were embarrassed to inject insulin in public). Furthermore, patients had difficulties increasing the insulin dose because they fear hypoglycemia, they associate higher insulin doses with disease progression, and some were ignorant of treatment targets. Patients who never used a computer-assisted insulin self-titration system felt they had enough knowledge to know when their insulin should be adjusted, but still believed that the system advice would be useful to confirm their reasoning. Furthermore, the time and effort saved with automated insulin advice was considered an advantage. Patients who had used PANDIT found the system useful if their glycemic regulation improved. Nevertheless, for some patients, the absence of personal contact with their caregiver was a drawback. While guidelines state that adjustment of basal insulin dose based on fasting plasma glucose values is sufficient, both patients who had and those who had not used PANDIT felt that such a system should take more patient data into consideration, such as lifestyle and diet factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients encounter multiple obstacles when implementing insulin therapy. Computer-assisted insulin self-titration can increase patient awareness of treatment targets and increase their confidence in self-adjusting the insulin dose. Nevertheless, some barriers may still exist when using computer-assisted titration systems and these systems could also introduce new barriers.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3198,16,10,e235,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Blood Glucose/*metabolism and clinical decision support systems and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*drug therapy/*psychology and Female and Humans and Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage and Insulin/*administration & dosage and Male and Middle Aged and patient acceptance of health care and Pilot Projects and Self Care/*psychology and Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Type 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,NA,2014/10/23/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jimenez_2020_JoofmeInre_1,JOUR,Improving the Primary Care Consultation for Diabetes and Depression Through Digital Medical Interview Assistant Systems: Narrative Review,"Jimenez, Geronimo and Tyagi, Shilpa and Osman, Tarig and Spinazze, Pier and van der Kleij, Rianne and Chavannes, Niels H. and Car, Josip",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Digital medical interview assistant (DMIA) systems, also known as computer-assisted history taking (CAHT) systems, have the potential to improve the quality of care and the medical consultation by exploring more patient-related aspects without time constraints and, therefore, acquiring more and better-quality information prior to the face-to-face consultation. The consultation in primary care is the broadest in terms of the amount of topics to be covered and, at the same time, the shortest in terms of time spent with the patient. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to explore how DMIA systems may be used specifically in the context of primary care, to improve the consultations for diabetes and depression, as exemplars of chronic conditions. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted focusing on (1) the characteristics of the primary care consultation in general, and for diabetes and depression specifically, and (2) the impact of DMIA and CAHT systems on the medical consultation. Through thematic analysis, we identified the characteristics of the primary care consultation that a DMIA system would be able to improve. Based on the identified primary care consultation tasks and the potential benefits of DMIA systems, we developed a sample questionnaire for diabetes and depression to illustrate how such a system may work. RESULTS: A DMIA system, prior to the first consultation, could aid in the essential primary care tasks of case finding and screening, diagnosing, and, if needed, timely referral to specialists or urgent care. Similarly, for follow-up consultations, this system could aid with the control and monitoring of these conditions, help check for additional health issues, and update the primary care provider about visits to other providers or further testing. Successfully implementing a DMIA system for these tasks would improve the quality of the data obtained, which means earlier diagnosis and treatment. Such a system would improve the use of face-to-face consultation time, thereby streamlining the interaction and allowing the focus to be the patient's needs, which ultimately would lead to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, for such a system to be successfully incorporated, there are important considerations to be taken into account, such as the language to be used and the challenges for implementing eHealth innovations in primary care and health care in general. CONCLUSIONS: Given the benefits explored here, we foresee that DMIA systems could have an important impact in the primary care consultation for diabetes and depression and, potentially, for other chronic conditions. Earlier case finding and a more accurate diagnosis, due to more and better-quality data, paired with improved monitoring of disease progress should improve the quality of care and keep the management of chronic conditions at the primary care level. A somewhat simple, easily scalable technology could go a long way to improve the health of the millions of people affected with chronic conditions, especially if working in conjunction with already-established health technologies such as electronic medical records and clinical decision support systems.",2020,10.2196/18109,22,8,e18109,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*chronic conditions and *digital medical interview assistant, computer-assisted history taking and *primary care and chronic conditions and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*organization & administration and Depression/*therapy and Diabetes Mellitus/*therapy and digital medical interview assistant, computer-assisted history taking and Humans and Narrative Medicine and primary care and Primary Health Care/*organization & administration and Referral and Consultation/*organization & administration and Telemedicine/*methods",NA,NA,2020/08/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the prevalence of the procedure, stigma surrounding abortion in Canada leads to barriers for women to access this service. The vast majority of care is concentrated in urban settings. There is evidence to support utilization of innovative mobile and other technology solutions to empower women to safely and effectively self-manage aspects of the abortion process. This study is part 1 of a 3-phase study that utilizes user-centered design methodology to develop a digital health solution to specifically support follow-up after an induced surgical abortion. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) understand how women at 3 surgical abortion clinics in an urban center of British Columbia utilize their mobile phones to access health care information and (2) understand women's preferences of content and design of an intervention that will support follow-up care after an induced abortion, including contraceptive use. METHODS: The study design was based on development-evaluation-implementation process from Medical Research Council Framework for Complex Medical Interventions. This was a mixed-methods formative study. Women (aged 14-45 years) were recruited from 3 urban abortion facilities in British Columbia who underwent an induced abortion. Adaptation of validated surveys and using the technology acceptance model and theory of reasoned action, a cross-sectional survey was designed. Interview topics included demographic information; type of wireless device used; cell phone usage; acceptable information to include in a mobile intervention to support women's abortion care; willingness to use a mobile phone to obtain reproductive health information; optimal strategies to use a mobile intervention to support women; understand preferences for health information resources; and design qualities in a mobile intervention important for ease of use, privacy, and security. Responses to questions in the survey were summarized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis was conducted with NVivo using a thematic analysis approach. This study was approved by the local ethics board. RESULTS: A waiting-room survey was completed by 50 participants, and semistructured interviews were completed with 8 participants. The average age of participants was 26 years. Furthermore, 94% (47/50) owned a smartphone, 85% (41/48) used their personal phones to go online, and 85% would use their cell phone to assist in clinical care. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that women prefer a comprehensive website that included secure email or text notifications to provide tools and resources for emotional well-being, contraceptive decision making, general sexual health, and postprocedure care. CONCLUSIONS: A community-based mixed-methods approach allowed us to understand how women use their cell phones and what women desire in a mobile intervention to support their postabortion care. The findings from this formative phase will assist in the development and testing of a mobile intervention to support follow-up care after an induced surgical abortion.",2019,10.2196/13387,21,5,e13387,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*abortion, induced and *digital health and *family planning and *mHealth and *sexual health and *user-centered design and abortion, induced and Adolescent and Adult and Aftercare/*methods and British Columbia and Cell Phone/*statistics & numerical data and digital health and family planning and Feasibility Studies and Female and Humans and mHealth and Pregnancy and Research Design and sexual health and user-centered design and Young Adult",NA,NA,2019/05/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Saeb_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Scalable Passive Sleep Monitoring Using Mobile Phones: Opportunities and Obstacles,"Saeb, Sohrab and Cybulski, Thaddeus R. and Schueller, Stephen M. and Kording, Konrad P. and Mohr, David C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Sleep is a critical aspect of people's well-being and as such assessing sleep is an important indicator of a person's health. Traditional methods of sleep assessment are either time- and resource-intensive or suffer from self-reporting biases. Recently, researchers have started to use mobile phones to passively assess sleep in individuals' daily lives. However, this work remains in its early stages, having only examined relatively small and homogeneous populations in carefully controlled contexts. Thus, it remains an open question as to how well mobile device-based sleep monitoring generalizes to larger populations in typical use cases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of machine learning algorithms to detect the sleep start and end times for the main sleep period in a 24-h cycle using mobile devices in a diverse sample. METHODS: We collected mobile phone sensor data as well as daily self-reported sleep start and end times from 208 individuals (171 females; 37 males), diverse in age (18-66 years; mean 39.3), education, and employment status, across the United States over 6 weeks. Sensor data consisted of geographic location, motion, light, sound, and in-phone activities. No specific instructions were given to the participants regarding phone placement. We used random forest classifiers to develop both personalized and global predictors of sleep state from the phone sensor data. RESULTS: Using all available sensor features, the average accuracy of classifying whether a 10-min segment was reported as sleep was 88.8%. This is somewhat better than using the time of day alone, which gives an average accuracy of 86.9%. The accuracy of the model considerably varied across the participants, ranging from 65.1% to 97.3%. We found that low accuracy in some participants was due to two main factors: missing sensor data and misreports. After correcting for these, the average accuracy increased to 91.8%, corresponding to an average median absolute deviation (MAD) of 38 min for sleep start time detection and 36 min for sleep end time. These numbers are close to the range reported by previous research in more controlled situations. CONCLUSIONS: We find that mobile phones provide adequate sleep monitoring in typical use cases, and that our methods generalize well to a broader population than has previously been studied. However, we also observe several types of data artifacts when collecting data in uncontrolled settings. Some of these can be resolved through corrections, but others likely impose a ceiling on the accuracy of sleep prediction for certain subjects. Future research will need to focus more on the understanding of people's behavior in their natural settings in order to develop sleep monitoring tools that work reliably in all cases for all people.",2017,10.2196/jmir.6821,19,4,e118,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*classification and *decision trees and *mobile phones and *sleep monitoring and Adolescent and Adult and Aged and Cell Phone/*instrumentation and classification and Data Collection and decision trees and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and mobile phones and Polysomnography/*instrumentation/methods and sleep monitoring and Sleep/*physiology and Young Adult,NA,NA,2017/04/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is crucial to delineate contact lens-associated dry eye's multifaceted nature to tailor treatment to each patient's individual needs for future personalized medicine. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to quantify and stratify individual subjective symptoms of contact lens-associated dry eye and clarify its risk factors for future personalized medicine using the smartphone app DryEyeRhythm (Juntendo University). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included iPhone (Apple Inc) users in Japan who downloaded DryEyeRhythm. DryEyeRhythm was used to collect medical big data related to contact lens-associated dry eye between November 2016 and January 2018. The main outcome measure was the incidence of contact lens-associated dry eye. Univariate and multivariate adjusted odds ratios of risk factors for contact lens-associated dry eye were determined by logistic regression analyses. The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm was used to depict the stratification of subjective symptoms of contact lens-associated dry eye. RESULTS: The records of 4454 individuals (median age 27.9 years, SD 12.6), including 2972 female participants (66.73%), who completed all surveys were included in this study. Among the included participants, 1844 (41.40%) were using contact lenses, and among those who used contact lenses, 1447 (78.47%) had contact lens-associated dry eye. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios of risk factors for contact lens-associated dry eye were as follows: younger age, 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99); female sex, 1.53 (95% CI 1.05-2.24); hay fever, 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-1.74); mental illness other than depression or schizophrenia, 2.51 (95% CI 1.13-5.57); past diagnosis of dry eye, 2.21 (95% CI 1.63-2.99); extended screen exposure time >8 hours, 1.61 (95% CI 1.13-2.28); and smoking, 2.07 (95% CI 1.49-2.88). The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis visualized and stratified 14 groups based on the subjective symptoms of contact lens-associated dry eye.

No systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of individual real-time video counseling for addressing each of the risk factors for smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and obesity. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of individually delivered real-time video counseling on risk factors for smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and obesity. METHODS: The MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), PsycINFO, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched for eligible studies published up to November 21, 2019. Eligible studies were randomized or cluster randomized trials that tested the effectiveness of individual real-time video communication interventions on smoking, nutrition, alcohol, physical activity, and obesity in any population or setting; the comparator was a no-intervention control group or any other mode of support (eg, telephone); and an English-language publication. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were eligible. Four studies targeted smoking, 3 alcohol, 3 physical activity, and 3 obesity. In 2 of the physical activity studies, real-time video counseling was found to significantly increase physical activity when compared with usual care at week 9 and after 5 years. Two obesity studies found a significant change in BMI between a video counseling and a documents group, with significantly greater weight loss in the video counseling group than the in-person as well as the control groups. One study found that those in the video counseling group were significantly more likely than those in the telephone counseling group to achieve smoking cessation. The remaining studies found no significant differences between video counseling and telephone counseling or face-to-face counseling for smoking cessation, video counseling and face-to-face treatment on alcohol consumption, video counseling and no counseling for physical activity, and video counseling and face-to-face treatment on BMI. The global methodological quality rating was moderate in 1 physical activity study, whereas 12 studies had a weak global rating. CONCLUSIONS: Video counseling is potentially more effective than a control group or other modes of support in addressing physical inactivity and obesity and is not less effective in modifying smoking and alcohol consumption. Further research is required to determine the relative benefits of video counseling in terms of other policy and practice decision-making factors such as costs and feasibility.",2020,10.2196/18621,22,9,e18621,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*alcohol drinking and *diet and *mobile phone and *obesity and *physical activity and *smoking cessation and *telehealth and *videoconferencing and alcohol drinking and Alcohol Drinking/*psychology and Counseling/*methods and diet and Exercise/*psychology and Female and Humans and Male and mobile phone and Nutritional Status/*physiology and obesity and Obesity/*psychology and physical activity and Risk Factors and smoking cessation and Smoking/*psychology and telehealth and Telemedicine/*methods and videoconferencing,NA,NA,2020/09/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This pilot project sought to deploy the HoloLens2 MR device to support the delivery of remote care in COVID-19 hospital environments. METHODS: A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted. RESULTS: The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users.

Zhang_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Social Jetlag and Chronotypes in the Chinese Population: Analysis of Data Recorded by Wearable Devices,"Zhang, Zhongxing and Cajochen, Christian and Khatami, Ramin",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Chronotype is the propensity for a person to sleep at a particular time during 24 hours. It is largely regulated by the circadian clock but constrained by work obligations to a specific sleep schedule. The discrepancy between biological and social time can be described as social jetlag (SJL), which is highly prevalent in modern society and associated with health problems. SJL and chronotypes have been widely studied in Western countries but have never been described in China. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the chronotypes and SJL in mainland China objectively by analyzing a database of Chinese sleep-wake pattern recorded by up-to-date wearable devices. METHODS: We analyzed 71,176 anonymous Chinese people who were continuously recorded by wearable devices for at least one week between April and July in 2017. Chronotypes were assessed (N=49,573) by the adjusted mid-point of sleep on free days (MSFsc). Early, intermediate, and late chronotypes were defined by arbitrary cut-offs of MSFsc <3 hours, between 3-5 hours, and >5 hours. In all subjects, SJL was calculated as the difference between mid-points of sleep on free days and work days. The correlations between SJL and age/body mass index/MSFsc were assessed by Pearson correlation. Random forest was used to characterize which factors (ie, age, body mass index, sex, nocturnal and daytime sleep durations, and exercise) mostly contribute to SJL and MSFsc. RESULTS: The mean total sleep duration of this Chinese sample is about 7 hours, with females sleeping on average 17 minutes longer than males. People taking longer naps sleep less during the night, but they have longer total 24-hour sleep durations. MSFsc follows a normal distribution, and the percentages of early, intermediate, and late chronotypes are approximately 26.76% (13,266/49,573), 58.59% (29,045/49,573), and 14.64% (7257/49,573). Adolescents are later types compared to adults. Age is the most important predictor of MSFsc suggested by our random forest model (relative feature importance: 0.772). No gender differences are found in chronotypes. We found that SJL follows a normal distribution and 17.07% (12,151/71,176) of Chinese have SJL longer than 1 hour. Nearly a third (22,442/71,176, 31.53%) of Chinese have SJL<0. The results showed that 53.72% (7127/13,266), 25.46% (7396/29,045), and 12.71% (922/7257) of the early, intermediate, and late chronotypes have SJL<0, respectively. SJL correlates with MSFsc (r=0.54, P<.001) but not with body mass index (r=0.004, P=.30). Random forest model suggests that age, nocturnal sleep, and daytime nap durations are the features contributing to SJL (their relative feature importance is 0.441, 0.349, and 0.204, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a higher proportion of early compared to late chronotypes in Chinese. Chinese have less SJL than the results reported in European populations, and more than half of the early chronotypes have negative SJL. In the Chinese population, SJL is not associated with body mass index. People of later chronotypes and long sleepers suffer more from SJL.",2019,10.2196/13482,21,6,e13482,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*big data and *cardiopulmonary coupling and *chronotypes and *nap and *sleep and *Social Behavior and *social jetlag and *wearable devices and Adult and big data and cardiopulmonary coupling and China and chronotypes and Data Analysis and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and nap and sleep and Sleep Wake Disorders/*diagnosis and social jetlag and Surveys and Questionnaires and Time Factors and wearable devices and Wearable Electronic Devices/*standards and Young Adult,NA,NA,2019/05/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gilljam_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Impact of an Electronic Health Service on Child Participation in Pediatric Oncology Care: Quasiexperimental Study,"Gilljam, Britt-Mari and Nygren, Jens M. and Svedberg, Petra and Arvidsson, Susann",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: For children 6-12 years old, there is a shortage of electronic Health (eHealth) services that promote their participation in health care. Therefore, a digital communication tool, called Sisom, was developed to give children a voice in their health care. Children with long-term diseases want to be more involved in their health care and have the right to receive information, be listened to, express their opinions, and participate in decision making in health care. However, the outcomes of using Sisom in practice at pediatric oncology clinics have not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate children's participation during appointments with pediatricians at pediatric oncology clinics, with or without the use of the eHealth service Sisom. METHODS: A quasiexperimental design with mixed methods was used. We analyzed 27 filmed appointments with pediatricians for 14 children (8 girls and 6 boys) aged 6-12 years (mean 8.3 years) with a cancer diagnosis. The intervention group consisted of children who used Sisom prior to their appointments with pediatricians at a pediatric oncology clinic, and the control group consisted of children who had appointments with pediatricians at 4 pediatric oncology clinics. Data from observations from the videos were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The quantitative analysis included manual calculations of how many times the pediatricians spoke directly to the children, the proportion of the appointment time that the children were talking, and levels of participation by the children. For the qualitative analysis, we used directed content analysis to analyze the children's levels of participation guided by a framework based on Shier's model of participation. RESULTS: Pediatricians directed a greater proportion of their discussion toward the child in the intervention group (731 occasions) than in the control group (624 occasions), but the proportion of the appointment time the children talked was almost the same for both the intervention and control groups (mean 17.0 minutes vs 17.6 minutes). The levels of participation corresponded to the first three levels of Shier's participation model: children were listened to, children were supported to express their views, and children's views were taken into account. The results showed an increased level of participation by the children in the intervention group. Several codes that were found did not fit into any of the existing categories, and a new category was thus formed: children received information. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the eHealth service Sisom can increase children's participation during appointments with health care professionals. Further studies employing a randomized control design focusing on the effects of eHealth services on children's health outcomes, perceived participation, and cost-effectiveness could make a significant contribution to guiding the implementation of eHealth services in pediatric care.",2020,10.2196/17673,22,7,e17673,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*cancer and *child care and *communication and *eHealth and *patient participation and cancer and Child and child care and communication and eHealth and Electronics/*standards and Female and Health Services/*standards and Humans and Male and Medical Oncology/*methods and Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and patient participation and Patient Participation/*methods,NA,NA,2020/07/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kwakernaak_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Patients' Use of the Internet to Find Reliable Medical Information About Minor Ailments: Vignette-Based Experimental Study,"Kwakernaak, Joyce and Eekhof, Just A. H. and De Waal, Margot W. M. and Barenbrug, Elisabeth A. M. and Chavannes, Niels H.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the exact process of how patients search for medical information on the internet and what they retrieve. There is especially a paucity of literature on browsing for information on minor ailments, a term used for harmless diseases that are very common in the general population and thus have a significant impact on health care. OBJECTIVE: This vignette-based experimental study aimed to explore what kind of Web-based search strategies are applied and how search strategies, demographic characteristics, and the quality of the visited websites relate to finding the right diagnosis. Additional goals were to describe how searching on the Web influences one's perception of the severity of the potential diagnosis and whether or not the participants would discuss the information they found on the internet with their doctors. METHODS: Out of 1372 survey participants, 355 were randomly sampled, and 155 of them were recruited and assigned to one of four clinical scenarios. Each search term they used was classified as one of three search strategies: (1) hypothesis testing, (2) narrowing within the general hypothesis area, and (3) symptom exploration. The quality of the websites used was determined by using the DISCERN instrument. To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the participants before and after the internet search, a McNemar test was used. Chi-square tests were used to describe which factors are related to the chosen search strategy. A multivariate binary logistic regression model was constructed to predict which factors are related to finding a sound diagnosis after searching the internet for health information. RESULTS: Most participants (65.8%, 102/155) used the symptom exploration strategy. However, this depends on the assigned scenario (P<.001) and the self-estimated severity score of the symptoms before the internet search (P=.001). A significant relation was found between choosing an accurate diagnosis and age (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and the clinical scenario, as well as the use of high-quality websites (OR 7.49, 95% CI 1.85 to 30.26). Browsing the internet did not lead to a statistically significant change in participants' beliefs about the severity of the condition (McNemar test, P=.85). Most participants (65%) shared their retrieved information with their physician and most of them (75%) received a positive response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most patients use a symptom-based approach; however, if patients expect the potential diagnosis to be severe, they tend to use a hypothesis verification strategy more often and are therefore prone to certain forms of bias. In addition, self-diagnosing accuracy is related to younger age, the symptom scenario, and the use of high-quality websites. We should find ways to guide patients toward search strategies and websites that may more likely lead to accurate decision making.",2019,10.2196/12278,21,11,e12278,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*adult and *consumer health information and *diagnosis and *humans and *information seeking behaviour and *internet and Adolescent and adult and Adult and Aged and consumer health information and Consumer Health Information/*methods and diagnosis and Female and humans and Humans and information seeking behaviour and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and internet and Internet and Male and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Young Adult,NA,NA,2019/11/11/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Afzal_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Clinical Context-Aware Biomedical Text Summarization Using Deep Neural Network: Model Development and Validation,"Afzal, Muhammad and Alam, Fakhare and Malik, Khalid Mahmood and Malik, Ghaus M.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Automatic text summarization (ATS) enables users to retrieve meaningful evidence from big data of biomedical repositories to make complex clinical decisions. Deep neural and recurrent networks outperform traditional machine-learning techniques in areas of natural language processing and computer vision; however, they are yet to be explored in the ATS domain, particularly for medical text summarization. OBJECTIVE: Traditional approaches in ATS for biomedical text suffer from fundamental issues such as an inability to capture clinical context, quality of evidence, and purpose-driven selection of passages for the summary. We aimed to circumvent these limitations through achieving precise, succinct, and coherent information extraction from credible published biomedical resources, and to construct a simplified summary containing the most informative content that can offer a review particular to clinical needs. METHODS: In our proposed approach, we introduce a novel framework, termed Biomed-Summarizer, that provides quality-aware Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO)-based intelligent and context-enabled summarization of biomedical text. Biomed-Summarizer integrates the prognosis quality recognition model with a clinical context-aware model to locate text sequences in the body of a biomedical article for use in the final summary. First, we developed a deep neural network binary classifier for quality recognition to acquire scientifically sound studies and filter out others. Second, we developed a bidirectional long-short term memory recurrent neural network as a clinical context-aware classifier, which was trained on semantically enriched features generated using a word-embedding tokenizer for identification of meaningful sentences representing PICO text sequences. Third, we calculated the similarity between query and PICO text sequences using Jaccard similarity with semantic enrichments, where the semantic enrichments are obtained using medical ontologies. Last, we generated a representative summary from the high-scoring PICO sequences aggregated by study type, publication credibility, and freshness score. RESULTS: Evaluation of the prognosis quality recognition model using a large dataset of biomedical literature related to intracranial aneurysm showed an accuracy of 95.41% (2562/2686) in terms of recognizing quality articles. The clinical context-aware multiclass classifier outperformed the traditional machine-learning algorithms, including support vector machine, gradient boosted tree, linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes, by achieving 93% (16127/17341) accuracy for classifying five categories: aim, population, intervention, results, and outcome. The semantic similarity algorithm achieved a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.61 (0-1 scale) on a well-known BIOSSES dataset (with 100 pair sentences) after semantic enrichment, representing an improvement of 8.9% over baseline Jaccard similarity. Finally, we found a highly positive correlation among the evaluations performed by three domain experts concerning different metrics, suggesting that the automated summarization is satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: By employing the proposed method Biomed-Summarizer, high accuracy in ATS was achieved, enabling seamless curation of research evidence from the biomedical literature to use for clinical decision-making.",2020,10.2196/19810,22,10,e19810,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*automatic text summarization and *biomedical informatics and *brain aneurysm and *deep neural network and *Neural Networks, Computer and *semantic similarity and *word embedding and automatic text summarization and biomedical informatics and brain aneurysm and deep neural network and Humans and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Reproducibility of Results and semantic similarity and word embedding",NA,NA,2020/10/23/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can assist prescribers with rapid access to up-to-date information. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the introduction of CDSS for antibiotic prescribing could have a measurable impact. However, interventions to implement them are challenging because of cultural and structural constraints, and their adoption and sustainability in routine clinical care are often limited. Preimplementation research is needed to ensure relevant adaptation and fit within the context of primary care in West Africa. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the requirements for a CDSS adapted to the context of primary care in West Africa, to analyze the barriers and facilitators of its implementation and adaptation, and to ensure co-designed solutions for its adaptation and sustainable use. METHODS: We organized a workshop in Burkina Faso in June 2019 with 47 health care professionals representing 9 West African countries and 6 medical specialties. The workshop began with a presentation of Antibioclic, a publicly funded CDSS for antibiotic prescribing in primary care that provides personalized antibiotic recommendations for 37 infectious diseases. Antibioclic is freely available on the web and as a smartphone app (iOS, Android). The presentation was followed by a roundtable discussion and completion of a questionnaire with open-ended questions by participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Most of the participants had access to a smartphone during their clinical consultations (35/47, 74%), but only 49% (23/47) had access to a computer and none used CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. The participants considered that CDSS could have a number of benefits including updating the knowledge of practitioners on antibiotic prescribing, improving clinical care and reducing AMR, encouraging the establishment of national guidelines, and developing surveillance capabilities in primary care. The most frequently mentioned contextual barrier to implementing a CDSS was the potential risk of increasing self-medication in West Africa, where antibiotics can be bought without a prescription. The need for the CDSS to be tailored to the local epidemiology of infectious diseases and AMR was highlighted along with the availability of diagnostic tests and antibiotics using national guidelines where available. Participants endorsed co-design involving all stakeholders, including nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, as central to any introduction of CDSS. A phased approach was suggested by initiating and evaluating CDSS at a pilot site, followed by dissemination using professional networks and social media. The lack of widespread internet access and computers could be circumvented by a mobile app with an offline mode. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides valuable information for the development and implementation of a CDSS for antibiotic prescribing among primary care prescribers in LMICs and may, in turn, contribute to improving antibiotic use, clinical outcomes and decreasing AMR.",2020,10.2196/17940,22,7,e17940,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Africa, Western and *antibiotic resistance, microbial and *antibiotic stewardship and *decision support systems, clinical and *diffusion of innovation and *drug resistance, microbial and *implementation science and *medical informatics applications and Adult and Africa, Western and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and antibiotic resistance, microbial and antibiotic stewardship and decision support systems, clinical and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and diffusion of innovation and drug resistance, microbial and Female and Humans and implementation science and Male and medical informatics applications and Physicians and Primary Health Care/*methods",NA,NA,2020/07/20/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bachmann_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Implementation and Evaluation of a Web-Based Distribution System For Anesthesia Department Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures: Qualitative Study and Content Analysis,"Bachmann, Kaspar F. and Vetter, Christian and Wenzel, Lars and Konrad, Christoph and Vogt, Andreas P.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Digitization is spreading exponentially in medical care, with improved availability of electronic devices. Guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) form an important part of daily clinical routine, and adherence is associated with improved outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a digital solution for the maintenance and distribution of SOPs and guidelines in 2 different anesthesiology departments in Switzerland. METHODS: A content management system (CMS), WordPress, was set up in 2 tertiary-level hospitals within 1 year: the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the Kantonsspital Lucerne in Lucerne, Switzerland, as an open-access system, followed by a similar system for internal usage in the Department of Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine of the Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, in Bern, Switzerland. We analyzed the requirements and implementation processes needed to successfully set up these systems, and we evaluated the systems' impact by analyzing content and usage. RESULTS: The systems' generated exportable metadata, such as traffic and content. Analysis of the exported metadata showed that the Lucerne website had 269 pages managed by 44 users, with 88,124 visits per month (worldwide access possible), and the Bern website had 341 pages managed by 35 users, with 1765 visits per month (access only possible from within the institution). Creation of an open-access system resulted in third-party interest in the published guidelines and SOPs. The implementation process can be performed over the course of 1 year and setup and maintenance costs are low. CONCLUSIONS: A CMS, such as WordPress, is a suitable solution for distributing and managing guidelines and SOPs. Content is easily accessible and is accessed frequently. Metadata from the system allow live monitoring of usage and suggest that the system be accepted and appreciated by the users. In the future, Web-based solutions could be an important tool to handle guidelines and SOPs, but further studies are needed to assess the effect of these systems.",2019,10.2196/14482,21,8,e14482,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*anesthesiology and *computer communication networks and *decision making, computer-assisted and *Information Dissemination and *Internet and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and *standards and Anesthesia Department, Hospital/*standards and anesthesiology and computer communication networks and decision making, computer-assisted and Humans and standards and Switzerland",NA,NA,2019/08/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Social media enables users to interact among large groups of people that share the same interests and suffer the same afflictions. Notably, these channels promote the ability to find and share information about health and medical conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the bowel disease (BD) community on Twitter, in particular how patients understand, discuss, feel, and react to the condition. The main questions were as follows: Which are the main communities and most influential users?; Where are the main content providers from?; What are the key biomedical and scientific topics under discussion? How are topics interrelated in patient communications?; How do external events influence user activity?; What kind of external sources of information are being promoted? METHODS: To answer these questions, a dataset of tweets containing terms related to BD conditions was collected from February to August 2018, accounting for a total of 24,634 tweets from 13,295 different users. Tweet preprocessing entailed the extraction of textual contents, hyperlinks, hashtags, time, location, and user information. Missing and incomplete information about the user profiles was completed using different analysis techniques. Semantic tweet topic analysis was supported by a lexicon-based entity recognizer. Furthermore, sentiment analysis enabled a closer look into the opinions expressed in the tweets, namely, gaining a deeper understanding of patients' feelings and experiences. RESULTS: Health organizations received most of the communication, whereas BD patients and experts in bowel conditions and nutrition were among those tweeting the most. In general, the BD community was mainly discussing symptoms, BD-related diseases, and diet-based treatments. Diarrhea and constipation were the most commonly mentioned symptoms, and cancer, anxiety disorder, depression, and chronic inflammations were frequently part of BD-related tweets. Most patient tweets discussed the bad side of BD conditions and other related conditions, namely, depression, diarrhea, and fibromyalgia. In turn, gluten-free diets and probiotic supplements were often mentioned in patient tweets expressing positive emotions. However, for the most part, tweets containing mentions to foods and diets showed a similar distribution of negative and positive sentiments because the effects of certain food components (eg, fiber, iron, and magnesium) were perceived differently, depending on the state of the disease and other personal conditions of the patients. The benefits of medical cannabis for the treatment of different chronic diseases were also highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: This study evidences that Twitter is becoming an influential space for conversation about bowel conditions, namely, patient opinions about associated symptoms and treatments. So, further qualitative and quantitative content analyses hold the potential to support decision making among health-related stakeholders, including the planning of awareness campaigns.",2019,10.2196/12610,21,8,e12610,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*communication and *data mining and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *inflammatory bowel diseases and *infodemiology and *irritable bowel syndrome and *natural language processing and *social media and *Social Media and *Surveys and Questionnaires and Colonic Neoplasms/*psychology and communication and data mining and Demography and Global Health and Humans and inflammatory bowel diseases and infodemiology and irritable bowel syndrome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome/*psychology and natural language processing and social media",NA,NA,2019/08/15/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bergman_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Associations Between Substance Use and Instagram Participation to Inform Social Network-Based Screening Models: Multimodal Cross-Sectional Study,"Bergman, Brandon G. and Wu, Weiyi and Marsch, Lisa A. and Crosier, Benjamin S. and DeLise, Timothy C. and Hassanpour, Saeed",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Technology-based computational strategies that leverage social network site (SNS) data to detect substance use are promising screening tools but rely on the presence of sufficient data to detect risk if it is present. A better understanding of the association between substance use and SNS participation may inform the utility of these technology-based screening tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to examine associations between substance use and Instagram posts and to test whether such associations differ as a function of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. METHODS: Participants with an Instagram account were recruited primarily via Clickworker (N=3117). With participant permission and Instagram's approval, participants' Instagram photo posts were downloaded with an application program interface. Participants' past-year substance use was measured with an adapted version of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Quick Screen. At-risk drinking was defined as at least one past-year instance having ""had more than a few alcoholic drinks a day,"" drug use was defined as any use of nonprescription drugs, and prescription drug use was defined as any nonmedical use of prescription medications. We used logistic regression to examine the associations between substance use and any Instagram posts and negative binomial regression to examine the associations between substance use and number of Instagram posts. We examined whether age (18-25, 26-38, 39+ years), gender, and race/ethnicity moderated associations in both logistic and negative binomial models. All differences noted were significant at the .05 level. RESULTS: Compared with no at-risk drinking, any at-risk drinking was associated with both a higher likelihood of any Instagram posts and a higher number of posts, except among Hispanic/Latino individuals, in whom at-risk drinking was associated with a similar number of posts. Compared with no drug use, any drug use was associated with a higher likelihood of any posts but was associated with a similar number of posts. Compared with no prescription drug use, any prescription drug use was associated with a similar likelihood of any posts and was associated with a lower number of posts only among those aged 39 years and older. Of note, main effects showed that being female compared with being male and being Hispanic/Latino compared with being White were significantly associated with both a greater likelihood of any posts and a greater number of posts. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers developing computational substance use risk detection models using Instagram or other SNS data may wish to consider our findings showing that at-risk drinking and drug use were positively associated with Instagram participation, while prescription drug use was negatively associated with Instagram participation for middle- and older-aged adults. As more is learned about SNS behaviors among those who use substances, researchers may be better positioned to successfully design and interpret innovative risk detection approaches.",2020,10.2196/21916,22,9,e21916,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*alcohol and *drug and *health risk and *Instagram and *machine learning and *screening and *social media and *social network sites and *Social Networking and *substance use and Adolescent and Adult and alcohol and Cross-Sectional Studies and drug and Female and Health Behavior/*physiology and health risk and Humans and Instagram and machine learning and Male and screening and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and social network sites and substance use and Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/09/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Melnick_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Perceived Electronic Health Record Usability as a Predictor of Task Load and Burnout Among US Physicians: Mediation Analysis,"Melnick, Edward R. and Harry, Elizabeth and Sinsky, Christine A. and Dyrbye, Liselotte N. and Wang, Hanhan and Trockel, Mickey Todd and West, Colin P. and Shanafelt, Tait",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) usability and physician task load both contribute to physician professional burnout. The association between perceived EHR usability and workload has not previously been studied at a national level. Better understanding these interactions could give further information as to the drivers of extraneous task load. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relationship between physician-perceived EHR usability and workload by specialty and evaluate for associations with professional burnout. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of US physicians from all specialties was conducted from October 2017 to March 2018. Among the 1250 physicians invited to respond to the subsurvey analyzed here, 848 (67.8%) completed it. EHR usability was assessed with the System Usability Scale (SUS; range: 0-100). Provider task load (PTL) was assessed using the mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, and effort required subscales of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (range: 0-400). Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: The mean scores were 46.1 (SD 22.1) for SUS and 262.5 (SD 71.7) for PTL. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, relationship status, medical specialty, practice setting, hours worked per week, and number of nights on call per week, physician-rated EHR usability was associated with PTL, with each 1-point increase in SUS score (indicating more favorable) associated with a 0.57-point decrease in PTL score (P<.001). On mediation analysis, higher SUS score was associated with lower PTL score, which was associated with lower odds of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: A strong association was observed between EHR usability and workload among US physicians, with more favorable usability associated with less workload. Both outcomes were associated with the odds of burnout, with task load acting as a mediator between EHR usability and burnout. Improving EHR usability while decreasing task load has the potential to allow practicing physicians more working memory for medical decision making and patient communication.",2020,10.2196/23382,22,12,e23382,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*burnout and *cognitive load and *EHR and *electronic health record and *Mediation Analysis and *NASA Task Load Index and *physician and *physician task load and *stress and *System Usability Scale and *usability and Adult and Aged and burnout and Burnout, Professional and cognitive load and Cross-Sectional Studies and EHR and electronic health record and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and NASA Task Load Index and physician and physician task load and stress and System Usability Scale and Task Performance and Analysis and United States and usability",NA,NA,2020/12/22/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Today, people can obtain relevant information from not only medical workers in hospitals, but also the internet in any place in real-time. Search behaviors can reflect a population's awareness of cancer from a completely new perspective, which could be driven by the underlying cancer epidemiology. However, such Web-retrieved data are not yet well validated or understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether a correlation exists between the incidence and mortality of cancers and normalized internet search volumes on the big data platform, Baidu. We also assessed whether the distribution of people who searched for specific types of cancer differed by gender. Finally, we determined whether there were regional disparities among people who searched the Web for cancer-related information. METHODS: Standard Boolean operators were used to choose search terms for each type of cancer. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore correlations among monthly search index values for each cancer type and their monthly incidence and mortality rates. We conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and incidence rates to examine whether a stable equilibrium existed between them. We also conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and mortality data. RESULTS: The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer incidence rates for 26 of 28 cancers in China (lung cancer: r=.80, P<.001; liver cancer: r=.28, P=.016; stomach cancer: r=.50, P<.001; esophageal cancer: r=.50, P<.001; colorectal cancer: r=.81, P<.001; pancreatic cancer: r=.86, P<.001; breast cancer: r=.56, P<.001; brain and nervous system cancer: r=.63, P<.001; leukemia: r=.75, P<.001; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.88, P<.001; Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.91, P<.001; cervical cancer: r=.64, P<.001; prostate cancer: r=.67, P<.001; bladder cancer: r=.62, P<.001; gallbladder and biliary tract cancer: r=.88, P<.001; lip and oral cavity cancer: r=.88, P<.001; ovarian cancer: r=.58, P<.001; larynx cancer: r=.82, P<.001; kidney cancer: r=.73, P<.001; squamous cell carcinoma: r=.94, P<.001; multiple myeloma: r=.84, P<.001; thyroid cancer: r=.77, P<.001; malignant skin melanoma: r=.55, P<.001; mesothelioma: r=.79, P<.001; testicular cancer: r=.57, P<.001; basal cell carcinoma: r=.83, P<.001). The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer mortality rates for 24 of 27 cancers. In terms of the whole population, the number of women who searched for cancer-related information has slowly risen over time. People aged 30-39 years were most likely to use search engines to retrieve cancer-related knowledge. East China had the highest Web search volumes for cancer.

Azodo_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Opportunities and Challenges Surrounding the Use of Data From Wearable Sensor Devices in Health Care: Qualitative Interview Study,"Azodo, Ijeoma and Williams, Robin and Sheikh, Aziz and Cresswell, Kathrin",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Wearable sensors connected via networked devices have the potential to generate data that may help to automate processes of care, engage patients, and increase health care efficiency. The evidence of effectiveness of such technologies is, however, nascent and little is known about unintended consequences. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore the opportunities and challenges surrounding the use of data from wearable sensor devices in health care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative, theoretically informed, interview-based study to purposefully sample international experts in health care, technology, business, innovation, and social sciences, drawing on sociotechnical systems theory. We used in-depth interviews to capture perspectives on development, design, and use of data from wearable sensor devices in health care, and employed thematic analysis of interview transcripts with NVivo to facilitate coding. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 experts. Although the use of data from wearable sensor devices in health and care has significant potential in improving patient engagement, there are a number of issues that stakeholders need to negotiate to realize these benefits. These issues include the current gap between data created and meaningful interpretation in health and care contexts, integration of data into health care professional decision making, negotiation of blurring lines between consumer and medical care, and pervasive monitoring of health across previously disconnected contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders need to actively negotiate existing challenges to realize the integration of data from wearable sensor devices into electronic health records.

Tan_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Internet Health Information Seeking and the Patient-Physician Relationship: A Systematic Review,"Tan, Sharon Swee-Lin and Goonawardene, Nadee",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: With online health information becoming increasingly popular among patients, concerns have been raised about the impact of patients' Internet health information-seeking behavior on their relationship with physicians. Therefore, it is pertinent to understand the influence of online health information on the patient-physician relationship. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review existing research on patients' Internet health information seeking and its influence on the patient-physician relationship. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and key medical informatics, information systems, and communication science journals covering the period of 2000 to 2015. Empirical articles that were in English were included. We analyzed the content covering themes in 2 broad categories: factors affecting patients' discussion of online findings during consultations and implications for the patient-physician relationship. RESULTS: We identified 18 articles that met the inclusion criteria and the quality requirement for the review. The articles revealed barriers, facilitators, and demographic factors that influence patients' disclosure of online health information during consultations and the different mechanisms patients use to reveal these findings. Our review also showed the mechanisms in which online information could influence patients' relationship with their physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this review contribute to the understanding of the patient-physician relationship of Internet-informed patients. Our main findings show that Internet health information seeking can improve the patient-physician relationship depending on whether the patient discusses the information with the physician and on their prior relationship. As patients have better access to health information through the Internet and expect to be more engaged in health decision making, traditional models of the patient-provider relationship and communication strategies must be revisited to adapt to this changing demographic.",2017,10.2196/jmir.5729,19,1,e9,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*health information and *information seeking and *Information Seeking Behavior and *Internet and *physician-patient relations and *Physician-Patient Relations and Health Behavior and health information and Humans and information seeking and Internet and physician-patient relations,NA,NA,2017/01/19/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Concurrently, the increasing ubiquity of mobile phones in LMICs presents possibilities for rapid collection of population-based data to inform the policy process. The objective of this paper is to highlight potential benefits of mobile phone surveys (MPS) for developing, implementing, and evaluating NCD prevention and control policies. To achieve this aim, we first provide a brief overview of major global commitments to NCD prevention and control, and subsequently explore how countries can translate these commitments into policy action at the national level. Using the policy cycle as our frame of reference, we highlight potential benefits of MPS which include (1) potential cost-effectiveness of using MPS to inform NCD policy actions compared with using traditional household surveys; (2) timeliness of assessments to feed into policy and planning cycles; (3) tracking progress of interventions, hence assessment of reach, coverage, and distribution; (4) better targeting of interventions, for example, to high-risk groups; (5) timely course correction for suboptimal or non-effective interventions; (6) assessing fairness in financial contribution and financial risk protection for those affected by NCDs in the spirit of universal health coverage (UHC); and (7) monitoring progress in reducing catastrophic medical expenditure due to chronic health conditions in general, and NCDs in particular.

Parra_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The Multimodal Assessment of Adult Attachment Security: Developing the Biometric Attachment Test,"Parra, Federico and Miljkovitch, Raphaele and Persiaux, Gwenaelle and Morales, Michelle and Scherer, Stefan",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Attachment theory has been proven essential for mental health, including psychopathology, development, and interpersonal relationships. Validated psychometric instruments to measure attachment abound but suffer from shortcomings common to traditional psychometrics. Recent developments in multimodal fusion and machine learning pave the way for new automated and objective psychometric instruments for adult attachment that combine psychophysiological, linguistic, and behavioral analyses in the assessment of the construct. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a new exposure-based, automatic, and objective adult-attachment assessment, the Biometric Attachment Test (BAT), which exposes participants to a short standardized set of visual and music stimuli, whereas their immediate reactions and verbal responses, captured by several computer sense modalities, are automatically analyzed for scoring and classification. We also aimed to empirically validate two of its assumptions: its capacity to measure attachment security and the viability of using themes as placeholders for rotating stimuli. METHODS: A total of 59 French participants from the general population were assessed using the Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ), the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), and the Attachment Multiple Model Interview (AMMI) as ground truth for attachment security. They were then exposed to three different BAT stimuli sets, whereas their faces, voices, heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA) were recorded. Psychophysiological features, such as skin-conductance response (SCR) and Bayevsky stress index; behavioral features, such as gaze and facial expressions; as well as linguistic and paralinguistic features, were automatically extracted. An exploratory analysis was conducted using correlation matrices to uncover the features that are most associated with attachment security. A confirmatory analysis was conducted by creating a single composite effects index and by testing it for correlations with attachment security. The stability of the theory-consistent features across three different stimuli sets was explored using repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs). RESULTS: In total, 46 theory-consistent correlations were found during the exploration (out of 65 total significant correlations). For example, attachment security as measured by the AAP was correlated with positive facial expressions (r=.36, P=.01). AMMI's security with the father was inversely correlated with the low frequency (LF) of HRV (r=-.87, P=.03). Attachment security to partners as measured by the AAQ was inversely correlated with anger facial expression (r=-.43, P=.001). The confirmatory analysis showed that the composite effects index was significantly correlated to security in the AAP (r=.26, P=.05) and the AAQ (r=.30, P=.04) but not in the AMMI. Repeated measures ANOVAs conducted individually on each of the theory-consistent features revealed that only 7 of the 46 (15%) features had significantly different values among responses to three different stimuli sets. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to validate two of the instrument's core assumptions: its capacity to measure attachment security and the viability of using themes as placeholders for rotating stimuli. Future validation of other of its dimensions, as well as the ongoing development of its scoring and classification algorithms is discussed.",2017,10.2196/jmir.6898,19,4,e100,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Language and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and psychometrics and attachment and heart rate and Mental Health and Combined Modality Therapy and linguistics and Interpersonal Relations and *psychopathology and Psychometrics/*methods and *heart rate and Facial Expression and *attachment and *COVAREP and *facial expression and *linguistics and *Object Attachment and *psychometrics and *psychophysiology and psychopathology and COVAREP and facial expression and psychophysiology,NA,NA,2017/04/06/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020,10.2196/21419,22,9,e21419,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*COVID-19 and *face masks and *infodemiology and *lockdown and *machine learning and *nonpharmaceutical interventions and *public health and *SARS-CoV-2 and *social distancing and *social media and *topic modeling and Betacoronavirus/isolation & purification and Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*psychology/*therapy/virology and COVID-19 and face masks and Humans and infodemiology and lockdown and machine learning and nonpharmaceutical interventions and Pandemics and Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*psychology/*therapy/virology and public health and SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and social media and Social Media and topic modeling",NA,NA,2020/09/03/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Katsuki_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Establishing a Link Between Prescription Drug Abuse and Illicit Online Pharmacies: Analysis of Twitter Data,"Katsuki, Takeo and Mackey, Tim Ken and Cuomo, Raphael",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Youth and adolescent non-medical use of prescription medications (NUPM) has become a national epidemic. However, little is known about the association between promotion of NUPM behavior and access via the popular social media microblogging site, Twitter, which is currently used by a third of all teens. OBJECTIVE: In order to better assess NUPM behavior online, this study conducts surveillance and analysis of Twitter data to characterize the frequency of NUPM-related tweets and also identifies illegal access to drugs of abuse via online pharmacies. METHODS: Tweets were collected over a 2-week period from April 1-14, 2015, by applying NUPM keyword filters for both generic/chemical and street names associated with drugs of abuse using the Twitter public streaming application programming interface. Tweets were then analyzed for relevance to NUPM and whether they promoted illegal online access to prescription drugs using a protocol of content coding and supervised machine learning. RESULTS: A total of 2,417,662 tweets were collected and analyzed for this study. Tweets filtered for generic drugs names comprised 232,108 tweets, including 22,174 unique associated uniform resource locators (URLs), and 2,185,554 tweets (376,304 unique URLs) filtered for street names. Applying an iterative process of manual content coding and supervised machine learning, 81.72% of the generic and 12.28% of the street NUPM datasets were predicted as having content relevant to NUPM respectively. By examining hyperlinks associated with NUPM relevant content for the generic Twitter dataset, we discovered that 75.72% of the tweets with URLs included a hyperlink to an online marketing affiliate that directly linked to an illicit online pharmacy advertising the sale of Valium without a prescription. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the association between Twitter content, NUPM behavior promotion, and online access to drugs using a broad set of prescription drug keywords. Initial results are concerning, as our study found over 45,000 tweets that directly promoted NUPM by providing a URL that actively marketed the illegal online sale of prescription drugs of abuse. Additional research is needed to further establish the link between Twitter content and NUPM, as well as to help inform future technology-based tools, online health promotion activities, and public policy to combat NUPM online.",2015,10.2196/jmir.5144,17,12,e280,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Adolescent and cyberpharmacies and eHealth and Humans and illicit Internet pharmacies and infodemiology and infoveillance and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and Pharmaceutical Services, Online/*statistics & numerical data and prescription drug abuse and Prescription Drug Misuse/*adverse effects and Prescription Drugs/*adverse effects and social media and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and surveillance and twitter",NA,NA,2015/12/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lin_2016_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Multilayered temporal modeling for the clinical domain,"Lin, Chen and Dligach, Dmitriy and Miller, Timothy A. and Bethard, Steven and Savova, Guergana K.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an open-source temporal relation discovery system for the clinical domain. The system is capable of automatically inferring temporal relations between events and time expressions using a multilayered modeling strategy. It can operate at different levels of granularity--from rough temporality expressed as event relations to the document creation time (DCT) to temporal containment to fine-grained classic Allen-style relations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated our systems on 2 clinical corpora. One is a subset of the Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME) corpus, which was used in SemEval 2015 Task 6: Clinical TempEval. The other is the 2012 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) challenge corpus. We designed multiple supervised machine learning models to compute the DCT relation and within-sentence temporal relations. For the i2b2 data, we also developed models and rule-based methods to recognize cross-sentence temporal relations. We used the official evaluation scripts of both challenges to make our results comparable with results of other participating systems. In addition, we conducted a feature ablation study to find out the contribution of various features to the system's performance. RESULTS: Our system achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Clinical TempEval corpus and was on par with the best systems on the i2b2 2012 corpus. Particularly, on the Clinical TempEval corpus, our system established a new F1 score benchmark, statistically significant as compared to the baseline and the best participating system.

Alshurafa_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Counting Bites With Bits: Expert Workshop Addressing Calorie and Macronutrient Intake Monitoring,"Alshurafa, Nabil and Lin, Annie Wen and Zhu, Fengqing and Ghaffari, Roozbeh and Hester, Josiah and Delp, Edward and Rogers, John and Spring, Bonnie",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Conventional diet assessment approaches such as the 24-hour self-reported recall are burdensome, suffer from recall bias, and are inaccurate in estimating energy intake. Wearable sensor technology, coupled with advanced algorithms, is increasingly showing promise in its ability to capture behaviors that provide useful information for estimating calorie and macronutrient intake. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to summarize current technological approaches to monitoring energy intake on the basis of expert opinion from a workshop panel and to make recommendations to advance technology and algorithms to improve estimation of energy expenditure. METHODS: A 1-day invitational workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation was held at Northwestern University. A total of 30 participants, including population health researchers, engineers, and intervention developers, from 6 universities and the National Institutes of Health participated in a panel discussing the state of evidence with regard to monitoring calorie intake and eating behaviors. RESULTS: Calorie monitoring using technological approaches can be characterized into 3 domains: (1) image-based sensing (eg, wearable and smartphone-based cameras combined with machine learning algorithms); (2) eating action unit (EAU) sensors (eg, to measure feeding gesture and chewing rate); and (3) biochemical measures (eg, serum and plasma metabolite concentrations). We discussed how each domain functions, provided examples of promising solutions, and highlighted potential challenges and opportunities in each domain. Image-based sensor research requires improved ground truth (context and known information about the foods), accurate food image segmentation and recognition algorithms, and reliable methods of estimating portion size. EAU-based domain research is limited by the understanding of when their systems (device and inference algorithm) succeed and fail, need for privacy-protecting methods of capturing ground truth, and uncertainty in food categorization. Although an exciting novel technology, the challenges of biochemical sensing range from a lack of adaptability to environmental effects (eg, temperature change) and mechanical impact, instability of wearable sensor performance over time, and single-use design. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional approaches to calorie monitoring rely predominantly on self-reports. These approaches can gain contextual information from image-based and EAU-based domains that can map automatically captured food images to a food database and detect proxies that correlate with food volume and caloric intake. Although the continued development of advanced machine learning techniques will advance the accuracy of such wearables, biochemical sensing provides an electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin, enabling noninvasive measures of chemical compounds that provide insight into the digestive and endocrine systems. Future computing-based researchers should focus on reducing the burden of wearable sensors, aligning data across multiple devices, automating methods of data annotation, increasing rigor in studying system acceptability, increasing battery lifetime, and rigorously testing validity of the measure. Such research requires moving promising technological solutions from the controlled laboratory setting to the field.",2019,10.2196/14904,21,12,e14904,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*computer vision systems and *computing methodologies and *diet and *eating and *eHealth and *energy intake and *Energy Intake and *feeding behavior and *Feeding Behavior and *mHealth and *nutritional status and *obesity and *Wearable Electronic Devices and *wearable technology and Algorithms and computer vision systems and computing methodologies and diet and eating and Education and eHealth and energy intake and feeding behavior and Humans and mHealth and nutritional status and obesity and Smartphone and Telemedicine and United States and wearable technology,NA,NA,2019/12/04/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dakwa_2020_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The impact of drug order complexity on prospective medication order review and verification time,"Dakwa, David S. and Marshall, Vincent D. and Chaffee, Bruce W.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To assess if the amount of time a pharmacist spends verifying medication orders increases as medication orders become more complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by observing pharmacist verification of adult medication orders in an academic medical center. Drug order complexity was prospectively defined and validated using a classification system derived from 3 factors: the degree of order variability, ISMP high-alert classification, and a pharmacist perception survey. Screen capture software was used to measure pharmacist order review time for each classification. The annualized volume of low complexity drug orders was used to calculate the potential time savings if these were verified using an alternate system that did not require pharmacist review. RESULTS: The primary study hypothesis was not achieved. Regression results did not show statistical significance for moderate (n = 30, 23.7 seconds, sd = 23.3) or high complexity (n = 30, 18.6 seconds, sd = 23.1) drugs relative to the low complexity drugs (n = 30, 8.0 seconds, sd = 14.4) nor for moderate vs high complexity; (<ce><b2>moderate vs low = 15.6, P = .113), (<ce><b2>high vs low = 10.3, P = .235), (<ce><b2>moderate vs high = 5.3, P = .737). The sensitivity analysis showed statistical significance in the high vs low comparison (<ce><b2>high vs low = 13.8, P = .017). DISCUSSION: This study showed that verifying pharmacists spent less time than projected to verify medication orders of different complexities, but the time did not correlate with the classifications used in our complexity scale. Several mitigating factors, including operational aspects associated with timing antimicrobial orders, likely influenced order verification time. These factors should be evaluated in future studies which seek to define drug order complexity and optimize pharmacist time spent in medication order verification. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that there may be other factors involved in pharmacist decision-making that should be considered when categorizing drugs by perceived complexity.",2020,10.1093/jamia/ocz188,27,2,284-293,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*cognitive effort and *decision-making approaches and *drug order complexity and *Drug Prescriptions and *medication order review and *Medication Systems, Hospital and *pharmacist time and cognitive effort and decision-making approaches and drug order complexity and Humans and medication order review and Pharmaceutical Preparations and pharmacist time and Pharmacists/*statistics & numerical data and Pharmacy Service, Hospital and Time Factors",NA,NA,2020/02/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sabirli_2020_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,Use of WhatsApp for Polyclinic Consultation of Suspected Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Case Control Study,"Sabirli, Ramazan and Karsli, Emre and Canacik, Omer and Ercin, Dogan and Ciftci, Handan and Sahin, Levent and Dolanbay, Turgut and Tutuncu, Emin Ediz",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Telephones, internet-connected devices (phablets, personal computers), chat platforms, and mobile apps (eg, Skype, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp) can be exploited for telemedicine applications. WhatsApp and similar apps are also widely used to facilitate clinical communication between physicians. Moreover, WhatsApp is used by emergency department (ED) physicians and consulting physicians to exchange medical information during ED consultations. This platform is regarded as a useful app in the consultation of dermatological and orthopedic cases. Preventing overcrowding in the ED is key to reducing the risk of disease transmission, and teleconsulting practice is thought to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission risk of disease, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video consultation is highly recommended in some countries on the grounds that it is likely to reduce the risk of transmission. WhatsApp-like apps are among the video consultation platforms that are assumed to reduce the risk of contamination by minimizing patient-physician contact. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of WhatsApp video consultation on patient admission and discharge times in comparison to bedside consultation in the evaluation of potential patients with COVID-19 visiting a COVID-19 outpatient clinic during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients who presented to the ED COVID-19 outpatient clinic between March 11 and May 31, 2020, and for whom an infectious disease specialist was consulted (via WhatsApp or at bedside) were included in the study in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study. RESULTS: The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P<.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.

Poncette_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Improvements in Patient Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Survey Study,"Poncette, Akira-Sebastian and Mosch, Lina and Spies, Claudia and Schmieding, Malte and Schiefenhovel, Fridtjof and Krampe, Henning and Balzer, Felix",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

We proposed a hierarchical neural network to determine whether a patient satisfied selection criteria or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a hierarchical neural network (denoted as CNN-Highway-LSTM or LSTM-Highway-LSTM) for the track 1 of the national natural language processing (NLP) clinical challenge (n2c2) on cohort selection for clinical trials in 2018. The neural network is composed of 5 components: (1) sentence representation using convolutional neural network (CNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) network; (2) a highway network to adjust information flow; (3) a self-attention neural network to reweight sentences; (4) document representation using LSTM, which takes sentence representations in chronological order as input; (5) a fully connected neural network to determine whether each criterion is met or not. We compared the proposed method with its variants, including the methods only using the first component to represent documents directly and the fully connected neural network for classification (denoted as CNN-only or LSTM-only) and the methods without using the highway network (denoted as CNN-LSTM or LSTM-LSTM). The performance of all methods was measured by micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS: The micro-averaged F1 scores of CNN-only, LSTM-only, CNN-LSTM, LSTM-LSTM, CNN-Highway-LSTM, and LSTM-Highway-LSTM were 85.24%, 84.25%, 87.27%, 88.68%, 88.48%, and 90.21%, respectively. The highest micro-averaged F1 score is higher than our submitted 1 of 88.55%, which is 1 of the top-ranked results in the challenge. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective for cohort selection for clinical trials. DISCUSSION: Although the proposed method achieved promising results, some mistakes were caused by word ambiguity, negation, number analysis and incomplete dictionary. Moreover, imbalanced data was another challenge that needs to be tackled in the future. CONCLUSION: In this article, we proposed a hierarchical neural network for cohort selection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a chronic disease management application using the technology framework known as SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). We used mixed methods to obtain user feedback on a prototype to support ambulatory providers managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each participant managed 2 patient scenarios using the regular EHR with and without access to our prototype in block-randomized order. The primary outcome was the percentage of expert-recommended ideal care tasks completed. Timing, keyboard and mouse use, and participant surveys were also collected. User experiences were captured using a retrospective think-aloud interview analyzed by concept coding. RESULTS: With our prototype, the 13 participants completed more recommended care (81% vs 48%; P < .001) and recommended tasks per minute (0.8 vs 0.6; P = .03) over longer sessions (7.0 minutes vs 5.4 minutes; P = .006). Keystrokes per task were lower with the prototype (6 vs 18; P < .001). Qualitative themes elicited included the desire for reliable presentation of information which matches participants' mental models of disease and for intuitive navigation in order to decrease cognitive load.

We sought to characterize system use, its predictors, and user feedback for the Electronic Asthma Management System (eAMS)-an electronic medical record system-integrated, point-of-care CCDSS for asthma-and applied the GUIDES checklist as a framework to identify areas for improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eAMS was tested in a 1-year prospective cohort study across 3 Ontario primary care sites. We recorded system usage by clinicians and patient characteristics through system logs and chart reviews. We created multivariable models to identify predictors of (1) CCDSS opening and (2) creation of a self-management asthma action plan (AAP) (final CCDSS step). Electronic questionnaires captured user feedback. RESULTS: Over 1 year, 490 asthma patients saw 121 clinicians. The CCDSS was opened in 205 of 1033 (19.8%) visits and an AAP created in 121 of 1033 (11.7%) visits. Multivariable predictors of opening the CCDSS and producing an AAP included clinic site, having physician-diagnosed asthma, and presenting with an asthma- or respiratory-related complaint. The system usability scale score was 66.3 <c2><b1> 16.5 (maximum 100). Reported usage barriers included time and system accessibility. DISCUSSION: The eAMS was used in a minority of asthma patient visits. Varying workflows and cultures across clinics, physician beliefs regarding asthma diagnosis, and relevance of the clinical complaint influenced uptake.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors evaluated the first 24 hours of structured electronic health record data for > 10 K inpatients. Drawing an analogy between structured items (e.g., clinical orders) to words in a text document, the authors performed latent Dirichlet allocation probabilistic topic modeling. These topic models use initial clinical information to predict clinical orders for a separate validation set of > 4 K patients. The authors evaluated these topic model-based predictions vs existing human-authored order sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, and recall for subsequent clinical orders. RESULTS: Existing order sets predict clinical orders used within 24 hours with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81, precision 16%, and recall 35%. This can be improved to 0.90, 24%, and 47% ( P < 10 -20 ) by using probabilistic topic models to summarize clinical data into up to 32 topics. Many of these latent topics yield natural clinical interpretations (e.g., ""critical care,"" ""pneumonia,"" ""neurologic evaluation""). DISCUSSION: Existing order sets tend to provide nonspecific, process-oriented aid, with usability limitations impairing more precise, patient-focused support. Algorithmic summarization has the potential to breach this usability barrier by automatically inferring patient context, but with potential tradeoffs in interpretability.

A patient decision aid can inform patients about their treatment options, the associated risks and benefits, help them clarify their values, and allow them to participate in medical decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a literacy-sensitive Web-based patient decision aid based on the Ottawa decision support framework, and through a randomized clinical trial estimate the effectiveness of the patient decision aid in improving patient knowledge and their involvement in decision making. METHODS: We conducted population decisional needs assessments in a nationwide sample of patients, caregivers, community advocates, policy makers, and health care providers using qualitative interviews to identify decisional conflict, knowledge and expectations, values, support and resources, decision types, timing, stages and learning, and personal clinical characteristics. Interview transcripts were coded using QSR NVivo 10. Alpha testing of the patient decision aid prototype was done to establish usability and the accuracy of the information it conveyed, and then was followed by iterative cycles of beta testing. We conducted a randomized clinical trial of adults and of caregivers of pediatric patients to evaluate the efficacy of the patient decision aid. RESULTS: In a decisional needs assessment, 223 stakeholders described their preferences, helping to guide the development of the patient decision aid, which then underwent alpha testing by 30 patients and 38 health care providers and iterative cycles of beta testing by 87 stakeholders. In a randomized clinical trial, 120 participants were assigned to either the patient decision aid or standard care (SC) arm. Qualitative interviews revealed high levels of usability, acceptability, and utility of the patient decision aid in education, values clarification, and preparation for decision making. On the acceptability survey, 72% (86/120) of participants rated the patient decision aid as good or excellent. Participants on the patient decision aid arm compared to the SC arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in decisional self-efficacy (P=.05) and a reduction in the informed sub-score of decisional conflict (P=.003) at 3 months, with an improvement in preparation for decision making (P<.001) at 6 months. However, there was no improvement in terms of the change in knowledge, the total or other domain scores of decisional conflicts, or decisional self-efficacies at 6 months. The large amount of missing data from survey completion limited our ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the patient decision aid. The patient decision aid met 61 of 62 benchmarks of the international patient decision aid collaboration standards for content, development process, and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a patient decision aid for sickle cell disease with extensive input from stakeholders and in a randomized clinical trial demonstrated its acceptability and utility in education and decision making. We were unable to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving patient knowledge and involvement in decision making.

Helmons_2015_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Drug-drug interaction checking assisted by clinical decision support: a return on investment analysis,"Helmons, Pieter J. and Suijkerbuijk, Bas O. and Nannan Panday, Prashant V. and Kosterink, Jos G. W.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are very prevalent in hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of DDI alerts, time saved, and time invested after suppressing clinically irrelevant alerts and adding clinical-decision support to relevant alerts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The most frequently occurring DDIs were evaluated for clinical relevance by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Pharmacist evaluation of relevant DDIs was facilitated using computerized decision support systems (CDSS). During Phase 1, only CDSS-assisted DDI checking was implemented. During Phase 2, CDSS-assisted DDI checking remained in place, and clinically irrelevant DDIs were suppressed. In each phase, the number of alerts and duration of pharmacist DDI checking were compared to conventional DDI checking. In addition, the time invested to implement and configure the CDSS was compared to the time saved using CDSS-assisted DDI checking. RESULTS: CDSS-assisted DDI checking resulted in a daily decrease of DDI checking alerts from 65 to 47 alerts in Phase 1 (P = .03) and from 73 to 33 alerts in Phase 2 (P = .003). DDI checking duration decreased from 15 to 11 minutes (P = .044) and from 15 1/2 to 8 1/2 minutes (P = .001) in Phases 1 and 2, respectively. Almost 298 of the 392 hours required for implementation were invested by pharmacists. An annual timesaving of 30 hours yielded a return on investment of 9.8 years. CONCLUSION: CDSS-assisted DDI checking resulted in a 55% reduction of the number of alerts and a 45% reduction in time spent on DDI checking, yielding a return on investment of almost 10 years. Our approach can be used to refine other drug safety checking modules, increasing the efficiency of checking for drug safety without the need to add more staff pharmacists.",2015,10.1093/jamia/ocu010,22,4,764-772,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Drug Interactions and *Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted and *Medical Order Entry Systems and clinical decision support systems and CPOE and drug interactions and Humans and Pharmacists and Pharmacy Service, Hospital and return on investment and Time and Motion Studies",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Utunen_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Global Reach of an Online COVID-19 Course in Multiple Languages on OpenWHO in the First Quarter of 2020: Analysis of Platform Use Data,"Utunen, Heini and Ndiaye, Ngouille and Piroux, Corentin and George, Richelle and Attias, Melissa and Gamhewage, Gaya",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: At the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergencies Learning and Capacity Development Unit, together with the WHO's health technical lead on coronaviruses, developed a massive open online course within 3 weeks as part of the global response to the emergency. The introductory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) course was launched on January 26, 2020, on the health emergencies learning platform OpenWHO.org. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the geographic reach of different language courses accessed by a worldwide audience seeking information on COVID-19. Users' professional identities and backgrounds were explored to inform course owners on the use case. The course was developed and delivered via the open-access learning platform OpenWHO.org. The self-paced resources are available in a total of 13 languages and were produced between January 26 and March 25, 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from the online courses' statistical data and metrics reporting system on the OpenWHO platform. User patterns and locations were analyzed based on Google Analytics and the platform's own statistics capabilities, and data sets were overlaid. This analysis was conducted based on user location, with the data disaggregated according to the six WHO regions, the top 10 countries, and the proportion of use for each language version. Data included affiliation, gender, age, and other parameters for 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of the users who indicated their background. RESULTS: As of March 25, 2020, the introductory COVID-19 course totaled 232,890 enrollments across all languages. The Spanish language course was comprised of more than half (n=118,754, 50.99%) of all course enrollments, and the English language course was comprised of 38.21% (n=88,988) of enrollments. The WHO's Region of the Americas accounted for most of the course enrollments, with more than 72.47% (138,503/191,130) enrollment across all languages. Other regions were more evenly distributed with less than 10% enrollment for each. A total of 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of users specified a professional affiliation by choosing from the 12 most common backgrounds in the OpenWHO user profiles. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, users were spread over the 11 distinct affiliations, with a small fraction of users identifying themselves as ""Other."" With the COVID-19 introductory course, the largest number of users selected ""Other"" (16,527/52,214, 31.65%), suggesting a large number of users who were not health professionals or academics. The top 10 countries with the most users across all languages were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The online course has addressed a worldwide learning need by providing WHO's technical guidance packaged in simple formats for access and use. The learning material development was expedited to meet the onset of the epidemic. Initial data suggest that the various language versions of the course, in particular Spanish, have reached new user groups, fulfilling the platform's aim of providing learning everywhere to anyone that is interested.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to review utilization patterns of the largest online patient portal in Canada's largest city. METHODS: We conducted a 4-year time-trend analysis of aggregated anonymous utilization data of the MyChart patient portal at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2015. Prespecified analyses examined trends related to day (weekend vs weekday), season (July vs January), year (2012 vs 2015), and an extreme adverse weather event (ice storm of December 20-26, 2013). Primary endpoints included three measures of patient portal activity: registrations, logins, and pageviews. RESULTS: We identified 32,325 patients who registered for a MyChart account during the study interval. Time-trend analysis showed no sign of attenuating registrations over time. Logins were frequent, averaged 734 total per day, and showed an increasing trend over time. Pageviews mirrored logins, averaged about 3029 total per day, and equated to about 5 pageviews during the average login. The most popular pageviews were clinical notes, followed by laboratory results and medical imaging reports. All measures of patient activity were lower on weekends compared to weekdays (P<.001) yet showed no significant changes related to seasons or extreme weather. No major security breach, malware attack, or software failure occurred during the study.

Birkeland_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Sociodemographic Representativeness in a Nationwide Web-Based Survey of the View of Men on Involvement in Health Care Decision-Making: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study,"Birkeland, Soren F. and Haakonsson, Anders K. and Pedersen, Susanne S. and Rottmann, Nina and Barry, Michael J. and Moller, Soren",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Being able to generalize research findings to a broader population outside of the study sample is an important goal in surveys on the internet. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey with vignettes illustrating different levels of patient involvement to investigate men's preferences regarding participation in health care decision-making. Following randomization into vignette variants, we distributed the survey among men aged 45 to 70 years through the state-authorized digital mailbox provided by the Danish authorities for secure communication with citizens. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the sociodemographic representativeness of our sample of men obtained in a nationwide web-based survey using the digital mailbox. METHODS: Response rate estimates were established, and comparisons were made between responders and nonresponders in terms of age profiles (eg, average age) and municipality-level information on sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among 22,288 men invited during two waves, a total of 6756 (30.31%) participants responded to the survey. In adjusted analyses, responders' characteristics mostly resembled those of nonresponders. Response rates, however, were significantly higher in older men (odds ratio [OR] 2.83 for responses among those aged 65-70 years compared with those aged 45-49 years, 95% CI 2.58-3.11; P<.001) and in rural areas (OR 1.10 compared with urban areas, 95% CI 1.03-1.18; P=.005). Furthermore, response rates appeared lower in areas with a higher tax base (OR 0.89 in the highest tertile, 95% CI 0.81-0.98; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the general population of men aged 45 to 70 years was represented very well by the responders to our web-based survey. However, the imbalances identified highlight the importance of supplementing survey findings with studies of the representativeness of other characteristics of the sample like trait and preference features, so that proper statistical corrections can be made in upcoming analyses of survey responses whenever needed.",2020,10.2196/19517,22,9,e19517,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*bioethics and *cancer and *electronic data capture and *generalizability and *internet-based survey and *medical law and *patient satisfaction and *representativeness and *research methodology and *user involvement and Aged and bioethics and cancer and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making/*ethics and electronic data capture and generalizability and Humans and Internet and internet-based survey and Male and medical law and Middle Aged and Patient Participation/*methods and patient satisfaction and representativeness and research methodology and Socioeconomic Factors and Surveys and Questionnaires and user involvement,NA,NA,2020/09/02/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Manuvinakurike_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automated indexing of Internet stories for health behavior change: weight loss attitude pilot study,"Manuvinakurike, Ramesh and Velicer, Wayne F. and Bickmore, Timothy W.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. OBJECTIVE: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. METHODS: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2*2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. RESULTS: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F1,107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F1,97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F1,107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F1,97=0.78, P=.38).

Wang_2020_JoofmeInre_2,JOUR,The Influence of Doctors' Online Reputation on the Sharing of Outpatient Experiences: Empirical Study,"Wang, Yang and Wu, Hong and Lei, Xueqin and Shen, Jingxuan and Feng, Zhanchun",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The internet enables consumers to evaluate products before purchase based on feedback submitted by like-minded individuals. Displaying reviews allows customers to assess comparable experiences and encourages trust, increased sales, and brand positivity. Customers use reviews to inform decision making, whereas organizations use reviews to predict future sales. Prior studies have focused on manufactured products, with little attention being paid to health care services. In particular, whether patients prefer to use websites to discuss doctors' reputation has so far remained unanswered. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate how patient propensity to post treatment experiences changes based on doctors' online reputation (medical quality and service attitude) in delivering outpatient care services. Further, this study examines the moderating effects of hospitals' (organizational) online reputation and disease severity. METHODS: Fractional logistic regression was conducted on data collected from 7183 active doctors in a Chinese online health community to obtain empirical results. RESULTS: Our findings show that patients prefer to share treatment experiences for doctors who have a higher medical quality and service attitude (<ce><b2>(service attitude)=.233; P<.001 and <ce><b2>(medical quality)=.052; P<.001) and who work in hospitals with a higher online reputation (<ce><b2>=.001; P<.001). Patients are more likely to share experiences of doctors who treat less severe diseases, as opposed to those treating severe diseases (<ce><b2>=-.004; P=.009). In addition, hospitals' online reputation positively (negatively) moderates the relationship between medical quality (service attitude) and patient propensity to post treatment experiences, whereas the moderating effects of disease severity on doctors' online reputation are negative.

RESULTS: The approach overcomes some of the current limitations of adverse event analysis and streamlines the way safety data can be explored, interpreted and analyzed. Using a phase II study, we describe and exemplify how the tendril plot effectively summarizes the time-resolved safety profile of two treatment arms in a single plot and how that can provide scientists with a trial safety overview that can support medical decision making.

METHODS: Since 2010, an m-EMR has been used in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. The usage logs of the m-EMR by doctors were gathered from March to December 2015. Descriptive analyses were conducted to explore the overall usage patterns of the m-EMR. To assess the value of the clinical information provided, the usage patterns of both the m-EMR and a hospital information system (HIS) were compared on an hourly basis. The peak usage times of the m-EMR were defined as continuous intervals having normalized usage values that are greater than 0.5. The usage logs were processed as an indicator representing specific clinical information using factor analysis. Random intercept logistic regression was used to explore the type of clinical information that is frequently accessed during the peak usage times. RESULTS: A total of 524,929 usage logs from 653 doctors (229 professors, 161 fellows, and 263 residents; mean age: 37.55 years; males: 415 [63.6%]) were analyzed. The highest average number of m-EMR usage logs (897) was by medical residents, whereas the lowest (292) was by surgical residents. The usage amount for three menus, namely inpatient list (47,096), lab results (38,508), and investigation list (25,336), accounted for 60.1% of the peak time usage. The HIS was used most frequently during regular hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). The peak usage time of the m-EMR was early in the morning (6:00 AM to 10:00 AM), and the use of the m-EMR from early evening (5:00 PM) to midnight was higher than during regular business hours. Four factors representing the types of clinical information were extracted through factor analysis. Factors related to patient investigation status and patient conditions were associated with the peak usage times of the m-EMR (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Access to information regarding patient investigation status and patient conditions is crucial for decision making during morning activities, including ward rounds. The m-EMRs allow doctors to maintain the continuity of their clinical information regardless of the time and location constraints. Thus, m-EMRs will best evolve in a manner that enhances the accessibility of clinical information helpful to the decision-making process under such constraints.",2017,10.2196/jmir.8128,19,10,e340,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Physicians and Humans and Male and Adult and accessibility and electronic medical records and mobile health and smartphone and *mobile health and *smartphone and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and *electronic medical records and *accessibility and *clinical information and *rounding and *timeliness and clinical information and rounding and timeliness,NA,NA,2017/10/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dafli_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Virtual patients on the semantic Web: a proof-of-application study,"Dafli, Eleni and Antoniou, Panagiotis and Ioannidis, Lazaros and Dombros, Nicholas and Topps, David and Bamidis, Panagiotis D.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Virtual patients are interactive computer simulations that are increasingly used as learning activities in modern health care education, especially in teaching clinical decision making. A key challenge is how to retrieve and repurpose virtual patients as unique types of educational resources between different platforms because of the lack of standardized content-retrieving and repurposing mechanisms. Semantic Web technologies provide the capability, through structured information, for easy retrieval, reuse, repurposing, and exchange of virtual patients between different systems. OBJECTIVE: An attempt to address this challenge has been made through the mEducator Best Practice Network, which provisioned frameworks for the discovery, retrieval, sharing, and reuse of medical educational resources. We have extended the OpenLabyrinth virtual patient authoring and deployment platform to facilitate the repurposing and retrieval of existing virtual patient material. METHODS: A standalone Web distribution and Web interface, which contains an extension for the OpenLabyrinth virtual patient authoring system, was implemented. This extension was designed to semantically annotate virtual patients to facilitate intelligent searches, complex queries, and easy exchange between institutions. The OpenLabyrinth extension enables OpenLabyrinth authors to integrate and share virtual patient case metadata within the mEducator3.0 network. Evaluation included 3 successive steps: (1) expert reviews; (2) evaluation of the ability of health care professionals and medical students to create, share, and exchange virtual patients through specific scenarios in extended OpenLabyrinth (OLabX); and (3) evaluation of the repurposed learning objects that emerged from the procedure. RESULTS: We evaluated 30 repurposed virtual patient cases. The evaluation, with a total of 98 participants, demonstrated the system's main strength: the core repurposing capacity. The extensive metadata schema presentation facilitated user exploration and filtering of resources. Usability weaknesses were primarily related to standard computer applications' ease of use provisions. Most evaluators provided positive feedback regarding educational experiences on both content and system usability. Evaluation results replicated across several independent evaluation events. CONCLUSIONS: The OpenLabyrinth extension, as part of the semantic mEducator3.0 approach, is a virtual patient sharing approach that builds on a collection of Semantic Web services and federates existing sources of clinical and educational data. It is an effective sharing tool for virtual patients and has been merged into the next version of the app (OpenLabyrinth 3.3). Such tool extensions may enhance the medical education arsenal with capacities of creating simulation/game-based learning episodes, massive open online courses, curricular transformations, and a future robust infrastructure for enabling mobile learning.",2015,10.2196/jmir.3933,17,1,e16,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*Computer Simulation and *Internet and *Patient Simulation and *User-Computer Interface and data sharing and Education, Medical/*methods and educational assessment and Health Personnel and Humans and medical education and patient simulation and Pilot Projects and problem-based learning and semantics and Semantics and Software and Students, Medical",NA,NA,2015/01/22/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shi_2018_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Evaluating Doctor Performance: Ordinal Regression-Based Approach,"Shi, Yong and Li, Peijia and Yu, Xiaodan and Wang, Huadong and Niu, Lingfeng",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Doctor's performance evaluation is an important task in mobile health (mHealth), which aims to evaluate the overall quality of online diagnosis and patient outcomes so that customer satisfaction and loyalty can be attained. However, most patients tend not to rate doctors' performance, therefore, it is imperative to develop a model to make doctor's performance evaluation automatic. When evaluating doctors' performance, we rate it into a score label that is as close as possible to the true one. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform automatic doctor's performance evaluation from online textual consultations between doctors and patients by way of a novel machine learning method. METHODS: We propose a solution that models doctor's performance evaluation as an ordinal regression problem. In doing so, a support vector machine combined with an ordinal partitioning model (SVMOP), along with an innovative predictive function will be developed to capture the hidden preferences of the ordering labels over doctor's performance evaluation. When engineering the basic text features, eight customized features (extracted from over 70,000 medical entries) were added and further boosted by the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm. RESULTS: Real data sets from one of the largest mobile doctor/patient communication platforms in China are used in our study. Statistically, 64% of data on mHealth platforms lack the evaluation labels from patients. Experimental results reveal that our approach can support an automatic doctor performance evaluation. Compared with other auto-evaluation models, SVMOP improves mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.1, mean square error (MSE) by 0.5, pairwise accuracy (PAcc) by 5%; the suggested customized features improve MAE by 0.1, MSE by 0.2, PAcc by 3%. After boosting, performance is further improved. Based on SVMOP, predictive features like politeness and sentiment words can be mined, which can be further applied to guide the development of mHealth platforms. CONCLUSIONS: The initial modelling of doctor performance evaluation is an ordinal regression problem. Experiments show that the performance of our proposed model with revised prediction function is better than many other machine learning methods on MAE, MSE, as well as PAcc. With this model, the mHealth platform could not only make an online auto-evaluation of physician performance, but also obtain the most effective features, thereby guiding physician performance and the development of mHealth platforms.",2018,10.2196/jmir.9300,20,7,e240,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*mHealth and *ordinal partitioning and *ordinal regression and *performance evaluation and *support vector machines and Algorithms and Female and Humans and Male and mHealth and ordinal partitioning and ordinal regression and performance evaluation and Physicians/*standards and Research Design and support vector machines and Telemedicine/*standards,NA,NA,2018/07/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Michie_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Developing and Evaluating Digital Interventions to Promote Behavior Change in Health and Health Care: Recommendations Resulting From an International Workshop,"Michie, Susan and Yardley, Lucy and West, Robert and Patrick, Kevin and Greaves, Felix",Journal of medical Internet research,"Devices and programs using digital technology to foster or support behavior change (digital interventions) are increasingly ubiquitous, being adopted for use in patient diagnosis and treatment, self-management of chronic diseases, and in primary prevention. They have been heralded as potentially revolutionizing the ways in which individuals can monitor and improve their health behaviors and health care by improving outcomes, reducing costs, and improving the patient experience. However, we are still mainly in the age of promise rather than delivery. Developing and evaluating these digital interventions presents new challenges and new versions of old challenges that require use of improved and perhaps entirely new methods for research and evaluation. This article discusses these challenges and provides recommendations aimed at accelerating the rate of progress in digital behavior intervention research and practice. Areas addressed include intervention development in a rapidly changing technological landscape, promoting user engagement, advancing the underpinning science and theory, evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and addressing issues of regulatory, ethical, and information governance. This article is the result of a two-day international workshop on how to create, evaluate, and implement effective digital interventions in relation to health behaviors. It was held in London in September 2015 and was supported by the United Kingdom's Medical Research Council (MRC), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Methodology Research Programme (PI Susan Michie), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of the United States (PI Kevin Patrick). Important recommendations to manage the rapid pace of change include considering using emerging techniques from data science, machine learning, and Bayesian approaches and learning from other disciplines including computer science and engineering. With regard to assessing and promoting engagement, a key conclusion was that sustained engagement is not always required and that for each intervention it is useful to establish what constitutes ""effective engagement,"" that is, sufficient engagement to achieve the intended outcomes. The potential of digital interventions for testing and advancing theories of behavior change by generating ecologically valid, real-time objective data was recognized. Evaluations should include all phases of the development cycle, designed for generalizability, and consider new experimental designs to make the best use of rich data streams. Future health economics analyses need to recognize and model the complex and potentially far-reaching costs and benefits of digital interventions. In terms of governance, developers of digital behavior interventions should comply with existing regulatory frameworks, but with consideration for emerging standards around information governance, ethics, and interoperability.",2017,10.2196/jmir.7126,19,6,e232,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and health behavior and eHealth and *eHealth and *mHealth and *mobile applications and Delivery of Health Care/*standards and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and mHealth and *behavioral medicine and Telemedicine/*statistics & numerical data and Health Behavior/*physiology and mobile applications and *health behavior and behavioral medicine and *psychological theory and psychological theory,NA,NA,2017/06/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

John and Seger, Diane L. and Dykes, Patricia C. and Bates, David W.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Variation in the use of tests and treatments has been demonstrated to be substantial between providers and geographic regions. This study assessed variation between outpatient providers in overriding electronic prescribing warnings. METHODS: Responses to warnings were prospectively logged. Random effects models were used to calculate provider-to-provider variation in the rates for the decisions to override warnings in 6 different clinical domains: medication allergies, drug-drug interactions, duplicate drugs, renal recommendations, age-based recommendations, and formulary substitutions. RESULTS: A total of 157 482 responses were logged. Differences between 1717 providers accounted for 11% of the overall variability in override rates, so that while the average override rate was 45.2%, individual provider rates had a wide range with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (13.7%-76.7% ). The highest variations between providers were observed in the categories age-based (25.4% of total variability; average override rate 70.2% [95% CI, 29.1%-100% ]) and renal recommendations (24.2%; average 70% [95% CI, 29.5%-100% ]), and provider responses within these 2 categories were most often clinically inappropriate according to prior work. Among providers who received at least 10 age-based recommendations, 64 of 238 (27%) overrode <e2><89><a5> 90% of the warnings and 13 of 238 (5%) overrode all of them. Of those who received at least 10 renal recommendations, 36 of 92 (39%) overrode <e2><89><a5> 90% of the alerts and 9 of 92 (10%) overrode all of them.

Pawloski_2017_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Predicting neutropenia risk in patients with cancer using electronic data,"Pawloski, Pamala A. and Thomas, Avis J. and Kane, Sheryl and Vazquez-Benitez, Gabriela and Shapiro, Gary R. and Lyman, Gary H.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical guidelines recommending the use of myeloid growth factors are largely based on the prescribed chemotherapy regimen. The guidelines suggest that oncologists consider patient-specific characteristics when prescribing granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis; however, a mechanism to quantify individual patient risk is lacking. Readily available electronic health record (EHR) data can provide patient-specific information needed for individualized neutropenia risk estimation. An evidence-based, individualized neutropenia risk estimation algorithm has been developed. This study evaluated the automated extraction of EHR chemotherapy treatment data and externally validated the neutropenia risk prediction model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed breast, colorectal, lung, lymphoid, or ovarian cancer who received the first cycle of a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen from 2008 to 2013 were recruited from a single cancer clinic. Electronically extracted EHR chemotherapy treatment data were validated by chart review. Neutropenia risk stratification was conducted and risk model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination. RESULTS: Chemotherapy treatment data electronically extracted from the EHR were verified by chart review. The neutropenia risk prediction tool classified 126 patients (57%) as being low risk for febrile neutropenia, 44 (20%) as intermediate risk, and 51 (23%) as high risk. The model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test = 0.24). Discrimination was adequate and slightly less than in the original internal validation (c-statistic 0.75 vs 0.81).

The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to scope the scientific literature in the field of pervasive wearable health monitoring in the time interval from January 2010 to February 2019 with respect to four important pillars: technology, safety and security, prescriptive insight, and user-related concerns. The purpose of this study was multifold: identification of (1) trends and milestones that have driven research in wearable technology in the last decade, (2) concerns and barriers from technology and user perspective, and (3) trends in the research literature addressing these issues. METHODS: This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. RESULTS: The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain. The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.",2019,10.2196/14017,21,9,e14017,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*assisted living facilities and *review and *telemedicine and *wearable technology and assisted living facilities and Humans and Remote Sensing Technology/*methods and review and Technology and telemedicine and Telemedicine/*standards and Wearable Electronic Devices/*standards and wearable technology,NA,NA,2019/09/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

To address this gap and inform the design of PHIM tools, we describe the work, needs, and barriers of FF in the context of PHIM for OAs. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 52 FF identified by OA as being important in their health and PHIM. We analyzed interview transcripts for themes about FF information work, barriers, and support needs. RESULTS: FF play a supportive role in OA health maintenance, medical encounters, decision making, and daily activities. Monitoring, the ongoing process of seeking information related to the OA status, emerged as a key activity comprised of 3 phases: detection, interpretation, and action. Barriers to monitoring included OA choices and constraints, FF constraints, and difficulty with technological tools, resources, health information exchange between providers, social network dynamics, and physical distance. CONCLUSIONS: FF frequently monitor for change in OA well-being, seeking up-to-date information to facilitate support of OA PHIM. Health information technology tools designed for FF can support all phases of monitoring by providing: (1) timely and granular levels of access to OA health information as the OA ages; (2) tailored health education for FF that is based on OA clinical data; and (3) networking platforms that integrate delegation, volunteering, and relevant resources, along with tools to facilitate support of OA appointment calendars and medication management.

As there has been enormous technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence and data processing in the past decade, the use of virtual coaches gains an augmented attention in the considerations of medical innovations. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed at providing an overview of the applications of a virtual coach in the clinical field. In particular, the review focused on the papers that provide tangible information for coaching activities with an active implication for engaging and guiding patients who have an ongoing plan of care. METHODS: We aimed to investigate the use of the term virtual coach in the clinical field performing a methodical review of the relevant literature indexed on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to find virtual coach papers focused on specific activities dealing with clinical or medical contexts, excluding those aimed at surgical settings or electronic learning purposes. RESULTS: After a careful revision of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 46 records were selected for the full-text review. Most of the identified articles directly or indirectly addressed the topic of physical activity. Some papers were focused on the use of virtual coaching (VC) to manage overweight or nutritional issues. Other papers dealt with technological interfaces to facilitate interactions with patients suffering from different chronic clinical conditions such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and chronic pain.

The example of AntibioHelp(R) in bacterial diseases","Tsopra, Rosy and Sedki, Karima and Courtine, Melanie and Falcoff, Hector and De Beco, Antoine and Madar, Ronni and Mechai, Frederic and Lamy, Jean-Baptiste",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) implementing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have 2 main limitations: they target only patients for whom CPGs provide explicit recommendations, and their rationale may be difficult to understand. These 2 limitations result in poor CDSS adoption. We designed AntibioHelp(R) as a CDSS for antibiotic treatment. It displays the recommended and nonrecommended antibiotics, together with their properties, weighted by degree of importance as outlined in the CPGs. The aim of this study was to determine whether AntibioHelp(R) could increase the confidence of general practitioners (GPs) in CPG recommendations and help them to extrapolate guidelines to patients for whom CPGs provide no explicit recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a 2-stage crossover study in which GPs responded to clinical cases using CPG recommendations either alone or with explanations displayed through AntibioHelp(R). We compared error rates, confidence levels, and response times. RESULTS: We included 64 GPs. When no explicit recommendation existed for a particular situation, AntibioHelp(R) significantly decreased the error rate (-41%, P value = 6x10-13), and significantly increased GP confidence (+8%, P value = .02). This CDSS was considered to be usable by GPs (SUS score = 64), despite a longer interaction time (+9-22 seconds). By contrast, AntibioHelp(R) had no significant effect if there was an explicit recommendation. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The visualization of weighted antibiotic properties helps GPs to extrapolate recommendations to patients for whom CPGs provide no explicit recommendations. It also increases GP confidence in their prescriptions for these patients. Further evaluations are required to determine the impact of AntibioHelp(R) on antibiotic prescriptions in real clinical practice.",2019,10.1093/jamia/ocz057,26,10,1010-1019,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"*antibiotics and *clinical decision support system and *clinical practice guidelines and *Data Display and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *infectious diseases and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and *primary care and *visualization and Adult and Aged and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and antibiotics and Attitude of Health Personnel and Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy and clinical decision support system and clinical practice guidelines and Cross-Over Studies and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and General Practitioners and Humans and infectious diseases and Male and Medication Errors/prevention & control and Middle Aged and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and primary care and User-Computer Interface and visualization",NA,NA,2019/10/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yin_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A Scalable Framework to Detect Personal Health Mentions on Twitter,"Yin, Zhijun and Fabbri, Daniel and Rosenbloom, S. Trent and Malin, Bradley",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Biomedical research has traditionally been conducted via surveys and the analysis of medical records. However, these resources are limited in their content, such that non-traditional domains (eg, online forums and social media) have an opportunity to supplement the view of an individual's health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a scalable framework to detect personal health status mentions on Twitter and assess the extent to which such information is disclosed. METHODS: We collected more than 250 million tweets via the Twitter streaming API over a 2-month period in 2014. The corpus was filtered down to approximately 250,000 tweets, stratified across 34 high-impact health issues, based on guidance from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We created a labeled corpus of several thousand tweets via a survey, administered over Amazon Mechanical Turk, that documents when terms correspond to mentions of personal health issues or an alternative (eg, a metaphor). We engineered a scalable classifier for personal health mentions via feature selection and assessed its potential over the health issues. We further investigated the utility of the tweets by determining the extent to which Twitter users disclose personal health status. RESULTS: Our investigation yielded several notable findings. First, we find that tweets from a small subset of the health issues can train a scalable classifier to detect health mentions. Specifically, training on 2000 tweets from four health issues (cancer, depression, hypertension, and leukemia) yielded a classifier with precision of 0.77 on all 34 health issues. Second, Twitter users disclosed personal health status for all health issues. Notably, personal health status was disclosed over 50% of the time for 11 out of 34 (33%) investigated health issues. Third, the disclosure rate was dependent on the health issue in a statistically significant manner (P<.001). For instance, more than 80% of the tweets about migraines (83/100) and allergies (85/100) communicated personal health status, while only around 10% of the tweets about obesity (13/100) and heart attack (12/100) did so. Fourth, the likelihood that people disclose their own versus other people's health status was dependent on health issue in a statistically significant manner as well (P<.001). For example, 69% (69/100) of the insomnia tweets disclosed the author's status, while only 1% (1/100) disclosed another person's status. By contrast, 1% (1/100) of the Down syndrome tweets disclosed the author's status, while 21% (21/100) disclosed another person's status. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to automatically detect personal health status mentions on Twitter in a scalable manner. These mentions correspond to the health issues of the Twitter users themselves, but also other individuals. Though this study did not investigate the veracity of such statements, we anticipate such information may be useful in supplementing traditional health-related sources for research purposes.",2015,10.2196/jmir.4305,17,6,e138,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Disclosure and *Health Status and *Internet and *Self Disclosure and *Social Media and consumer health and Data Collection and Humans and infodemiology and information retrieval and machine learning and social media and twitter,NA,NA,2015/06/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yom.Tov_2015_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Automatic identification of Web-based risk markers for health events,"Yom-Tov, Elad and Borsa, Diana and Hayward, Andrew C. and McKendry, Rachel A. and Cox, Ingemar J.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The escalating cost of global health care is driving the development of new technologies to identify early indicators of an individual's risk of disease. Traditionally, epidemiologists have identified such risk factors using medical databases and lengthy clinical studies but these are often limited in size and cost and can fail to take full account of diseases where there are social stigmas or to identify transient acute risk factors. OBJECTIVE: Here we report that Web search engine queries coupled with information on Wikipedia access patterns can be used to infer health events associated with an individual user and automatically generate Web-based risk markers for some of the common medical conditions worldwide, from cardiovascular disease to sexually transmitted infections and mental health conditions, as well as pregnancy. METHODS: Using anonymized datasets, we present methods to first distinguish individuals likely to have experienced specific health events, and classify them into distinct categories. We then use the self-controlled case series method to find the incidence of health events in risk periods directly following a user's search for a query category, and compare to the incidence during other periods for the same individuals. RESULTS: Searches for pet stores were risk markers for allergy. We also identified some possible new risk markers; for example: searching for fast food and theme restaurants was associated with a transient increase in risk of myocardial infarction, suggesting this exposure goes beyond a long-term risk factor but may also act as an acute trigger of myocardial infarction. Dating and adult content websites were risk markers for sexually transmitted infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based methods provide a powerful, low-cost approach to automatically identify risk factors, and support more timely and personalized public health efforts to bring human and economic benefits.",2015,10.2196/jmir.4082,17,1,e29,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*Internet and *Risk Factors and *Search Engine and Adolescent and Adult and epidemiology and Female and Humans and Information retrieval query processing and Information Storage and Retrieval/*statistics & numerical data and Machine Learning and Male and Pregnancy and Public Health and self-controlled case series and Support Vector Machine and Web search engines,NA,NA,2015/01/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to devise and develop an interpretable and expandable diagnosis framework for automatically diagnosing multiple ocular diseases and providing treatment recommendations for the particular illness of a specific patient. METHODS: As the diagnosis of ocular diseases highly depends on observing medical images, we chose ophthalmic images as research material. All medical images were labeled to 4 types of diseases or normal (total 5 classes); each image was decomposed into different parts according to the anatomical knowledge and then annotated. This process yields the positions and primary information on different anatomical parts and foci observed in medical images, thereby bridging the gap between medical image and diagnostic process. Next, we applied images and the information produced during the annotation process to implement an interpretable and expandable automatic diagnostic framework with deep learning. RESULTS: This diagnosis framework comprises 4 stages. The first stage identifies the type of disease (identification accuracy, 93%). The second stage localizes the anatomical parts and foci of the eye (localization accuracy: images under natural light without fluorescein sodium eye drops, 82%; images under cobalt blue light or natural light with fluorescein sodium eye drops, 90%). The third stage carefully classifies the specific condition of each anatomical part or focus with the result from the second stage (average accuracy for multiple classification problems, 79%-98%). The last stage provides treatment advice according to medical experience and artificial intelligence, which is merely involved with pterygium (accuracy, >95%). Based on this, we developed a telemedical system that can show detailed reasons for a particular diagnosis to doctors and patients to help doctors with medical decision making. This system can carefully analyze medical images and provide treatment advices according to the analysis results and consultation between a doctor and a patient. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable and expandable medical artificial intelligence platform was successfully built; this system can identify the disease, distinguish different anatomical parts and foci, discern the diagnostic information relevant to the diagnosis of diseases, and provide treatment suggestions. During this process, the whole diagnostic flow becomes clear and understandable to both doctors and their patients. Moreover, other diseases can be seamlessly integrated into this system without any influence on existing modules or diseases. Furthermore, this framework can assist in the clinical training of junior doctors. Owing to the rare high-grade medical resource, it is impossible that everyone receives high-quality professional diagnosis and treatment service. This framework can not only be applied in hospitals with insufficient medical resources to decrease the pressure on experienced doctors but also deployed in remote areas to help doctors diagnose common ocular diseases.",2018,10.2196/11144,20,11,e11144,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*deep learning and *interpretable and expandable diagnosis framework and *making medical decisions and *multiple ocular diseases and *object localization and *Qualitative Research and deep learning and Deep Learning/*trends and Eye Diseases/classification/*diagnosis and Humans and interpretable and expandable diagnosis framework and making medical decisions and multiple ocular diseases and object localization,NA,NA,2018/11/14/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of this work is to inform electronic health record alert optimization and clinical practice workflow by identifying, compiling, and reporting design recommendations for CDSS to support the efficient, effective, and timely delivery of high-quality care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted from 2000 to 2016 in PubMed and The Journal of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society to identify papers that discussed/recommended design features of CDSSs that are associated with the success of these systems. RESULTS: Fourteen papers were included as meeting the criteria and were found to have a total of 42 unique recommendations; 11 were classified as interface features, 10 as information features, and 21 as interaction features. DISCUSSION: Features are defined and described, providing actionable guidance that can be applied to CDSS development and policy. To our knowledge, no reviews have been completed that discuss/recommend design features of CDSS at this scale, and thus we found that this was important for the body of literature. The recommendations identified in this narrative review will help to optimize design, organization, management, presentation, and utilization of information through presentation, content, and function. The designation of 3 categories (interface, information, and interaction) should be further evaluated to determine the critical importance of the categories.

Improved visualization of patient information may help clinicians cope with information overload, increase efficiency, and improve quality. We compared the effect of information display interventions with usual care on patient care outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review including experimental and quasi-experimental studies of information display interventions conducted in critical care and anesthesiology settings. Citations from January 1990 to June 2018 were searched in PubMed and IEEE Xplore. Reviewers worked independently to screen articles, evaluate quality, and abstract primary outcomes and display features. RESULTS: Of 6742 studies identified, 22 studies evaluating 17 information displays met the study inclusion criteria. Information display categories included comprehensive integrated displays (3 displays), multipatient dashboards (7 displays), physiologic and laboratory monitoring (5 displays), and expert systems (2 displays). Significant improvement on primary outcomes over usual care was reported in 12 studies for 9 unique displays. Improvement was found mostly with comprehensive integrated displays (4 of 6 studies) and multipatient dashboards (5 of 7 studies). Only 1 of 5 randomized controlled trials had a positive effect in the primary outcome. CONCLUSION: We found weak evidence suggesting comprehensive integrated displays improve provider efficiency and process outcomes, and multipatient dashboards improve compliance with care protocols and patient outcomes.

What are the unmet medical needs? How do we allocate limited resources to maximize the health and welfare of the people? These challenging questions might be re-examined systematically within an infodemiological frame on a much larger scale, leveraging the latest advancement in information technology and data science. OBJECTIVE: We expanded our previous work by investigating news media data to reveal the coverage of different diseases and medical conditions, together with their sentiments and topics in news articles over three decades. We were motivated to do so since news media plays a significant role in politics and affects the public policy making. METHODS: We analyzed over 3.5 million archive news articles from Reuters media during the periods of 1996/1997, 2008 and 2016, using summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Summary statistics illustrated the coverage of various diseases and medical conditions during the last 3 decades. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling helped us automatically detect the sentiments of news articles (ie, positive versus negative) and topics (ie, a series of keywords) associated with each disease over time. RESULTS: The percentages of news articles mentioning diseases and medical conditions were 0.44%, 0.57% and 0.81% in the three time periods, suggesting that news media or the public has gradually increased its interests in medicine since 1996. Certain diseases such as other malignant neoplasm (34%), other infectious diseases (20%), and influenza (11%) represented the most covered diseases. Two hundred and twenty-six diseases and medical conditions (97.8%) were found to have neutral or negative sentiments in the news articles. Using topic modeling, we identified meaningful topics on these diseases and medical conditions. For instance, the smoking theme appeared in the news articles on other malignant neoplasm only during 1996/1997. The topic phrases HIV and Zika virus were linked to other infectious diseases during 1996/1997 and 2016, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-dimensional analysis of news media data allows the discovery of focus, sentiments and topics of news media in terms of diseases and medical conditions. These infodemiological discoveries could shed light on unmet medical needs and research priorities for future and provide guidance for the decision making in public policy.",2018,10.2196/10047,20,5,e10047,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*news and *Public Opinion and *public policy and *research priority and *Reuters and *sentiment analysis and *text mining and *topic modeling and *unmet medical need and Humans and Information Services/*trends and Internet/*trends and Mass Media/*trends and news and public policy and research priority and Reuters and sentiment analysis and text mining and topic modeling and unmet medical need,NA,NA,2018/05/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to discriminate important features for identifying users' social support needs based on knowledge gathered from survey data. This study also provides guidelines for a technical framework, which can be used to predict users' social support needs based on raw data collected from OHSNs. METHODS: We initially conducted a Web-based survey with 184 OHSN users. From this survey data, we extracted 34 features based on 5 categories: (1) demographics, (2) reading behavior, (3) posting behavior, (4) perceived roles in OHSNs, and (5) values sought in OHSNs. Features from the first 4 categories were used as variables for binary classification. For the prediction outcomes, we used features from the last category: the needs for emotional support, experience-based information, unconventional information, and medical facts. We compared 5 binary classifier algorithms: gradient boosting tree, random forest, decision tree, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We then calculated the scores of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to understand the comparative effectiveness of the used features. RESULTS: The best performance was AUC scores of 0.89 for predicting users seeking emotional support, 0.86 for experience-based information, 0.80 for unconventional information, and 0.83 for medical facts. With the gradient boosting tree as our best performing model, we analyzed the strength of individual features in predicting one's social support need. Among other discoveries, we found that users seeking emotional support tend to post more in OHSNs compared with others. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an initial framework for automatically predicting social support needs in OHSNs using survey data.

Interface design can focus on decision processes (guided navigation) or usability principles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare these two approaches in terms of perceived usability, accuracy rate, and confidence in the system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We displayed clinical practice guidelines for antibiotic treatment via two types of interface, which we compared in a crossover design. General practitioners were asked to provide responses for 10 clinical cases and the System Usability Scale (SUS) for each interface. We assessed SUS scores, the number of correct responses, and the confidence level for each interface. RESULTS: SUS score and percentage confidence were significantly higher for the interface designed according to usability principles (81 vs 51, p=0.00004, and 88.8% vs 80.7%, p=0.004). The percentage of correct responses was similar for the two interfaces. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The interface designed according to usability principles was perceived to be more usable and inspired greater confidence among physicians than the guided navigation interface.

Senteio_2019_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Psychosocial information use for clinical decisions in diabetes care,"Senteio, Charles and Adler-Milstein, Julia and Richardson, Caroline and Veinot, Tiffany",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: There are increasing efforts to capture psychosocial information in outpatient care in order to enhance health equity. To advance clinical decision support systems (CDSS), this study investigated which psychosocial information clinicians value, who values it, and when and how clinicians use this information for clinical decision-making in outpatient type 2 diabetes care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This mixed methods study involved physician interviews (n = 17) and a survey of physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), and diabetes educators (n = 198). We used the grounded theory approach to analyze interview data and descriptive statistics and tests of difference by clinician type for survey data. RESULTS: Participants viewed financial strain, mental health status, and life stressors as most important. NPs and diabetes educators perceived psychosocial information to be more important, and used it significantly more often for 1 decision, than did physicians. While some clinicians always used psychosocial information, others did so when patients were not doing well. Physicians used psychosocial information to judge patient capabilities, understanding, and needs; this informed assessment of the risks and the feasibility of options and patient needs. These assessments influenced 4 key clinical decisions. DISCUSSION: Triggers for psychosocially informed CDSS should include psychosocial screening results, new or newly diagnosed patients, and changes in patient status. CDSS should support cost-sensitive medication prescribing, and psychosocially based assessment of hypoglycemia risk.

However, merely providing access does not guarantee comprehension. Patients could experience confusion when reviewing their test results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the challenges and needs of patients when comprehending laboratory test results. METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey with 203 participants and a set of semistructured interviews with 13 participants. We assessed patients' perceived challenges and needs (both informational and technological needs) when they attempted to comprehend test results, factors associated with patients' perceptions, and strategies for improving the design of patient portals to communicate laboratory test results more effectively. Descriptive and correlation analysis and thematic analysis were used to analyze the survey and interview data, respectively. RESULTS: Patients face a variety of challenges and confusion when reviewing laboratory test results. To better comprehend laboratory results, patients need different types of information, which are grouped into 2 categories-generic information (eg, reference range) and personalized or contextual information (eg, treatment options, prognosis, what to do or ask next). We also found that several intrinsic factors (eg, laboratory result normality, health literacy, and technology proficiency) significantly impact people's perceptions of using portals to view and interpret laboratory results. The desired enhancements of patient portals include providing timely explanations and educational resources (eg, a health encyclopedia), increasing usability and accessibility, and incorporating artificial intelligence-based technology to provide personalized recommendations.

The aim of the present study was to analyze critical drug prescriptions in a university-based nephrology clinic and to evaluate the effect of different alerting strategies on the alert burden. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, two advanced strategies to automatically generate alerts were applied when medication regimens were entered for discharge letters, outpatient clinic letters, and written prescriptions and compared to two basic reference strategies. Strategy A generated alerts whenever drug-specific information was available, whereas strategy B generated alerts only when the estimated glomerular filtration rate of a patient was below a drug-specific value. Strategies C and D included further patient characteristics and drug-specific information to generate even more specific alerts. RESULTS: Overall, 1012 medication regimens were entered during the observation period. The average number of alerts per drug preparation in medication regimens entered for letters was 0.28, 0.080, 0.019, and 0.011, when using strategy A, B, C, or D (P<0.001, for comparison between the strategies), leading to at least one alert in 87.5%, 39.3%, 13.5%, or 7.81 % of the regimens. Similar average numbers of alerts were observed for medication regimens entered for written prescriptions.

Specifically, these methods are popular in the medical domain because of their suitability for applications where there is a lack of a sufficient data set for the other classes. Infection incidence often brings prolonged hyperglycemia and frequent insulin injections in people with type 1 diabetes, which are significant anomalies. Despite these potentials, there have been very few studies that focused on detecting infection incidences in individuals with type 1 diabetes using a dedicated personalized health model. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a personalized health model that can automatically detect the incidence of infection in people with type 1 diabetes using blood glucose levels and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio as input variables. The model is expected to detect deviations from the norm because of infection incidences considering elevated blood glucose levels coupled with unusual changes in the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. METHODS: Three groups of one-class classifiers were trained on target data sets (regular days) and tested on a data set containing both the target and the nontarget (infection days). For comparison, two unsupervised models were also tested. The data set consists of high-precision self-recorded data collected from three real subjects with type 1 diabetes incorporating blood glucose, insulin, diet, and events of infection. The models were evaluated on two groups of data: raw and filtered data and compared based on their performance, computational time, and number of samples required. RESULTS: The one-class classifiers achieved excellent performance. In comparison, the unsupervised models suffered from performance degradation mainly because of the atypical nature of the data. Among the one-class classifiers, the boundary and domain-based method produced a better description of the data. Regarding the computational time, nearest neighbor, support vector data description, and self-organizing map took considerable training time, which typically increased as the sample size increased, and only local outlier factor and connectivity-based outlier factor took considerable testing time. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the applicability of one-class classifiers and unsupervised models for the detection of infection incidence in people with type 1 diabetes. In this patient group, detecting infection can provide an opportunity to devise tailored services and also to detect potential public health threats. The proposed approaches achieved excellent performance; in particular, the boundary and domain-based method performed better. Among the respective groups, particular models such as one-class support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, and K-means achieved excellent performance in all the sample sizes and infection cases. Overall, we foresee that the results could encourage researchers to examine beyond the presented features into other additional features of the self-recorded data, for example, continuous glucose monitoring features and physical activity data, on a large scale.",2020,10.2196/18912,22,8,e18912,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*decision support techniques and *infection detection and *outbreak detection system and *self-recorded health data and *syndromic surveillance and *type 1 diabetes and Algorithms and decision support techniques and Diabetes Complications/*complications and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications and Humans and Incidence and infection detection and Machine Learning/*standards and outbreak detection system and Precision Medicine/*methods and self-recorded health data and syndromic surveillance and type 1 diabetes",NA,NA,2020/08/12/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johnson_2018_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The MIMIC Code Repository: enabling reproducibility in critical care research,"Johnson, Alistair Ew and Stone, David J. and Celi, Leo A. and Pollard, Tom J.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Lack of reproducibility in medical studies is a barrier to the generation of a robust knowledge base to support clinical decision-making. In this paper we outline the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) Code Repository, a centralized code base for generating reproducible studies on an openly available critical care dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Code is provided to load the data into a relational structure, create extractions of the data, and reproduce entire analysis plans including research studies. RESULTS: Concepts extracted include severity of illness scores, comorbid status, administrative definitions of sepsis, physiologic criteria for sepsis, organ failure scores, treatment administration, and more. Executable documents are used for tutorials and reproduce published studies end-to-end, providing a template for future researchers to replicate. The repository's issue tracker enables community discussion about the data and concepts, allowing users to collaboratively improve the resource. DISCUSSION: The centralized repository provides a platform for users of the data to interact directly with the data generators, facilitating greater understanding of the data.

OBJECTIVE: The intent was to conduct a study of a preventive medical service in a developing country, combining eHealth checkups and teleconsultation as well as assess stratification rules and the short-term effects of intervention. METHODS: We developed an eHealth system that comprises a set of sensor devices in an attache case, a data transmission system linked to a mobile network, and a data management application. We provided eHealth checkups for the populations of five villages and the employees of five factories/offices in Bangladesh. Individual health condition was automatically categorized into four grades based on international diagnostic standards: green (healthy), yellow (caution), orange (affected), and red (emergent). We provided teleconsultation for orange- and red-grade subjects and we provided teleprescription for these subjects as required. RESULTS: The first checkup was provided to 16,741 subjects. After one year, 2361 subjects participated in the second checkup and the systolic blood pressure of these subjects was significantly decreased from an average of 121 mmHg to an average of 116 mmHg (P<.001). Based on these results, we propose a cost-effective method using a machine learning technique (random forest method) using the medical interview, subject profiles, and checkup results as predictor to avoid costly measurements of blood sugar, to ensure sustainability of the program in developing countries.

We describe the development and evaluation of a system to automatically find and categorize all new RCT reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trialstreamer continuously monitors PubMed and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, looking for new RCTs in humans using a validated classifier. We combine machine learning and rule-based methods to extract information from the RCT abstracts, including free-text descriptions of trial PICO (populations, interventions/comparators, and outcomes) elements and map these snippets to normalized MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) vocabulary terms. We additionally identify sample sizes, predict the risk of bias, and extract text conveying key findings. We store all extracted data in a database, which we make freely available for download, and via a search portal, which allows users to enter structured clinical queries.

Tarver_2016_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The impact of health information technology on cancer care across the continuum: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Tarver, Will L. and Menachemi, Nir",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"INTRODUCTION: Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to play a significant role in the management of cancer. The purpose of this review is to identify and examine empirical studies that investigate the impact of HIT in cancer care on different levels of the care continuum. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in four academic databases. The authors used a three-step search process to identify 122 studies that met specific inclusion criteria. Next, a coding sheet was used to extract information from each included article to use in an analysis. Logistic regression was used to determine study-specific characteristics that were associated with positive findings. RESULTS: Overall, 72.4% of published analyses reported a beneficial effect of HIT. Multivariate analysis found that the impact of HIT differs across the cancer continuum with studies targeting diagnosis and treatment being, respectively, 77 (P = .001) and 39 (P = .039) percentage points less likely to report a beneficial effect when compared to those targeting prevention. In addition, studies targeting HIT to patients were 31 percentage points less likely to find a beneficial effect than those targeting providers (P = .030). Lastly, studies assessing behavior change as an outcome were 41 percentage points less likely to find a beneficial effect (P = .006), while studies targeting decision making were 27 percentage points more likely to find a beneficial effect (P = .034).

The rapidly growing availability of electronic ""big data"" from diagnostic and prediagnostic sources in health care and public health settings permits advance of a new generation of methods for local detection and prediction of winter influenza seasons and influenza pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a method for integrated detection and prediction of influenza virus activity in local settings using electronically available surveillance data and to evaluate its performance by retrospective application on authentic data from a Swedish county. METHODS: An integrated detection and prediction method was formally defined based on a design rationale for influenza detection and prediction methods adapted for local surveillance. The novel method was retrospectively applied on data from the winter influenza season 2008-09 in a Swedish county (population 445,000). Outcome data represented individuals who met a clinical case definition for influenza (based on International Classification of Diseases version 10 [ICD-10] codes) from an electronic health data repository. Information from calls to a telenursing service in the county was used as syndromic data source. RESULTS: The novel integrated detection and prediction method is based on nonmechanistic statistical models and is designed for integration in local health information systems. The method is divided into separate modules for detection and prediction of local influenza virus activity. The function of the detection module is to alert for an upcoming period of increased load of influenza cases on local health care (using influenza-diagnosis data), whereas the function of the prediction module is to predict the timing of the activity peak (using syndromic data) and its intensity (using influenza-diagnosis data). For detection modeling, exponential regression was used based on the assumption that the beginning of a winter influenza season has an exponential growth of infected individuals. For prediction modeling, linear regression was applied on 7-day periods at the time in order to find the peak timing, whereas a derivate of a normal distribution density function was used to find the peak intensity. We found that the integrated detection and prediction method detected the 2008-09 winter influenza season on its starting day (optimal timeliness 0 days), whereas the predicted peak was estimated to occur 7 days ahead of the factual peak and the predicted peak intensity was estimated to be 26% lower than the factual intensity (6.3 compared with 8.5 influenza-diagnosis cases/100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Our detection and prediction method is one of the first integrated methods specifically designed for local application on influenza data electronically available for surveillance.

The connection between Internet searches for dementia information and dementia incidence and dementia-related outpatient visits remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether Google Trends could provide insight into trends in dementia incidence and related outpatient visits in Taiwan. We investigated and validated the local search terms that would be the best predictors of new dementia cases and outpatient visits. We further evaluated the nowcasting (ie, forecasting the present) and forecasting effects of Google Trends search trends for new dementia cases and outpatient visits. The long-term goal is to develop a surveillance system to help early detection and interventions for dementia in Taiwan. METHODS: This study collected (1) dementia data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and (2) local Internet search data from Google Trends, both from January 2009 to December 2011. We investigated and validated search terms that would be the best predictors of new dementia cases and outpatient visits. We then evaluated both the nowcasting and the forecasting effects of Google Trends search trends through cross-correlation analysis of the dementia incidence and outpatient visit data with the Google Trends data. RESULTS: The search term ""dementia + Alzheimer's disease"" demonstrated a 3-month lead effect for new dementia cases and a 6-month lead effect for outpatient visits (r=.503, P=.002; r=.431, P=.009, respectively). When gender was included in the analysis, the search term ""dementia"" showed 6-month predictive power for new female dementia cases (r=.520, P=.001), but only a nowcasting effect for male cases (r=.430, P=.009). The search term ""neurology"" demonstrated a 3-month leading effect for new dementia cases (r=.433, P=.008), for new male dementia cases (r=.434, P=.008), and for outpatient visits (r=.613, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Google Trends established a plausible relationship between search terms and new dementia cases and dementia-related outpatient visits in Taiwan. This data may allow the health care system in Taiwan to prepare for upcoming outpatient and dementia screening visits.

Rothenfluh_2016_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Consumer Decision-Making Based on Review Websites: Are There Differences Between Choosing a Hotel and Choosing a Physician?,"Rothenfluh, Fabia and Germeni, Evi and Schulz, Peter J.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Web users are increasingly encouraged to rate and review consumer services (eg, hotels, restaurants) and, more recently, this is also the case for physicians and medical services. The resemblance in the setup and design of commercial rating websites (CRWs) and Web-based physician rating websites (PRWs) raises the question of whether choice-making processes based on the two types of websites could also be similar. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study sought to explore the extent to which consumer decision making based on Web-based reviews is the same for consumer services (ie, choice of a hotel) and health services (ie, choice of a pediatrician), while providing an in-depth understanding of potential differences or similarities. METHODS: Between June and August 2015, we carried out a total of 22 qualitative interviews with young parents residing in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Participants were invited to complete 2 choice tasks, which involved (1) choosing a hotel based on the commercial Web-based rating website TripAdvisor and (2) selecting a pediatrician based on the PRW Jameda. To better understand consumers' thought processes, we instructed participants to ""think aloud"", namely to verbalize their thinking while sorting through information and reaching decisions. Using a semistructured interview guide, we subsequently posed open-ended questions to allow them to elaborate more on factors influencing their decision making, level of confidence in their final choice, and perceived differences and similarities in their search for a hotel and a physician. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Participants spent on average 9:57 minutes (standard deviation=9:22, minimum=3:46, maximum=22:25) searching for a hotel and 6:17 minutes (standard deviation=4:47, minimum=00:38, maximum=19:25) searching for a pediatrician. Although the choice of a pediatrician was perceived as more important than the choice of a hotel, participants found choosing a physician much easier than selecting an appropriate accommodation. Four main themes emerged from the analysis of our interview data that can explain the differences in search time and choice confidence: (1) trial and error, (2) trust, (3) competence assessment, and (4) affect and likeability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, despite congruent website designs, individuals only trust review information to choose a hotel, but refuse to fully rely on it for selecting a physician. The design and content of Web-based PRWs need to be adjusted to better address the differing information needs of health consumers.",2016,10.2196/jmir.5580,18,6,e129,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and qualitative research and patient satisfaction and Patient Satisfaction and electronic word of mouth and *Decision Making and Physicians/*standards and *qualitative research and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and *Choice Behavior and *patient satisfaction and *electronic word of mouth and *health care provider and *health care quality assessment and *physician choice and *physician rating website and Housing/standards and health care provider and health care quality assessment and physician choice and physician rating website,NA,NA,2016/06/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Daughton_2019_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Identifying Protective Health Behaviors on Twitter: Observational Study of Travel Advisories and Zika Virus,"Daughton, Ashlynn R. and Paul, Michael J.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 3.9 billion individuals live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease-travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. METHODS: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. RESULTS: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information.

Chen_2020_JoofmeInre_4,JOUR,Effect of Speech Recognition on Problem Solving and Recall in Consumer Digital Health Tasks: Controlled Laboratory Experiment,"Chen, Jessica and Lyell, David and Laranjo, Liliana and Magrabi, Farah",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence have led to widespread adoption of speech recognition technologies. In consumer health applications, speech recognition is usually applied to support interactions with conversational agents for data collection, decision support, and patient monitoring. However, little is known about the use of speech recognition in consumer health applications and few studies have evaluated the efficacy of conversational agents in the hands of consumers. In other consumer-facing tools, cognitive load has been observed to be an important factor affecting the use of speech recognition technologies in tasks involving problem solving and recall. Users find it more difficult to think and speak at the same time when compared to typing, pointing, and clicking. However, the effects of speech recognition on cognitive load when performing health tasks has not yet been explored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of speech recognition for documentation in consumer digital health tasks involving problem solving and recall. METHODS: Fifty university staff and students were recruited to undertake four documentation tasks with a simulated conversational agent in a computer laboratory. The tasks varied in complexity determined by the amount of problem solving and recall required (simple and complex) and the input modality (speech recognition vs keyboard and mouse). Cognitive load, task completion time, error rate, and usability were measured. RESULTS: Compared to using a keyboard and mouse, speech recognition significantly increased the cognitive load for complex tasks (Z=-4.08, P<.001) and simple tasks (Z=-2.24, P=.03). Complex tasks took significantly longer to complete (Z=-2.52, P=.01) and speech recognition was found to be overall less usable than a keyboard and mouse (Z=-3.30, P=.001). However, there was no effect on errors. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a keyboard and mouse was preferable to speech recognition for complex tasks involving problem solving and recall. Further studies using a broader variety of consumer digital health tasks of varying complexity are needed to investigate the contexts in which use of speech recognition is most appropriate. The effects of cognitive load on task performance and its significance also need to be investigated.",2020,10.2196/14827,22,6,e14827,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,*consumer health informatics and *ergonomics and *speech recognition software and Adolescent and Adult and consumer health informatics and Consumer Health Informatics/*methods and ergonomics and Female and Humans and Laboratories/*standards and Male and Middle Aged and Problem Solving/*physiology and speech recognition software and Speech Recognition Software/*standards and Young Adult,NA,NA,2020/06/01/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Collinge_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Fibromyalgia Impact Reduction Using Online Personal Health Informatics: Longitudinal Observational Study,"Collinge, William and Soltysik, Robert and Yarnold, Paul",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Personal health informatics have the potential to help patients discover personalized health management strategies that influence outcomes. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex chronic illness requiring individualized strategies that may be informed by analysis of personal health informatics data. An online health diary program with dynamic feedback was developed to assist patients with FM in identifying symptom management strategies that predict their personal outcomes, and found reduced symptom levels associated with program use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine longitudinal associations between program use and functional impact of FM as measured by scores on a standardized assessment instrument, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). METHODS: Participants were self-identified as diagnosed with FM and recruited via online FM advocacy websites. Participants used an online health diary program (""SMARTLog"") to report symptom ratings, behaviors, and management strategies used. Based on single-subject analysis of the accumulated data over time, individualized recommendations (""SMARTProfile"") were then provided by the automated feedback program. Indices of program use comprised of cumulative numbers of SMARTLogs completed and SMARTProfiles received. Participants included in this analysis met a priori criteria of sufficient program use to generate SMARTProfiles (ie, <e2><89><a5>22 SMARTLogs completed). Users completed the FIQ at baseline and again each subsequent month of program use as follow-up data for analysis. Kendall tau-b, a nonparametric statistic that measures both the strength and direction of an ordinal association between two repeated measured variables, was computed between all included FIQ scores and both indices of program use for each subject at the time of each completed FIQ. RESULTS: A total of 76 users met the a priori use criteria. The mean baseline FIQ score was 61.6 (SD 14.7). There were 342 FIQ scores generated for longitudinal analysis via Kendall tau-b. Statistically significant inverse associations were found over time between FIQ scores and (1) the cumulative number of SMARTLogs completed (tau-b=-0.135, P<.001); and (2) the cumulative number of SMARTProfiles received (tau-b=-0.133, P<.001). Users who completed 61 or more SMARTLogs had mean follow-up scores of 49.9 (n=25, 33% of the sample), an 18.9% drop in FM impact. Users who generated 11 or more new SMARTProfiles had mean follow-up scores of 51.8 (n=23, 30% of the sample), a 15.9% drop. CONCLUSIONS: Significant inverse associations were found between FIQ scores and both indices of program use, with FIQ scores declining as use increased. Based on established criteria for rating FM severity, the top one-third of users in terms of use had clinically significant reductions from ""severe"" to ""moderate"" FM impact. These findings underscore the value of self-management interventions with low burden, high usability, and high perceived relevance to the user.

Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word ""cough"" was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. RESULTS: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word ""cough"" to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.",2020,10.2196/21562,22,9,e21562,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"*COVID-19 and *electronic health record and *forecast and *pandemic and *prediction and *time-series analysis and Acute Disease and Adult and Ambulatory Care Facilities and Betacoronavirus and California/epidemiology and Coronavirus Infections and Cough/*epidemiology and COVID-19 and electronic health record and Electronic Health Records and Emergency Service, Hospital and Female and forecast and Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and pandemic and Pandemics and Pneumonia, Viral and prediction and Respiratory Insufficiency/*epidemiology and Retrospective Studies and SARS-CoV-2 and Seasons and time-series analysis",NA,NA,2020/09/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schild_2019_JMImHeanduHe,JOUR,A Digital Cognitive Aid for Anesthesia to Support Intraoperative Crisis Management: Results of the User-Centered Design Process,"Schild, Stefanie and Sedlmayr, Brita and Schumacher, Ann-Kathrin and Sedlmayr, Martin and Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich and St Pierre, Michael",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"BACKGROUND: Stressful situations during intraoperative emergencies have negative impact on human cognitive functions. Consequently, task performance may decrease and patient safety may be compromised. Cognitive aids can counteract these effects and support anesthesiologists in their crisis management. The Professional Association of German Anesthesiologists set up a project to develop a comprehensive set of digital cognitive aids for intraoperative emergencies. A parallel development for several software platforms and stationary and mobile devices will accommodate the inhomogeneity of the information technology infrastructure within German anesthesia departments. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to provide a detailed overview of how the task of developing a digital cognitive aid for intraoperative crisis management in anesthesia was addressed that meets user requirements and is highly user-friendly. METHODS: A user-centered design (UCD) process was conducted to identify, specify, and supplement the requirements for a digital cognitive aid. The study covered 4 aspects: analysis of the context of use, specification of user requirements, development of design solutions, and evaluation of design solutions. Three prototypes were developed and evaluated by end users of the application. Following each evaluation, the new requirements were prioritized and used for redesign. For the first and third prototype, the System Usability Scale (SUS) score was determined. The second prototype was evaluated with an extensive Web-based questionnaire. The evaluation of the third prototype included a think-aloud protocol. RESULTS: The chosen methods enabled a comprehensive collection of requirements and helped to improve the design of the application. The first prototype achieved an average SUS score of 74 (SD 12), indicating good usability. The second prototype included the following main revisions: 2-column layout, initial selection of patient type (infant, adult, or parturient), 4 offered search options, and the option to check off completed action steps. Its evaluation identified the following major revision points: add quick selection for resuscitation checklists, design the top bar and tabs slightly larger, and add more pictograms to the text. The third prototype achieved an average SUS score of 77 (SD 15). The evaluation of the think-aloud protocol revealed a good intuitiveness of the application and identified a missing home button as the main issue. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiology-as an acute medical field-is particularly characterized by its high demands on decision making and action in dynamic, or time-critical situations. The integration of usability aspects is essential for everyday and emergency suitability. The UCD process allowed us to develop a prototypical digital cognitive aid, exhibiting high usability and user satisfaction in the demanding environment of anesthesiological emergencies. Both aspects are essential to increase the acceptance of the application in later stages. The study approach, combining different methods for determining user requirements, may be useful for other implementation projects in a highly demanding environment.",2019,10.2196/13226,7,4,e13226,eng,2291-5222,"*anesthesiology and *checklist and *crew resource management, healthcare and *emergency treatment and *ergonomics and *human factors and *practice guideline and *reference books, medical and *resuscitation and *Software Design and *user-computer interface and Anesthesia Department, Hospital/*methods/statistics & numerical data and anesthesiology and checklist and crew resource management, healthcare and Crisis Intervention/*instrumentation/methods/standards and emergency treatment and ergonomics and human factors and Humans and Internet and Intraoperative Complications/psychology/*therapy and Mobile Applications/*standards/statistics & numerical data and practice guideline and reference books, medical and resuscitation and Surveys and Questionnaires and user-computer interface and User-Computer Interface",NA,NA,2019/04/29/,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mavragani_2020_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Infodemiology and Infoveillance: Scoping Review,"Mavragani, Amaryllis",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Web-based sources are increasingly employed in the analysis, detection, and forecasting of diseases and epidemics, and in predicting human behavior toward several health topics. This use of the internet has come to be known as infodemiology, a concept introduced by Gunther Eysenbach. Infodemiology and infoveillance studies use web-based data and have become an integral part of health informatics research over the past decade. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide a scoping review of the state-of-the-art in infodemiology along with the background and history of the concept, to identify sources and health categories and topics, to elaborate on the validity of the employed methods, and to discuss the gaps identified in current research. METHODS: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed to extract the publications that fall under the umbrella of infodemiology and infoveillance from the JMIR, PubMed, and Scopus databases. A total of 338 documents were extracted for assessment. RESULTS: Of the 338 studies, the vast majority (n=282, 83.4%) were published with JMIR Publications. The Journal of Medical Internet Research features almost half of the publications (n=168, 49.7%), and JMIR Public Health and Surveillance has more than one-fifth of the examined studies (n=74, 21.9%). The interest in the subject has been increasing every year, with 2018 featuring more than one-fourth of the total publications (n=89, 26.3%), and the publications in 2017 and 2018 combined accounted for more than half (n=171, 50.6%) of the total number of publications in the last decade. The most popular source was Twitter with 45.0% (n=152), followed by Google with 24.6% (n=83), websites and platforms with 13.9% (n=47), blogs and forums with 10.1% (n=34), Facebook with 8.9% (n=30), and other search engines with 5.6% (n=19). As for the subjects examined, conditions and diseases with 17.2% (n=58) and epidemics and outbreaks with 15.7% (n=53) were the most popular categories identified in this review, followed by health care (n=39, 11.5%), drugs (n=40, 10.4%), and smoking and alcohol (n=29, 8.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The field of infodemiology is becoming increasingly popular, employing innovative methods and approaches for health assessment.

Cheng_2017_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,"Cheng, Qijin and Li, Tim Mh and Kwok, Chi-Leung and Zhu, Tingshao and Yip, Paul Sf",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Early identification and intervention are imperative for suicide prevention. However, at-risk people often neither seek help nor take professional assessment. A tool to automatically assess their risk levels in natural settings can increase the opportunity for early intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether computerized language analysis methods can be utilized to assess one's suicide risk and emotional distress in Chinese social media. METHODS: A Web-based survey of Chinese social media (ie, Weibo) users was conducted to measure their suicide risk factors including suicide probability, Weibo suicide communication (WSC), depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Participants' Weibo posts published in the public domain were also downloaded with their consent. The Weibo posts were parsed and fitted into Simplified Chinese-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (SC-LIWC) categories. The associations between SC-LIWC features and the 5 suicide risk factors were examined by logistic regression. Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) model was applied based on the language features to automatically classify whether a Weibo user exhibited any of the 5 risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 974 Weibo users participated in the survey. Those with high suicide probability were marked by a higher usage of pronoun (odds ratio, OR=1.18, P=.001), prepend words (OR=1.49, P=.02), multifunction words (OR=1.12, P=.04), a lower usage of verb (OR=0.78, P<.001), and a greater total word count (OR=1.007, P=.008). Second-person plural was positively associated with severe depression (OR=8.36, P=.01) and stress (OR=11, P=.005), whereas work-related words were negatively associated with WSC (OR=0.71, P=.008), severe depression (OR=0.56, P=.005), and anxiety (OR=0.77, P=.02). Inconsistently, third-person plural was found to be negatively associated with WSC (OR=0.02, P=.047) but positively with severe stress (OR=41.3, P=.04). Achievement-related words were positively associated with depression (OR=1.68, P=.003), whereas health- (OR=2.36, P=.004) and death-related (OR=2.60, P=.01) words positively associated with stress. The machine classifiers did not achieve satisfying performance in the full sample set but could classify high suicide probability (area under the curve, AUC=0.61, P=.04) and severe anxiety (AUC=0.75, P<.001) among those who have exhibited WSC. CONCLUSIONS: SC-LIWC is useful to examine language markers of suicide risk and emotional distress in Chinese social media and can identify characteristics different from previous findings in the English literature. Some findings are leading to new hypotheses for future verification. Machine classifiers based on SC-LIWC features are promising but still require further optimization for application in real life.",2017,10.2196/jmir.7276,19,7,e243,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"machine learning and social media and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Linguistics and suicide and Asian Continental Ancestry Group and *machine learning and *social media and Suicide/*psychology and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and Data Mining/*methods and Machine Learning/*statistics & numerical data and *suicide and *psychological stress and *Chinese and *natural language and Stress, Psychological/*psychology and psychological stress and Asians and Chinese and natural language",NA,NA,2017/07/10/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

A Secondary Data Analytics Approach,"Carroll, Jennifer K. and Moorhead, Anne and Bond, Raymond and LeBlanc, William G. and Petrella, Robert J. and Fiscella, Kevin",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone use and the adoption of healthy lifestyle software apps (""health apps"") are rapidly proliferating. There is limited information on the users of health apps in terms of their social demographic and health characteristics, intentions to change, and actual health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to (1) to describe the sociodemographic characteristics associated with health app use in a recent US nationally representative sample; (2) to assess the attitudinal and behavioral predictors of the use of health apps for health promotion; and (3) to examine the association between the use of health-related apps and meeting the recommended guidelines for fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity. METHODS: Data on users of mobile devices and health apps were analyzed from the National Cancer Institute's 2015 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which was designed to provide nationally representative estimates for health information in the United States and is publicly available on the Internet. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess sociodemographic predictors of mobile device and health app use and examine the associations between app use, intentions to change behavior, and actual behavioral change for fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and weight loss. RESULTS: From the 3677 total HINTS respondents, older individuals (45-64 years, odds ratio, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-68; 65+ years, OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.14-0.24), males (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.94), and having degree (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.18-3.70) or less than high school education (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.72) were all significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of having adopted health apps. Similarly, both age and education were significant variables for predicting whether a person had adopted a mobile device, especially if that person was a college graduate (OR 3.30). Individuals with apps were significantly more likely to report intentions to improve fruit (63.8% with apps vs 58.5% without apps, P=.01) and vegetable (74.9% vs 64.3%, P<.01) consumption, physical activity (83.0% vs 65.4%, P<.01), and weight loss (83.4% vs 71.8%, P<.01). Individuals with apps were also more likely to meet recommendations for physical activity compared with those without a device or health apps (56.2% with apps vs 47.8% without apps, P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: The main users of health apps were individuals who were younger, had more education, reported excellent health, and had a higher income. Although differences persist for gender, age, and educational attainment, many individual sociodemographic factors are becoming less potent in influencing engagement with mobile devices and health app use. App use was associated with intentions to change diet and physical activity and meeting physical activity recommendations.",2017,10.2196/jmir.5604,19,4,e125,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Internet and *Internet and health behavior and smartphone and *Health Behavior and *mobile applications and *cell phone and *smartphone and Cell Phone/*statistics & numerical data and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data and *health promotion and health promotion and mobile applications and *health behavior and cell phone,NA,NA,2017/04/19/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the published data on infertility and the internet only address the experiences of women, with limited studies focusing exclusively on internet discussions on male factor infertility. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the concerns and experiences of discussants on an online male infertility community and to provide insight into their perceptions of interactions with health care professionals. METHODS: Using the large-scale data analytics tool BigQuery, we extracted all posts in the r/MaleInfertility community (877 members) of the social media website and discussion board Reddit from November 2017 to October 2018. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative semantic analysis using Language Inquiry and Word Count 2015 of the extracted posts to identify dominant themes and subthemes of discussions. Descriptive statistics and semantic analytic Z-scores were computed. RESULTS: From the analysis of 97 posts, notable themes and subthemes emerged: 70 (72%) posts shared personal experiences, including feeling emasculated or isolated or describing a negative (28/97, 29%), positive (13/97, 13%), or neutral (56/97, 58%) experience with a health care professional; 19% (18/97) of the posts posed questions about personal semen analysis results. On the basis of semantic analysis, posts by men had higher authenticity scores (Z=3.44; P<.001), suggesting more honest or personal texts, but lower clout scores (Z=4.57; P<.001), suggesting a more tentative or anxious style of writing, compared with posts by women. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of a social media community focused exclusively on male infertility using mixed methodology.

CDSS are used to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Since their first use in the 1980s, CDSS have seen a rapid evolution. They are now commonly administered through electronic medical records and other computerized clinical workflows, which has been facilitated by increasing global adoption of electronic medical records with advanced capabilities. Despite these advances, there remain unknowns regarding the effect CDSS have on the providers who use them, patient outcomes, and costs. There have been numerous published examples in the past decade(s) of CDSS success stories, but notable setbacks have also shown us that CDSS are not without risks. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art overview on the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine, including the different types, current use cases with proven efficacy, common pitfalls, and potential harms.

However, most of today's medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data - artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications - cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation. We discuss how interoperability can facilitate digital transformation in these areas to improve the health and well-being of patients worldwide.",2019,10.1038/s41746-019-0158-1,2,NA,79,eng,2398-6352,Health care and Health policy,NA,NA,2019///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the discipline has matured, individuals have called attention to aberrancies in the output of these algorithms. In particular, criticisms have been widely circulated that algorithmically developed models may have limited generalizability due to overfitting to the training data and may systematically perpetuate various forms of biases inherent in the training data, including race, gender, age, and health state or fitness level (Challen et al.

However, evidence indicates that such algorithms have the potential to worsen disparities currently intrinsic to the contemporary healthcare system, including racial biases. Blame for these deficiencies has often been placed on the algorithm-but the underlying training data bears greater responsibility for these errors, as biased outputs are inexorably produced by biased inputs. The utility, equity, and generalizability of predictive models depend on population-representative training data with robust feature sets. So while the conventional paradigm of big data is deductive in nature-clinical decision support-a future model harnesses the potential of big data for inductive reasoning. This may be conceptualized as clinical decision questioning, intended to liberate the human predictive process from preconceived lenses in data solicitation and/or interpretation. Efficacy, representativeness and generalizability are all heightened in this schema. Thus, the possible risks of biased big data arising from the inputs themselves must be acknowledged and addressed. Awareness of data deficiencies, structures for data inclusiveness, strategies for data sanitation, and mechanisms for data correction can help realize the potential of big data for a personalized medicine era.

For healthcare infrastructure, the answer is population measurement, monitoring people to compute status for clustering cohorts. In chronic care, most effective is measuring all the time, to track health status as it gradually changes. Passive monitors run in the background, without additional tasks to activate monitors, especially on mobile phones. At its core, a health system is a ""sorting problem"". Each patient entering the system must be effectively sorted into treatment cohorts. Health systems have three primary problems: Case Finding (which persons have which diagnoses), Risk Stratification (which persons are which status), and Care Routing (which persons need which treatments). The issue is then which measures can be continuously monitored at appropriate periodicity. The solutions of population measurement measure vital signs with passive monitors. These are input to predictive analytics to detect clinical values for providing care within health systems. For chronic care, complex vitals must be measured for overall status, such as oxygen saturation or gait speed. This enables healthcare infrastructure to support stratification, with persons placed into current levels of health status. Practical considerations for health systems influence implementation of new infrastructure. Case finding is more likely to be useful in urban settings, with barriers to entry based upon lower incomes. Care routing is more likely to be useful in rural settings, with barriers to entry based upon isolated geographies. Viable healthcare at acceptable quality and affordable cost is now possible for the range of geographies and incomes.",2018,10.1038/s41746-017-0004-2,1,NA,20174,eng,2398-6352,Diagnosis and Risk factors and Health services and Signs and symptoms and Respiratory tract diseases,NA,NA,2018///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Douglas",NPJ digital medicine,"Machine learning (ML) and its parent technology trend, artificial intelligence (AI), are deriving novel insights from ever larger and more complex datasets. Efficient and accurate AI analytics require fastidious data science-the careful curating of knowledge representations in databases, decomposition of data matrices to reduce dimensionality, and preprocessing of datasets to mitigate the confounding effects of messy (i.e., missing, redundant, and outlier) data. Messier, bigger and more dynamic medical datasets create the potential for ML computing systems querying databases to draw erroneous data inferences, portending real-world human health consequences. High-dimensional medical datasets can be static or dynamic. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) used within R computing packages can speed & scale disease association analytics for deriving polygenic risk scores from static gene-expression microarrays. Robust PCA of k-dimensional subspace data accelerates image acquisition and reconstruction of dynamic 4-D magnetic resonance imaging studies, enhancing tracking of organ physiology, tissue relaxation parameters, and contrast agent effects. Unlike other data-dense business and scientific sectors, medical AI users must be aware that input data quality limitations can have health implications, potentially reducing analytic model accuracy for predicting clinical disease risks and patient outcomes.

However, there are many issues concerning patient privacy that need to be accounted for in order to enable this data to be better harnessed by all sectors. One approach that could offer a method of circumventing privacy issues is the creation of realistic synthetic data sets that capture as many of the complexities of the original data set (distributions, non-linear relationships, and noise) but that does not actually include any real patient data. While previous research has explored models for generating synthetic data sets, here we explore the integration of resampling, probabilistic graphical modelling, latent variable identification, and outlier analysis for producing realistic synthetic data based on UK primary care patient data. In particular, we focus on handling missingness, complex interactions between variables, and the resulting sensitivity analysis statistics from machine learning classifiers, while quantifying the risks of patient re-identification from synthetic datapoints. We show that, through our approach of integrating outlier analysis with graphical modelling and resampling, we can achieve synthetic data sets that are not significantly different from original ground truth data in terms of feature distributions, feature dependencies, and sensitivity analysis statistics when inferring machine learning classifiers.

Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-00341-z,3,NA,136,eng,2398-6352,Medical imaging and Machine learning and Data integration,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Treatment recommendations are predictions with an inherently causal interpretation. To use deep learning for these applications in the setting of observational data, deep learning methods must be made compatible with the required causal assumptions. We present a scenario with real-world medical images (CT-scans of lung cancer) and simulated outcome data. Through the data simulation scheme, the images contain two distinct factors of variation that are associated with survival, but represent a collider (tumor size) and a prognostic factor (tumor heterogeneity), respectively. When a deep network would use all the information available in the image to predict survival, it would condition on the collider and thereby introduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect. We show that when this collider can be quantified, unbiased individual prognosis predictions are attainable with deep learning. This is achieved by (1) setting a dual task for the network to predict both the outcome and the collider and (2) enforcing a form of linear independence of the activation distributions of the last layer. Our method provides an example of combining deep learning and structural causal models to achieve unbiased individual prognosis predictions. Extensions of machine learning methods for applications to causal questions are required to attain the long-standing goal of personalized medicine supported by artificial intelligence.",2019,10.1038/s41746-019-0194-x,2,NA,122,eng,2398-6352,Epidemiology and Computer science and Prognosis and Computed tomography,NA,NA,2019///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Paulus_2020_NPJdigmed,JOUR,Predictably unequal: understanding and addressing concerns that algorithmic clinical prediction may increase health disparities,"Paulus, Jessica K. and Kent, David M.",NPJ digital medicine,"The machine learning community has become alert to the ways that predictive algorithms can inadvertently introduce unfairness in decision-making. Herein, we discuss how concepts of algorithmic fairness might apply in healthcare, where predictive algorithms are being increasingly used to support decision-making. Central to our discussion is the distinction between algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias. Fairness concerns apply specifically when algorithms are used to support polar decisions (i.e., where one pole of prediction leads to decisions that are generally more desired than the other), such as when predictions are used to allocate scarce health care resources to a group of patients that could all benefit. We review different fairness criteria and demonstrate their mutual incompatibility. Even when models are used to balance benefits-harms to make optimal decisions for individuals (i.e., for non-polar decisions)-and fairness concerns are not germane-model, data or sampling issues can lead to biased predictions that support decisions that are differentially harmful/beneficial across groups. We review these potential sources of bias, and also discuss ways to diagnose and remedy algorithmic bias. We note that remedies for algorithmic fairness may be more problematic, since we lack agreed upon definitions of fairness. Finally, we propose a provisional framework for the evaluation of clinical prediction models offered for further elaboration and refinement. Given the proliferation of prediction models used to guide clinical decisions, developing consensus for how these concerns can be addressed should be prioritized.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-0304-9,3,NA,99,eng,2398-6352,Health care and Medical research,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the emergence of AI/ML in medicine also creates challenges, which regulators must pay attention to. Which medical AI/ML-based products should be reviewed by regulators? What evidence should be required to permit marketing for AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD)? How can we ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based SaMD that may change over time as they are applied to new data? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, has recently proposed a discussion paper to address some of these issues.

This shift in perspective-from a product view to a system view-is central to maximizing the safety and efficacy of AI/ML in health care, but it also poses significant challenges for agencies like the FDA who are used to regulating products, not systems.

New analytical techniques, such as sentiment analysis, may allow us to understand and use this information more effectively to improve the quality of health care. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to use machine learning to understand patients' unstructured comments about their care. We used sentiment analysis techniques to categorize online free-text comments by patients as either positive or negative descriptions of their health care. We tried to automatically predict whether a patient would recommend a hospital, whether the hospital was clean, and whether they were treated with dignity from their free-text description, compared to the patient's own quantitative rating of their care. METHODS: We applied machine learning techniques to all 6412 online comments about hospitals on the English National Health Service website in 2010 using Weka data-mining software. We also compared the results obtained from sentiment analysis with the paper-based national inpatient survey results at the hospital level using Spearman rank correlation for all 161 acute adult hospital trusts in England. RESULTS: There was 81%, 84%, and 89% agreement between quantitative ratings of care and those derived from free-text comments using sentiment analysis for cleanliness, being treated with dignity, and overall recommendation of hospital respectively (kappa scores: .40-.74, P<.001 for all).

METHODS: From EHR access logs and other organizational data collected over a 2-month period, the authors extracted 26 features likely to be useful in detecting suspicious accesses. Selected events were marked as either suspicious or appropriate by privacy officers, and served as the gold standard set for model evaluation. The authors trained logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models on 10-fold cross-validation sets of 1291 labeled events. The authors evaluated the sensitivity of final models on an external set of 58 events that were identified as truly inappropriate and investigated independently from this study using standard operating procedures.

Akyea_2020_NPJdigmed,JOUR,Performance and clinical utility of supervised machine-learning approaches in detecting familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care,"Akyea, Ralph K. and Qureshi, Nadeem and Kai, Joe and Weng, Stephen F.",NPJ digital medicine,"Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common inherited disorder, causing lifelong elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Most individuals with FH remain undiagnosed, precluding opportunities to prevent premature heart disease and death. Some machine-learning approaches improve detection of FH in electronic health records, though clinical impact is under-explored. We assessed performance of an array of machine-learning approaches for enhancing detection of FH, and their clinical utility, within a large primary care population. A retrospective cohort study was done using routine primary care clinical records of 4,027,775 individuals from the United Kingdom with total cholesterol measured from 1 January 1999 to 25 June 2019. Predictive accuracy of five common machine-learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines, neural networks and ensemble learning) were assessed for detecting FH. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) and expected vs observed calibration slope; with clinical utility assessed by expected case-review workload and likelihood ratios. There were 7928 incident diagnoses of FH. In addition to known clinical features of FH (raised total cholesterol or LDL-C and family history of premature coronary heart disease), machine-learning (ML) algorithms identified features such as raised triglycerides which reduced the likelihood of FH. Apart from logistic regression (AUC, 0.81), all four other ML approaches had similarly high predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.89). Calibration slope ranged from 0.997 for gradient boosting machines to 1.857 for logistic regression. Among those screened, high probability cases requiring clinical review varied from 0.73% using ensemble learning to 10.16% using deep learning, but with positive predictive values of 15.5% and 2.8% respectively. Ensemble learning exhibited a dominant positive likelihood ratio (45.5) compared to all other ML models (7.0-14.4). Machine-learning models show similar high accuracy in detecting FH, offering opportunities to increase diagnosis. However, the clinical case-finding workload required for yield of cases will differ substantially between models.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-00349-5,3,NA,142,eng,2398-6352,Outcomes research and Dyslipidaemias,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Electronic health records are valuable sources of real-world evidence for assessing device safety and tracking device-related patient outcomes over time. However, distilling this evidence remains challenging, as information is fractured across clinical notes and structured records. Modern machine learning methods for machine reading promise to unlock increasingly complex information from text, but face barriers due to their reliance on large and expensive hand-labeled training sets. To address these challenges, we developed and validated state-of-the-art deep learning methods that identify patient outcomes from clinical notes without requiring hand-labeled training data. Using hip replacements-one of the most common implantable devices-as a test case, our methods accurately extracted implant details and reports of complications and pain from electronic health records with up to 96.3% precision, 98.5% recall, and 97.4% F1, improved classification performance by 12.8-53.9% over rule-based methods, and detected over six times as many complication events compared to using structured data alone. Using these additional events to assess complication-free survivorship of different implant systems, we found significant variation between implants, including for risk of revision surgery, which could not be detected using coded data alone. Patients with revision surgeries had more hip pain mentions in the post-hip replacement, pre-revision period compared to patients with no evidence of revision surgery (mean hip pain mentions 4.97 vs. 3.23; t = 5.14; p < 0.001). Some implant models were associated with higher or lower rates of hip pain mentions.

Sleep disruptions due to unnecessary overnight vital sign monitoring are associated with delirium, cognitive impairment, weakened immunity, hypertension, increased stress, and mortality. It is also one of the most common complaints of hospital patients while imposing additional burdens on healthcare providers. Previous efforts to forgo overnight vital sign measurements and improve patient sleep used providers' subjective stability assessment or utilized an expanded, thus harder to retrieve, set of vitals and laboratory results to predict overnight clinical risk. Here, we present a model that incorporates past values of a small set of vital signs and predicts overnight stability for any given patient-night. Using data obtained from a multi-hospital health system between 2012 and 2019, a recurrent deep neural network was trained and evaluated using ~2.3 million admissions and 26 million vital sign assessments. The algorithm is agnostic to patient location, condition, and demographics, and relies only on sequences of five vital sign measurements, a calculated Modified Early Warning Score, and patient age. We achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.966 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.956-0.967) on the retrospective testing set, and 0.971 (95% CI 0.965-0.974) on the prospective set to predict overnight patient stability. The model enables safe avoidance of overnight monitoring for ~50% of patient-nights, while only misclassifying 2 out of 10,000 patient-nights as stable. Our approach is straightforward to deploy, only requires regularly obtained vital signs, and delivers easily actionable clinical predictions for a peaceful sleep in hospitals.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-00355-7,3,1,149,eng,2398-6352,NA,NA,NA,2020/11/13/,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Query Health defined a standards-based approach for distributed population health queries, using an ontology based on the Quality Data Model and Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture, Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) as the query language, the Query Envelope as the secure transport layer, and the Quality Reporting Document Architecture as the result language. RESULTS: We implemented this approach using Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and hQuery for data analytics and PopMedNet for access control, secure query distribution, and response. We deployed the reference implementation at three pilot sites: two public health departments (New York City and Massachusetts) and one pilot designed to support Food and Drug Administration post-market safety surveillance activities. The pilots were successful, although improved cross-platform data normalization is needed.

However, they often require large numbers of annotated samples, which are costly and time-consuming to review. We investigated the use of active learning (AL) in ML-based phenotyping algorithms. METHODS: We integrated an uncertainty sampling AL approach with support vector machines-based phenotyping algorithms and evaluated its performance using three annotated disease cohorts including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), colorectal cancer (CRC), and venous thromboembolism (VTE). We investigated performance using two types of feature sets: unrefined features, which contained at least all clinical concepts extracted from notes and billing codes; and a smaller set of refined features selected by domain experts. The performance of the AL was compared with a passive learning (PL) approach based on random sampling. RESULTS: Our evaluation showed that AL outperformed PL on three phenotyping tasks. When unrefined features were used in the RA and CRC tasks, AL reduced the number of annotated samples required to achieve an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.95 by 68% and 23%, respectively. AL also achieved a reduction of 68% for VTE with an optimal AUC of 0.70 using refined features. As expected, refined features improved the performance of phenotyping classifiers and required fewer annotated samples.

Cheng_2014_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,"Machine learning-based prediction of drug-drug interactions by integrating drug phenotypic, therapeutic, chemical, and genomic properties","Cheng, Feixiong and Zhao, Zhongming",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important consideration in both drug development and clinical application, especially for co-administered medications. While it is necessary to identify all possible DDIs during clinical trials, DDIs are frequently reported after the drugs are approved for clinical use, and they are a common cause of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and increasing healthcare costs. Computational prediction may assist in identifying potential DDIs during clinical trials. METHODS: Here we propose a heterogeneous network-assisted inference (HNAI) framework to assist with the prediction of DDIs. First, we constructed a comprehensive DDI network that contained 6946 unique DDI pairs connecting 721 approved drugs based on DrugBank data. Next, we calculated drug-drug pair similarities using four features: phenotypic similarity based on a comprehensive drug-ADR network, therapeutic similarity based on the drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, chemical structural similarity from SMILES data, and genomic similarity based on a large drug-target interaction network built using the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. Finally, we applied five predictive models in the HNAI framework: naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and support vector machine, respectively. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the HNAI models is 0.67 as evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. Using antipsychotic drugs as an example, several HNAI-predicted DDIs that involve weight gain and cytochrome P450 inhibition were supported by literature resources.

We sought to use predictive data mining and high dimensional analytics of electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a highly accurate and clinically actionable 5 year life expectancy index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the index using EHR data for 7463 patients <e2><89><a5>50 years old with <e2><89><a5>1 visit(s) in 2003 to a large, academic, multispecialty group practice. We extracted 980 attributes from the EHRs of the practices and affiliated hospitals. Correlation feature selection with greedy stepwise search was used to find the attribute subset with best average merit. Rotation forest ensembling with alternating decision tree as underlying classifier was used to predict 5 year mortality. Model performance was compared with the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Walter life expectancy method. RESULTS: Within 5 years of the last visit in 2003, 838 (11%) patients had died. The final model included 24 attributes: two demographic (age, sex), 10 comorbidity (eg, cardiovascular disease), one vital sign (mean diastolic blood pressure), two medications (loop diuretic use, digoxin use), six laboratory (eg, mean albumin), and three healthcare utilization (eg, the number of hospitalizations 1 year prior to the last visit in 2003). The index showed very good discrimination (c-statistic 0.86) and outperformed comparators. CONCLUSIONS: The EHR based index successfully distinguished adults <e2><89><a5>50 years old with life expectancy >5 years from those with life expectancy <e2><89><a4>5 years.

Some of these challenges arise from a misperception that the problem should be solved technically when actually the problem needs a holistic solution. OBJECTIVE: The authors' experience with informatics for integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2) use cases indicates that the privacy of the patient should be considered on three fronts: technical de-identification of the data, trust in the researcher and the research, and the security of the underlying technical platforms. METHODS: The security structure of i2b2 is implemented based on consideration of all three fronts. It has been supported with several use cases across the USA, resulting in five privacy categories of users that serve to protect the data while supporting the use cases. RESULTS: The i2b2 architecture is designed to provide consistency and faithfully implement these user privacy categories. These privacy categories help reflect the policy of both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the provisions of the National Research Act of 1974, as embodied by current institutional review boards.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health records of 741 adult patients at the University of California Davis Health System who met at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were used to associate patients' vital signs, white blood cell count (WBC), with sepsis occurrence and mortality. Generative and discriminative classification (naive Bayes, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models) were used to integrate heterogeneous patient data and form a predictive tool for the inference of lactate level and mortality risk. RESULTS: An accuracy of 0.99 and discriminability of 1.00 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for lactate level prediction was obtained when the vital signs and WBC measurements were analysed in a 24 h time bin. An accuracy of 0.73 and discriminability of 0.73 AUC for mortality prediction in patients with sepsis was achieved with only three features: median of lactate levels, mean arterial pressure, and median absolute deviation of the respiratory rate. DISCUSSION: This study introduces a new scheme for the prediction of lactate levels and mortality risk from patient vital signs and WBC. Accurate prediction of both these variables can drive the appropriate response by clinical staff and thus may have important implications for patient health and treatment outcome.

There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.",2019,10.1038/s41746-019-0193-y,2,NA,115,eng,2398-6352,Computational science and Computational biophysics,NA,NA,2019///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hip fractures are also the most commonly missed diagnosis on pelvic radiographs, and delayed diagnosis leads to higher cost and worse outcomes. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms have shown promise for helping radiologists detect fractures, but the image features underpinning their predictions are notoriously difficult to understand. In this study, we trained deep-learning models on 17,587 radiographs to classify fracture, 5 patient traits, and 14 hospital process variables. All 20 variables could be individually predicted from a radiograph, with the best performances on scanner model (AUC = 1.00), scanner brand (AUC = 0.98), and whether the order was marked ""priority"" (AUC = 0.79). Fracture was predicted moderately well from the image (AUC = 0.78) and better when combining image features with patient data (AUC = 0.86, DeLong paired AUC comparison, p = 2e-9) or patient data plus hospital process features (AUC = 0.91, p = 1e-21). Fracture prediction on a test set that balanced fracture risk across patient variables was significantly lower than a random test set (AUC = 0.67, DeLong unpaired AUC comparison, p = 0.003); and on a test set with fracture risk balanced across patient and hospital process variables, the model performed randomly (AUC = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.58), indicating that these variables were the main source of the model's fracture predictions. A single model that directly combines image features, patient, and hospital process data outperforms a Naive Bayes ensemble of an image-only model prediction, patient, and hospital process data. If CAD algorithms are inexplicably leveraging patient and process variables in their predictions, it is unclear how radiologists should interpret their predictions in the context of other known patient data.

DESIGN: Lancet incorporates three supervised machine-learning models: a conditional random fields model for tagging individual medication names and associated fields, an AdaBoost model with decision stump algorithm for determining which medication names and fields belong to a single medication event, and a support vector machines disambiguation model for identifying the context style (narrative or list). MEASUREMENTS: The authors, from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, participated in the third i2b2 shared-task for challenges in natural language processing for clinical data: medication extraction challenge. With the performance metrics provided by the i2b2 challenge, the micro F1 (precision/recall) scores are reported for both the horizontal and vertical level. RESULTS: Among the top 10 teams, Lancet achieved the highest precision at 90.4% with an overall F1 score of 76.4% (horizontal system level with exact match), a gain of 11.2% and 12%, respectively, compared with the rule-based baseline system jMerki.

METHODS: We developed two models to test our hypothesis. The first based on supervised machine learning was created using Apache's OpenNLP Maxent and the second based on information retrieval was created using Apache's Lucene. The models were validated by a random subsampling method that was repeated 20 times and that used 80/20 splits for training and testing, respectively. We also evaluated the performance of these models on all laboratory terms from three test institutions. RESULTS: For the 20 iterations used for validation of our 80/20 splits Maxent and Lucene ranked the correct LOINC code first for between 70.5% and 71.4% and between 63.7% and 65.0% of local terms, respectively. For all laboratory terms from the three test institutions Maxent ranked the correct LOINC code first for between 73.5% and 84.6% (mean 78.9%) of local terms, whereas Lucene's performance was between 66.5% and 76.6% (mean 71.9%). Using a cut-off score of 0.46 Maxent always ranked the correct LOINC code first for over 57% of local terms. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a rich corpus of local terms mapped to LOINC contains collective knowledge that can help map terms from other institutions.

The goal of the task was to construct a system that links the markables corresponding to the same entity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The task organizers provided progress notes and discharge summaries that were annotated with the markables of treatment, problem, test, person, and pronoun. We used a multi-pass sieve algorithm that applies deterministic rules in the order of preciseness and simultaneously gathers information about the entities in the documents. Our system, MedCoref, also uses a state-of-the-art machine learning framework as an alternative to the final, rule-based pronoun resolution sieve.

Algorithms that process these data and inform digital diagnostics are typically developed using training and test sets generated from multiple repeated measures collected across a set of individuals. However, the inclusion of repeated measurements is not always appropriately taken into account in the analytical evaluations of predictive performance. The assignment of repeated measurements from each individual to both the training and the test sets (""record-wise"" data split) is a common practice and can lead to massive underestimation of the prediction error due to the presence of ""identity confounding."" In essence, these models learn to identify subjects, in addition to diagnostic signal. Here, we present a method that can be used to effectively calculate the amount of identity confounding learned by classifiers developed using a record-wise data split. By applying this method to several real datasets, we demonstrate that identity confounding is a serious issue in digital health studies and that record-wise data splits for machine learning- based applications need to be avoided.",2019,10.1038/s41746-019-0178-x,2,NA,99,eng,2398-6352,Statistics and Preclinical research,NA,NA,2019///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The development, functionalities, and official evaluation of the system are detailed. DESIGN: Textractor is based on the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UMIA) framework, and uses methods that are a hybrid between machine learning and pattern matching. Two modules in the system are based on machine learning algorithms, while other modules use regular expressions, rules, and dictionaries, and one module embeds MetaMap Transfer. MEASUREMENTS: The official evaluation was based on a reference standard of 251 discharge summaries annotated by all teams participating in the challenge. The metrics used were recall, precision, and the F(1)-measure. They were calculated with exact and inexact matches, and were averaged at the level of systems and documents. RESULTS: The reference metric for this challenge, the system-level overall F(1)-measure, reached about 77% for exact matches, with a recall of 72% and a precision of 83%. Performance was the best with route information (F(1)-measure about 86%), and was good for dosage and frequency information, with F(1)-measures of about 82-85%. Results were not as good for durations, with F(1)-measures of 36-39%, and for reasons, with F(1)-measures of 24-27%.

When used in machine learning classification, many data features must first be transformed by discretization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate six discretization strategies, both supervised and unsupervised, using EMR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We classified laboratory data (arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements) and physiologic data (cardiac output (CO) measurements) derived from adult patients in the intensive care unit using decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers. Continuous features were partitioned using two supervised, and four unsupervised discretization strategies. The resulting classification accuracy was compared with that obtained with the original, continuous data. RESULTS: Supervised methods were more accurate and consistent than unsupervised, but tended to produce larger decision trees. Among the unsupervised methods, equal frequency and k-means performed well overall, while equal width was significantly less accurate. DISCUSSION: This is, we believe, the first dedicated evaluation of discretization strategies using EMR data. It is unlikely that any one discretization method applies universally to EMR data. Performance was influenced by the choice of class labels and, in the case of unsupervised methods, the number of intervals. In selecting the number of intervals there is generally a trade-off between greater accuracy and greater consistency. CONCLUSIONS: In general, supervised methods yield higher accuracy, but are constrained to a single specific application. Unsupervised methods do not require class labels and can produce discretized data that can be used for multiple purposes.",2013,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000929,20,3,544-553,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,Humans and Adult and Bayes Theorem and *Artificial Intelligence and Blood Gas Analysis and *Electronic Health Records and Data Mining/*methods and *Decision Trees and Cardiac Output,NA,NA,2013/05/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and the Veterans Affair (VA) Consortium for Healthcare Informatics Research (CHIR) partnered to organize the coreference challenge. They provided the research community with two corpora of medical records for the development and evaluation of the coreference resolution systems. These corpora contained various record types (ie, discharge summaries, pathology reports) from multiple institutions. METHODS: The coreference challenge provided the community with two annotated ground truth corpora and evaluated systems on coreference resolution in two ways: first, it evaluated systems for their ability to identify mentions of concepts and to link together those mentions. Second, it evaluated the ability of the systems to link together ground truth mentions that refer to the same entity. Twenty teams representing 29 organizations and nine countries participated in the coreference challenge. RESULTS: The teams' system submissions showed that machine-learning and rule-based approaches worked best when augmented with external knowledge sources and coreference clues extracted from document structure.

The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a machine-learned model of foodborne illness detection in a real-world setting. To this end, we built FINDER, a machine-learned model for real-time detection of foodborne illness using anonymous and aggregated web search and location data. We computed the fraction of people who visited a particular restaurant and later searched for terms indicative of food poisoning to identify potentially unsafe restaurants. We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety, allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness.",2018,10.1038/s41746-018-0045-1,1,NA,36,eng,2398-6352,Machine learning and Epidemiology and Data mining,NA,NA,2018///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hasan_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Automatic detection of omissions in medication lists,"Hasan, Sharique and Duncan, George T. and Neill, Daniel B. and Padman, Rema",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that the medication lists of patients are often incomplete and could negatively affect patient outcomes. In this article, the authors propose the application of collaborative filtering methods to the medication reconciliation task. Given a current medication list for a patient, the authors employ collaborative filtering approaches to predict drugs the patient could be taking but are missing from their observed list. DESIGN: The collaborative filtering approach presented in this paper emerges from the insight that an omission in a medication list is analogous to an item a consumer might purchase from a product list. Online retailers use collaborative filtering to recommend relevant products using retrospective purchase data. In this article, the authors argue that patient information in electronic medical records, combined with artificial intelligence methods, can enhance medication reconciliation. The authors formulate the detection of omissions in medication lists as a collaborative filtering problem. Detection of omissions is accomplished using several machine-learning approaches. The effectiveness of these approaches is evaluated using medication data from three long-term care centers. The authors also propose several decision-theoretic extensions to the methodology for incorporating medical knowledge into recommendations. RESULTS: Results show that collaborative filtering identifies the missing drug in the top-10 list about 40-50% of the time and the therapeutic class of the missing drug 50%-65% of the time at the three clinics in this study. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that collaborative filtering can be a valuable tool for reconciling medication lists, complementing currently recommended process-driven approaches. However, a one-size-fits-all approach is not optimal, and consideration should be given to context (eg, types of patients and drug regimens) and consequence (eg, the impact of omission on outcomes).",2011,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000106,18,4,449-458,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"Humans and Electronic Health Records and Logistic Models and Information Storage and Retrieval and Algorithms and Computer Simulation and *Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted and *Artificial Intelligence and Principal Component Analysis and *Medication Reconciliation and *Medication Systems",NA,NA,2011/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The system performs three sub-tasks: concept extraction, assertion classification, and relation identification. DESIGN: The overall system consists of five steps: (1) pre-processing sentences, (2) marking noun phrases (NPs) and adjective phrases (APs), (3) extracting concepts that use a dosage-unit dictionary to dynamically switch two models based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF), (4) classifying assertions based on voting of five classifiers, and (5) identifying relations using normalized sentences with a set of effective discriminating features. MEASUREMENTS: Macro-averaged and micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure were used to evaluate results. RESULTS: The performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art systems with micro-averaged F-measure of 0.8489 for concept extraction, 0.9392 for assertion classification and 0.7326 for relation identification. CONCLUSIONS: The system exploits an array of common features and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Prudent feature engineering sets the foundation of our systems. In concept extraction, we demonstrated that switching models, one of which is especially designed for telegraphic sentences, improved extraction of the treatment concept significantly. In assertion classification, a set of features derived from a rule-based classifier were proven to be effective for the classes such as conditional and possible. These classes would suffer from data scarcity in conventional machine-learning methods.

METHODS: We analyzed the EHRs of a random sample of 2100 pediatric emergency department (ED) patients with abdominal pain, including all with a final diagnosis of appendicitis. We developed an automated system to extract relevant elements from ED physician notes and lab values and to automatically assign a risk category for acute appendicitis (high, equivocal, or low), based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Score. We evaluated the performance of the system against a manually created gold standard (chart reviews by ED physicians) for recall, specificity, and precision. RESULTS: The system achieved an average F-measure of 0.867 (0.869 recall and 0.863 precision) for risk classification, which was comparable to physician experts. Recall/precision were 0.897/0.952 in the low-risk category, 0.855/0.886 in the high-risk category, and 0.854/0.766 in the equivocal-risk category. The information that the system required as input to achieve high F-measure was available within the first 4 h of the ED visit.

Klann_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Patient-tailored prioritization for a pediatric care decision support system through machine learning,"Klann, Jeffrey G. and Anand, Vibha and Downs, Stephen M.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Over 8 years, we have developed an innovative computer decision support system that improves appropriate delivery of pediatric screening and care. This system employs a guidelines evaluation engine using data from the electronic health record (EHR) and input from patients and caregivers. Because guideline recommendations typically exceed the scope of one visit, the engine uses a static prioritization scheme to select recommendations. Here we extend an earlier idea to create patient-tailored prioritization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Bayesian structure learning to build networks of association among previously collected data from our decision support system. Using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of discriminability (a sine qua non for expected value calculations needed for prioritization), we performed a structural analysis of variables with high AUC on a test set. Our source data included 177 variables for 29 402 patients. RESULTS: The method produced a network model containing 78 screening questions and anticipatory guidance (107 variables total). Average AUC was 0.65, which is sufficient for prioritization depending on factors such as population prevalence. Structure analysis of seven highly predictive variables reveals both face-validity (related nodes are connected) and non-intuitive relationships. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate the ability of a Bayesian structure learning method to 'phenotype the population' seen in our primary care pediatric clinics. The resulting network can be used to produce patient-tailored posterior probabilities that can be used to prioritize content based on the patient's current circumstances.

We undertook a study to evaluate the impact of a Web-based knowledge resource on increasing access to evidence and facilitating best practice of health care providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate (1) the impact of the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Evidence (SCIRE) project on access to information for health care providers and researchers and (2) how SCIRE influenced health care providers' management of clients. METHODS: A 4-part mixed methods evaluation was undertaken: (1) monitoring website traffic and utilization using Google Analytics, (2) online survey of users who accessed the SCIRE website, (3) online survey of targeted end-users, that is, rehabilitation health care providers known to work with spinal cord injury (SCI) clients, as well as researchers, and (4) focus groups with health care providers who had previously accessed SCIRE. RESULTS: The online format allowed the content for a relatively specialized field to have far reach (eg, 26 countries and over 6500 users per month). The website survey and targeted end-user survey confirmed that health care providers, as well as researchers perceived that the website increased their access to SCI evidence. Access to SCIRE not only improved knowledge of SCI evidence but helped inform changes to the health providers' clinical practice and improved their confidence in treating SCI clients. The SCIRE information directly influenced the health providers' clinical decision making, in terms of choice of intervention, equipment needs, or assessment tool.

Early diagnosis is important to minimize disease symptoms, complications, and consumption of healthcare resources. Most patients remain undiagnosed. We developed two electronic medical record (EMR)-based algorithms to identify patients at high risk of CD and in need of CD screening. METHODS: (I) Using natural language processing (NLP), we searched EMRs for 16 free text (and related) terms in 216 CD patients and 280 controls. (II) EMRs were also searched for ICD9 (International Classification of Disease) codes suggesting an increased risk of CD in 202 patients with CD and 524 controls. For each approach, we determined the optimal number of hits to be assigned as CD cases. To assess performance of these algorithms, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Using two hits as the cut-off, the NLP algorithm identified 72.9% of all celiac patients (sensitivity), and ruled out CD in 89.9% of the controls (specificity). In a representative US population of individuals without a prior celiac diagnosis (assuming that 0.6% had undiagnosed CD), this NLP algorithm could identify a group of individuals where 4.2% would have CD (positive predictive value). ICD9 code search using three hits as the cut-off had a sensitivity of 17.1% and a specificity of 88.5% (positive predictive value was 0.9%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five internal medicine residents reviewed 18 anemia alerts, while 'talking aloud'. They identified features that were reviewed by two or more physicians to determine appropriate alert level, etiology and treatment recommendation. Based on these features, data were extracted from 100 randomly-selected anemia cases for a training set and an additional 82 cases for a test set. Two staff internists assigned an alert level, etiology and treatment recommendation before and after reviewing the entire electronic medical record. The training set of 118 cases (100 plus 18) and the test set of 82 cases were explored using RIDOR and JRip algorithms. RESULTS: The feature set was sufficient to assess 93% of anemia cases (intraclass correlation for alert level before and after review of the records by internists 1 and 2 were 0.92 and 0.95, respectively). High-precision classifiers were constructed to identify low-level alerts (precision p=0.87, recall R=0.4), iron deficiency (p=1.0, R=0.73), and anemia associated with kidney disease (p=0.87, R=0.77). DISCUSSION: It was possible to identify low-level alerts and several conditions commonly associated with chronic anemia. This approach may reduce the number of clinically unimportant alerts.

Early prediction of AKI could prompt preventive measures, but is challenging in the clinical routine. One important reason is that the amount of postoperative data is too massive and too high-dimensional to be effectively processed by the human operator. We therefore sought to develop a deep-learning-based algorithm that is able to predict postoperative AKI prior to the onset of symptoms and complications. Based on 96 routinely collected parameters we built a recurrent neural network (RNN) for real-time prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. From the data of 15,564 admissions we constructed a balanced training set (2224 admissions) for the development of the RNN. The model was then evaluated on an independent test set (350 admissions) and yielded an area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) of 0.893 (0.862-0.924). We compared the performance of our model against that of experienced clinicians. The RNN significantly outperformed clinicians (AUC = 0.901 vs. 0.745, p < 0.001) and was overall well calibrated. This was not the case for the physicians, who systematically underestimated the risk (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the RNN was superior to physicians in the prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. It could potentially be integrated into hospitals' electronic health records for real-time patient monitoring and may help to detect early AKI and hence modify the treatment in perioperative care.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-00346-8,3,NA,139,eng,2398-6352,Diagnosis and Preventive medicine,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The final outputs of the system were scored using the i2b2 workshop evaluation metrics, including strict and relaxed matching with a gold standard. RESULTS: Evaluation results showed greater than 90% accuracy on five out of seven entities in the name entity recognition task, and an F-measure greater than 95% on the relationship classification task. The strict micro averaged F-measure for the system output achieved best submitted performance of the competition, at 85.65%. LIMITATIONS: Clinical staff will only use practical processing systems if they have confidence in their reliability. Authors estimate that an acceptable accuracy for a such a working system should be approximately 95%. This leaves a significant performance gap of 5 to 10% from the current processing capabilities. CONCLUSION: A multistage method with mixed computational strategies using a combination of rule-based classifiers and statistical classifiers seems to provide a near-optimal strategy for automated extraction of medication information from clinical records.",2010,10.1136/jamia.2010.003939,17,5,524-527,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,Humans and Artificial Intelligence and *Natural Language Processing and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and *Pharmaceutical Preparations and *Electronic Health Records,NA,NA,2010/10//Sep undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

In many regions, particularly those in resource-limited settings, SCD is not consistently diagnosed. In Africa, where the majority of SCD patients reside, more than 50% of the 0.2-0.3 million children born with SCD each year will die from it; many of these deaths are in fact preventable with correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a deep learning framework which can perform automatic screening of sickle cells in blood smears using a smartphone microscope. This framework uses two distinct, complementary deep neural networks. The first neural network enhances and standardizes the blood smear images captured by the smartphone microscope, spatially and spectrally matching the image quality of a laboratory-grade benchtop microscope. The second network acts on the output of the first image enhancement neural network and is used to perform the semantic segmentation between healthy and sickle cells within a blood smear. These segmented images are then used to rapidly determine the SCD diagnosis per patient. We blindly tested this mobile sickle cell detection method using blood smears from 96 unique patients (including 32 SCD patients) that were imaged by our smartphone microscope, and achieved ~98% accuracy, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.998.

In this observational, exploratory study, PD participants wore a smartwatch and used the Fox Wearable Companion mobile phone app to stream movement data and report symptom severity and medication intake for 6 months. Data were analyzed using the Intel(R) Pharma Analytics Platform. Clinicians reviewed participants' data in a dashboard during in-office visits at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Clinicians provided feedback in focus groups leading to dashboard updates. Between June and August 2017, 51 PD patients were recruited at four US sites, and 39 (76%) completed the 6-month study. Patients streamed 83,432 h of movement data from their smartwatches (91% of expected). Reporting of symptoms and medication intake using the app was lower than expected, 44% and 60%, respectively, but did not differ according to baseline characteristics. Clinicians' feedback resulted in ten updates to the dashboard during the study period. Clinicians reported that medications and patient reported outcomes were generally discernable in the dashboard and complementary to clinical assessments.

These devices have strong appeal because they allow for continuous, scalable, unobtrusive, and ecologically valid data collection of cardiac activity in ""big data"" studies. However, replicability and reproducibility may be hampered moving forward due to the lack of standardization of data collection and processing procedures, and inconsistent reporting of technological factors (e.g., device type, firmware versions, and sampling rate), biobehavioral variables (e.g., body mass index, wrist dominance and circumference), and participant demographic characteristics, such as skin tone, that may influence heart rate measurement. These limitations introduce unnecessary noise into measurement, which can cloud interpretation and generalizability of findings. This paper provides a brief overview of research using commercial wearable devices to measure heart rate, reviews literature on device accuracy, and outlines the challenges that non-standardized reporting pose for the field. We also discuss study design, technological, biobehavioral, and demographic factors that can impact the accuracy of the passive sensing of heart rate measurements, and provide guidelines and corresponding checklist handouts for future study data collection and design, data cleaning and processing, analysis, and reporting that may help ameliorate some of these barriers and inconsistencies in the literature.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-0297-4,3,NA,90,eng,2398-6352,Risk factors and Psychology and Cardiovascular diseases and Biomarkers,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is an essential examination for noninvasive estimation of ventilatory threshold (VT), defined as the clinically equivalent to aerobic exercise, its evaluation requires an expensive respiratory gas analyzer and expertize. To address these inconveniences, this study investigated the feasibility of a deep learning (DL) algorithm with single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for estimating the aerobic exercise threshold. Two hundred sixty consecutive patients with CVDs who underwent CPX were analyzed. Single-lead ECG data were stored as time-series voltage data with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The data of preprocessed ECG and time point at VT calculated by respiratory gas analyzer were used to train a neural network. The trained model was applied on an independent test cohort, and the DL threshold (DLT; a time of VT estimated through the DL algorithm) was calculated. We compared the correlation between oxygen uptake of the VT (VT-VO(2)) and the DLT (DLT-VO(2)). Our DL model showed that the DLT-VO(2) was confirmed to be significantly correlated with the VT-VO(2) (r = 0.875; P < 0.001), and the mean difference was nonsignificant (-0.05 ml/kg/min, P > 0.05), which displayed strong agreements between the VT and the DLT.

This paper highlights the significant impact of social components on health outcomes in a novel way. Introducing the concept of sociomarkers, which are measurable indicators of social conditions in which a patient is embedded, we employed a machine learning approach that uses both biomarkers and sociomarkers to identify asthma patients at risk of a hospital revisit after an initial visit with an accuracy of 66%. The analysis has been performed over an integrated dataset consisting of individual-level patient information such as gender, race, insurance type, and age, along with ZIP code-level sociomarkers such as poverty level, blight prevalence, and housing quality. Using this uniquely integrated database, we then compare the traditional biomarker-based risk model and the sociomarker-based risk model. A biomarker-based predictive model yields an accuracy of 65% and the sociomarker-based model predicts with an accuracy of 61%. Without knowing specific symptom-related features, the sociomarker-based model can correctly predict two out of three patients at risk. We systematically show that sociomarkers play an important role in predicting health outcomes at the individual level in pediatric asthma cases.

However, clinicians lack the time and resource to annotate patient records with standard medical diagnostic codes and most veterinary visits are captured in free-text notes. The lack of standard coding makes it challenging to use the clinical data to improve patient care. It is also a major impediment to cross-species translational research, which relies on the ability to accurately identify patient cohorts with specific diagnostic criteria in humans and animals. In order to reduce the coding burden for veterinary clinical practice and aid translational research, we have developed a deep learning algorithm, DeepTag, which automatically infers diagnostic codes from veterinary free-text notes. DeepTag is trained on a newly curated dataset of 112,558 veterinary notes manually annotated by experts. DeepTag extends multitask LSTM with an improved hierarchical objective that captures the semantic structures between diseases. To foster human-machine collaboration, DeepTag also learns to abstain in examples when it is uncertain and defers them to human experts, resulting in improved performance. DeepTag accurately infers disease codes from free-text even in challenging cross-hospital settings where the text comes from different clinical settings than the ones used for training. It enables automated disease annotation across a broad range of clinical diagnoses with minimal preprocessing.

Digital scribes or intelligent documentation support systems, take advantage of advances in speech recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, to automate the clinical documentation task currently conducted by humans. Whilst in their infancy, digital scribes are likely to evolve through three broad stages. Human led systems task clinicians with creating documentation, but provide tools to make the task simpler and more effective, for example with dictation support, semantic checking and templates. Mixed-initiative systems are delegated part of the documentation task, converting the conversations in a clinical encounter into summaries suitable for the electronic record. Computer-led systems are delegated full control of documentation and only request human interaction when exceptions are encountered. Intelligent clinical environments permit such augmented clinical encounters to occur in a fully digitised space where the environment becomes the computer. Data from clinical instruments can be automatically transmitted, interpreted using AI and entered directly into the record. Digital scribes raise many issues for clinical practice, including new patient safety risks. Automation bias may see clinicians automatically accept scribe documents without checking. The electronic record also shifts from a human created summary of events to potentially a full audio, video and sensor record of the clinical encounter.

In such situations, evidence generated from similar patients' data captured in electronic health records (EHRs) can aid decision making. However, challenges in generating and making such evidence available have prevented its on-demand use to inform patient care. We propose that a specialty consultation service staffed by a team of medical and informatics experts can rapidly summarize 'what happened to patients like mine' using data from the EHR and other health data sources. By emulating a familiar physician workflow, and keeping experts in the loop, such a service can translate physician inquiries about situations with evidence gaps into actionable reports. The demand for and benefits gained from such a consult service will naturally vary by practice type and data robustness. However, we cannot afford to miss the opportunity to use the patient data captured every day via EHR systems to close the evidence gap between available clinical guidelines and realities of clinical practice. We have begun offering such a service to physicians at our academic medical center and believe that such a service should be core offering by clinical informatics professional throughout the country.

During the workshop, participating teams presented comprehensive reviews and analysis of their systems, and outlined future research directions suggested by the challenge contributions. METHODS: The challenge evaluated systems on the information extraction tasks that targeted: (1) clinically significant events, including both clinical concepts such as problems, tests, treatments, and clinical departments, and events relevant to the patient's clinical timeline, such as admissions, transfers between departments, etc; (2) temporal expressions, referring to the dates, times, durations, or frequencies phrases in the clinical text. The values of the extracted temporal expressions had to be normalized to an ISO specification standard; and (3) temporal relations, between the clinical events and temporal expressions. Participants determined pairs of events and temporal expressions that exhibited a temporal relation, and identified the temporal relation between them. RESULTS: For event detection, statistical machine learning (ML) methods consistently showed superior performance. While ML and rule based methods seemed to detect temporal expressions equally well, the best systems overwhelmingly adopted a rule based approach for value normalization.

However, the potential of the more than 3.6 billion radiology examinations performed annually worldwide has largely gone unused in the effort to digitally transform health care. The Bionic Radiologist is a concept that combines humanity and digitalization for better health care integration of radiology. At a practical level, this concept will achieve critical goals: (1) testing decisions being made scientifically on the basis of disease probabilities and patient preferences; (2) image analysis done consistently at any time and at any site; and (3) treatment suggestions that are closely linked to imaging results and are seamlessly integrated with other information. The Bionic Radiologist will thus help avoiding missed care opportunities, will provide continuous learning in the work process, and will also allow more time for radiologists' primary roles: interacting with patients and referring physicians. To achieve that potential, one has to cope with many implementation barriers at both the individual and institutional levels. These include: reluctance to delegate decision making, a possible decrease in image interpretation knowledge and the perception that patient safety and trust are at stake. To facilitate implementation of the Bionic Radiologist the following will be helpful: uncertainty quantifications for suggestions, shared decision making, changes in organizational culture and leadership style, maintained expertise through continuous learning systems for training, and role development of the involved experts.

We developed ML models for ASCVD risk prediction for multi-ethnic patients using an electronic health record (EHR) database from Northern California. Our cohort included patients aged 18 years or older with no prior CVD and not on statins at baseline (n = 262,923), stratified by PCE-eligible (n = 131,721) or PCE-ineligible patients based on missing or out-of-range variables.

However, the accuracy of disease classification may be low because of the disease characteristics and the analytes used for classification. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe a system that enhanced the neonatal screening system of the Newborn Screening Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The system was designed and deployed according to a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework under the Web services .NET environment. The system consists of sample collection, testing, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up services among collaborating hospitals. To improve the accuracy of newborn screening, machine learning and optimal feature selection mechanisms were investigated for screening newborns for inborn errors of metabolism. METHODS: The framework of the Newborn Screening Hospital Information System (NSHIS) used the embedded Health Level Seven (HL7) standards for data exchanges among heterogeneous platforms integrated by Web services in the C# language. In this study, machine learning classification was used to predict phenylketonuria (PKU), hypermethioninemia, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase (3-MCC) deficiency. The classification methods used 347,312 newborn dried blood samples collected at the Center between 2006 and 2011. Of these, 220 newborns had values over the diagnostic cutoffs (positive cases) and 1557 had values that were over the screening cutoffs but did not meet the diagnostic cutoffs (suspected cases). The original 35 analytes and the manifested features were ranked based on F score, then combinations of the top 20 ranked features were selected as input features to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to obtain optimal feature sets. These feature sets were tested using 5-fold cross-validation and optimal models were generated. The datasets collected in year 2011 were used as predicting cases. RESULTS: The feature selection strategies were implemented and the optimal markers for PKU, hypermethioninemia, and 3-MCC deficiency were obtained. The results of the machine learning approach were compared with the cutoff scheme. The number of the false positive cases were reduced from 21 to 2 for PKU, from 30 to 10 for hypermethioninemia, and 209 to 46 for 3-MCC deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This SOA Web service-based newborn screening system can accelerate screening procedures effectively and efficiently. An SVM learning methodology for PKU, hypermethioninemia, and 3-MCC deficiency metabolic diseases classification, including optimal feature selection strategies, is presented.

Recent machine learning effort is limited to predicting 42 top-level diagnosis categories from veterinary notes. Here we develop a large-scale algorithm to automatically predict all 4577 standard veterinary diagnosis codes from free text. We train our algorithm on a curated dataset of over 100 K expert labeled veterinary notes and over one million unlabeled notes. Our algorithm is based on the adapted Transformer architecture and we demonstrate that large-scale language modeling on the unlabeled notes via pretraining and as an auxiliary objective during supervised learning greatly improves performance. We systematically evaluate the performance of the model and several baselines in challenging settings where algorithms trained on one hospital are evaluated in a different hospital with substantial domain shift. In addition, we show that hierarchical training can address severe data imbalances for fine-grained diagnosis with a few training cases, and we provide interpretation for what is learned by the deep network. Our algorithm addresses an important challenge in veterinary medicine, and our model and experiments add insights into the power of unsupervised learning for clinical natural language processing.",2019,10.1038/s41746-019-0113-1,2,NA,35,eng,2398-6352,NA,NA,NA,2019///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tool, RapTAT, was designed to assist annotation by iteratively pre-annotating probable phrases of interest within a document, presenting the annotations to a reviewer for correction, and then using the corrected annotations for further machine learning-based training before pre-annotating subsequent documents. Annotators reviewed 404 clinical notes either manually or using RapTAT assistance for concepts related to quality of care during heart failure treatment. Notes were divided into 20 batches of 19-21 documents for iterative annotation and training. RESULTS: The number of correct RapTAT pre-annotations increased significantly and annotation time per batch decreased by ~50% over the course of annotation. Annotation rate increased from batch to batch for assisted but not manual reviewers. Pre-annotation F-measure increased from 0.5 to 0.6 to >0.80 (relative to both assisted reviewer and reference annotations) over the first three batches and more slowly thereafter. Overall inter-annotator agreement was significantly higher between RapTAT-assisted reviewers (0.89) than between manual reviewers (0.85). DISCUSSION: The tool reduced workload by decreasing the number of annotations needing to be added and helping reviewers to annotate at an increased rate. Agreement between the pre-annotations and reference standard, and agreement between the pre-annotations and assisted annotations, were similar throughout the annotation process, which suggests that pre-annotation did not introduce bias.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pattern matching rules were manually developed through examining keywords and expression patterns of side effects to discover an individual side effect and causative drug relationship. A combination of machine learning (C4.5) using side effect keyword features and pattern matching rules was used to extract sentences that contain side effect and causative drug pairs, enabling the system to discover most side effect occurrences. Our system was implemented as a module within the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. RESULTS: The system was tested in the domain of psychiatry and psychology. The rule-based system extracting side effects and causative drugs produced an F score of 0.80 (0.55 excluding allergy section). The hybrid system identifying side effect sentences had an F score of 0.75 (0.56 excluding allergy section) but covered more side effect and causative drug pairs than individual side effect extraction. DISCUSSION: The rule-based system was able to identify most side effects expressed by clear indication words. More sophisticated semantic processing is required to handle complex side effect descriptions in the narrative. We demonstrated that our system can be trained to identify sentences with complex side effect descriptions that can be submitted to a human expert for further abstraction. CONCLUSION: Our system was able to extract most physician-asserted drug side effects.

Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (Ï = 0.87 for ROP and Ï = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging.",2020,10.1038/s41746-020-0255-1,3,NA,48,eng,2398-6352,Diagnosis and Medical imaging and Medical research and Machine learning,NA,NA,2020///,NPJ Digit Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared this approach to a logistic regression model and a sophisticated machine learning approach, the gradient boosting machine.

This study compared the impact of modal and non-modal electronic (e-) prescribing alerts on prescribing error rates, to help inform the design of clinical decision support systems. DESIGN: A randomized study of 24 junior doctors each performing 30 simulated prescribing tasks in random order with a prototype e-prescribing system. Using a within-participant design, doctors were randomized to be shown one of three types of e-prescribing alert (modal, non-modal, no alert) during each prescribing task. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measure was prescribing error rate. Structured interviews were performed to elicit participants' preferences for the prescribing alerts and their views on clinical decision support systems. RESULTS: Participants exposed to modal alerts were 11.6 times less likely to make a prescribing error than those not shown an alert (OR 11.56, 95% CI 6.00 to 22.26). Those shown a non-modal alert were 3.2 times less likely to make a prescribing error (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.30) than those not shown an alert. The error rate with non-modal alerts was 3.6 times higher than with modal alerts (95% CI 1.88 to 7.04). CONCLUSIONS: Both kinds of e-prescribing alerts significantly reduced prescribing error rates, but modal alerts were over three times more effective than non-modal alerts.

With the increased use of imaging and its progressive technical advances, the role of imaging informatics is now evolving--from one of managing images, to one of integrating the full scope of clinical information needed to contextualize and link observations across phenotypic and genotypic scales. Several challenges exist for imaging informatics, including the need for methods to transform clinical imaging studies and associated data into structured information that can be organized and analyzed.

Jones_2012_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Accuracy of geographically targeted internet advertisements on Google AdWords for recruitment in a randomized trial,"Jones, Ray B. and Goldsmith, Lesley and Williams, Christopher J. and Kamel Boulos, Maged N.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Google AdWords are increasingly used to recruit people into research studies and clinical services. They offer the potential to recruit from targeted control areas in cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but little is known about the feasibility of accurately targeting ads by location and comparing with control areas. OBJECTIVE: To examine the accuracy and contamination of control areas by a location-targeted online intervention using Google AdWords in a pilot cluster RCT. METHODS: Based on previous use of online cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and population size, we purposively selected 16 of the 121 British postcode areas and randomized them to three intervention and one (do-nothing) control arms. Two intervention arms included use of location-targeted AdWords, and we compared these with the do-nothing control arm. We did not raise the visibility of our research website to normal Web searches. Users who clicked on the ad were directed to our project website, which collected the computer Internet protocol (IP) address, date, and time. Visitors were asked for their postcode area and to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (depression). They were then offered links to several online depression resources. Google Analytics largely uses IP methods to estimate location, but AdWords uses additional information. We compared locations assessed by (1) Analytics, and (2) as self-identified by users. RESULTS: Ads were shown 300,523 times with 4207 click-throughs. There were few site visits except through AdWord click-throughs. Both methods of location assessment agreed there was little contamination of control areas. According to Analytics, 69.75% (2617/3752) of participants were in intervention areas, only 0% (8/3752) in control areas, but 30.04% (1127/3752) in other areas. However, according to user-stated postcodes, only 20.7% (463/2237) were in intervention areas, 1% (22/2236) in control areas, but 78.31% (1751/2236) in other areas. Both location assessments suggested most leakage from the intervention arms was to nearby postcode areas. Analytics data differed from postcodes reported by participants. Analysis of a subset of 200/2236 records over 10 days comparing IP-estimated location with stated postcode suggested that Google AdWords targeted correctly in just half the cases. Analytics agreed with our assessment that, overall, one-third were wrongly targeted by AdWords. There appeared little evidence that people who bothered to give their postcode did not answer truthfully. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is likely to be substantial leakage from the targeted areas, if intervention and control areas are a sufficient distance apart, it is feasible to conduct a cluster RCT using online ads to target British postcode areas without significant contamination.

Trained taggers were evaluated using the annotated clinical documents made available in the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge workshop, consisting of documents from four data sources. RESULTS: As expected, performance of a tagger trained on one data source degraded when evaluated on another source, but the degradation of the performance varied depending on data sources. A tagger trained on multiple data sources was robust, and it achieved an F score as high as 0.890 on one data source. The results also suggest that performance of machine learning taggers is likely to improve if more annotated documents are available for training. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the performance of machine learning taggers is degraded when they are ported across clinical documents from different sources. The portability of taggers can be enhanced by training on datasets from multiple sources.

We present a method that uses machine learning techniques to choose optimal interventions from a set of possible interventions within a case study aiming to increase General Practitioner (GP) discussions of physical activity (PA) with their patients. Interventions were developed based on a causal loop diagram with 26 GPs across 13 clinics in Geelong, Australia. GPs prioritised eight from more than 80 potential interventions to increase GP discussion of PA with patients. Following a 2-week baseline, a multi-arm bandit algorithm was used to assign optimal strategies to GP clinics with the target outcome being GP PA discussion rates. The algorithm was updated weekly and the process iterated until the more promising strategies emerged (a duration of seven weeks). The top three performing strategies were continued for 3 weeks to improve the power of the hypothesis test of effectiveness for each strategy compared to baseline. GPs recorded a total of 11,176 conversations about PA. GPs identified 15 factors affecting GP PA discussion rates with patients including GP skills and awareness, fragmentation of care and fear of adverse outcomes. The two most effective strategies were correctly identified within seven weeks of the algorithm-based assignment of strategies. These were clinic reception staff providing PA information to patients at check in and PA screening questionnaires completed in the waiting room.

Their reduced size and increased processing speed has led to rapid adoption in health care. Thus, it is important to identify whether handheld computers are actually effective in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: A scoping review of systematic reviews was designed to provide a quick overview of the documented evidence of effectiveness for health care professionals using handheld computers in their clinical work. METHODS: A detailed search, sensitive for systematic reviews was applied for Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Global Health, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. All outcomes that demonstrated effectiveness in clinical practice were included. Classroom learning and patient use of handheld computers were excluded. Quality was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. A previously published conceptual framework was used as the basis for dual data extraction. Reported outcomes were summarized according to the primary function of the handheld computer. RESULTS: Five systematic reviews met the inclusion and quality criteria. Together, they reviewed 138 unique primary studies. Most reviewed descriptive intervention studies, where physicians, pharmacists, or medical students used personal digital assistants. Effectiveness was demonstrated across four distinct functions of handheld computers: patient documentation, patient care, information seeking, and professional work patterns. Within each of these functions, a range of positive outcomes were reported using both objective and self-report measures. The use of handheld computers improved patient documentation through more complete recording, fewer documentation errors, and increased efficiency. Handheld computers provided easy access to clinical decision support systems and patient management systems, which improved decision making for patient care. Handheld computers saved time and gave earlier access to new information. There were also reports that handheld computers enhanced work patterns and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review summarizes the secondary evidence for effectiveness of handheld computers and mhealth. It provides a snapshot of effective use by health care professionals across four key functions. We identified evidence to suggest that handheld computers provide easy and timely access to information and enable accurate and complete documentation. Further, they can give health care professionals instant access to evidence-based decision support and patient management systems to improve clinical decision making.

Identifying individuals at high risk of progression to late AMD, the sight-threatening stage, is critical for clinical actions, including medical interventions and timely monitoring. Although deep learning has shown promise in diagnosing/screening AMD using color fundus photographs, it remains difficult to predict individuals' risks of late AMD accurately. For both tasks, these initial deep learning attempts have remained largely unvalidated in independent cohorts. Here, we demonstrate how deep learning and survival analysis can predict the probability of progression to late AMD using 3298 participants (over 80,000 images) from the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies AREDS and AREDS2, the largest longitudinal clinical trials in AMD. When validated against an independent test data set of 601 participants, our model achieved high prognostic accuracy (5-year C-statistic 86.4 (95% confidence interval 86.2-86.6)) that substantially exceeded that of retinal specialists using two existing clinical standards (81.3 (81.1-81.5) and 82.0 (81.8-82.3), respectively). Interestingly, our approach offers additional strengths over the existing clinical standards in AMD prognosis (e.g., risk ascertainment above 50%) and is likely to be highly generalizable, given the breadth of training data from 82 US retinal specialty clinics. Indeed, during external validation through training on AREDS and testing on AREDS2 as an independent cohort, our model retained substantially higher prognostic accuracy than existing clinical standards.

An XML representation (ArdenML) may partially address the technical challenges. MLMs created in ArdenML can be converted into executable files using standard transforms written in the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) language. As an example, we have demonstrated an approach to executing MLMs written in ArdenML using the Drools business rule management system. Extensions to ArdenML make it possible to generate a user interface through which an MLM developer can test for logical errors.",2012,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000512,19,4,533-536,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"Humans and User-Computer Interface and Knowledge Management and Reference Standards and Information Dissemination and *Pattern Recognition, Automated and *Artificial Intelligence and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Programming Languages",NA,NA,2012/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: The authors'approaches rely on both rule-based and machine-learning methods. Natural language processing is used to extract features from the input texts; these features are then used in the authors' machine-learning approaches. The authors used Conditional Random Fields for concept extraction, and Support Vector Machines for assertion and relation annotation. Depending on the task, the authors tested various combinations of rule-based and machine-learning methods. RESULTS: The authors'assertion annotation system obtained an F-measure of 0.931, ranking fifth out of 21 participants at the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge. The authors' relation annotation system ranked third out of 16 participants with a 0.709 F-measure. The 0.773 F-measure the authors obtained on concept extraction did not make it to the top 10. CONCLUSION: On the one hand, the authors confirm that the use of only machine-learning methods is highly dependent on the annotated training data, and thus obtained better results for well-represented classes. On the other hand, the use of only a rule-based method was not sufficient to deal with new types of data.

Balancing privacy protection against the need for high quality record linkage requires a human-machine hybrid system to safely manage uncertainty in the ever changing streams of chaotic Big Data. METHODS: In the computer science literature, private record linkage is the most published area. It investigates how to apply a known linkage function safely when linking two tables. However, in practice, the linkage function is rarely known. Thus, there are many data linkage centers whose main role is to be the trusted third party to determine the linkage function manually and link data for research via a master population list for a designated region. Recently, a more flexible computerized third-party linkage platform, Secure Decoupled Linkage (SDLink), has been proposed based on: (1) decoupling data via encryption, (2) obfuscation via chaffing (adding fake data) and universe manipulation; and (3) minimum information disclosure via recoding. RESULTS: We synthesize this literature to formalize a new framework for privacy preserving interactive record linkage (PPIRL) with tractable privacy and utility properties and then analyze the literature using this framework. CONCLUSIONS: Human-based third-party linkage centers for privacy preserving record linkage are the accepted norm internationally. We find that a computer-based third-party platform that can precisely control the information disclosed at the micro level and allow frequent human interaction during the linkage process, is an effective human-machine hybrid system that significantly improves on the linkage center model both in terms of privacy and utility.",2014,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002165,21,2,212-220,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"Humans and User-Computer Interface and privacy and entity resolution and Biomedical Research and Computer Security and *Medical Records Systems, Computerized and Medical Record Linkage/*methods and *Confidentiality and decoupled data and Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical record linkage and privacy preserving interactive record linkage (PPIRL)",NA,NA,2014/04//Mar undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Consults were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: CICS Provided, in which clinicians received synthesized information from the biomedical literature addressing the consult question or No CICS Provided, in which no information was provided. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes were measured via online post-consult forms that assessed consult purpose, actual and potential impact, satisfaction, time spent searching, and other variables. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty six consults were made during the 19-month study period. Clinicians primarily made requests in order to update themselves (65.0%, 147/226) and were satisfied with the service results (Mean 4.52 of possible 5.0, SD 0.94). Intention to treat (ITT) analyses showed that consults in the CICS Provided condition had a greater actual and potential impact on clinical actions and clinician satisfaction than No CICS consults. Evidence provided by the service primarily impacted the use of a new or different treatment (OR 8.19 95% CI 1.04-64.00). Reasons for no or little impact included a lack of evidence addressing the issue or that the clinician was already implementing the practices indicated by the evidence.

However, these initiatives also constitute a significant intervention which will change the structure of the EHR market. OBJECTIVE: To describe quantitatively recent changes to both the demand and supply sides of the EHR market. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 3447 of hospitals from the HIMSS Analytics Database (2006-10) was created. Using hospital referral regions to define the local market, we determined the percentage of hospitals using paper records, the number of vendors, and local EHR vendor competition using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Changes over time were assessed using a series of regression equations and geographic information systems analyses. RESULTS: Overall, there was movement away from paper records, upward trends in the number of EHR vendors, and greater competition. However, changes differed according to hospital size and region of the country. Changes were greatest for small hospitals, whereas competition and the number of vendors did not change dramatically for large hospitals. DISCUSSION: The EHR market is changing most dramatically for those least equipped to handle broad technological transformation, which underscores the need for continued targeted support. Furthermore, wide variations across the nation indicate a continued role for states in the support of EHR utilization. CONCLUSION: The structure of the EHR market is undergoing substantial changes as desired by the proponents and architects of HIT certification and meaningful use.

Evidence is needed to determine whether these decision aids are helpful in clinical practice and whether they lead to increased patient involvement and better outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the outcome of a randomized controlled trial and process evaluation of a Web-based intervention to facilitate shared decision making for people with psychotic disorders. METHODS: The study was carried out in a Dutch mental health institution. Patients were recruited from 2 outpatient teams for patients with psychosis (N=250). Patients in the intervention condition (n=124) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aimed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization. Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own (at their home computer or at a computer of the service) or with the support of an assistant. Patients in the control group received care as usual (n=126). Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis. Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making, measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness (COMRADE). Process evaluation consisted of questionnaire-based surveys, open interviews, and researcher observation. RESULTS: In all, 73 patients completed the follow-up measurement and were included in the final analysis (response rate 29.2%). More than one-third (48/124, 38.7%) of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid used it, and most used its full functionality. No differences were found between the intervention and control conditions on perceived involvement in medical decision making (COMRADE satisfaction with communication: F1,68=0.422, P=.52; COMRADE confidence in decision: F1,67=0.086, P=.77). In addition, results of the process evaluation suggest that the intervention did not optimally fit in with routine practice of the participating teams. CONCLUSIONS: The development of electronic decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making is encouraged and many people with a psychotic disorder can work with them. This holds for both first-episode patients and long-term care patients, although the latter group might need more assistance. However, results of this paper could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making.

In order to effectively prevent these complications, high-risk patients must be readily identified. However, most current risk scores are designed to predict a single postoperative complication and often lack specificity on the patient level. In other fields, machine learning (ML) has been shown to successfully create models to predict multiple end points using a single input feature set. We hypothesized that ML can be used to create models to predict postoperative mortality, AKI, reintubation, and a combined outcome using a single set of features available at the end of surgery. A set of 46 features available at the end of surgery, including drug dosing, blood loss, vital signs, and others were extracted. Additionally, six additional features accounting for total intraoperative hypotension were extracted and trialed for different models. A total of 59,981 surgical procedures met inclusion criteria and the deep neural networks (DNN) were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The network performances were then compared to ASA Physical Status. In addition to creating separate models for each outcome, a multitask learning model was trialed that used information on all outcomes to predict the likelihood of each outcome individually. The overall rate of the examined complications in this data set was 0.79% for mortality, 22.3% (of 21,676 patients with creatinine values) for AKI, and 1.1% for reintubation. Overall, there was significant overlap between the various model types for each outcome, with no one modeling technique consistently performing the best. However, the best DNN models did beat the ASA score for all outcomes other than mortality. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) models were 0.792 (0.775-0.808) for AKI, 0.879 (0.851-0.905) for reintubation, 0.907 (0.872-0.938) for mortality, and 0.874 (0.864-0.866) for any outcome.

We used CDS to increase inpatient influenza vaccination during implementation of an electronic medical record, in which pharmacy and nursing transactions increasingly became electronic. Over three influenza seasons we evaluated standing orders, provider reminders, and pre-selected physician orders. A pre-intervention cross-sectional survey showed that most patients (95%) met criteria for vaccination. During our intervention, physicians were increasingly likely to accept pre-selected vaccination orders, Year 1 (47%), Year 2 (77%), Year 3 (83%); however vaccine administration by nurses was suboptimal.

The clinical effectiveness of these systems, however, is substantially limited by poor user acceptance of presented warnings. To enhance alert acceptance it may be useful to quantify the impact of potential modulators of acceptance. METHODS: We built a logistic regression model to predict alert acceptance of drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in three different settings. Ten variables from the clinical and human factors literature were evaluated as potential modulators of provider alert acceptance. ORs were calculated for the impact of knowledge quality, alert display, textual information, prioritization, setting, patient age, dose-dependent toxicity, alert frequency, alert level, and required acknowledgment on acceptance of the DDI alert. RESULTS: 50,788 DDI alerts were analyzed. Providers accepted only 1.4% of non-interruptive alerts. For interruptive alerts, user acceptance positively correlated with frequency of the alert (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.38), quality of display (4.75, 3.87 to 5.84), and alert level (1.74, 1.63 to 1.86). Alert acceptance was higher in inpatients (2.63, 2.32 to 2.97) and for drugs with dose-dependent toxicity (1.13, 1.07 to 1.21). The textual information influenced the mode of reaction and providers were more likely to modify the prescription if the message contained detailed advice on how to manage the DDI. CONCLUSION: We evaluated potential modulators of alert acceptance by assessing content and human factors issues, and quantified the impact of a number of specific factors which influence alert acceptance.

An improved understanding of the discourse on Twitter that encourages marijuana use can be helpful for tailoring and targeting online and offline prevention messages. OBJECTIVES: The intent of the study was to assess the content of ""tweets"" and the demographics of followers of a popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle (@stillblazingtho). METHODS: We assessed the sentiment and content of tweets (sent from May 1 to December 31, 2013), as well as the demographics of consumers that follow a popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle (approximately 1,000,000 followers) using Twitter analytics from Demographics Pro. This analytics company estimates demographic characteristics based on Twitter behavior/usage, relying on multiple data signals from networks, consumption, and language and requires confidence of 95% or above to make an estimate of a single demographic characteristic. RESULTS: A total of 2590 tweets were sent from @stillblazingtho during the 8-month period and 305 (11.78%) replies to another Twitter user were excluded for qualitative analysis. Of the remaining 2285 tweets, 1875 (82.06%) were positive about marijuana, 403 (17.64%) were neutral, and 7 (0.31%) appeared negative about marijuana. Approximately 1101 (58.72%) of the positive marijuana tweets were perceived as jokes or humorous, 340 (18.13%) implied that marijuana helps you to feel good or relax, 294 (15.68%) mentioned routine, frequent, or heavy use, 193 (10.29%) mentioned blunts, marijuana edibles, or paraphernalia (eg, bongs, vaporizers), and 186 (9.92%) mentioned other risky health behaviors (eg, tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, sex).

Kuzu_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,A practical approach to achieve private medical record linkage in light of public resources,"Kuzu, Mehmet and Kantarcioglu, Murat and Durham, Elizabeth Ashley and Toth, Csaba and Malin, Bradley",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Integration of patients' records across resources enhances analytics. To address privacy concerns, emerging strategies such as Bloom filter encodings (BFEs), enable integration while obscuring identifiers. However, recent investigations demonstrate BFEs are, in theory, vulnerable to cryptanalysis when encoded identifiers are randomly selected from a public resource. This study investigates the extent to which cryptanalysis conditions hold for (1) real patient records and (2) a countermeasure that obscures the frequencies of the identifying values in encoded datasets. DESIGN: First, to investigate the strength of cryptanalysis for real patient records, we build BFEs from identifiers in an electronic medical record system and apply cryptanalysis using identifiers in a publicly available voter registry. Second, to investigate the countermeasure under ideal cryptanalysis conditions, we compose BFEs from the identifiers that are randomly selected from a public voter registry. MEASUREMENT: We utilize precision (ie, rate of correct re-identified encodings) and computation efficiency (ie, time to complete cryptanalysis) to assess the performance of cryptanalysis in BFEs before and after application of the countermeasure. RESULTS: Cryptanalysis can achieve high precision when the encoded identifiers are composed of a random sample of a public resource (ie, a voter registry). However, we also find that the attack is less efficient and may not be practical for more realistic scenarios. By contrast, the proposed countermeasure made cryptanalysis impractical in terms of precision and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of cryptanalysis against BFEs based on patient data is significantly lower than theoretical estimates. The proposed countermeasure makes BFEs resistant to known practical attacks.",2013,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000917,20,2,285-292,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,United States and Humans and Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration and *Medical Record Linkage and *Confidentiality and *Computer Security,NA,NA,2013/04//Mar undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

L. and Cavanaugh, Teresa M. and Guo, Jeff J. and Hanseman, Dennis J. and Heaton, Pamela C.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electronic medical record (EMR) system sophistication on preventive women's healthcare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Providers in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), 2007-8, were included if they had at least one visit by a woman at least 21 years old. Based on 16 questions from NAMCS, the level of a provider's EMR system sophistication was classified as non-existent, minimal, basic, or fully functional. A two-stage residual-inclusion method was used with ordered probit regression to model the level of EMR system sophistication, and outcome-specific Poisson regressions to predict the number of examinations or tests ordered or performed. RESULTS: Across the providers, 29.23%, 49.34%, 15.97%, and 5.46% had no, minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR systems, respectively. The breast examination rate was 20.27%, 34.96%, 37.21%, and 44.98% for providers without or with minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR systems, respectively. For breast examinations, pelvic examinations, Pap tests, chlamydia tests, cholesterol tests, mammograms, and bone mineral density (BMD) tests, an EMR system increased the number of these tests and examinations. Furthermore, the level of sophistication increased the number of breast examinations and Pap, chlamydia, cholesterol, and BMD tests. DISCUSSION: The use of advanced EMR systems in obstetrics and gynecology was limited. Given the positive results of this study, specialists in women's health should consider investing in more sophisticated systems.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. OBJECTIVE: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. METHODS: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. RESULTS: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (<ce><b3>=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (<ce><b3>=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (<ce><b3>=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (<ce><b3>=.32, P<.01), and self-care (<ce><b3>=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (<ce><b3>=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (<ce><b3>=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper describes the unique historical and genetic characteristics of the Newfoundland and Labrador founder population, which gave rise to the opportunity for PTRG to build the Newfoundland Genealogy Database containing digitized records of all pre-confederation (1949) census records of the Newfoundland founder population. In addition to building the database, PTRG has developed the Heritability Analytics Infrastructure, a data management structure that stores genotype, phenotype, and pedigree information in a single database, and custom linkage software (KINNECT) to perform pedigree linkages on the genealogy database. DISCUSSION: A newly adopted legal regimen in Newfoundland and Labrador is discussed. It incorporates health privacy legislation with a unique research ethics statute governing the composition and activities of research ethics boards and, for the first time in Canada, elevating the status of national research ethics guidelines into law. The discussion looks at this integration of legal and ethical principles which provides a flexible and seamless framework for balancing the privacy rights and welfare interests of individuals, families, and larger societies in the creation and use of research data infrastructures as public goods. CONCLUSION: The complementary legal and ethical frameworks that now coexist in Newfoundland and Labrador provide the legislative authority, ethical legitimacy, and practical flexibility needed to find a workable balance between privacy interests and public goods.

DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of all 696 children with meningitis admitted to a large urban pediatric hospital from 1992 to 2000. We modified a published bacterial meningitis score by adding a new epidemiological context adjustor variable. We examined 540 possible rules for this adjustor, varying both the number of aseptic meningitis cases that needed to be seen, and the recent time window in which they were seen. We performed sensitivity analyses with each of 540 possibilities in order to identify the optimal rule--namely, the one that included the most cases of aseptic meningitis without missing additional cases of bacterial meningitis, as compared with the published prediction model. We used bootstrap methods to validate this new score. RESULTS: The optimal rule was found to be: ""at least four cases of aseptic meningitis in the previous 10 days."" The epidemiological context adjustor based on surveillance of recent cases of meningitis allowed the correct identification of an additional 47 cases (7%) of aseptic meningitis without missing any additional cases of bacterial meningitis.

Eric and Anthony, Denise L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and electronic medication administration records (eMAR) is associated with better quality of medication administration at medium-to-large acute-care hospitals. DATA/STUDY SETTING: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of data from three sources: CPOE/eMAR usage from HIMSS Analytics (2010), medication quality scores from CMS Hospital Compare (2010), and hospital characteristics from CMS Acute Inpatient Prospective Payment System (2009). The analysis focused on 11 quality indicators (January-December 2009) at 2603 medium-to-large (<e2><89><a5> 100 beds), non-federal acute-care hospitals measuring proportion of eligible patients given (or prescribed) recommended medications for conditions, including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, and surgical care improvement. Using technology adoption by 2008 as reference, hospitals were coded: (1) eMAR-only adopters (n=986); (2) CPOE-only adopters (n=115); and (3) adopters of both technologies (n=804); with non-adopters of both technologies as reference group (n=698). Hospitals were also coded for duration of use in 2-year increments since technology adoption. Hospital characteristics, historical measure-specific patient volume, and propensity scores for technology adoption were used to control for confounding factors. The analysis was performed using a generalized linear model (logit link and binomial family). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Relative to non-adopters of both eMAR and CPOE, the odds of adherence to all measures (except one) were higher by 14-29% for eMAR-only hospitals and by 13-38% for hospitals with both technologies, translating to a marginal increase of 0.4-2.0 percentage points. Further, each additional 2 years of technology use was associated with 6-15% higher odds of compliance on all medication measures for eMAR-only hospitals and users of both technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and duration of use of health information technologies are associated with improved adherence to medication guidelines at US hospitals. The benefits are evident for adoption of eMAR systems alone and in combination with CPOE.",2012,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000289,19,3,360-367,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"United States and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Quality Indicators, Health Care and Time Factors and Linear Models and *Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted and *Electronic Health Records and *Medical Order Entry Systems and *Benchmarking and *Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care and *Medication Systems, Hospital",NA,NA,2012/06//May undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date the effectiveness of CDSS has been less than expected, especially concerning the ambulatory management of chronic diseases.

Barriers to clinicians' use of CDSS have included lack of integration into workflow, software usability issues, and relevance of the content to the patient at hand. At Partners HealthCare, we are developing ""Smart Forms"" to facilitate documentation-based clinical decision support.

This study aims to compare the performance of resident physicians in answering clinical scenarios using PubMed abstracts accessed via the PubMed for Handhelds (PubMed4Hh) website versus medical/drug reference applications (Medical Apps) accessed via software on the mobile phone. METHODS: A two-arm comparative study with crossover design was conducted. Subjects, who were resident physicians at the University of Botswana, completed eight scenarios, each with multi-part questions. The primary outcome was a grade for each question. The primary independent variable was the intervention arm and other independent variables included residency and question. RESULTS: Within each question type there were significant differences in 'percentage correct' between Medical Apps and PubMed4Hh for three of the six types of questions: drug-related, diagnosis/definitions, and treatment/management. Within each of these question types, Medical Apps had a higher percentage of fully correct responses than PubMed4Hh (63% vs 13%, 33% vs 12%, and 41% vs 13%, respectively). PubMed4Hh performed better for epidemiologic questions.

Bierbrier_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Evaluation of the accuracy of smartphone medical calculation apps,"Bierbrier, Rachel and Lo, Vivian and Wu, Robert C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phones with operating systems and capable of running applications (smartphones) are increasingly being used in clinical settings. Medical calculating applications are popular mhealth apps for smartphones. These include, for example, apps that calculate the severity or likelihood of disease-based clinical scoring systems, such as determining the severity of liver disease, the likelihood of having a pulmonary embolism, and risk stratification in acute coronary syndrome. However, the accuracy of these apps has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone-based medical calculation apps. METHODS: A broad search on Google Play, BlackBerry World, and the iTunes App Store was conducted to find medical calculation apps for smartphones. The list of apps was narrowed down based on inclusion and exclusion criteria focusing on functions thought to be relevant by a panel of general internists (number of functions =13). Ten case values were inputted for each function and were compared to manual calculations. For each case, the correct answer was assigned a score of 1. A score for the 10 cases was calculated based on the accuracy of the results for each function on each app. RESULTS: We tested 14 apps and 13 functions for each app if that function was available. We conducted 10 cases for each function for a total of 1240 tests. Most functions tested on the apps were accurate in their results with an overall accuracy of 98.6% (17 errors in 1240 tests). In all, 6 of 14 (43%) apps had 100% accuracy. Although 11 of 13 (85%) functions had perfect accuracy, there were issues with 2 functions: the Child-Pugh scores and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores on 8 apps. Approximately half of the errors were clinically significant resulting in a significant change in prognosis (8/17, 47%). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that most medical calculating apps provide accurate and reliable results. The free apps that were 100% accurate and contained the most functions desired by internists were CliniCalc, Calculate by QxMD, and Medscape. When using medical calculating apps, the answers will likely be accurate; however, it is important to be careful when calculating MELD scores or Child-Pugh scores on some apps. Despite the few errors found, greater scrutiny is warranted to ensure full accuracy of smartphone medical calculator apps.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3062,16,2,e32,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Physicians and Humans and software and Severity of Illness Index and Diagnosis, Differential and medical informatics applications and *Mobile Applications and *Cell Phone and *Risk Assessment and *Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and mobile phone and mhealth and cellular phone and computers, handheld",NA,NA,2014/02/03/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Classen_2007_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Evaluation and certification of computerized provider order entry systems,"Classen, David C. and Avery, Anthony J. and Bates, David W.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is an application that is used to electronically write physician orders either in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. It is used in about 15% of U.S. Hospitals and a smaller percentage of ambulatory clinics. It is linked with clinical decision support, which provides much of the value of implementing it. A number of studies have assessed the impact of CPOE with respect to a variety of parameters, including costs of care, medication safety, use of guidelines or protocols, and other measures of the effectiveness or quality of care. Most of these studies have been undertaken at CPOE exemplar sites with homegrown clinical information systems. With the increasing implementation of commercial CPOE systems in various settings of care has come evidence that some implementation approaches may not achieve previously published results or may actually cause new errors or even harm. This has lead to new initiatives to evaluate CPOE systems, which have been undertaken by both vendors and other groups who evaluate vendors, focused on CPOE vendor capabilities and effective approaches to implementation that can achieve benefits seen in published studies. In addition, an electronic health record (EHR) vendor certification process is ongoing under the province of the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) (which includes CPOE) that will affect the purchase and use of these applications by hospitals and clinics and their participation in public and private health insurance programs. Large employers have also joined this focus by developing flight simulation tools to evaluate the capabilities of these CPOE systems once implemented, potentially linking the results of such programs to reimbursement through pay for performance programs. The increasing role of CPOE systems in health care has invited much more scrutiny about the effectiveness of these systems in actual practice which has the potential to improve their ultimate performance.",2007,10.1197/jamia.M2248,14,1,48-55,eng,1067-5027 1527-974X,"Humans and Evaluation Studies as Topic and Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and *Certification and Medical Order Entry Systems/*standards",NA,NA,2007/02//Jan undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

As electronic health record adoption expands, computerized provider documentation (CPD) is increasingly the primary means of capturing clinical documentation. Previous CPD studies have focused on particular stakeholder groups and sites, often limiting their scope and conclusions. To address this, we studied multiple stakeholder groups from multiple sites across the USA. METHODS: We conducted 14 focus groups at five Department of Veterans Affairs facilities with 129 participants (54 physicians or practitioners, 34 nurses, and 37 administrators). Investigators qualitatively analyzed resultant transcripts, developed categories linked to the data, and identified emergent themes. RESULTS: Five major themes related to CPD emerged: communication and coordination; control and limitations in expressivity; information availability and reasoning support; workflow alteration and disruption; and trust and confidence concerns. The results highlight that documentation intertwines tightly with clinical and administrative workflow. Perceptions differed between the three stakeholder groups but remained consistent within groups across facilities. CONCLUSIONS: CPD has dramatically changed documentation processes, impacting clinical understanding, decision-making, and communication across multiple groups. The need for easy and rapid, yet structured and constrained, documentation often conflicts with the need for highly reliable and retrievable information to support clinical reasoning and workflows. Current CPD systems, while better than paper overall, often do not meet the needs of users, partly because they are based on an outdated 'paper-chart' paradigm. These findings should inform those implementing CPD systems now and future plans for more effective CPD systems.",2013,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000946,20,4,718-726,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"Physicians and United States and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Medical Informatics and United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Nurses and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Administrative Personnel and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Attitude to Computers and Documentation/methods and *Electronic Health Records/organization & administration and Medical Records Systems, Computerized/organization & administration and Clinical Documentation and Professional Communication",NA,NA,2013/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mackey_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Global reach of direct-to-consumer advertising using social media for illicit online drug sales,"Mackey, Tim Ken and Liang, Bryan A.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Illicit or rogue Internet pharmacies are a recognized global public health threat that have been identified as utilizing various forms of online marketing and promotion, including social media. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accessibility of creating illicit no prescription direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) online pharmacy social media marketing (eDTCA2.0) and evaluate its potential global reach. METHODS: We identified the top 4 social media platforms allowing eDTCA2.0. After determining applicable platforms (ie, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and MySpace), we created a fictitious advertisement advertising no prescription drugs online and posted it to the identified social media platforms. Each advertisement linked to a unique website URL that consisted of a site error page. Employing Web search analytics, we tracked the number of users visiting these sites and their location. We used commercially available Internet tools and services, including website hosting, domain registration, and website analytic services. RESULTS: Illicit online pharmacy social media content for Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace remained accessible despite highly questionable and potentially illegal content. Fictitious advertisements promoting illicit sale of drugs generated aggregate unique user traffic of 2795 visits over a 10-month period. Further, traffic to our websites originated from a number of countries, including high-income and middle-income countries, and emerging markets.

Hains_2012_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The impact of PACS on clinician work practices in the intensive care unit: a systematic review of the literature,"Hains, Isla M. and Georgiou, Andrew and Westbrook, Johanna I.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To assess evidence of the impact of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) on clinicians' work practices in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We searched Medline, Pre-Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and the SPIE Digital Library databases for English-language publications between 1980 and September 2010 using Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords. RESULTS: Eleven studies from the USA and UK were included. All studies measured aspects of time associated with the introduction of PACS, namely the availability of images, the time a physician took to review an image, and changes in viewing patterns. Seven studies examined the impact on clinical decision-making, with the majority measuring the time to image-based clinical action. The effect of PACS on communication modes was reported in five studies. DISCUSSION: PACS can impact on clinician work practices in three main areas. Most of the evidence suggests an improvement in the efficiency of work practices. Quick image availability can impact on work associated with clinical decision-making, although the results were inconsistent. PACS can change communication practices, particularly between the ICU and radiology; however, the evidence base is insufficient to draw firm conclusions in this area. CONCLUSION: The potential for PACS to impact positively on clinician work practices in the ICU and improve patient care is great. However, the evidence base is limited and does not reflect aspects of contemporary PACS technology. Performance measures developed in previous studies remain relevant, with much left to investigate to understand how PACS can support new and improved ways of delivering care in the intensive care setting.",2012,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000422,19,4,506-513,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"Communication and Humans and Efficiency and Time Factors and Decision Making and Interprofessional Relations and Technology Assessment, Biomedical and *Radiology Information Systems and *Intensive Care Units and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Outcome Assessment, Health Care",NA,NA,2012/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cohen_2007_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Reevaluating recovery: perceived violations and preemptive interventions on emergency psychiatry rounds,"Cohen, Trevor and Blatter, Brett and Almeida, Carlos and Patel, Vimla L.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Contemporary error research suggests that the quest to eradicate error is misguided. Error commission, detection, and recovery are an integral part of cognitive work, even at the expert level. In collaborative workspaces, the perception of potential error is directly observable: workers discuss and respond to perceived violations of accepted practice norms. As perceived violations are captured and corrected preemptively, they do not fit Reason's widely accepted definition of error as ""failure to achieve an intended outcome."" However, perceived violations suggest the aversion of potential error, and consequently have implications for error prevention. This research aims to identify and describe perceived violations of the boundaries of accepted procedure in a psychiatric emergency department (PED), and how they are resolved in practice. DESIGN: Clinical discourse from fourteen PED patient rounds was audio-recorded. Excerpts from recordings suggesting perceived violations or incidents of miscommunication were extracted and analyzed using qualitative coding methods. The results are interpreted in relation to prior research on vulnerabilities to error in the PED. RESULTS: Thirty incidents of perceived violations or miscommunication are identified and analyzed. Of these, only one medication error was formally reported. Other incidents would not have been detected by a retrospective analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of perceived violations expands the data available for error analysis beyond occasional reported adverse events. These data are prospective: responses are captured in real time.

However, privacy concerns have hampered the widespread creation of open health data. There is a dearth of documented methods and case studies for the creation of public-use health data. We describe a new methodology for creating a longitudinal public health dataset in the context of the Heritage Health Prize (HHP). The HHP is a global data mining competition to predict, by using claims data, the number of days patients will be hospitalized in a subsequent year. The winner will be the team or individual with the most accurate model past a threshold accuracy, and will receive a US $3 million cash prize. HHP began on April 4, 2011, and ends on April 3, 2013. OBJECTIVE: To de-identify the claims data used in the HHP competition and ensure that it meets the requirements in the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. METHODS: We defined a threshold risk consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule Safe Harbor standard for disclosing the competition dataset. Three plausible re-identification attacks that can be executed on these data were identified. For each attack the re-identification probability was evaluated. If it was deemed too high then a new de-identification algorithm was applied to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. We performed an actual evaluation of re-identification risk using simulated attacks and matching experiments to confirm the results of the de-identification and to test sensitivity to assumptions. The main metric used to evaluate re-identification risk was the probability that a record in the HHP data can be re-identified given an attempted attack. RESULTS: An evaluation of the de-identified dataset estimated that the probability of re-identifying an individual was .0084, below the .05 probability threshold specified for the competition. The risk was robust to violations of our initial assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to ensure that the probability of re-identification for a large longitudinal dataset was acceptably low when it was released for a global user community in support of an analytics competition. This is an example of, and methodology for, achieving open data principles for longitudinal health data.",2012,10.2196/jmir.2001,14,1,e33,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"United States and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and *Medical Records Systems, Computerized and *Patient Identification Systems",NA,NA,2012/02/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Xu_2012_JotAMIA.J_1,JOUR,"Named entity recognition of follow-up and time information in 20,000 radiology reports","Xu, Yan and Tsujii, Junichi and Chang, Eric I.-Chao",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a system to extract follow-up information from radiology reports. The method may be used as a component in a system which automatically generates follow-up information in a timely fashion. METHODS: A novel method of combining an LSP (labeled sequential pattern) classifier with a CRF (conditional random field) recognizer was devised. The LSP classifier filters out irrelevant sentences, while the CRF recognizer extracts follow-up and time phrases from candidate sentences presented by the LSP classifier. MEASUREMENTS: The standard performance metrics of precision (P), recall (R), and F measure (F) in the exact and inexact matching settings were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Four experiments conducted using 20,000 radiology reports showed that the CRF recognizer achieved high performance without time-consuming feature engineering and that the LSP classifier further improved the performance of the CRF recognizer.

Baysari_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,The influence of computerized decision support on prescribing during ward-rounds: are the decision-makers targeted?,"Baysari, Melissa T. and Westbrook, Johanna I. and Richardson, Katrina L. and Day, Richard O.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a low level of decision support within a hospital computerized provider order entry system has an observable influence on the medication ordering process on ward-rounds and to assess prescribers' views of the decision support features. METHODS: 14 specialty teams (46 doctors) were shadowed by the investigator while on their ward-rounds and 16 prescribers from these teams were interviewed. RESULTS: Senior doctors were highly influential in prescribing decisions during ward-rounds but rarely used the computerized provider order entry system. Junior doctors entered the majority of medication orders into the system, nearly always ignored computerized alerts and never raised their occurrence with other doctors on ward-rounds. Interviews with doctors revealed that some decision support features were valued but most were not perceived to be useful. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The computerized alerts failed to target the doctors who were making the prescribing decisions on ward-rounds. Senior doctors were the decision makers, yet the junior doctors who used the system received the alerts. As a result, the alert information was generally ignored and not incorporated into the decision-making processes on ward-rounds. The greatest value of decision support in this setting may be in non-ward-round situations where senior doctors are less influential. Identifying how prescribing systems are used during different clinical activities can guide the design of decision support that effectively supports users in different situations.

Common structured sources of problem information include the patient problem list and billing data; however, these sources are often inaccurate or incomplete. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate methods of automatically inferring patient problems from clinical and billing data, and to provide a knowledge base for inferring problems. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 17 target conditions and designed and validated a set of rules for identifying patient problems based on medications, laboratory results, billing codes, and vital signs. A panel of physicians provided input on a preliminary set of rules. Based on this input, we tested candidate rules on a sample of 100,000 patient records to assess their performance compared to gold standard manual chart review. The physician panel selected a final rule for each condition, which was validated on an independent sample of 100,000 records to assess its accuracy. RESULTS: Seventeen rules were developed for inferring patient problems. Analysis using a validation set of 100,000 randomly selected patients showed high sensitivity (range: 62.8-100.0%) and positive predictive value (range: 79.8-99.6%) for most rules. Overall, the inference rules performed better than using either the problem list or billing data alone. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a set of rules for inferring patient problems.

We aimed to understand the general use and functionality of PHRs and the organizational policies and decision-making structures for making data available to patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered by telephone structured interview to 21 organizations to determine the types of data made available to patients through PHRs and the presence of explicit governance for PHR data release. Organizations were identified based on a review of the literature, PHR experts, and snowball sampling. Organizations that did not provide patients with electronic access to their data via a PHR were excluded. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 17 organizations for a response rate of 81%. Half of the organizations had explicit governance in the form of a written policy that outlined the data types made available to patients. Overall, 88% of the organizations used a committee structure for the decision-making process and included senior management and information services. All organizations sought input from clinicians. Discussion There was considerable variability in the types of clinical data and the time frame for releasing these data to patients. Variability in data release policies may have implications for PHR use and adoption.

The authors designed and evaluated an algorithm (""SecTag"") to identify both labeled and unlabeled (implied) note section headers in ""history and physical examination"" documents (""H&P notes""). DESIGN: The SecTag algorithm uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, word variant recognition with spelling correction, terminology-based rules, and naive Bayesian scoring methods to identify note section headers. Eleven physicians evaluated SecTag's performance on 319 randomly chosen H&P notes. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were the algorithm's recall and precision in identifying all document sections and a predefined list of twenty-nine major sections. A secondary outcome was to evaluate the algorithm's ability to recognize the correct start and end boundaries of identified sections. RESULTS: The SecTag algorithm identified 16,036 total sections and 7,858 major sections. Physician evaluators classified 15,329 as true positives and identified 160 sections omitted by SecTag. The recall and precision of the SecTag algorithm were 99.0 and 95.6% for all sections, 98.6 and 96.2% for major sections, and 96.6 and 86.8% for unlabeled sections. The algorithm determined the correct starting and ending text boundaries for 94.8% of labeled sections and 85.9% of unlabeled sections.

Ferrandez_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,"BoB, a best-of-breed automated text de-identification system for VHA clinical documents","Ferrandez, Oscar and South, Brett R. and Shen, Shuying and Friedlin, F. Jeffrey and Samore, Matthew H. and Meystre, Stephane M.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: De-identification allows faster and more collaborative clinical research while protecting patient confidentiality. Clinical narrative de-identification is a tedious process that can be alleviated by automated natural language processing methods. The goal of this research is the development of an automated text de-identification system for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical documents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We devised a novel stepwise hybrid approach designed to improve the current strategies used for text de-identification. The proposed system is based on a previous study on the best de-identification methods for VHA documents. This best-of-breed automated clinical text de-identification system (aka BoB) tackles the problem as two separate tasks: (1) maximize patient confidentiality by redacting as much protected health information (PHI) as possible; and (2) leave de-identified documents in a usable state preserving as much clinical information as possible. RESULTS: We evaluated BoB with a manually annotated corpus of a variety of VHA clinical notes, as well as with the 2006 i2b2 de-identification challenge corpus. We present evaluations at the instance- and token-level, with detailed results for BoB's main components. Moreover, an existing text de-identification system was also included in our evaluation. DISCUSSION: BoB's design efficiently takes advantage of the methods implemented in its pipeline, resulting in high sensitivity values (especially for sensitive PHI categories) and a limited number of false positives. CONCLUSIONS: Our system successfully addressed VHA clinical document de-identification, and its hybrid stepwise design demonstrates robustness and efficiency, prioritizing patient confidentiality while leaving most clinical information intact.",2013,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001020,20,1,77-83,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"United States and Humans and United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and *Natural Language Processing and Technology Assessment, Biomedical and *Information Dissemination and *Electronic Health Records and *Confidentiality",NA,NA,2013/01/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hilligoss_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Chart biopsy: an emerging medical practice enabled by electronic health records and its impacts on emergency department-inpatient admission handoffs,"Hilligoss, Brian and Zheng, Kai",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To examine how clinicians on the receiving end of admission handoffs use electronic health records (EHRs) in preparation for those handoffs and to identify the kinds of impacts such usage may have. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis is part of a two-year ethnographic study of emergency department (ED) to internal medicine admission handoffs at a tertiary teaching and referral hospital. Qualitative data were gathered and analyzed iteratively, following a grounded theory methodology. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews (N = 48), observations (349 hours), and recording of handoff conversations (N = 48). Data analyses involved coding, memo writing, and member checking. RESULTS: The use of EHRs has enabled an emerging practice that we refer to as pre-handoff ""chart biopsy"": the activity of selectively examining portions of a patient's health record to gather specific data or information about that patient or to get a broader sense of the patient and the care that patient has received. Three functions of chart biopsy are identified: getting an overview of the patient; preparing for handoff and subsequent care; and defending against potential biases. Chart biopsies appear to impact important clinical and organizational processes. Among these are the nature and quality of handoff interactions, and the quality of care, including the appropriateness of dispositioning of patients.

This problem is particularly profound with drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts for which studies have reported override rates of approximately 90%. The objective of this study is to report consensus-based recommendations of an expert panel on DDI that can be safely made non-interruptive to the provider's workflow, in EHR, in an attempt to reduce alert fatigue. METHODS: We utilized an expert panel process to rate the interactions. Panelists had expertise in medicine, pharmacy, pharmacology and clinical informatics, and represented both academic institutions and vendors of medication knowledge bases and EHR. In addition, representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacy contributed to the discussions. RESULTS: Recommendations and considerations of the panel resulted in the creation of a list of 33 class-based low-priority DDI that do not warrant being interruptive alerts in EHR. In one institution, these accounted for 36% of the interactions displayed. DISCUSSION: Development and customization of the content of medication knowledge bases that drive DDI alerting represents a resource-intensive task. Creation of a standardized list of low-priority DDI may help reduce alert fatigue across EHR. CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts might include the development of a consortium to maintain this list over time.

Although the user experience for online health information seeking varies with the device used, for example, smart devices (SDs) like smartphones/tablets versus personal computers (PCs) like desktops/laptops, very few studies have investigated how online health information seeking behavior (OHISB) may differ by device. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine differences in OHISB between PCs and SDs through a comparative analysis of large-scale health search queries submitted through Web search engines from both types of devices. METHODS: Using the Web analytics tool, IBM NetInsight OnDemand, and based on the type of devices used (PCs or SDs), we obtained the most frequent health search queries between June 2011 and May 2013 that were submitted on Web search engines and directed users to the Mayo Clinic's consumer health information website. We performed analyses on ""Queries with considering repetition counts (QwR)"" and ""Queries without considering repetition counts (QwoR)"". The dataset contains (1) 2.74 million and 3.94 million QwoR, respectively for PCs and SDs, and (2) more than 100 million QwR for both PCs and SDs. We analyzed structural properties of the queries (length of the search queries, usage of query operators and special characters in health queries), types of search queries (keyword-based, wh-questions, yes/no questions), categorization of the queries based on health categories and information mentioned in the queries (gender, age-groups, temporal references), misspellings in the health queries, and the linguistic structure of the health queries. RESULTS: Query strings used for health information searching via PCs and SDs differ by almost 50%. The most searched health categories are ""Symptoms"" (1 in 3 search queries), ""Causes"", and ""Treatments & Drugs"". The distribution of search queries for different health categories differs with the device used for the search. Health queries tend to be longer and more specific than general search queries. Health queries from SDs are longer and have slightly fewer spelling mistakes than those from PCs. Users specify words related to women and children more often than that of men and any other age group. Most of the health queries are formulated using keywords; the second-most common are wh- and yes/no questions. Users ask more health questions using SDs than PCs. Almost all health queries have at least one noun and health queries from SDs are more descriptive than those from PCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a large-scale comparative analysis of health search queries to understand the effects of device type (PCs vs. SDs) used on OHISB.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. METHODS: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. RESULTS: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phihookah-positive=0.39; phi(e-cigs)-positive=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (<cf><87><c2><b2><e2><82><84>=414.50, P<.001, Cramer's V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2534,15,8,e174,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,social media and Humans and natural language processing and *Internet and smoking and twitter messaging and *Smoking and *Tobacco,NA,NA,2013/08/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Conway_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Ethical issues in using Twitter for public health surveillance and research: developing a taxonomy of ethical concepts from the research literature,"Conway, Mike",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The rise of social media and microblogging platforms in recent years, in conjunction with the development of techniques for the processing and analysis of ""big data"", has provided significant opportunities for public health surveillance using user-generated content. However, relatively little attention has been focused on developing ethically appropriate approaches to working with these new data sources. OBJECTIVE: Based on a review of the literature, this study seeks to develop a taxonomy of public health surveillance-related ethical concepts that emerge when using Twitter data, with a view to: (1) explicitly identifying a set of potential ethical issues and concerns that may arise when researchers work with Twitter data, and (2) providing a starting point for the formation of a set of best practices for public health surveillance through the development of an empirically derived taxonomy of ethical concepts. METHODS: We searched Medline, Compendex, PsycINFO, and the Philosopher's Index using a set of keywords selected to identify Twitter-related research papers that reference ethical concepts. Our initial set of queries identified 342 references across the four bibliographic databases. We screened titles and abstracts of these references using our inclusion/exclusion criteria, eliminating duplicates and unavailable papers, until 49 references remained. We then read the full text of these 49 articles and discarded 36, resulting in a final inclusion set of 13 articles. Ethical concepts were then identified in each of these 13 articles. Finally, based on a close reading of the text, a taxonomy of ethical concepts was constructed based on ethical concepts discovered in the papers. RESULTS: From these 13 articles, we iteratively generated a taxonomy of ethical concepts consisting of 10 top level categories: privacy, informed consent, ethical theory, institutional review board (IRB)/regulation, traditional research vs Twitter research, geographical information, researcher lurking, economic value of personal information, medical exceptionalism, and benefit of identifying socially harmful medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, based on a review of the literature, we present a provisional taxonomy of public health surveillance-related ethical concepts that emerge when using Twitter data.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3617,16,12,e290,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"social media and Humans and ethics and Databases, Bibliographic and *Classification and Public Health Surveillance/*methods and Social Media/*ethics and *Ethics and Information Storage and Retrieval/ethics/methods and Internet/*ethics and MEDLINE/ethics and twitter messaging",NA,NA,2014/12/22/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Text de-identification software exists, including ""resynthesis"" components that replace real identifiers with synthetic identifiers. The goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness and examine possible bias introduced by resynthesis on de-identification software. DESIGN: We evaluated the open-source MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit, which includes a resynthesis capability, with clinical text from Vanderbilt University Medical Center patient records. We investigated four record classes from over 500 patients' files, including laboratory reports, medication orders, discharge summaries and clinical notes. We trained and tested the de-identification tool on real and resynthesized records. MEASUREMENTS: We measured performance in terms of precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy for the detection of protected health identifiers as designated by the HIPAA Safe Harbor Rule. RESULTS: The de-identification tool was trained and tested on a collection of real and resynthesized Vanderbilt records. Results for training and testing on the real records were 0.990 accuracy and 0.960 F-measure. The results improved when trained and tested on resynthesized records with 0.998 accuracy and 0.980 F-measure but deteriorated moderately when trained on real records and tested on resynthesized records with 0.989 accuracy 0.862 F-measure. Moreover, the results declined significantly when trained on resynthesized records and tested on real records with 0.942 accuracy and 0.728 F-measure. CONCLUSION: The de-identification tool achieves high accuracy when training and test sets are homogeneous (ie, both real or resynthesized records).

Rink_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Automatic extraction of relations between medical concepts in clinical texts,"Rink, Bryan and Harabagiu, Sanda and Roberts, Kirk",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: A supervised machine learning approach to discover relations between medical problems, treatments, and tests mentioned in electronic medical records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single support vector machine classifier was used to identify relations between concepts and to assign their semantic type. Several resources such as Wikipedia, WordNet, General Inquirer, and a relation similarity metric inform the classifier. RESULTS: The techniques reported in this paper were evaluated in the 2010 i2b2 Challenge and obtained the highest F1 score for the relation extraction task. When gold standard data for concepts and assertions were available, F1 was 73.7, precision was 72.0, and recall was 75.3. F1 is defined as 2*Precision*Recall/(Precision+Recall). Alternatively, when concepts and assertions were discovered automatically, F1 was 48.4, precision was 57.6, and recall was 41.7. DISCUSSION: Although a rich set of features was developed for the classifiers presented in this paper, little knowledge mining was performed from medical ontologies such as those found in UMLS. Future studies should incorporate features extracted from such knowledge sources, which we expect to further improve the results. Moreover, each relation discovery was treated independently. Joint classification of relations may further improve the quality of results. Also, joint learning of the discovery of concepts, assertions, and relations may also improve the results of automatic relation extraction. CONCLUSION: Lexical and contextual features proved to be very important in relation extraction from medical texts. When they are not available to the classifier, the F1 score decreases by 3.7%.

Bodnari_2012_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,MCORES: a system for noun phrase coreference resolution for clinical records,"Bodnari, Andreea and Szolovits, Peter and Uzuner, Ozlem",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Narratives of electronic medical records contain information that can be useful for clinical practice and multi-purpose research. This information needs to be put into a structured form before it can be used by automated systems. Coreference resolution is a step in the transformation of narratives into a structured form. METHODS: This study presents a medical coreference resolution system (MCORES) for noun phrases in four frequently used clinical semantic categories: persons, problems, treatments, and tests. MCORES treats coreference resolution as a binary classification task. Given a pair of concepts from a semantic category, it determines coreferent pairs and clusters them into chains. MCORES uses an enhanced set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Some MCORES features measure the distance between various representations of the concepts in a pair and can be asymmetric. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: MCORES was compared with an in-house baseline that uses only single-perspective 'token overlap' and 'number agreement' features. MCORES was shown to outperform the baseline; its enhanced features contribute significantly to performance. In addition to the baseline, MCORES was compared against two available third-party, open-domain systems, RECONCILE(ACL09) and the Beautiful Anaphora Resolution Toolkit (BART). MCORES was shown to outperform both of these systems on clinical records.",2012,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000591,19,5,906-912,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"United States and Semantics and Humans and Patient Discharge and Classification and Artificial Intelligence and *Natural Language Processing and *Pattern Recognition, Automated and *Electronic Health Records and Data Mining/*methods",NA,NA,2012/10//Sep undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

A prototype system was developed to leverage the capabilities of a personal health record system for the purpose of identifying clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: This study examines how breast cancer patients perceive and interact with a preliminary version of an Internet-based clinical trial matching system, while taking into account the demands of diagnosis and treatment decision making. METHODS: Breast cancer patients participated in small group discussions and interacted with the prototype website in a two-phase qualitative research process. The first phase explored the experience of breast cancer patients (n = 8) with treatment decision making, initial responses to the idea of Internet-based clinical trial matching systems, and reactions to the prototype site. In the second phase, a different set of breast cancer patients (n = 7) reviewed revised website content and presentation and participated in a usability test in which they registered on the system and completed a personal health record to set up the matching process. RESULTS: Participants were initially skeptical of the prototype system because it emphasized registration, had a complicated registration process, and asked for complex medical information. Changing content and attending to usability guidelines improved the experience for women in the second phase of the research and enabled the identification of functionality and content issues, such as lack of clear information and directions on how to use the system. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that women felt favorably about the idea of using the Internet to search for clinical trials but that such a system needed to meet their expectations for credibility and privacy and be sensitive to their situation. Developers can meet these expectations by conforming to established usability guidelines and testing improvements with breast cancer patients.

SCOPE: First, we discuss the importance of imaging informatics in pathology and highlight the challenges posed by histopathological WSI. Next, we provide a thorough review of current methods for: quality control of histopathological images; feature extraction that captures image properties at the pixel, object, and semantic levels; predictive modeling that utilizes image features for diagnostic or prognostic applications; and data and information visualization that explores WSI for de novo discovery. In addition, we highlight future research directions and discuss the impact of large public repositories of histopathological data, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, on the field of pathology informatics. Following the review, we present a case study to illustrate a clinical decision support system that begins with quality control and ends with predictive modeling for several cancer endpoints.

The time required to obtain optimal results from these databases using traditional systems often makes accessing the databases impractical for clinicians. This article explores whether a hybrid approach of augmenting traditional information retrieval with knowledge-based methods facilitates finding practical clinical advice in the research literature. DESIGN: Three experimental systems were evaluated for their ability to find MEDLINE citations providing answers to clinical questions of different complexity. The systems (SemRep, Essie, and CQA-1.0), which rely on domain knowledge and semantic processing to varying extents, were evaluated separately and in combination. Fifteen therapy and prevention questions in three categories (general, intermediate, and specific questions) were searched. The first 10 citations retrieved by each system were randomized, anonymized, and evaluated on a three-point scale. The reasons for ratings were documented. MEASUREMENTS: Metrics evaluating the overall performance of a system (mean average precision, binary preference) and metrics evaluating the number of relevant documents in the first several presented to a physician were used. RESULTS: Scores (mean average precision = 0.57, binary preference = 0.71) for fusion of the retrieval results of the three systems are significantly (p < 0.01) better than those for any individual system.

DESIGN: The system explored several linguistic natural language processing techniques (eg, term-based and token-based rule matching) to identify medication-related information in the narrative text. A number of lexical resources was constructed to profile lexical or morphological features for different categories of medication constituents. MEASUREMENTS: Performance was evaluated in terms of the micro-averaged F-measure at the horizontal system level. RESULTS: The automated system performed well, and achieved an F-micro of 80% for the term-level results and 81% for the token-level results, placing it sixth in exact matches and fourth in inexact matches in the i2b2 competition.

However, redundant assessments may increase patient dropout and represent a lost opportunity to collect more clinically useful data. OBJECTIVE: We determined the extent to which previous IVR assessments predicted subsequent responses among patients with depression diagnoses, potentially obviating the need to repeatedly collect the same information. We also evaluated whether frequent (ie, weekly) IVR assessment attempts were significantly more predictive of patients' subsequent reports than information collected biweekly or monthly. METHODS: Using data from 1050 IVR assessments for 208 patients with depression diagnoses, we examined the predictability of four IVR-reported outcomes: moderate/severe depressive symptoms (score <e2><89><a5>10 on the PHQ-9), fair/poor general health, poor antidepressant adherence, and days in bed due to poor mental health. We used logistic models with training and test samples to predict patients' IVR responses based on their five most recent weekly, biweekly, and monthly assessment attempts. The marginal benefit of more frequent assessments was evaluated based on Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and statistical comparisons of the area under the curves (AUC). RESULTS: Patients' reports about their depressive symptoms and perceived health status were highly predictable based on prior assessment responses. For models predicting moderate/severe depression, the AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.93) when assuming weekly assessment attempts and only slightly less when assuming biweekly assessments (AUC: 0.89; CI 0.87-0.91) or monthly attempts (AUC: 0.89; CI 0.86-0.91). The AUC for models predicting reports of fair/poor health status was similar when weekly assessments were compared with those occurring biweekly (P value for the difference=.11) or monthly (P=.81). Reports of medication adherence problems and days in bed were somewhat less predictable but also showed small differences between assessments attempted weekly, biweekly, and monthly. CONCLUSIONS: The technical feasibility of gathering high frequency health data via IVR may in some instances exceed the clinical benefit of doing so. Predictive analytics could make data gathering more efficient with negligible loss in effectiveness. In particular, weekly or biweekly depressive symptom reports may provide little marginal information regarding how the person is doing relative to collecting that information monthly. The next generation of automated health assessment services should use data mining techniques to avoid redundant assessments and should gather data at the frequency that maximizes the value of the information collected.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2582,15,7,e118,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and depression and telemedicine and Area Under Curve and ROC Curve and self-care and *Telemedicine and *Self-Assessment and *Patient Compliance and *Automation and cellular phone and Depression/*physiopathology/psychology/therapy,NA,NA,2013/07/05/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Roberts_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,A flexible framework for deriving assertions from electronic medical records,"Roberts, Kirk and Harabagiu, Sanda M.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: This paper describes natural-language-processing techniques for two tasks: identification of medical concepts in clinical text, and classification of assertions, which indicate the existence, absence, or uncertainty of a medical problem. Because so many resources are available for processing clinical texts, there is interest in developing a framework in which features derived from these resources can be optimally selected for the two tasks of interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors used two machine-learning (ML) classifiers: support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). Because SVMs and CRFs can operate on a large set of features extracted from both clinical texts and external resources, the authors address the following research question: Which features need to be selected for obtaining optimal results? To this end, the authors devise feature-selection techniques which greatly reduce the amount of manual experimentation and improve performance. RESULTS: The authors evaluated their approaches on the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge data. Concept extraction achieves 79.59 micro F-measure. Assertion classification achieves 93.94 micro F-measure. DISCUSSION: Approaching medical concept extraction and assertion classification through ML-based techniques has the advantage of easily adapting to new data sets and new medical informatics tasks. However, ML-based techniques perform best when optimal features are selected. By devising promising feature-selection techniques, the authors obtain results that outperform the current state of the art.

M. and Wang, Yefeng and Li, Min",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Information extraction and classification of clinical data are current challenges in natural language processing. This paper presents a cascaded method to deal with three different extractions and classifications in clinical data: concept annotation, assertion classification and relation classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pipeline system was developed for clinical natural language processing that includes a proofreading process, with gold-standard reflexive validation and correction. The information extraction system is a combination of a machine learning approach and a rule-based approach. The outputs of this system are used for evaluation in all three tiers of the fourth i2b2/VA shared-task and workshop challenge. RESULTS: Overall concept classification attained an F-score of 83.3% against a baseline of 77.0%, the optimal F-score for assertions about the concepts was 92.4% and relation classifier attained 72.6% for relationships between clinical concepts against a baseline of 71.0%. Micro-average results for the challenge test set were 81.79%, 91.90% and 70.18%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The challenge in the multi-task test requires a distribution of time and work load for each individual task so that the overall performance evaluation on all three tasks would be more informative rather than treating each task assessment as independent. The simplicity of the model developed in this work should be contrasted with the very large feature space of other participants in the challenge who only achieved slightly better performance.

D.Avolio_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Automated concept-level information extraction to reduce the need for custom software and rules development,"D'Avolio, Leonard W. and Nguyen, Thien M. and Goryachev, Sergey and Fiore, Louis D.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Despite at least 40 years of promising empirical performance, very few clinical natural language processing (NLP) or information extraction systems currently contribute to medical science or care. The authors address this gap by reducing the need for custom software and rules development with a graphical user interface-driven, highly generalizable approach to concept-level retrieval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 'learn by example' approach combines features derived from open-source NLP pipelines with open-source machine learning classifiers to automatically and iteratively evaluate top-performing configurations. The Fourth i2b2/VA Shared Task Challenge's concept extraction task provided the data sets and metrics used to evaluate performance. RESULTS: Top F-measure scores for each of the tasks were medical problems (0.83), treatments (0.82), and tests (0.83). Recall lagged precision in all experiments. Precision was near or above 0.90 in all tasks. Discussion With no customization for the tasks and less than 5&emsp14;min of end-user time to configure and launch each experiment, the average F-measure was 0.83, one point behind the mean F-measure of the 22 entrants in the competition. Strong precision scores indicate the potential of applying the approach for more specific clinical information extraction tasks.

DESIGN: To detect clinical events, we used rules and Conditional Random Fields. We built Random Forest models to identify event modality and polarity. To identify temporal expressions we built on the HeidelTime system. To detect temporal relations, we systematically studied their breakdown into distinct situations; we designed an oracle method to determine the most prominent situations and the most suitable associated classifiers, and combined their results. RESULTS: We achieved F-measures of 0.8307 for event identification, based on rules, and 0.8385 for temporal expression identification. In the temporal relation task, we identified nine main situations in three groups, experimentally confirming shared intuitions: within-sentence relations, section-related time, and across-sentence relations. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes performed best on the first and third groups, and decision trees on the second. We reached a 0.6231 global F-measure, improving by 7.5 points our official submission. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully hand-crafted rules obtained good results for the detection of events and temporal expressions, while a combination of classifiers improved temporal link prediction. The characterization of the oracle recall of situations allowed us to point at directions where further work would be most useful for temporal relation detection: within-sentence relations and linking History of Present Illness events to the admission date.

DESIGN: Analysis of ordering and order check data gathered by a post-hoc logging program. Use of Pearson's chi-square contingency table test comparing results from this study and the earlier study. MEASUREMENTS: Factors measured were total number of orders, frequency of order check types, frequency of order check overrides by order check type and comparisons of these results with previous results. RESULTS: A total of 37,040 orders generated 908 (2.5%) critical order checks.

Based on the information extracted from the narrative reports associated with a patient, the task is to identify whether or not the patient is positive for pneumonia. DESIGN: A binary classifier was employed to identify pneumonia from a dataset of multiple types of clinical notes created for 426 patients during their stay in the intensive care unit. For this purpose, three types of features were considered: (1) word n-grams, (2) Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts, and (3) assertion values associated with pneumonia expressions. System performance was greatly increased by a feature selection approach which uses statistical significance testing to rank features based on their association with the two categories of pneumonia identification. RESULTS: Besides testing our system on the entire cohort of 426 patients (unrestricted dataset), we also used a smaller subset of 236 patients (restricted dataset). The performance of the system was compared with the results of a baseline previously proposed for these two datasets. The best results achieved by the system (85.71 and 81.67 F1-measure) are significantly better than the baseline results (50.70 and 49.10 F1-measure) on the restricted and unrestricted datasets, respectively.

Roberts_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,"A flexible framework for recognizing events, temporal expressions, and temporal relations in clinical text","Roberts, Kirk and Rink, Bryan and Harabagiu, Sanda M.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a natural language processing method for the automatic recognition of events, temporal expressions, and temporal relations in clinical records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combination of supervised, unsupervised, and rule-based methods were used. Supervised methods include conditional random fields and support vector machines. A flexible automated feature selection technique was used to select the best subset of features for each supervised task. Unsupervised methods include Brown clustering on several corpora, which result in our method being considered semisupervised. RESULTS: On the 2012 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) shared task data, we achieved an overall event F1-measure of 0.8045, an overall temporal expression F1-measure of 0.6154, an overall temporal link detection F1-measure of 0.5594, and an end-to-end temporal link detection F1-measure of 0.5258. The most competitive system was our event recognition method, which ranked third out of the 14 participants in the event task. DISCUSSION: Analysis reveals the event recognition method has difficulty determining which modifiers to include/exclude in the event span. The temporal expression recognition method requires significantly more normalization rules, although many of these rules apply only to a small number of cases. Finally, the temporal relation recognition method requires more advanced medical knowledge and could be improved by separating the single discourse relation classifier into multiple, more targeted component classifiers. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing events and temporal expressions can be achieved accurately by combining supervised and unsupervised methods, even when only minimal medical knowledge is available.

The aim was to extract the following information for each medication: name, dosage, mode/route, frequency, duration and reason. DESIGN: The system implements a rule-based methodology, which exploits typical morphological, lexical, syntactic and semantic features of the targeted information. These features were acquired from the training dataset and public resources such as the UMLS and relevant web pages. Information extracted by pattern matching was combined together using context-sensitive heuristic rules. MEASUREMENTS: The system was applied to a set of 547 previously unseen discharge summaries, and the extracted information was evaluated against a manually prepared gold standard consisting of 251 documents. The overall ranking of the participating teams was obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure as the primary evaluation metric. RESULTS: The implemented method achieved the micro-averaged F-measure of 81% (with 86% precision and 77% recall), which ranked this system third in the challenge. The significance tests revealed the system's performance to be not significantly different from that of the second ranked system. Relative to other systems, this system achieved the best F-measure for the extraction of duration (53%) and reason (46%).

Brumen_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,"Outsourcing medical data analyses: can technology overcome legal, privacy, and confidentiality issues?","Brumen, Bostjan and Hericko, Marjan and Sevcnikar, Andrej and Zavrsnik, Jernej and Holbl, Marko",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Medical data are gold mines for deriving the knowledge that could change the course of a single patient's life or even the health of the entire population. A data analyst needs to have full access to relevant data, but full access may be denied by privacy and confidentiality of medical data legal regulations, especially when the data analyst is not affiliated with the data owner. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to analyze the privacy and confidentiality issues and the associated regulations pertaining to medical data, and to identify technologies to properly address these issues. Our second objective was to develop a procedure to protect medical data in such a way that the outsourced analyst would be capable of doing analyses on protected data and the results would be comparable, if not the same, as if they had been done on the original data. Specifically, our hypothesis was there would not be a difference between the outsourced decision trees built on encrypted data and the ones built on original data. METHODS: Using formal definitions, we developed an algorithm to protect medical data for outsourced analyses. The algorithm was applied to publicly available datasets (N=30) from the medical and life sciences fields. The analyses were performed on the original and the protected datasets and the results of the analyses were compared. Bootstrapped paired t tests for 2 dependent samples were used to test whether the mean differences in size, number of leaves, and the accuracy of the original and the encrypted decision trees were significantly different. RESULTS: The decision trees built on encrypted data were virtually the same as those built on original data. Out of 30 datasets, 100% of the trees had identical accuracy. The size of a tree and the number of leaves was different only once (1/30, 3%, P=.19). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm encrypts a file with plain text medical data into an encrypted file with the data protected in such a way that external data analyses are still possible. The results show that the results of analyses on original and on protected data are identical or comparably similar. The approach addresses the privacy and confidentiality issues that arise with medical data and is adherent to strict legal rules in the United States and Europe regarding the processing of the medical data.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2471,15,12,e283,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"United States and Humans and Algorithms and Databases, Factual and Europe and data analysis and data protection and Decision Trees and medical decision making and confidentiality and computer-assisted and *Confidentiality/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Outsourced Services/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Statistics as Topic/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Computer Security/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and patient data privacy",NA,NA,2013/12/16/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mark and Gupta, Dipak K. and Peddecord, K. Michael and Nagel, Anna C. and Allen, Christopher and Yang, Jiue-An and Lindsay, Suzanne",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Existing influenza surveillance in the United States is focused on the collection of data from sentinel physicians and hospitals; however, the compilation and distribution of reports are usually delayed by up to 2 weeks. With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza. OBJECTIVE: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. METHODS: Tweets containing the keyword ""flu"" were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was ""valid"", or from a user who was likely ill with the flu. RESULTS: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.",2014,10.2196/jmir.3532,16,11,e250,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Humans and Internet and Twitter and tweets and Reproducibility of Results and Seasons and United States/epidemiology and *Social Media and infodemiology and infoveillance and Influenza, Human/*epidemiology and Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data and influenza and Population Surveillance/*methods and California/epidemiology and syndromic surveillance",NA,NA,2014/11/14/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system is a decision support and electronic medical record system used in our pediatric clinics. All families of patients up to 15 months of age seen between October 2007 and July 2009 were randomized to one of three groups: (1) screening questions printed on prescreener forms (PSF) completed by mothers in the waiting room with physician alerts for positive screens, (2) everything in (1) plus 'just in time' (JIT) printed materials to aid physicians, and (3) a control group where physicians were simply reminded to screen on printed physician worksheets. RESULTS: The main outcome of interest was whether physicians suspected a diagnosis of maternal depression and referred a mother for assistance. This occurred significantly more often in both the PSF (2.4%) and JIT groups (2.4%) than in the control group (1.2%) (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.93).

Dai_2012_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Coreference resolution of medical concepts in discharge summaries by exploiting contextual information,"Dai, Hong-Jie and Chen, Chun-Yu and Wu, Chi-Yang and Lai, Po-Ting and Tsai, Richard Tzong-Han and Hsu, Wen-Lian",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Patient discharge summaries provide detailed medical information about hospitalized patients and are a rich resource of data for clinical record text mining. The textual expressions of this information are highly variable. In order to acquire a precise understanding of the patient, it is important to uncover the relationship between all instances in the text. In natural language processing (NLP), this task falls under the category of coreference resolution. DESIGN: A key contribution of this paper is the application of contextual-dependent rules that describe relationships between coreference pairs. To resolve phrases that refer to the same entity, the authors use these rules in three representative NLP systems: one rule-based, another based on the maximum entropy model, and the last a system built on the Markov logic network (MLN) model. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the proposed MLN-based system outperforms the baseline system (exact match) by average F-scores of 4.3% and 5.7% on the Beth and Partners datasets, respectively. Finally, the three systems were integrated into an ensemble system, further improving performance to 87.21%, which is 4.5% more than the official i2b2 Track 1C average (82.7%). CONCLUSION: In this paper, the main challenges in the resolution of coreference relations in patient discharge summaries are described. Several rules are proposed to exploit contextual information, and three approaches presented. While single systems provided promising results, an ensemble approach combining the three systems produced a better performance than even the best single system.",2012,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000808,19,5,888-896,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,"United States and Semantics and Humans and Patient Discharge and Artificial Intelligence and Computer Simulation and *Natural Language Processing and *Pattern Recognition, Automated and *Electronic Health Records and Data Mining/*methods",NA,NA,2012/10//Sep undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of infobuttons is to help clinicians promptly meet their information needs. The objective of this study was to determine whether infobutton links that direct to specific content topics (""topic links"") are more effective than links that point to general overview content (""nonspecific links""). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with a control and an intervention group. Clinicians in the control group had access to nonspecific links, while those in the intervention group had access to topic links. MEASUREMENTS: Infobutton session duration, number of infobutton sessions, session success rate, and the self-reported impact that the infobutton session produced on decision making. RESULTS: The analysis was performed on 90 subjects and 3,729 infobutton sessions. Subjects in the intervention group spent 17.4% less time seeking for information (35.5 seconds vs. 43 seconds, p = 0.008) than those in the control group. Subjects in the intervention group used infobuttons 20.5% (22 sessions vs. 17.5 sessions, p = 0.21) more often than in the control group, but the difference was not significant. The information seeking success rate was equally high in both groups (89.4% control vs. 87.2% intervention, p = 0.99). Subjects reported a high positive clinical impact (i.e., decision enhancement or knowledge update) in 62% of the sessions. Limitations The exclusion of users with a low frequency of infobutton use and the focus on medication-related information needs may limit the generalization of the results. The session outcomes measurement was based on clinicians' self-assessment and therefore prone to bias. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that topic links are more efficient than nonspecific links regarding the time seeking for information. It is unclear whether the statistical difference demonstrated will result in a clinically significant impact. However, the overall results confirm previous evidence that infobuttons are effective at helping clinicians to answer questions at the point of care and demonstrate a modest incremental change in the efficiency of information delivery for routine users of this tool.",2008,10.1197/jamia.M2725,15,6,752-759,eng,1067-5027 1527-974X,"Humans and Medical Records Systems, Computerized and *User-Computer Interface and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and Point-of-Care Systems and Clinical Medicine and *Decision Support Techniques",NA,NA,2008/12//Nov undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The coreference categories include Person, Problem, Treatment, and Test. DESIGN: An integrated coreference resolution system was developed by exploiting Person attributes, contextual semantic clues, and world knowledge. It includes three subsystems: Person coreference system based on three Person attributes, Problem/Treatment/Test system based on numerous contextual semantic extractors and world knowledge, and Pronoun system based on a multi-class support vector machine classifier. The three Person attributes are patient, relative and hospital personnel. Contextual semantic extractors include anatomy, position, medication, indicator, temporal, spatial, section, modifier, equipment, operation, and assertion. The world knowledge is extracted from external resources such as Wikipedia. MEASUREMENTS: Micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure in MUC, BCubed and CEAF were used to evaluate results. RESULTS: The system achieved an overall micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure of 0.906, 0.925, and 0.915, respectively, on test data (from four hospitals) released by the challenge organizers. It achieved a precision, recall and F-measure of 0.905, 0.920 and 0.913, respectively, on test data without Pittsburgh data. We ranked the first out of 20 competing teams. Among the four sub-tasks on Person, Problem, Treatment, and Test, the highest F-measure was seen for Person coreference. CONCLUSIONS: This system achieved encouraging results. The Person system can determine whether personal pronouns and proper names are coreferent or not. The Problem/Treatment/Test system benefits from both world knowledge in evaluating the similarity of two mentions and contextual semantic extractors in identifying semantic clues. The Pronoun system can automatically detect whether a Pronoun mention is coreferent to that of the other four types.

METHODS: We cast the task of discovering body site and severity modifiers as a relation extraction problem in the context of a supervised machine learning framework. We utilize rich linguistic features to represent the pairs of relation arguments and delegate the decision about the nature of the relationship between them to a support vector machine model. We evaluate our models using two corpora that annotate body site and severity modifiers. We also compare the model performance to a number of rule-based baselines. We conduct cross-domain portability experiments. In addition, we carry out feature ablation experiments to determine the contribution of various feature groups. Finally, we perform error analysis and report the sources of errors. RESULTS: The performance of our method for discovering body site modifiers achieves F1 of 0.740-0.908 and our method for discovering severity modifiers achieves F1 of 0.905-0.929. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that both methods perform well on both in-domain and out-domain data, approaching the performance of human annotators. The most salient features are token and named entity features, although syntactic dependency features also contribute to the overall performance. The dominant sources of errors are infrequent patterns in the data and inability of the system to discern deeper semantic structures.

However, studies indicate these systems may miss some important interactions. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of pharmacy CDS programs to detect clinically important DDIs. DESIGN: Researchers made on-site visits to 64 participating Arizona pharmacies between December 2008 and November 2009 to analyze the ability of pharmacy information systems and associated CDS to detect DDIs. Software evaluation was conducted to determine whether DDI alerts arose from prescription orders entered into the pharmacy computer systems for a standardized fictitious patient. The fictitious patient's orders consisted of 18 different medications including 19 drug pairs-13 of which were clinically significant DDIs, and six were non-interacting drug pairs. MEASUREMENTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and percentage of correct responses were measured for each of the pharmacy CDS systems. RESULTS: Only 18 (28%) of the 64 pharmacies correctly identified eligible interactions and non-interactions. The median percentage of correct DDI responses was 89% (range 47-100%) for participating pharmacies.

Baker_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,How can research keep up with eHealth? Ten strategies for increasing the timeliness and usefulness of eHealth research,"Baker, Timothy B. and Gustafson, David H. and Shah, Dhavan",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: eHealth interventions appear and change so quickly that they challenge the way we conduct research. By the time a randomized trial of a new intervention is published, technological improvements and clinical discoveries may make the intervention dated and unappealing. This and the spate of health-related apps and websites may lead consumers, patients, and caregivers to use interventions that lack evidence of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to offer strategies for increasing the speed and usefulness of eHealth research. METHODS: The paper describes two types of strategies based on the authors' own research and the research literature: those that improve the efficiency of eHealth research, and those that improve its quality. RESULTS: Efficiency strategies include: (1) think small: conduct small studies that can target discrete but significant questions and thereby speed knowledge acquisition; (2) use efficient designs: use such methods as fractional-factorial and quasi-experimental designs and surrogate endpoints, and experimentally modify and evaluate interventions and delivery systems already in use; (3) study universals: focus on timeless behavioral, psychological, and cognitive principles and systems; (4) anticipate the next big thing: listen to voices outside normal practice and connect different perspectives for new insights; (5) improve information delivery systems: researchers should apply their communications expertise to enhance inter-researcher communication, which could synergistically accelerate progress and capitalize upon the availability of ""big data""; and (6) develop models, including mediators and moderators: valid models are remarkably generative, and tests of moderation and mediation should elucidate boundary conditions of effects and treatment mechanisms. Quality strategies include: (1) continuous quality improvement: researchers need to borrow engineering practices such as the continuous enhancement of interventions to incorporate clinical and technological progress; (2) help consumers identify quality: consumers, clinicians, and others all need to easily identify quality, suggesting the need to efficiently and publicly index intervention quality; (3) reduce the costs of care: concern with health care costs can drive intervention adoption and use and lead to novel intervention effects (eg, reduced falls in the elderly); and (4) deeply understand users: a rigorous evaluation of the consumer's needs is a key starting point for intervention development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiple pass sieve approach utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) at each pass was used to resolve coreference. Information such as lexical similarity, recency of a concept mention, synonymy based on Wikipedia redirects, and local lexical context were used to inform the method. Results were evaluated using an unweighted average of MUC, CEAF, and B(3) coreference evaluation metrics. The datasets used in these research experiments were made available through the 2011 i2b2/VA Shared Task on Coreference. RESULTS: The method achieved an average F score of 0.821 on the ODIE dataset, with a precision of 0.802 and a recall of 0.845.

Coiera_2008_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Is relevance relevant? User relevance ratings may not predict the impact of Internet search on decision outcomes,"Coiera, Enrico W. and Vickland, Victor",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: A common measure of Internet search engine effectiveness is its ability to find documents that a user perceives as 'relevant'. This study sought to test whether user provided relevance ratings for documents retrieved by an Internet search engine correlate with the decision outcome after use of a search engine. DESIGN: 227 university students were asked to answer four randomly assigned consumer health questions, then to conduct an Internet search on one of two randomly assigned search engines of different performance, and to again answer the question. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked to provide a relevance score for each document retrieved as well as a pre and post search answer to each question. RESULTS: User relevance rankings had little or no predictive power. Relevance rankings were unable to predict whether the user of a search engine could correctly answer a question after search and could not differentiate between two search engines with statistically different performance in the hands of users. Only when users had strong prior knowledge of the questions, and the decision task was of low complexity, did relevance appear to have modest predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: User provided relevance rankings taken in isolation seem to be of limited to no value when designing a search engine that will be used in a general-purpose setting. Relevance rankings may have a place in situations in which experts provide rankings, and decision tasks are of complexity commensurate with the abilities of the raters. A more natural metric of search engine performance may be a user's ability to accurately complete a task, as this removes the inherent subjectivity of relevance rankings, and provides a direct and repeatable outcome measure which directly correlates with the performance of the search technology in the hands of users.",2008,10.1197/jamia.M2663,15,4,542-545,eng,1067-5027 1527-974X,Humans and Medical Informatics and *Internet and *Decision Making and Information Storage and Retrieval/*standards,NA,NA,2008/08//Jul undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Management options for localized disease exist, yet an evidence-based criterion standard for treatment still has to emerge. Although 5-year survival rates approach 98%, all treatment options carry the possibility for significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. It is therefore recommended that patients be actively involved in the treatment decision process. We have developed an Internet/CD-ROM-based multimedia Prostate Interactive Educational System (PIES) to enhance patients' treatment decision making. PIES virtually mirrors a health center to provide patients with information about prostate cancer and its treatment through an intuitive interface, using videos, animations, graphics, and texts. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the PIES intervention and to report preliminary outcomes of the program in a pilot trial among patients with a new prostate cancer diagnosis, and (2) to explore the potential impact of tailoring PIES treatment information to participants' information-seeking styles on study outcomes. METHODS: Participants (n = 72) were patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who had not made a treatment decision. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions: (1) control condition (providing information through standard National Cancer Institute brochures; 26%), and PIES (2) with tailoring (43%) and (3) without tailoring to a patient's information-seeking style (31%). Questionnaires were administrated before (t1) and immediately after the intervention (t2). Measurements include evaluation and acceptability of the PIES intervention, monitoring/blunting information-seeking style, psychological distress, and decision-related variables (eg, decisional confidence, feeling informed about prostate cancer and treatment, and treatment preference). RESULTS: The PIES program was well accepted by patients and did not interfere with the clinical routine. About 79% of eligible patients (72/91) completed the pre- and post-PIES intervention assessments. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly more likely to report higher levels of confidence in their treatment choices, higher levels of helpfulness of the information they received in making a treatment decision, and that the information they received was emotionally reassuring. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly less likely to need more information about treatment options, were less anxious about their treatment choices, and thought the information they received was clear (P < .05). Tailoring PIES information to information-seeking style was not related to decision-making variables. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study confirms that the implementation of PIES within a clinical practice is feasible and acceptable to patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. PIES improved key decision-making process variables and reduced the emotional impact of a difficult medical decision.",2012,10.2196/jmir.1891,14,1,e6,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and Feasibility Studies and *Internet and New England and *Decision Making and *Patient Acceptance of Health Care and *CD-ROM and *Patient Participation and Prostatic Neoplasms/*psychology,NA,NA,2012/01/13/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Weitzman_2011_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Social but safe? Quality and safety of diabetes-related online social networks,"Weitzman, Elissa R. and Cole, Emily and Kaci, Liljana and Mandl, Kenneth D.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To foster informed decision-making about health social networking (SN) by patients and clinicians, the authors evaluated the quality/safety of SN sites' policies and practices. DESIGN: Multisite structured observation of diabetes-focused SN sites. Measurements 28 indicators of quality and safety covering: (1) alignment of content with diabetes science and clinical practice recommendations; (2) safety practices for auditing content, supporting transparency and moderation; (3) accessibility of privacy policies and the communication and control of privacy risks; and (4) centralized sharing of member data and member control over sharing. RESULTS: Quality was variable across n=10 sites: 50% were aligned with diabetes science/clinical practice recommendations with gaps in medical disclaimer use (30% have) and specification of relevant glycosylated hemoglobin levels (0% have). Safety was mixed with gaps in external review approaches (20% used audits and association links) and internal review approaches (70% use moderation). Internal safety review offers limited protection: misinformation about a diabetes 'cure' was found on four moderated sites. Of nine sites with advertising, transparency was missing on five; ads for unfounded 'cures' were present on three. Technological safety was poor with almost no use of procedures for secure data storage and transmission; only three sites support member controls over personal information. Privacy policies' poor readability impedes risk communication. Only three sites (30%) demonstrated better practice. Limitations English-language diabetes sites only. CONCLUSION: The quality/safety of diabetes SN is variable. Observed better practice suggests improvement is feasible. Mechanisms for improvement are recommended that engage key stakeholders to balance autonomy, community ownership, conditions for innovation, and consumer protection.",2011,10.1136/jamia.2010.009712,18,3,292-297,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,United States and Humans and Confidentiality and *Internet and Computer Security and Consumer Health Information and *Information Dissemination and *Quality of Health Care and *Safety and *Social Support and Diabetes Mellitus/*therapy,NA,NA,2011/05/01/,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Xu_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,An end-to-end system to identify temporal relation in discharge summaries: 2012 i2b2 challenge,"Xu, Yan and Wang, Yining and Liu, Tianren and Tsujii, Junichi and Chang, Eric I.-Chao",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To create an end-to-end system to identify temporal relation in discharge summaries for the 2012 i2b2 challenge. The challenge includes event extraction, timex extraction, and temporal relation identification. DESIGN: An end-to-end temporal relation system was developed. It includes three subsystems: an event extraction system (conditional random fields (CRF) name entity extraction and their corresponding attribute classifiers), a temporal extraction system (CRF name entity extraction, their corresponding attribute classifiers, and context-free grammar based normalization system), and a temporal relation system (10 multi-support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a Markov logic networks inference system) using labeled sequential pattern mining, syntactic structures based on parse trees, and results from a coordination classifier. Micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), averaged P&R (P&R), and F measure (F) were used to evaluate results. RESULTS: For event extraction, the system achieved 0.9415 (P), 0.8930 (R), 0.9166 (P&R), and 0.9166 (F). The accuracies of their type, polarity, and modality were 0.8574, 0.8585, and 0.8560, respectively. For timex extraction, the system achieved 0.8818, 0.9489, 0.9141, and 0.9141, respectively. The accuracies of their type, value, and modifier were 0.8929, 0.7170, and 0.8907, respectively. For temporal relation, the system achieved 0.6589, 0.7129, 0.6767, and 0.6849, respectively. For end-to-end temporal relation, it achieved 0.5904, 0.5944, 0.5921, and 0.5924, respectively. With the F measure used for evaluation, we were ranked first out of 14 competing teams (event extraction), first out of 14 teams (timex extraction), third out of 12 teams (temporal relation), and second out of seven teams (end-to-end temporal relation).

Jonnalagadda_2013_JotAMIA.J,JOUR,Automatically extracting sentences from Medline citations to support clinicians' information needs,"Jonnalagadda, Siddhartha Reddy and Del Fiol, Guilherme and Medlin, Richard and Weir, Charlene and Fiszman, Marcelo and Mostafa, Javed and Liu, Hongfang",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: Online health knowledge resources contain answers to most of the information needs raised by clinicians in the course of care. However, significant barriers limit the use of these resources for decision-making, especially clinicians' lack of time. In this study we assessed the feasibility of automatically generating knowledge summaries for a particular clinical topic composed of relevant sentences extracted from Medline citations. METHODS: The proposed approach combines information retrieval and semantic information extraction techniques to identify relevant sentences from Medline abstracts. We assessed this approach in two case studies on the treatment alternatives for depression and Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: A total of 515 of 564 (91.3%) sentences retrieved in the two case studies were relevant to the topic of interest. About one-third of the relevant sentences described factual knowledge or a study conclusion that can be used for supporting information needs at the point of care. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of relevant sentences is desirable, given that clinicians' lack of time is one of the main barriers to using knowledge resources at the point of care. Sentence rank was not significantly associated with relevancy, possibly due to most sentences being highly relevant. Sentences located closer to the end of the abstract and sentences with treatment and comparative predications were likely to be conclusive sentences. Our proposed technical approach to helping clinicians meet their information needs is promising. The approach can be extended for other knowledge resources and information need types.",2013,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001347,20,5,1000-995,eng,1527-974X 1067-5027,clinical decision support and Semantics and Humans and natural language processing and Unified Medical Language System and *Algorithms and *Natural Language Processing and Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods and information needs and *MEDLINE and Alzheimer Disease/therapy and Depressive Disorder/therapy and knowledge summary,NA,NA,2013/10//Sep undefined,J Am Med Inform Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Woods_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Patient experiences with full electronic access to health records and clinical notes through the My HealtheVet Personal Health Record Pilot: qualitative study,"Woods, Susan S. and Schwartz, Erin and Tuepker, Anais and Press, Nancy A. and Nazi, Kim M. and Turvey, Carolyn L. and Nichol, W. Paul",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Full sharing of the electronic health record with patients has been identified as an important opportunity to engage patients in their health and health care. The My HealtheVet Pilot, the initial personal health record of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, allowed patients and their delegates to view and download content in their electronic health record, including clinical notes, laboratory tests, and imaging reports. OBJECTIVE: A qualitative study with purposeful sampling sought to examine patients' views and experiences with reading their health records, including their clinical notes, online. METHODS: Five focus group sessions were conducted with patients and family members who enrolled in the My HealtheVet Pilot at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center, Oregon. A total of 30 patients enrolled in the My HealtheVet Pilot, and 6 family members who had accessed and viewed their electronic health records participated in the sessions. RESULTS: Four themes characterized patient experiences with reading the full complement of their health information. Patients felt that seeing their records positively affected communication with providers and the health system, enhanced knowledge of their health and improved self-care, and allowed for greater participation in the quality of their care such as follow-up of abnormal test results or decision-making on when to seek care. While some patients felt that seeing previously undisclosed information, derogatory language, or inconsistencies in their notes caused challenges, they overwhelmingly felt that having more, rather than less, of their health record information provided benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their delegates had predominantly positive experiences with health record transparency and the open sharing of notes and test results. Viewing their records appears to empower patients and enhance their contributions to care, calling into question common provider concerns about the effect of full record access on patient well-being. While shared records may or may not impact overall clinic workload, it is likely to change providers' work, necessitating new types of skills to communicate and partner with patients.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2356,15,3,e65,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Humans and Oregon and Patient Care Team and Pilot Projects and User-Computer Interface and Qualitative Research and *Medical Records Systems, Computerized and *Access to Information and *Patient Satisfaction",NA,NA,2013/03/27/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lindquist_2008_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The use of the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) among personnel and students in health care: a review,"Lindquist, Anna M. and Johansson, Pauline E. and Petersson, Goran I. and Saveman, Britt-Inger and Nilsson, Gunilla C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Health care personnel need access to updated information anywhere and at any time, and a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) has the potential to meet these requirements. A PDA is a mobile tool which has been employed widely for various purposes in health care practice, and the level of its use is expected to increase. Loaded with suitable functions and software applications, a PDA might qualify as the tool that personnel and students in health care need. In Sweden today, despite its leadership role in mobile technologies, PDAs are not commonly used, and there is a lack of suitable functions and software applications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present review was to obtain an overview of existing research on the use of PDAs among personnel and students in health care. METHODS: The literature search included original peer-reviewed research articles written in English and published from 1996 to 2008. All study designs were considered for inclusion. We excluded reviews and studies focusing on the use of PDAs in classroom situations. From March 2006 to the last update in May 2008, we searched PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, IngentaConnect, and a local search engine (ELIN@Kalmar). We conducted a content analysis, using Nielsen's Model of System Acceptability as a theoretical framework in structuring and presenting the results. RESULTS: From the 900 references initially screened, 172 articles were selected and critically assessed until 48 articles remained. The majority originated in North-America (USA: n=24, Canada: n=11). The categories which emerged from our content analysis coincided to a certain extent to Nielsen's Model of System Acceptability (social and practical acceptability), including usefulness (utility and usability) subcategories such as learnability, efficiency, errors, and satisfaction. The studies showed that health care personnel and students used PDAs in patient care with varied frequency. Most of the users were physicians. There is some evidence that the use of a PDA in health care settings might improve decision-making, reduce the numbers of medical errors, and enhance learning for both students and professionals, but the evidence is not strong, with most studies being descriptive, and only 6 randomized controlled trials. Several special software programs have been created and tested for PDAs, and a wide range of situations for their use have been reported for different patient groups. Drug and medical information were commonly accessed by PDA users, and the PDA was often viewed as the preferred tool when compared to paper-based documents. Some users regarded the PDA easy to operate, while others found it difficult in the beginning. CONCLUSIONS: This overview of the use of PDAs revealed a positive attitude towards the PDA, which was regarded as a feasible and convenient tool. The possibility of immediate access to medical information has the potential to improve patient care. The PDA seems to be a valuable tool for personnel and students in health care, but there is a need for further intervention studies, randomized controlled trials, action research, and studies with various health care groups in order to identify its appropriate functions and software applications.",2008,10.2196/jmir.1038,10,4,e31,eng,1438-8871,"Language and Humans and Leadership and Learning and *Professional-Patient Relations and *Students and Computers, Handheld/standards and Delivery of Health Care/*standards and Health Personnel/*standards and Medical Informatics Computing/*standards and Medical Informatics/*standards and Peer Review and Periodicals as Topic/standards and Publishing/standards and Teaching/*standards",NA,NA,2008/10/28/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lin_2010_JoofmeInre,JOUR,The establishment of an ethical guideline for genetic testing through citizen consensus via the Internet in Taiwan,"Lin, Chiou-Fen and Lu, Meei-Shiow and Chung, Chun-Chih and Yang, Che-Ming",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: With the rapid advance of genetics, the application of genetic testing has become increasingly popular. Test results have had a tremendous impact on individuals who receive the test and his or her family. The ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genetic testing cannot be overlooked. The Internet is a potential tool for public engagement. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at establishing ethical guidelines for genetic testing in Taiwan through a participatory citizen consensus approach via the Internet. METHODS: The research method used was a citizen consensus conference modified by an Internet application and the Delphi technique. The citizen consensus conference is one of the public participation mechanisms. The draft ethical guidelines for genetic testing were written by an expert panel of 10. The Delphi technique was applied to a citizen panel recruited via the Internet until a consensus was reached. Our research population was restricted to people who had Internet access. RESULTS: Included in the citizen panel were 100 individuals. A total of 3 individuals dropped out of the process. The citizen panel was exposed to the issues through Internet learning and sharing. In all, 3 rounds of anonymous questionnaires were administered before a consensus was reached in terms of importance and feasibility. The result was ethical guidelines composed of 4 categories and 25 items. The 4 categories encompassed decision making (6 items), management of tissue samples (5 items), release of results (8 items), and information flow (6 items). On a scale of 1 to 10, the average (SD) importance score for the decision-making category was 9.41 (SD 0.58); for the management of tissue samples category, the average score was 9.62 (SD 0.49); for the release of results category, the average score was 9.34 (SD= 0.59); and for the information flow category, the average score was 9.6 (SD = 0.43). Exploratory analyses indicated that participants with higher education tended to attribute more importance to these guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting recommended ethical guidelines had 4 categories and 25 items. We hope through the implementation of these guidelines that mutual trust can be established between health care profession and the general public with respect to genetic tests.",2010,10.2196/jmir.1467,12,4,e47,eng,1438-8871,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Attitude to Health and Genetic Predisposition to Disease and Public Opinion and *Bioethical Issues and *Consensus and Community Participation/*statistics & numerical data and Genetic Counseling/ethics and Genetic Testing/*ethics/statistics & numerical data and Genetics, Medical/ethics and Health Services Needs and Demand/*ethics/statistics & numerical data and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and Taiwan",NA,NA,2010/10/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Frost_2011_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Patient-reported outcomes as a source of evidence in off-label prescribing: analysis of data from PatientsLikeMe,"Frost, Jeana and Okun, Sally and Vaughan, Timothy and Heywood, James and Wicks, Paul",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Evaluating a new use for an existing drug can be expensive and time consuming. Providers and patients must all too often rely upon their own individual-level experience to inform clinical practice, which generates only anecdotal and unstructured data. While academic-led clinical trials are occasionally conducted to test off-label uses of drugs with expired patents, this is relatively rare. In this work, we explored how a patient-centered online research platform could supplement traditional trials to create a richer understanding of medical products postmarket by efficiently aggregating structured patient-reported data. PatientsLikeMe is a tool for patients, researchers, and caregivers (currently 82,000 members across 11 condition-based communities) that helps users make treatment decisions, manage symptoms, and improve outcomes. Members enter demographic information, longitudinal treatment, symptoms, outcome data, and treatment evaluations. These are reflected back as longitudinal health profiles and aggregated reports. Over the last 3 years, patients have entered treatment histories and evaluations on thousands of medical products. These data may aid in evaluating the effectiveness and safety of some treatments more efficiently and over a longer period of time course than is feasible through traditional trials. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the illustrative cases of amitriptyline and modafinil - drugs commonly used off-label. METHODS: We analyzed patient-reported treatment histories and drug evaluations for each drug, examining prevalence, treatment purpose, and evaluations of effectiveness, side effects, and burden. RESULTS: There were 1948 treatment histories for modafinil and 1394 treatment reports for amitriptyline reported across five PatientsLikeMe communities (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, mood conditions, fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). In these reports, the majority of members reported taking the drug for off-label uses. Only 34 of the 1755 (1%) reporting purpose used modafinil for an approved purpose (narcolepsy or sleep apnea). Only 104 out of 1197 members (9%) reported taking amitriptyline for its approved indication, depression. Members taking amitriptyline for off-label purposes rated the drug as more effective than those who were taking it for its approved indication. While dry mouth is a commonly reported side effect of amitriptyline for most patients, 88 of 220 (40%) of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on the drug reported taking advantage of this side effect to treat their symptom of excess saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported outcomes, like those entered within PatientsLikeMe, offer a unique real-time approach to understand utilization and performance of treatments across many conditions. These patient-reported data can provide a new source of evidence about secondary uses and potentially identify targets for treatments to be studied systematically in traditional efficacy trials.",2011,10.2196/jmir.1643,13,1,e6,eng,1438-8871,"Humans and Internet and Treatment Outcome and Decision Making, Organizational and *Self Report and *Off-Label Use and *Patients and Amitriptyline/adverse effects/therapeutic use and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/drug therapy/metabolism and Benzhydryl Compounds/therapeutic use and Cognition Disorders/drug therapy and Community Networks/statistics & numerical data and Fatigue/drug therapy and Modafinil and Patient-Centered Care/organization & administration and Saliva/drug effects/metabolism and Sleep Stages/drug effects",NA,NA,2011/01/21/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We wished to examine the attitudes and opinions of pediatric users' toward the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system, a computer decision support system linked to an electronic health record in four community pediatric clinics. Surveys were administered in 2011 and 2012 to all users to measure CHICA's acceptability and users' satisfaction with it. Free text comments were analyzed for themes to understand areas of potential technical refinement. RESULTS: 70 participants completed the survey in 2011 (100% response rate) and 64 of 66 (97% response rate) in 2012. Initially, satisfaction with CHICA was mixed. In general, users felt the system held promise; however various critiques reflected difficulties understanding integrated technical aspects of how CHICA worked, as well as concern with the format and wording on generated forms for families and users. In the subsequent year, users' ratings reflected improved satisfaction and acceptance. Comments also reflected a deeper understanding of the system's logic, often accompanied by suggestions on potential refinements to make CHICA more useful at the point of care. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric users appreciate the system's automation and enhancements that allow relevant and meaningful clinical data to be accessible at point of care.

OBJECTIVE: Here we propose a low cost, fully automated method for continuous monitoring of adverse drug reactions in single drugs and in combinations thereof, and demonstrate the discovery of heretofore-unknown ones. METHODS: We used aggregated search data of large populations of Internet users to extract information related to drugs and adverse reactions to them, and correlated these data over time. We further extended our method to identify adverse reactions to combinations of drugs. RESULTS: We validated our method by showing high correlations of our findings with known adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, although acute early-onset drug reactions are more likely to be reported to regulatory agencies, we show that less acute later-onset ones are better captured in Web search queries.

Konovalov_2010_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Biomedical informatics techniques for processing and analyzing web blogs of military service members,"Konovalov, Sergiy and Scotch, Matthew and Post, Lori and Brandt, Cynthia",Journal of medical Internet research,"INTRODUCTION: Web logs (""blogs"") have become a popular mechanism for people to express their daily thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Many of these expressions contain health care-related themes, both physical and mental, similar to information discussed during a clinical interview or medical consultation. Thus, some of the information contained in blogs might be important for health care research, especially in mental health where stress-related conditions may be difficult and expensive to diagnose and where early recognition is often key to successful treatment. In the field of biomedical informatics, techniques such as information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) are often used to unlock information contained in free-text notes. These methods might assist the clinical research community to better understand feelings and emotions post deployment and the burden of symptoms of stress among US military service members. METHODS: In total, 90 military blog posts describing deployment situations and 60 control posts of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) were collected. After ""stop"" word exclusion and stemming, a ""bag-of-words"" representation and term weighting was performed, and the most relevant words were manually selected out of the high-weight words. A pilot ontology was created using Collaborative Protege, a knowledge management application. The word lists and the ontology were then used within General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE), an NLP framework, to create an automated pipeline for recognition and analysis of blogs related to combat exposure. An independent expert opinion was used to create a reference standard and evaluate the results of the GATE pipeline. RESULTS: The 2 dimensions of combat exposure descriptors identified were: words dealing with physical exposure and the soldiers' emotional reactions to it. GATE pipeline was able to retrieve blog texts describing combat exposure with precision 0.9, recall 0.75, and F-score 0.82.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups with 75 African-American youth from a city with high HIV/STI prevalence. Data analyses involved coding using qualitative content analysis procedures and memo writing. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, the majority of participants' design recommendations concerned trust. Youth expressed distrust towards people and groups, which was amplified within the context of information technology-mediated interactions about HIV/STI. Participants expressed distrust in the reliability of condoms and the accuracy of HIV tests. They questioned the benevolence of many institutions, and some rejected authoritative HIV/STI information. Therefore, reputational information, including rumor, influenced HIV/STI-related decision making. Participants' design requirements also focused on trust-related concerns. Accordingly, we developed a novel trust-centered design framework to guide intervention design. DISCUSSION: Current approaches to online trust for health informatics do not consider group-level trusting patterns. Yet, trust was the central intervention-relevant issue among African-American youth, suggesting an important focus for culturally informed design. Our design framework incorporates: intervention objectives (eg, network embeddedness, participation); functional specifications (eg, decision support, collective action, credible question and answer services); and interaction design (eg, member control, offline network linkages, optional anonymity).

Mark and Ross, Stephen E.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Older adults often have multiple chronic problems requiring them to manage complex medication regimens overseen by various clinicians. Personal health applications (PHAs) show promise assisting in medication self-management, but adoption of new computer technologies by this population is challenging. Optimizing the utility of PHAs requires a thorough understanding of older adults' needs, preferences, and practices. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to understand the medication self-management issues faced by older adults and caregivers that can be addressed by an electronic PHA. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis of a series of individual and group semistructured interviews with participants who were identified through purposive sampling. RESULTS: We interviewed 32 adult patients and 2 adult family caregivers. We identified 5 core themes regarding medication self-management challenges: seeking reliable medication information, maintaining autonomy in medication treatment decisions, worrying about taking too many medications, reconciling information discrepancies between allopathic and alternative medical therapies, and tracking and coordinating health information between multiple providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the latent concerns and challenges faced by older adults and caregivers in managing medications. The results suggest that PHAs should have the following features to accommodate the management strategies and information preferences of this population: (1) provide links to authoritative and reliable information on side effects, drug interactions, and other medication-related concerns in a way that is clear, concise, and easy to navigate, (2) facilitate communication between patients and doctors and pharmacists through electronic messaging and health information exchange, and (3) provide patients the ability to selectively disclose medication information to different clinicians.",2011,10.2196/jmir.1813,13,2,e44,eng,1438-8871,"Physicians and Communication and Disclosure and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Medical Informatics and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Anxiety and Electronic Mail and Aged, 80 and over and Health Personnel and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted and Personal Autonomy and Pharmacies and *Aging and *Caregivers and *Comorbidity and *Drug Therapy and *Patients/psychology and *Self Care and Complementary Therapies and Drug Interactions",NA,NA,2011/06/29/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Burns_2011_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Harnessing context sensing to develop a mobile intervention for depression,"Burns, Michelle Nicole and Begale, Mark and Duffecy, Jennifer and Gergle, Darren and Karr, Chris J. and Giangrande, Emily and Mohr, David C.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing. METHODS: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients' mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients' self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (b(week) = -.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (beta(week) = -.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.

Mitchell_2011_JoofmeInre,JOUR,A pilot study of motivational interviewing training in a virtual world,"Mitchell, Suzanne and Heyden, Robin and Heyden, Neil and Schroy, Paul and Andrew, Stephen and Sadikova, Ekaterina and Wiecha, John",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based, patient-centered counseling strategy proven to support patients seeking health behavior change. Yet the time and travel commitment for MI training is often a barrier to the adoption of MI by health care professionals. Virtual worlds such as Second Life (SL) are rapidly becoming part of the educational technology landscape and offer not only the potential to improve access to MI training but also to deepen the MI training experience through the use of immersive online environments. Despite SL's potential for medical education applications, little work is published studying its use for this purpose and still less is known of educational outcomes for physician training in MI using a virtual-world platform. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to (1) explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a virtual-world platform for delivering MI training designed for physicians and (2) pilot test instructional designs using SL for MI training. METHODS: We designed and pilot tested an MI training program in the SL virtual world. We trained and enrolled 13 primary care physicians in a two-session, interactive program in SL on the use of MI for counseling patients about colorectal cancer screening. We measured self-reported changes in confidence and clinical practice patterns for counseling on colorectal cancer screening, and acceptability of the virtual-world learning environment and the MI instructional design. Effectiveness of the MI training was assessed by coding and scoring tape-recorded interviews with a blinded mock patient conducted pre- and post-training. RESULTS: A total of 13 physicians completed the training. Acceptability ratings for the MI training ranged from 4.1 to 4.7 on a 5-point scale. The SL learning environment was also highly rated, with 77% (n = 10) of the doctors reporting SL to be an effective educational medium. Learners' confidence and clinical practice patterns for colorectal cancer screening improved after training. Pre- to post-training mean confidence scores for the ability to elicit and address barriers to colorectal cancer screening (4.5 to 6.2, P = .004) and knowledge of decision-making psychology (4.5 to 5.7, P = .02) and behavior change psychology (4.9 to 6.2, P = .02) increased significantly. Global MI skills scores increased significantly and component scores for the MI skills also increased, with statistically significant improvements in 4 of the 5 component skills: empathy (3.12 to 3.85, P = .001), autonomy (3.07 to 3.85, P < .001), collaboration (2.88 to 3.46, P = .02), and evocative response (2.80 to 3.61, P = .008).

Better understanding of patient and public attitudes and the factors that influence overall levels of support toward EHRs is needed to inform policy. OBJECTIVE: To explore patient and public attitudes toward integrated EHRs used simultaneously for health care provision, planning and policy, and health research. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey administered to patients and members of the public who were recruited from a stratified cluster random sample of 8 outpatient clinics of a major teaching hospital and 8 general practices in London (United Kingdom). RESULTS: 5331 patients and members of the public responded to the survey, with 2857 providing complete data for the analysis presented here. There were moderately high levels of support for integrated EHRs used simultaneously for health care provision, planning and policy, and health research (1785/2857, 62.47%), while 27.93% (798/2857) of participants reported being undecided about whether or not they would support EHR use. There were higher levels of support for specific uses of EHRs. Most participants were in favor of EHRs for personal health care provision (2563/2857, 89.71%), with 66.75% (1907/2857) stating that they would prefer their complete, rather than limited, medical history to be included. Of those ""undecided"" about integrated EHRs, 87.2% (696/798) were nevertheless in favor of sharing their full (373/798, 46.7%) or limited (323/798, 40.5%) records for health provision purposes. There were similar high levels of support for use of EHRs in health services policy and planning (2274/2857, 79.59%) and research (2325/2857, 81.38%), although 59.75% (1707/2857) and 67.10% (1917/2857) of respondents respectively would prefer their personal identifiers to be removed. Multivariable analysis showed levels of overall support for EHRs decreasing with age. Respondents self-identifying as Black British were more likely to report being undecided or unsupportive of national EHRs. Frequent health services users were more likely to report being supportive than undecided. CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous difficulties with National Health Service (NHS) technology projects, patients and the public generally support the development of integrated EHRs for health care provision, planning and policy, and health research. This support, however, varies between social groups and is not unqualified; relevant safeguards must be in place and patients should be guided in their decision-making process, including increased awareness about the benefits of EHRs for secondary uses.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2701,15,8,e160,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Humans and Data Collection and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and electronic health records and Attitude and United Kingdom and health care delivery and policy and *Medical Records Systems, Computerized and *Public Sector and patient attitudes and Patients/*psychology and research",NA,NA,2013/08/23/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Heselmans_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Human computation as a new method for evidence-based knowledge transfer in Web-based guideline development groups: proof of concept randomized controlled trial,"Heselmans, Annemie and Aertgeerts, Bert and Donceel, Peter and Van de Velde, Stijn and Vanbrabant, Peter and Ramaekers, Dirk",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Guideline developers use different consensus methods to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Previous research suggests that existing guideline development techniques are subject to methodological problems and are logistically demanding. Guideline developers welcome new methods that facilitate a methodologically sound decision-making process. Systems that aggregate knowledge while participants play a game are one class of human computation applications. Researchers have already proven that these games with a purpose are effective in building common sense knowledge databases. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a new consensus method based on human computation techniques compared to an informal face-to-face consensus method. METHODS: We set up a randomized design to study 2 different methods for guideline development within a group of advanced students completing a master of nursing and obstetrics. Students who participated in the trial were enrolled in an evidence-based health care course. We compared the Web-based method of human-based computation (HC) with an informal face-to-face consensus method (IC). We used 4 clinical scenarios of lower back pain as the subject of the consensus process. These scenarios concerned the following topics: (1) medical imaging, (2) therapeutic options, (3) drugs use, and (4) sick leave. Outcomes were expressed as the amount of group (dis)agreement and the concordance of answers with clinical evidence. We estimated within-group and between-group effect sizes by calculating Cohen's d. We calculated within-group effect sizes as the absolute difference between the outcome value at round 3 and the baseline outcome value, divided by the pooled standard deviation. We calculated between-group effect sizes as the absolute difference between the mean change in outcome value across rounds in HC and the mean change in outcome value across rounds in IC, divided by the pooled standard deviation. We analyzed statistical significance of within-group changes between round 1 and round 3 using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. We assessed the differences between the HC and IC groups using Mann-Whitney U tests. We used a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .025 in all statistical tests. We performed a thematic analysis to explore participants' arguments during group discussion. Participants completed a satisfaction survey at the end of the consensus process. RESULTS: Of the 135 students completing a master of nursing and obstetrics, 120 participated in the experiment. We formed 8 HC groups (n=64) and 7 IC groups (n=56). The between-group comparison demonstrated that the human computation groups obtained a greater improvement in evidence scores compared to the IC groups, although the difference was not statistically significant. The between-group effect size was 0.56 (P=.30) for the medical imaging scenario, 0.07 (P=.97) for the therapeutic options scenario, and 0.89 (P=.11) for the drug use scenario. We found no significant differences in improvement in the degree of agreement between HC and IC groups. Between-group comparisons revealed that the HC groups showed greater improvement in degree of agreement for the medical imaging scenario (d=0.46, P=.37) and the drug use scenario (d=0.31, P=.59). Very few evidence arguments (6%) were quoted during informal group discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of the IC method was appropriate as long as the evidence supported participants' beliefs or usual practice, or when the availability of the evidence was sparse. However, when some controversy about the evidence existed, the HC method outperformed the IC method. The findings of our study illustrate the importance of the choice of the consensus method in guideline development. Human computation could be an acceptable methodology for guideline development specifically for scenarios in which the evidence shows no resonance with participants' beliefs. Future research is needed to confirm the results of this study and to establish practical significance in a controlled setting of multidisciplinary guideline panels during real-life guideline development.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2055,15,1,e8,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Universities and *Internet and Belgium and Telemedicine/*methods and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Knowledge Bases and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Education, Nursing, Graduate/methods and Low Back Pain/diagnosis/nursing/therapy",NA,NA,2013/01/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jimbo_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Perceived barriers and facilitators of using a Web-based interactive decision aid for colorectal cancer screening in community practice settings: findings from focus groups with primary care clinicians and medical office staff,"Jimbo, Masahito and Shultz, Cameron Garth and Nease, Donald Eugene and Fetters, Michael Derwin and Power, Debra and Ruffin, Mack Thomas 4th",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Information is lacking about the capacity of those working in community practice settings to utilize health information technology for colorectal cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap we asked those working in community practice settings to share their perspectives about how the implementation of a Web-based patient-led decision aid might affect patient-clinician conversations about colorectal cancer screening and the day-to-day clinical workflow. METHODS: Five focus groups in five community practice settings were conducted with 8 physicians, 1 physician assistant, and 18 clinic staff. Focus groups were organized using a semistructured discussion guide designed to identify factors that mediate and impede the use of a Web-based decision aid intended to clarify patient preferences for colorectal cancer screening and to trigger shared decision making during the clinical encounter. RESULTS: All physicians, the physician assistant, and 8 of the 18 clinic staff were active participants in the focus groups. Clinician and staff participants from each setting reported a belief that the Web-based patient-led decision aid could be an informative and educational tool; in all but one setting participants reported a readiness to recommend the tool to patients. The exception related to clinicians from one clinic who described a preference for patients having fewer screening choices, noting that a colonoscopy was the preferred screening modality for patients in their clinic. Perceived barriers to utilizing the Web-based decision aid included patients' lack of Internet access or low computer literacy, and potential impediments to the clinics' daily workflow. Expanding patients' use of an online decision aid that is both easy to access and understand and that is utilized by patients outside of the office visit was described as a potentially efficient means for soliciting patients' screening preferences. Participants described that a system to link the online decision aid to a computerized reminder system could promote a better understanding of patients' screening preferences, though some expressed concern that such a system could be difficult to keep up and running. CONCLUSIONS: Community practice clinicians and staff perceived the Web-based decision aid technology as promising but raised questions as to how the technology and resultant information would be integrated into their daily practice workflow. Additional research investigating how to best implement online decision aids should be conducted prior to the widespread adoption of such technology so as to maximize the benefits of the technology while minimizing workflow disruptions.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2914,15,12,e286,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care and Aged and Telemedicine and Decision Making and Patient Participation and health information technology and Focus Groups and focus groups and Community Health Centers and *Internet and *Decision Support Techniques and cancer screening and colonoscopy and colon cancer and Colorectal Neoplasms/*prevention & control and decision support techniques and early detection of cancer and Mass Screening/*methods/psychology/statistics & numerical data and reminder systems,NA,NA,2013/12/18/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mulvaney_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Assessing adolescent asthma symptoms and adherence using mobile phones,"Mulvaney, Shelagh A. and Ho, Yun-Xian and Cala, Cather M. and Chen, Qingxia and Nian, Hui and Patterson, Barron L. and Johnson, Kevin B.",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Self-report is the most common method of measuring medication adherence but is influenced by recall error and response bias, and it typically does not provide insight into the causes of poor adherence. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of health behaviors using mobile phones offers a promising alternative to assessing adherence and collecting related data that can be clinically useful for adherence problem solving. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of using EMA via mobile phones to assess adolescent asthma medication adherence and identify contextual characteristics of adherence decision making. METHODS: We utilized a descriptive and correlational study design to explore a mobile method of symptom and adherence assessment using an interactive voice response system. Adolescents aged 12-18 years with a diagnosis of asthma and prescribed inhalers were recruited from an academic medical center. A survey including barriers to mobile phone use, the Illness Management Survey, and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire were administered at baseline. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of asthma symptoms and adherence were conducted with daily calls to mobile phones for 1 month. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) was administered at 2 study time points: baseline and 1 month after baseline. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 53 adolescents who were primarily African American (34/53, 64%) and female (31/53, 58%) with incomes US$40K/year or lower (29/53, 55%). The majority of adolescents (37/53, 70%) reported that they carried their phones with them everywhere, but only 47% (25/53) were able to use their mobile phone at school. Adolescents responded to an average of 20.1 (SD 8.1) of the 30 daily calls received (67%). Response frequency declined during the last week of the month (b=-0.29, P<.001) and was related to EMA-reported levels of rescue inhaler adherence (r= 0.33, P=.035). Using EMA, adolescents reported an average of 0.63 (SD 1.2) asthma symptoms per day and used a rescue inhaler an average of 70% of the time (SD 35%) when they experienced symptoms. About half (26/49, 53%) of the instances of nonadherence took place in the presence of friends. The EMA-measured adherence to rescue inhaler use correlated appropriately with asthma control as measured by the ACT (r=-0.33, P=.034). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phones provided a feasible method to assess asthma symptoms and adherence in adolescents. The EMA method was consistent with the ACT, a widely established measure of asthma control, and results provided valuable insights regarding the context of adherence decision making that could be used clinically for problem solving or as feedback to adolescents in a mobile or Web-based support system.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2413,15,7,e141,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and assessment and asthma and adolescent and *Cell Phone and *Patient Compliance and mobile technology and adherence and Anti-Asthmatic Agents/*therapeutic use and Asthma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology,NA,NA,2013/07/17/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Huerta_2014_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Hospital website rankings in the United States: expanding benchmarks and standards for effective consumer engagement,"Huerta, Timothy R. and Hefner, Jennifer L. and Ford, Eric W. and McAlearney, Ann Scheck and Menachemi, Nir",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the roles hospitals and health systems play in care delivery and led to a wave of consolidation of medical groups and hospitals. As such, the traditional patient interaction with an independent medical provider is becoming far less common, replaced by frequent interactions with integrated medical groups and health systems. It is thus increasingly important for these organizations to have an effective social media presence. Moreover, in the age of the informed consumer, patients desire a readily accessible, electronic interface to initiate contact, making a well-designed website and social media strategy critical features of the modern health care organization. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the Web presence of hospitals and their health systems on five dimensions: accessibility, content, marketing, technology, and usability. In addition, an overall ranking was calculated to identify the top 100 hospital and health system websites. METHODS: A total of 2407 unique Web domains covering 2785 hospital facilities or their parent organizations were identified and matched against the 2009 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey. This is a four-fold improvement in prior research and represents what the authors believe to be a census assessment of the online presence of US hospitals and their health systems. Each of the five dimensions was investigated with an automated content analysis using a suite of tools. Scores on the dimensions are reported on a range from 0 to 10, with a higher score on any given dimension representing better comparative performance. Rankings on each dimension and an average ranking are provided for the top 100 hospitals. RESULTS: The mean score on the usability dimension, meant to rate overall website quality, was 5.16 (SD 1.43), with the highest score of 8 shared by only 5 hospitals. Mean scores on other dimensions were between 4.43 (SD 2.19) and 6.49 (SD 0.96). Based on these scores, rank order calculations for the top 100 websites are presented. Additionally, a link to raw data, including AHA ID, is provided to enable researchers and practitioners the ability to further explore relationships to other dynamics in health care. CONCLUSIONS: This census assessment of US hospitals and their health systems provides a clear indication of the state of the sector. While stakeholder engagement is core to most discussions of the role that hospitals must play in relation to communities, management of an online presence has not been recognized as a core competency fundamental to care delivery. Yet, social media management and network engagement are skills that exist at the confluence of marketing and technical prowess.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the sources of health information used by persons with MS, their preferences for the source of health information, and levels of trust in those information sources. We also aimed to evaluate how these findings varied according to participant characteristics. METHODS: In 2011, participants in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry were asked about their sources of health information using selected questions adapted from the 2007 Health Information National Trends (HINTS) survey. RESULTS: Of 12,974 eligible participants, 66.18% (8586/12,974) completed the questionnaire. Mass media sources, rather than interpersonal information sources, were the first sources used by 83.22% (5953/7153) of participants for general health topics and by 68.31% (5026/7357) of participants for MS concerns. Specifically, the Internet was the first source of health information for general health issues (5332/7267, 73.40%) and MS (4369/7376, 59.23%). In a logistic regression model, younger age, less disability, and higher annual income were independently associated with increased odds of use of mass media rather than interpersonal sources of information first. The most trusted information source was a physician, with 97.94% (8318/8493) reporting that they trusted a physician some or a lot. Information sought included treatment for MS (4470/5663, 78.93%), general information about MS (3378/5405, 62.50%), paying for medical care (1096/4282, 25.59%), where to get medical care (787/4282, 18.38%), and supports for coping with MS (2775/5031, 55.16%). Nearly 40% (2998/7521) of participants had concerns about the quality of the information they gathered.

The evolution of information technology has resulted in telehealth becoming a fourth-generation synchronous program. However, long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis of fourth-generation telehealth programs have not been reported in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to assess the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program for patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 575 patients who had joined a telehealth program and compared them with 1178 patients matched for sex, age, and Charlson comorbidity index. The program included: (1) instant transmission of biometric data, (2) daily telephone interview, and (3) continuous decision-making support. Data on hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and medical costs were collected from the hospital's database and were adjusted to the follow-up months. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.5 years (SD 16.0). The mean number of monthly ED visits (mean 0.06 SD 0.13 vs mean 0.09 SD 0.23, P<.001), hospitalizations (mean 0.05 SD 0.12 vs mean 0.11 SD 0.21, P<.001), length of hospitalization (mean 0.77 days SD 2.78 vs mean 1.4 SD 3.6, P<.001), and intensive care unit admissions (mean 0.01 SD 0.07 vs mean 0.036 SD 0.14, P<.001) were lower in the telehealth group. The monthly mean costs of ED visits (mean US$20.90 SD 66.60 vs mean US$37.30 SD 126.20, P<.001), hospitalizations (mean US$386.30 SD 1424.30 vs mean US$878.20 SD 2697.20, P<.001), and all medical costs (mean US$587.60 SD 1497.80 vs mean US$1163.60 SD 3036.60, P<.001) were lower in the telehealth group. The intervention costs per patient were US$224.80 per month. Multivariate analyses revealed that age, telehealth care, and Charlson index were the independent factors for ED visits, hospitalizations, and length of hospitalization. A bootstrap method revealed the dominant cost-effectiveness of telehealth care over usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Better cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes were noted with the use of a fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases.

Archambault_2011_JoofmeInre,JOUR,WikiBuild: a new application to support patient and health care professional involvement in the development of patient support tools,"Archambault, Patrick Michel",Journal of medical Internet research,"Active patient and public involvement as partners in their own health care and in the development of health services is key to achieving a health care system that is responsive to patients' needs and values. It promotes better use of the health care system, and improves health outcomes, quality of life and patient satisfaction. By involving patients and health care professionals as partners in the creation and updating of patient health support tools, wikis--highly accessible, interactive vehicles of communication--have the potential to empower users to implement these support tools in daily life. Acknowledging the potential of wikis, and recognizing that they capitalize on the free and open access to information, scientists, opinion leaders and patient advocates have suggested that wikis could help decision-making constituencies improve the delivery of health care. They might also decrease its cost and improve access to knowledge within developing countries. However, little is known about the efficacy of wikis in helping to attain these goals. There is also a need to know more about the intention of patients and health care workers to use wikis, in what circumstances and what factors will influence their use of wikis. In this issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research, Gupta et al describe how they developed and tested a new wiki-inspired application to improve asthma care. The researchers involved patients with asthma, primary care physicians, pulmonologists and certified asthma educators in the construction of an asthma action plan. Their paper--entitled ""WikiBuild: a new online collaboration process for multistakeholder tool development and consensus building""--is the first description of a wiki-inspired technology built to involve patients and health care professionals in the development of a patient support tool. This innovative study has made important contributions toward how wikis could be generalized to involve multiple stakeholders in the development of other knowledge translation tools such as clinical practice guidelines or decision aids. More specifically, Gupta et al have uncovered potential action mechanisms toward increasing usage of these tools by patients and health care professionals. These are decreasing hierarchical influences, increasing usability and adapting a tool to local context. More research is now needed to determine if the use of the resulting wiki-developed plan will actually be higher than a plan developed using other methods. Furthermore, there is also a need to assess the intention of participants to continue using wiki-based processes on an ongoing basis. It is in this dynamic and continuous retroaction loop that the support tool users--both patients and health care professionals--can adapt and improve the product after its real-life shortcomings are revealed and as new evidence becomes available. As such, a wiki would be more than a simple patient support development tool, but could also become a dynamic and interactive repository and delivery tool that would facilitate ongoing and sustainable patient and professional engagement.",2011,10.2196/jmir.1961,13,4,e114,eng,1438-8871,Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Cooperative Behavior and Internet and Patient Participation and Self Care and Patient Education as Topic and Health Personnel and *Telemedicine and Asthma/therapy,NA,NA,2011/12/08/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhai_2013_JoofmeInre,JOUR,Web 2.0-based crowdsourcing for high-quality gold standard development in clinical natural language processing,"Zhai, Haijun and Lingren, Todd and Deleger, Louise and Li, Qi and Kaiser, Megan and Stoutenborough, Laura and Solti, Imre",Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: A high-quality gold standard is vital for supervised, machine learning-based, clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems. In clinical NLP projects, expert annotators traditionally create the gold standard. However, traditional annotation is expensive and time-consuming. To reduce the cost of annotation, general NLP projects have turned to crowdsourcing based on Web 2.0 technology, which involves submitting smaller subtasks to a coordinated marketplace of workers on the Internet. Many studies have been conducted in the area of crowdsourcing, but only a few have focused on tasks in the general NLP field and only a handful in the biomedical domain, usually based upon very small pilot sample sizes. In addition, the quality of the crowdsourced biomedical NLP corpora were never exceptional when compared to traditionally-developed gold standards. The previously reported results on medical named entity annotation task showed a 0.68 F-measure based agreement between crowdsourced and traditionally-developed corpora. OBJECTIVE: Building upon previous work from the general crowdsourcing research, this study investigated the usability of crowdsourcing in the clinical NLP domain with special emphasis on achieving high agreement between crowdsourced and traditionally-developed corpora. METHODS: To build the gold standard for evaluating the crowdsourcing workers' performance, 1042 clinical trial announcements (CTAs) from the ClinicalTrials.gov website were randomly selected and double annotated for medication names, medication types, and linked attributes. For the experiments, we used CrowdFlower, an Amazon Mechanical Turk-based crowdsourcing platform. We calculated sensitivity, precision, and F-measure to evaluate the quality of the crowd's work and tested the statistical significance (P<.001, chi-square test) to detect differences between the crowdsourced and traditionally-developed annotations. RESULTS: The agreement between the crowd's annotations and the traditionally-generated corpora was high for: (1) annotations (0.87, F-measure for medication names; 0.73, medication types), (2) correction of previous annotations (0.90, medication names; 0.76, medication types), and excellent for (3) linking medications with their attributes (0.96). Simple voting provided the best judgment aggregation approach. There was no statistically significant difference between the crowd and traditionally-generated corpora. Our results showed a 27.9% improvement over previously reported results on medication named entity annotation task. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers three contributions. First, we proved that crowdsourcing is a feasible, inexpensive, fast, and practical approach to collect high-quality annotations for clinical text (when protected health information was excluded). We believe that well-designed user interfaces and rigorous quality control strategy for entity annotation and linking were critical to the success of this work. Second, as a further contribution to the Internet-based crowdsourcing field, we will publicly release the JavaScript and CrowdFlower Markup Language infrastructure code that is necessary to utilize CrowdFlower's quality control and crowdsourcing interfaces for named entity annotations. Finally, to spur future research, we will release the CTA annotations that were generated by traditional and crowdsourced approaches.",2013,10.2196/jmir.2426,15,4,e73,eng,1438-8871 1439-4456,Humans and Internet and Pilot Projects and *Natural Language Processing and Quality Control and *Social Media and Telemedicine/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data and Crowdsourcing/*standards/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2013/04/02/,J Med Internet Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
