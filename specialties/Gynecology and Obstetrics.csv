R. and Zarins, Christopher and Kusnezov, Dimitri and Howard, Donna and Oden, Tinsley",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"Medicine is, in its essence, decision making under uncertainty; the decisions are made about tests to be performed and treatments to be administered. Traditionally, the uncertainty in decision making was handled using expertise collected by individual providers and, more recently, systematic appraisal of research in the form of evidence-based medicine. The traditional approach has been used successfully in medicine for a very long time. However, it has substantial limitations because of the complexity of the system of the human body and healthcare. The complex systems are a network of highly coupled components intensely interacting with each other. These interactions give those systems redundancy and thus robustness to failure and, at the same time, equifinality, that is, many different causative pathways leading to the same outcome. The equifinality of the complex systems of the human body and healthcare system demand the individualization of medical care, medicine, and medical decision making. Computational models excel in modeling complex systems and, consequently, enabling individualization of medical decision making and medicine. Computational models are theory- or knowledge-based models, data-driven models, or models that combine both approaches. Data are essential, although to a different degree, for computational models to successfully represent complex systems. The individualized decision making, made possible by the computational modeling of complex systems, has the potential to revolutionize the entire spectrum of medicine from individual patient care to policymaking. This approach allows applying tests and treatments to individuals who receive a net benefit from them, for whom benefits outweigh the risk, rather than treating all individuals in a population because, on average, the population benefits. Thus, the computational modeling-enabled individualization of medical decision making has the potential to both improve health outcomes and decrease the costs of healthcare.",2021,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.08.057,224,1,16-34,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"machine learning and Humans and uncertainty and modeling and data and *Models, Theoretical and data-driven models and computation and *Computational Biology and *Gynecology and *Obstetrics and physics-based models and theory-based models",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a gap in practitioner-relevant guides to interpret and critique such research. OBJECTIVE: This guide is an introduction to interpreting research using observational data and provides explanations and context for related terminology. In addition, it serves as a guide for critiquing OB/GYN studies that use observational data by outlining how to assess common pitfalls of experimental and observational study designs. Lastly, the piece provides a compendium of observational data resources commonly used within OB/GYN research. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Review of literature was conducted for the collection of definitions and examples of terminology related to observational data research. Data resources were collected via Web search and researcher recommendations. Next, each data resource was reviewed and analyzed for content and accessibility. Contents of data resources were organized into summary tables and matched to relevant literature examples.

Factors driving this change include the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, improved methods of testing for fetal well-being, increasing litigation risk, and changes in resident duty hour guidelines. The contemporary obstetric triage facility must have processes in place to provide a medical screening examination that complies with regulatory statues while considering both the facility's maternal level of care and available resources. OBJECTIVE: This review examines the history of the development of obstetric triage, current considerations in a contemporary obstetric triage paradigm, and future areas for consideration. An example of a contemporary obstetric triage program at an academic medical center is presented. RESULT: A successful contemporary obstetric triage paradigm is one that addresses the questions of ""sick or not sick"" and ""labor or no labor,"" for every obstetric patient that presents for care. Failure to do so risks poor patient outcome, poor patient satisfaction, adverse litigation outcome, regulatory scrutiny, and exclusion from federal payment programs. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the role of contemporary obstetric triage in the current health care environment is important for both providers and health care leadership. TARGET AUDIENCE: This study is for obstetricians and gynecologists as well as family physicians.

Their potential impact is particularly germane to the biology of pregnancy and perinatal medicine, where limited improvement in health outcomes for women and children has remained a global challenge. We assembled a group of experts to establish a Pregnancy Think Tank to discuss a broad spectrum of major gestational disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes that affect maternal-infant lifelong health and should serve as targets for leveraging the many recent advances. This report reflects avenues for future effects that hold great potential in 3 major areas: developmental genomics, including the application of methodologies designed to bridge genotypes, physiology, and diseases, addressing vexing questions in early human development; gestational physiology, from immune tolerance to growth and the timing of parturition; and personalized and population medicine, focusing on amalgamating health record data and deep phenotypes to create broad knowledge that can be integrated into healthcare systems and drive discovery to address pregnancy-related disease and promote general health. We propose a series of questions reflecting development, systems biology, diseases, clinical approaches and tools, and population health, and a call for scientific action. Clearly, transdisciplinary science must advance and accelerate to address adverse pregnancy outcomes. Disciplines not traditionally involved in the reproductive sciences, such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and pharmacology, should be engaged at the study design phase to optimize the information gathered and to identify and further evaluate potentially actionable therapeutic targets. Information sources should include noninvasive personalized sensors and monitors, alongside instructive ""liquid biopsies"" for noninvasive pregnancy assessment. Future research should also address the diversity of human cohorts in terms of geography, racial and ethnic distributions, and social and health disparities.

The vulnerability of parturients and fetuses during the delivery process led to the development of intrapartum monitoring methods and to the emergence of alternative methods of delivery. However, current monitoring methods fail to accurately discriminate between cases in which intervention is unnecessary, partly contributing to the high rates of cesarean deliveries worldwide. Machine learning methods are applied in various medical fields to create personalized prediction models. These methods are used to analyze abundant, complex data with intricate associations to aid in decision making. Initial attempts to predict vaginal delivery vs cesarean deliveries using machine learning tools did not utilize the vast amount of data recorded during labor. The data recorded during labor represent the dynamic process of labor and therefore may be invaluable for dynamic prediction of vaginal delivery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create a personalized machine learning-based prediction model to predict successful vaginal deliveries using real-time data acquired during the first stage of labor. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic medical records of labor occurring during a 12-year period in a tertiary referral center were explored and labeled. Four different models were created using input from multiple maternal and fetal parameters. Initial risk assessments for vaginal delivery were calculated using data available at the time of admission to the delivery unit, followed by models incorporating cervical examination data and fetal heart rate data, and finally, a model that integrates additional data available during the first stage of labor was created. RESULTS: A total of 94,480 cases in which a trial of labor was attempted were identified. Based on approximately 180 million data points from the first stage of labor, machine learning models were developed to predict successful vaginal deliveries. A model using data available at the time of admission to the delivery unit yielded an area under the curve of 0.817 (95% confidence interval, 0.811-0.823). Models that used real-time data increased prediction accuracy. A model that includes real-time cervical examination data had an initial area under the curve of 0.819 (95% confidence interval, 0.813-0.825) at first examination, which increased to an area under the curve of 0.917 (95% confidence interval, 0.913-0.921) by the end of the first stage. Adding the real-time fetal heart monitor data provided an area under the curve of 0.824 (95% confidence interval, 0.818-0.830) at first examination, which increased to an area under the curve of 0.928 (95% confidence interval, 0.924-0.932) by the end of the first stage. Finally, adding additional real-time data increased the area under the curve initially to 0.833 (95% confidence interval, 0.827-0.838) at the first cervical examination and up to 0.932 (95% confidence interval, 0.928-0.935) by the end of the first stage. CONCLUSION: Real-time data acquired throughout the process of labor significantly increased the prediction accuracy for vaginal delivery using machine learning models.

However, several professional organizations support the notion that health care providers should no longer recommend that asymptomatic patients receive a yearly pelvic examination. At minimum, health care providers must respect patients' autonomy in decision making around this examination and initiate a joint discussion about whether to proceed with a pelvic examination. Shared decision making is a model used in other aspects of medicine that can aid such discussions. This model recognizes two experts in these clinical encounters-the health care provider is the expert regarding medical information and the patient is the expert regarding their values, preferences, and lived experiences. When shared decision making is used, not only is each expert valued for their knowledge, but the power differential shifts to a shared power model.

Only those who entered more than 10 cycles in 2 years were included. Generalized estimation equations were used to adjust for confounding factors and for within-person correlations of multiple records. Multiple regression analysis was conducted, with age, external average temperature, precipitation amount, and sunshine hours as confounding factors. RESULTS: The mean menstrual cycle length increased from age 15-23 years, subsequently decreased up to age 45 years, and then increased again.

This article provides the obstetrician with an algorithm to guide professionally responsible decision making with these patients. We searched for articles related to the intrapartum management of pregnant patients with major mental disorders, using 3 main search components: pregnancy, chronic mental illness, and ethics. No articles were found that addressed the clinical ethical challenges of decision making during the intrapartum period with these patients. We therefore developed an ethical framework with 4 components: the concept of the fetus as a patient; the presumption of decision-making capacity; the concept of assent; and beneficence-based clinical judgment. On the basis of this framework we propose an algorithm to guide professionally responsible decision making that asks 5 questions: (1) Does the patient have the capacity to consent to treatment?; (2) Is there time to attempt restoration of capacity?; (3) Is there an opportunity for substituted judgment?; (4) Is the patient accepting treatment?; (5) Is there an opportunity for active assent?; and (6) coerced clinical management as the least worst alternative.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide database, the 2007-2014 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental Databases (Truven Health Analytics), which contain deidentified health care claims data from approximately 150 employer-based insurance plans across the United States. We included women aged 18-84 years and used Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify surgeries for SUI and POP. We identified index procedures for SUI or POP after at least 3 years of continuous enrollment without a prior procedure. We defined three groups of women based on the index procedure: 1) SUI surgery only; 2) POP surgery only; and 3) Both SUI+POP surgery.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign disease by TVH, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), and robotic hysterectomy (RH) between Jan. 1, 2007, and April 30, 2010, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The hospital decision support database was used to calculate net hospital income. A subset of patients with at least 1 prior vaginal delivery, no more than 1 laparotomy, and a uterine size less than 14 weeks who had undergone RH, TLH, or LAVH was identified as potential TVH candidates. The financial impact of performing TVH over the selected hysterectomy was calculated. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-four cases of minimally invasive hysterectomy were identified. Fifty-five percent were TVH, 33% LAVH, 3% TLH, and 9% RH. Mean total hospital costs for TVH were $7903, $10,069 for LAVH, $11,558 for TLH, and $13,429 for RH (P < .0001). Net hospital income was $1260 for TVH. The hospital incurred losses of $-1306 for LAVH, $-4049 for TLH, and $-4564 for RH (P = .03).

METHODS: Predictive models were constructed and compared using data from 10 of 12 sites in the U.S. Consortium for Safe Labor Study (2002-2008) that consistently reported estimated blood loss at delivery. The outcome was postpartum hemorrhage, defined as an estimated blood loss at least 1,000 mL. Fifty-five candidate risk factors routinely available on labor admission were considered. We used logistic regression with and without lasso regularization (lasso regression) as the two statistical models, and random forest and extreme gradient boosting as the two machine learning models to predict postpartum hemorrhage. Model performance was measured by C statistics (ie, concordance index), calibration, and decision curves. Models were constructed from the first phase (2002-2006) and externally validated (ie, temporally) in the second phase (2007-2008). Further validation was performed combining both temporal and site-specific validation. RESULTS: Of the 152,279 assessed births, 7,279 (4.8%, 95% CI 4.7-4.9) had postpartum hemorrhage. All models had good-to-excellent discrimination. The extreme gradient boosting model had the best discriminative ability to predict postpartum hemorrhage (C statistic: 0.93; 95% CI 0.92-0.93), followed by random forest (C statistic: 0.92; 95% CI 0.91-0.92).

Twenty-week bans have salient implications for women's health, quality of care, and access to services, particularly in the context of the delivery of prenatal care. Because of the timeline of the initiation of prenatal care and assessments of fetal genetic and anatomic anomalies, patients may increasingly find themselves at or near the 20-week postfertilization gestational threshold when they have insufficient information to decide about continuing or ending the pregnancy. This law thus leaves women and families with limited time to obtain a genetic or anatomic diagnosis, restricts access to abortion care at a crucial decision-making time in the pregnancy, and has significant implications for the patient-physician relationship. This law also has ramifications for women and health care providers outside of Ohio, because patients who have made the choice to end a pregnancy will have to cross state lines for abortion care.

METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study (2011-2017). In their native language, patients were consented and queried regarding country of origin and time in the United States. Additional variables were collected or abstracted from the medical record, including documentation and timing of prenatal visits. Based on relevance and prevalence during the study period, publicly available Google search trends were mined for the terms ""Make America Great Again,"" ""Mexico Wall,"" and ""Deportation"" by geographic region. The time of first deviation from the mode Google search popularity value for each term was ascertained (mode inflection date).

METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study of clinically stable women seeking surgical, medical, or expectant miscarriage treatment. Women with first-trimester fetal demise or anembryonic gestation (N=55) completed demographic and psychosocial surveys. Using purposive sampling, 45 (82%) completed in-depth interviews. Fifteen obstetricians were interviewed. Participants described factors that informed their counseling (physicians) or decision-making (patients). Content analysis used an integrated approach with inductively and deductively derived codes. Patient-derived themes were stratified by treatment choice. Associations between variables and treatment choices were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-four women (62%) received surgical management, 19 (35%) received medical, and two (4%) received expectant. Physicians expected that women with prior pregnancies have strong management preferences, and indeed, multigravid patients were less likely to change their initial treatment choice after counseling than primigravid patients (12% compared with 42%, odds ratio [OR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.81, P=.03). Physicians favored patient-centered decisions and patients chose the treatment that they thought would least affect other responsibilities. Those ultimately receiving surgical management had a higher monthly income (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04-1.63, P=.023) and more social support (adjusted OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.07-5.61, P=.035) than the medical group. The surgical group cited loss acceptance, a favorable perception of surgery, and a desire to expedite the miscarriage as decisive factors. The medical group endorsed control over, and timed completion of, the miscarriage in a more intimate setting, an aversion to surgery or anesthesia, and a perception of improved fertility preservation as decisive factors. Regardless of treatment choice, satisfaction with treatment was linked to a supportive clinical team and expeditious resolution.

METHODS: This was an economic analysis of patients enrolled in the five Utah hospitals participating in a multicenter randomized trial of elective labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation compared with expectant management in low-risk nulliparous women. The entire trial enrolled more than 6,000 patients. For this subset, 1,201 had cost data available. The primary outcome was relative direct health care costs of maternal and neonatal care from a health system perspective. Secondary outcomes included the costs of each phase of maternal and neonatal care. Direct health system costs of maternal and neonatal care were measured using advanced costing analytics from the time of randomization at 38 weeks of gestation until exit from the study up to 8 weeks postpartum. Costs in each randomization arm were compared using generalized linear models and reported as the relative cost of induction compared with expectant management. With a fixed sample size, we had adequate power to detect a 7.3% or greater difference in overall costs. RESULTS: The total cost of elective induction was no different than expectant management (mean difference +4.7%; 95% CI -2.1% to +12.0%; P=.18). Maternal outpatient antenatal care costs were 47.0% lower in the induction arm (95% CI -58.3% to -32.6%; P<.001).

Certification speaks to physician competence. All obstetrician-gynecologists who have finished residency training since 1982 are deemed ""competent"" to perform obstetric and gynecologic ultrasonography by virtue of their training. Those trained before 1982 need to be able to describe their level of experience in performing obstetric and gynecologic ultrasonography. Accreditation deals with issues of patient safety and quality control, including equipment calibration, transducer cleaning and disinfection, universal precautions and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, ultrasound examination protocols, and qualifications of nonphysician personnel performing ultrasound examinations. A new field of radiology benefit managers has arisen in response to attempts by health insurers to manage care, and reduce their costs and utilization. They have adopted ultrasound accreditation, originally intended to enhance patient safety, to help restrict utilization. Currently two organizations are recognized as accrediting bodies: The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), which recognizes obstetric and gynecologic residency training as evidence of competency, and The American College of Radiologists, which does not.

METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of labor and delivery unit nurse managers. We developed a computer module that simulates the physical layout and clinical activity of the labor and delivery unit at our tertiary care academic medical center, in which players act as clinical managers in dynamically allocating nursing staff and beds as patients arrive, progress in labor, and undergo procedures. We exposed nurse managers to variation in patient census and measured the delays in resource decisions over the course of a simulated shift. We used mixed logistic and linear regression models to analyze the associations between patient census and delays in patient care. RESULTS: Thirteen nurse managers participated in the study and completed 17 12-hour shifts, or 204 simulated hours of decision-making. All participants reported the simulation module reflected their real-life experiences at least somewhat well. We observed 1.47-increased odds (95% CI 1.18-1.82) of recommending a patient ambulate in early labor for every additional patient on the labor and delivery unit. For every additional patient on the labor and delivery unit, there was a 15.9-minute delay between delivery and transfer to the postpartum unit (95% CI 2.4-29.3). For every additional patient in the waiting room, we observed a 33.3-minute delay in the time patients spent in the waiting room (95% CI 23.2-43.5) and a 14.3-minute delay in moving a patient in need of a cesarean delivery to the operating room (95% CI 2.8-25.8).

Minimally invasive surgical technology has decreased length of hospital stay, improved postoperative recovery, and decreased postoperative pain. Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the United States. Increasing trends in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery are expected to reduce patients' postoperative pain. It is unclear whether this assumption has resulted in decreasing postoperative opioid prescriptions or patient need for these prescriptions, as prescribing patterns may be contributing to the current opioid public health emergency. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe opioid prescribing and patient procurement practices for postoperative pain at time of discharge for benign hysterectomy from 2004 through 2014 using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Research Database. The trends of the route of hysterectomy over this time period were concomitantly described to reflect the movement toward more minimally invasive approaches. STUDY DESIGN: The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Research Database including the Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, and the Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database were utilized. Current Procedural Terminology, 4th Edition, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes identified all patients who underwent a hysterectomy for benign indications from 2004 through 2014. Hysterectomy routes were categorized into abdominal, laparoscopic, and vaginal. The MarketScan database captures prescriptions filled at a retail or mail-order pharmacy and does not capture prescriptions filled within the inpatient, hospital facility. The days of opioids procured by patients at the time of discharge were identified for each encounter. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data within the entire study period. Although this article is purely descriptive, further analyses were conducted for exploratory purposes only. analysis of variance and <cf><87>(2) analyses were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were used to describe associations between variables of interest and postoperative opioid prescriptions. RESULTS: We identified 793,016 patients who underwent a hysterectomy for benign indications from 2004 through 2014. Of these, 96% were identified from the Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. During the study period, the overall route of hysterectomy was categorized into 40.5% abdominal, 42.0% laparoscopic, and 17.5% vaginal hysterectomy. The route of hysterectomy changed from 60.2-25.6% (a decrease of <ce><94> = 34.58; 95% confidence interval, 33.96-35.20) for abdominal, 17.0-61.9% (an increase of <ce><94> = 44.83; 95% confidence interval, 44.21-45.44) for laparoscopic, and 22.8-12.6% (a decrease of <ce><94> = 10.25; 95% confidence interval, 9.77-10.73) for vaginal. At discharge, the percentage of patients who were prescribed opioids and filled them increased from 25.6-82.1% (an increase of <ce><94> = 56.50; 95% confidence interval, 55.88-57.13 with P < .001) from 2004 through 2014 for all hysterectomy routes. Additionally, the quantity of opioids prescribed also increased. CONCLUSION: Opioid prescriptions filled for postoperative pain after hysterectomy substantially increased from 2004 through 2014. Opioid prescription procurement has increased despite a concomitant increase in minimally invasive hysterectomy routes.

METHODS: A pre-post control group design was used to examine early pregnancy loss counseling performance among medical students from two medical schools doing their obstetrics and gynecology rotations at the same community hospital. The study outcomes were: (1) pre-post differences in Standardized Patient Objective Structured Clinical Examination scores; (2) pre-post differences in student confidence levels; and (3) postdifferences in standardized patient empathy ratings. Both groups had similar demographics, academic parameters, and longitudinal curricula. The study group (N=39) received a curriculum of demonstration and role-playing for delivering bad news and a shared decision-making model for early pregnancy loss management. The control group (N=38) received traditional instruction. RESULTS: Standardized Patient Objective Structured Clinical Examination posttest scores were significantly higher for the study group compared with the control group (94.2% compared with 69.7%, P<.001) after starting with similar pretest scores (64.0% compared with 61.6%, P=.53). Posttest confidence levels (1=high, 5=low) were significantly higher for the study compared with the control group (1.57 compared with 3.62, P<.001) after starting at similar levels (4.27 compared with 4.23, P=.79). Standardized patient empathy ratings (1=high, 5=low) were significantly higher for the study compared with the control group (1.84 compared with 2.62, P=.002). CONCLUSION: A structured curriculum for teaching early pregnancy loss counseling improved student performance on standardized Objective Structured Clinical Examinations compared with traditional instruction.

Limited work has been done on automated predictive models that could be used for prevention. Using only routinely collected obstetrical data, this study aimed to develop a predictive model suitable for real-time use with an electronic medical record. We used a retrospective cohort study design with split validation. The denominator consisted of women admitted to a delivery service. The numerator consisted of women who experienced a composite outcome that included both maternal (eg, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage), fetal (eg, stillbirth), and neonatal (eg, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) adverse events. We employed machine learning methods, assessing model performance using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and number needed to evaluate. A total of 303,678 deliveries took place at 15 study hospitals between January 1, 2010, and March 31, 2018, and 4130 (1.36%) had <e2><89><a5>1 obstetrical complication.

We then applied our model to data from 41,669 deliveries from the last year of the study (April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 [validation 2 dataset]). Our model included 35 variables (eg, demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, progress of labor indicators).

All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. We applied the Framework Method of content analysis. Transcripts were iteratively analyzed and emergent themes identified. RESULTS: Twenty-seven expert gynecologic surgical teachers from 15 institutions across the United States participated in 30-minute interviews. We identified four domains of entrustment evidence (resident characteristics, medical knowledge, technical performance, and ""beyond current surgical case"") commonly reported by expert gynecologic surgical teachers to determine residents' autonomy as well as the particular evidence associated with expert gynecologic surgical teachers' determination of resident autonomy at two decision-making points (surgical time-out and taking over certain intraoperative steps) in the operating room.

Brown_2016_Obsandgyn,JOUR,Whose Choice? Developing a Unifying Ethical Framework for Conscience Laws in Health Care,"Brown, Benjamin P. and Hasselbacher, Lee and Chor, Julie",Obstetrics and gynecology,"Since abortion became legal nationwide, federal and state ""conscience clauses"" have been established to define the context in which health professionals may decline to participate in contested services. Patients and health care providers may act according to conscience in making health care decisions and in deciding whether to abstain from or to participate in contested services. Historically, however, conscience clauses largely have equated conscience in health care with provider abstinence from such services. We propose a framework to analyze the ethical implications of conscience laws. There is a rich literature on the exercise of conscience in the clinical encounter. This essay addresses the need to ensure that policy, too, is grounded in an ethical framework. We argue that the ideal law meets three standards: it protects patients' exercise of conscience, it safeguards health care providers' rights of conscience, and it does not contradict standards of ethical conduct established by professional societies. We have chosen Illinois as a test of our framework because it has one of the nation's broadest conscience clauses and because an amendment to ensure that women receive consistent access to contested services has just passed in the state legislature. Without such an amendment, Illinois law fails all three standards of our framework. If signed by the governor, the amended law will provide protections for patients' positive claims of conscience. We recommend further protections for providers' positive claims as well. Enacting such changes would offer a model for how ethics-based analysis could be applied to similar policies nationwide.",2016,10.1097/AOG.0000000000001526,128,2,391-395,eng,1873-233X 0029-7844,"Humans and Religion and Organizational Policy and Patient Preference and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Treatment Refusal/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and *Conscience and Hospitals/ethics and Illinois and Codes of Ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Delivery of Health Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Refusal to Treat/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Societies, Medical/ethics",NA,NA,2016/08//undefined,Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, discussion of family planning issues and contraceptive considerations has become an integral component of women's health care and one of the benchmarks of the traditional annual well-women visit. In terms of cost-effectiveness, prevention of unplanned pregnancies through contraceptive use has repeatedly been shown to be a highly cost-effective use of health care dollars. Options for effective hormonal contraception have expanded tremendously and include a variety of delivery options, including the pills both in traditional 21/7 format, and more recently in a 24/4 format, as well as a vaginal ring, a skin patch, implants, and the hormonally medicated intrauterine device. Importantly, the overall risks associated with hormonal contraceptives have been reduced as compared with older formulations, even for women with medical conditions. Many modern hormonal contraceptives also offer valuable noncontraceptive benefits. To help clinical decision making, a number of evidence-based guides have been published, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recently updated their practice bulletin on contraception use in women with medical conditions. In general, clinical protocols for provision of hormonal contraceptives have been streamlined, and unnecessary practices, tests, and procedures are identified and discouraged.

METHODS: We performed a before and after cohort study of postpartum women at an urban public teaching hospital. We compared the frequency of Tdap vaccination during the preintervention (October 1, 2008-January 14, 2009) and postintervention (January 15-April 30, 2009) time periods. We intervened by automating electronic presentation of preselected orders to physicians who provided postpartum care. The order was displayed when physicians ordered iron supplementation or patient discharge to a woman who met certain criteria. We evaluated whether patient characteristics were associated with receipt of vaccine. RESULTS: Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccination was more likely for postpartum women postintervention compared with preintervention (147 of 248 [59%] compared with zero of 183 [0%]; difference=59%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 53-65%).

It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Dysmenorrhea can negatively affect a woman's quality of life and interfere with daily activities. The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is likely a result of the cyclooxygenase pathway producing increased prostanoids, particularly prostaglandins (PGs). The increased PGs cause uterine contractions that restrict blood flow and lead to the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain receptors. Women with a history typical for primary dysmenorrhea can initiate empiric treatment without additional testing. Shared decision making is key to effective management of dysmenorrhea to maximize patient compliance and satisfaction. After a discussion of their risks and benefits, extremely effective empiric therapies are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and contraceptive hormonal therapy. Other treatments for primary dysmenorrhea can be employed solely or in combination with other modalities, but the literature supporting their use is not as convincing.

The interviews were transcribed and coded thematically using grounded theory. RESULTS: Of a total of 381 women, 56 women qualified for our study. The average interview length was 30 minutes, and theoretical saturation occurred at 30 interviews. General themes included treatment delay, education, treatment attitudes, and office factors. The most common modifiable barrier to third-line therapy was insufficient in-office education. Participants expressed a poor understanding of the etiology, natural history, and treatment options for OAB. Participants were heavily influenced by outside factors including the opinions of friends and the media. Negative experiences with less-advanced options and treatment fatigue negatively affected participants' perceptions of third-line therapies. Office factors such as wait times and male physicians also negatively affected participants' ability to discuss their bladder symptoms. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, office education is tremendously important to patients' understanding of OAB, expectations of therapy, and treatment compliance. Education about third-line therapy counseling should be incorporated into the initial office visit. This may mitigate expectations, improve patient compliance, and promote graduation to advanced therapy in women who later go on to develop refractory symptoms.",2019,10.1097/AOG.0000000000003320,134,1,141-148,eng,1873-233X 0029-7844,"Ohio and Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Women's Health and *Health Services Accessibility and *Patient-Centered Care and Botulinum Toxins, Type A/administration & dosage/therapeutic use and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation and Urinary Bladder, Overactive/*therapy",NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

D.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"There is a general consensus that the cesarean delivery rate in the United States is too high, and that practice patterns of obstetricians are largely to blame for this situation. In reality, the US cesarean delivery rate is the result of 3 forces largely beyond the control of the practicing clinician: patient expectations and misconceptions regarding the safety of labor, the medical-legal system, and limitations in technology. Efforts to ""do something"" about the cesarean delivery rate by promulgating practice directives that are marginally evidence-based or influenced by social pressures are both ineffective and potentially harmful. We examine both the recent American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)/Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Care Consensus Statement ""Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery"" document and the various iterations of the ACOG guidelines for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery in this context. Adherence to arbitrary time limits for active phase or second-stage arrest without incorporating other clinical factors into the decision-making process is unwise. In a similar manner, ever-changing practice standards for vaginal birth after cesarean driven by factors other than changing data are unlikely to be effective in lowering the cesarean delivery rate. Whether too high or too low, the current US cesarean delivery rate is the expected result of the unique demographic, geographic, and social forces driving it and is unlikely to change significantly given the limitations of current technology to otherwise satisfy the demands of these forces.",2018,10.1016/j.ajog.2018.04.044,219,3,267-271,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"United States and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and Time Factors and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Labor, Obstetric and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and *Liability, Legal and *Obstetric Labor Complications and cesarean delivery rate and labor arrest and vaginal birth after cesarean and Vaginal Birth after Cesarean",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mejia_2015_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Ethical issues identified by obstetrics and gynecology learners through a novel ethics curriculum,"Mejia, Rachel B. and Shinkunas, Laura A. and Ryan, Ginny L.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"OBJECTIVE: Obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) is fraught with bioethical issues, the professional significance of which may vary based on clinical experience. Our objective was to utilize our novel ethics curriculum to identify ethics and professionalism issues highlighted by ob/gyn learners and to compare responses between learner levels to further inform curricular development. STUDY DESIGN: We introduced an integrated and dynamic ob/gyn ethics and professionalism curriculum and mixed methods analysis of 181 resulting written reflections (case observation and assessments) from third-year medical students and from first- to fourth-year ob/gyn residents. Content was compared by learner level using basic thematic analysis and summary statistics. RESULTS: Within the 7 major ethics and professionalism domains, learners wrote most frequently about miscellaneous ob/gyn issues such as periviability and abortion (22% of students, 20% of residents) and problematic treatment decisions (20% of students, 19% of residents) rather than professional duty, communication, justice, student-/resident-specific issues, or quality of care. The most commonly discussed ob/gyn area by both learner groups was obstetrics rather than gynecology, gynecologic oncology, or reproductive endocrinology and infertility, although residents were more likely to discuss obstetrics-related concerns than students (65% vs 48%; P = .04) and students wrote about gynecologic oncology-related concerns more frequently than residents (25% vs 6%; P = .002). In their reflections, sources of ethical value (eg, the 4 classic ethics principles, professional guidelines, and consequentialism) were cited more frequently and in greater number by students than by residents (82% of students cited at least 1 source of ethical value vs 65% of residents; P = .01). Residents disagreed more frequently with the ethical propriety of clinical management than did students (67% vs 43%; P = .005). CONCLUSION: Our study introduces an innovative and dynamic approach to an ob/gyn ethics and professionalism curriculum that highlights important learner-identified ethics and professionalism issues both specific to ob/gyn and common to clinical medicine. Findings will help ob/gyn educators best utilize and refine this flexible curriculum such that it is appropriately focused on topics relevant to each learner level.",2015,10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.023,213,6,867.e1-867.e11,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Professionalism and Pregnancy and professional competence and Students, Medical and Internship and Residency and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Curriculum and medical education and Ethics, Clinical/*education and obstetrics and bioethics and Gynecology/*education and Obstetrics/*education and gynecology and Iowa",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A focused ethnography was conducted at a large teaching hospital, which serves a high proportion of immigrant clientele (predominantly North or East African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Data collection comprised single, semistructured interviews with a purposive sample of 20 obstetric health care providers (10 resident and 10 staff obstetricians). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were managed with Quirkos and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 13 female and seven male physicians were interviewed. Physicians recognized the validity of immigrant women's preference and requests for female health care providers and expressed sympathy for them. However, they were also resistant and expressed several concerns about accommodating these requests, including fear of perpetuating and exacerbating gender inequalities in medicine, the extent to which patient decision-making was coercion-free, the ability of the health system to meet the demands, and implications for training and quality of care. CONCLUSION: Although physicians were sympathetic to immigrant women's requests for female obstetricians, they placed greater value on maintaining gender equity both within the medical profession and in wider society and resisted accommodating gender-of-health-care-provider requests.

Gatter_2014_Obsandgyn,JOUR,Relationship between ultrasound viewing and proceeding to abortion,"Gatter, Mary and Kimport, Katrina and Foster, Diana Greene and Weitz, Tracy A. and Upadhyay, Ushma D.",Obstetrics and gynecology,"OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound scanning is a routine part of preprocedure abortion care, and many health care providers offer patients the opportunity to view their ultrasound images. It has been speculated that ultrasound viewing will dissuade women from having an abortion. We examine whether viewing the image is associated with choosing to continue the pregnancy. METHODS: Data from medical records for 15,575 visits by women seeking abortion care at a large, urban abortion provider in 2011 were analyzed for factors associated with choosing to continue the pregnancy. All patients received a preprocedure ultrasound scan and were offered the opportunity to view the image. RESULTS: Patients opted to view the ultrasound image 42.5% of the time. Nearly all pregnancies (98.8%) were terminated: 98.4% of pregnancies among women who viewed their ultrasound images and 99.0% of pregnancies among the patients who did not. Among women with high decision certainty, viewing was not associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy. Viewing was significantly associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy only among the 7.4% of women who reported medium or low decision certainty about having an abortion (adjusted odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.18-8.73). CONCLUSION: Voluntarily viewing the ultrasound image may contribute to a small proportion of women with medium or low decision certainty deciding to continue the pregnancy; such viewing does not alter decisions of the large majority of women who are certain that abortion is the right decision.

Cohen_2015_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Perils of the new labor management guidelines,"Cohen, Wayne R. and Friedman, Emanuel A.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"Recent guidelines issued jointly by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine for assessing labor progress differ substantially from those described initially by Friedman, which have guided clinical practice for decades. The guidelines are based on results obtained from new and untested methods of analyzing patterns of cervical dilatation and fetal descent. Before these new guidelines are adopted into clinical practice, the results obtained by these unconventional analytic approaches should be validated and shown to be superior, or at least equivalent, to currently accepted standards. The new guidelines indicate the patterns of labor originally described by Friedman are incorrect and, further, are inapplicable to modern obstetric practice. We contend that the original descriptions of normal and abnormal labor progress, which were based on direct clinical observations, accurately describe progress in dilatation and descent, and that the differences reported more recently are likely attributable to patient selection and the potential inaccuracy of very high-order polynomial curve-fitting methods. The clinical evaluation of labor is a process of serially estimating the likelihood of a safe vaginal delivery. Because many factors contribute to that likelihood, such as cranial molding, head position and attitude, and the bony architecture and capacity of the pelvis, graphic labor patterns should never be used in isolation. The new guidelines are based heavily on unvalidated notions of labor progress and ignore clinical parameters that should remain cornerstones of intrapartum decision-making.",2015,10.1016/j.ajog.2014.09.008,212,4,420-427,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"United States and Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Societies, Medical and Cesarean Section and *Obstetric Labor Complications/diagnosis/therapy and active phase and arrest of descent and arrest of dilatation and arrest of labor and deceleration phase and dysfunctional labor and labor curve and Labor, Obstetric/*physiology and partogram",NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database, we performed a large, nationwide retrospective cohort study of commercially insured beneficiaries who underwent vaginal delivery between 2003 and 2015 and who were opioid-naive for 12 weeks before the delivery admission. We assessed the proportion of women dispensed an oral opioid within 1 week of discharge, the associated median oral morphine milligram equivalent dose dispensed, and the frequency of opioid refills during the 6 weeks after discharge. We evaluated predictors of opioid dispensing using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 1,345,244 women undergoing vaginal delivery, 28.5% were dispensed an opioid within 1 week of discharge. The most commonly dispensed opioids were hydrocodone (44.7%), oxycodone (34.6%), and codeine (13.1%). The odds of filling an opioid were higher among those using benzodiazepines (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.73-2.02) and antidepressants (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.59-1.66), smokers (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.38-1.51), and among those undergoing tubal ligation (adjusted OR 3.77, 95% CI 3.67-3.87), operative vaginal delivery (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.49-1.54), and higher order perineal laceration (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI 2.11-2.18). The median (interquartile range, 10th-90th percentile) dose of opioids dispensed was 150 (113-225, 80-345) morphine milligram equivalents, equivalent to 20 tablets (interquartile range 15-30, 10th-90th percentile 11-46) of 5 mg oxycodone. Six weeks after discharge, 8.5% of women filled one or more additional opioid prescriptions. CONCLUSION: Opioid dispensing after vaginal delivery is common and often occurs at high doses.

Recently, cell-free DNA in plasma was found to reflect the global nucleosome footprint and status of gene expression and showed potential for noninvasive health monitoring during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the relationships between plasma cell-free DNA profiles and pregnancy biology and evaluate the use of a cell-free DNA profile as a noninvasive method for physiological and pathologic status monitoring during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: We used genome cell-free DNA sequencing data generated from noninvasive prenatal testing in a total of 2937 pregnant women. For each physiological and pathologic condition, features of the cell-free DNA profile were identified using the discovery cohort, and support vector machine classifiers were built and evaluated using independent training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: We established nucleosome occupancy profiles at transcription start sites in different gestational trimesters, demonstrated the relationships between gene expression and cell-free DNA coverage at transcription start sites, and showed that the cell-free DNA profiles at transcription start sites represented the biological processes of pregnancy. In addition, using cell-free DNA data, nucleosome profiles of transcription factor binding sites were identified to reflect the transcription factor footprint, which may help to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying pregnancy. Finally, by using machine-learning models on low-coverage noninvasive prenatal testing data, we evaluated the use of cell-free DNA nucleosome profiles for distinguishing gestational trimesters, fetal sex, and fetal trisomy 21 and highlighted its potential utility for predicting physiological and pathologic fetal conditions by using low-coverage noninvasive prenatal testing data.

Pregnancy planning can allow these high-risk women the opportunity to receive preconception counseling, medication adjustment, and risk assessment related to health conditions that have a direct impact on maternal morbidity and mortality risk. Despite the need for pregnancy planning, medically complex women face barriers to contraceptive use, including systemic barriers, such as underinsurance for women at increased risk for complex medical conditions as well as low uptake of effective postpartum contraception. Providing contraceptive counseling and a full range of contraceptive options, including immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), is a means of overcoming these barriers. The purpose of this document is to educate all providers, including maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, about the benefits of postpartum contraception, and to advocate for widespread implementation of immediate postpartum LARC placement programs. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: we recommend that LARC be offered to women at highest risk for adverse health events as a result of a future pregnancy (GRADE 1B); we recommend that obstetric care providers discuss the availability of immediate postpartum LARC with all pregnant women during prenatal care and consult the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use guidelines to determine methods most appropriate for specific medical conditions (GRADE 1C); we recommend that women considering immediate postpartum intrauterine device insertion be counseled that although expulsion rates are higher than with delayed insertion, the benefits appear to outweigh the risk of expulsion, as the long-term continuation rates are higher (GRADE 1C); we recommend that obstetric care providers wishing to utilize immediate postpartum LARC obtain training specific to the immediate postpartum period (BEST PRACTICE); for women who desire and are eligible for LARC, we recommend immediate postpartum placement after a high-risk pregnancy over delayed placement due to overall superior efficacy and cost-effectiveness (GRADE 1B); we recommend that women considering immediate postpartum LARC be encouraged to breastfeed, as current evidence suggests that these methods do not negatively influence lactation (GRADE 1B); for women who desire and are eligible for LARC, we suggest that early postpartum LARC placement be considered when immediate postpartum LARC placement is not feasible (GRADE 2C); and we recommend that contraceptive counseling programs be patient-centered and provided in a shared decision-making framework to avoid coercion (BEST PRACTICE).",2019,10.1016/j.ajog.2019.02.011,220,5,B12-B2,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Patient Care Team and Insurance Coverage and Pregnancy and Patient Education as Topic and Breast Feeding and *Postpartum Period and *Pregnancy, High-Risk and *Long-Acting Reversible Contraception and Contraindications, Drug and high-risk pregnancy and Intrauterine Devices and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and medically complex woman and postpartum contraception and Pregnancy, Unplanned",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current recommendations are based partly on antiquated studies with questionable methods. All studies that have been published to date suffer from nonstandardized outcome measures, selection bias, and small sample size. The larger studies are >15 years old. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to provide information for evidence-based decision-making regarding the impact of route of delivery on motor outcomes for pediatric patients with prenatally were diagnosed myelomeningocele in a well-defined retrospective cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for all neonates who had been diagnosed with a myelomeningocele at birth from 1995-2015 within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center system, as identified through the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Neurosurgery Department operative database. Records were matched with maternal records with the use of the Center for Assistance in Research that used eRecord. Data from 72 maternal-neonatal pairs were analyzed for multiple variables. The primary outcome measure was the difference between the functional and anatomic motor levels in the child at the age of 2 years, stratified by mode of delivery and presence or absence of labor. The sample size necessary to detect a difference between the groups with power of 0.8 and significance of .05 was calculated to be 52 subjects total (26 per group). RESULTS: Functional levels were slightly better than predicted by anatomic levels for all pediatric patient groups, regardless of mode of delivery or presence of labor. Anatomic levels were slightly lower (better), and defects were smaller for those infants who underwent vaginal delivery or a trial of labor, likely attributable to selection bias. Attempts to correct for this selection bias did not change the results. No other outcomes that were analyzed were associated significantly with mode of delivery or presence of labor.

Hanley_2010_Obsandgyn,JOUR,Regional variation in the cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery rates,"Hanley, Gillian E. and Janssen, Patricia A. and Greyson, Devon",Obstetrics and gynecology,"OBJECTIVE: To examine regional variations in rates of primary cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery in the population of British Columbia, while adjusting for the maternal characteristics and conditions that increase the likelihood of operative delivery. METHODS: Using data from the British Columbia Perinatal Database Registry, we studied all deliveries in British Columbia between 2004 and 2007, excluding women who had a previous cesarean delivery (n=116,839). Our primary outcome of interest was mode of delivery, further defined as delivery by cesarean or assisted vaginal delivery. We calculated crude and risk-adjusted rates of primary cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery across British Columbia's 16 Health Service Delivery Areas and examined cesarean delivery rates by indication for the procedure. RESULTS: Crude primary cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery rates varied markedly across the Health Service Delivery Areas ranging from 16.1 to 27.5 per 100 deliveries, and from 8.6 to 18.6 per 100 deliveries, respectively. The most common indication for cesarean delivery was dystocia, which accounted for 30.0% of all cesarean deliveries and varied more than fivefold across regions. After controlling for maternal characteristics and conditions known to increase the likelihood of cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery, adjusted cesarean delivery rates varied twofold, ranging from 14.7 to 27.6 per 100 deliveries, while adjusted assisted vaginal delivery rates varied by more than twofold, ranging from 6.5 to 15.3 per 100 deliveries. CONCLUSION: Our results illustrate substantial regional variation in the use of cesarean delivery that cannot be explained by patient illness or preferences. This variation likely reflects differences in practitioners' approaches to medical decision-making.

Metz_2016_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Variation in primary cesarean delivery rates by individual physician within a single-hospital laborist model,"Metz, Torri D. and Allshouse, Amanda A. and Gilbert, Sara A. Babcock and Doyle, Reina and Tong, Angie and Carey, J. Christopher",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Laborist practice models are associated with lower rates of cesarean delivery than individual private practice models in several studies; however, this effect is not uniform. Further exploration of laborist models may help us better understand the observed decrease in rates of cesarean delivery in some hospitals that implement a laborist model. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the degree of variation in rates of primary cesarean delivery by individual laborists within a single institution that uses a laborist model. In addition, we sought to evaluate whether differences in rates of cesarean delivery resulted in different maternal or short-term neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: At this teaching institution, one laborist (either a generalist or maternal-fetal medicine attending physician) is directly responsible for labor and delivery management during each shift. No patients are followed in a private practice model nor are physicians incentivized to perform deliveries. We retrospectively identified all laborists who delivered nulliparous, term women with cephalic singletons at this institution from 2007 to 2014. Overall and individual primary cesarean delivery rates were reported as percentages with exact Pearson 95% confidence intervals. Laborists were grouped by tertile as having low, medium, or high rates of cesarean delivery. Characteristics of the women delivered, indications for cesarean delivery, and short-term neonatal outcomes were compared between these groups. A binomial regression model of cesarean delivery was estimated, where the relative rates of each laborist compared with the lowest-unadjusted laborist rate were calculated; a second model was estimated to adjust for patient-level maternal characteristics. RESULTS: Twenty laborists delivered 2224 nulliparous, term women with cephalic singletons. The overall cesarean delivery rate was 24.1% (95% confidence interval 21.4-26.8). In an unadjusted binomial model, the overall effect of individual laborist was significant (P < .001), and a 2.9-fold (1.5-5.4, P = .001) variation between the cesarean delivery rates of the greatest (35.9%) and lowest (12.5%) physicians was observed. When adjusted for hypertensive disease, gestational age at delivery, race, and maternal age, the physician effect remained overall significant (P = .0265) with the difference between physicians expanding to 3.58 (1.72-7.47, P <. 001). Between groups of laborists with low, medium, and high rates of cesarean delivery, patient demographics and clinical characteristics of the population managed were clinically similar and not different statistically. The primary indication for cesarean delivery did not differ between groups. Similarly there were no differences in short-term neonatal outcomes, including Apgar scores, arterial cord blood pH, or the incidence of neonatal encephalopathy. CONCLUSION: The 3-fold variation in cesarean delivery rates between laborists at the same institution without observed differences in patient characteristics or short-term neonatal outcomes draws attention to the impact of individual physician decision-making on cesarean delivery rates even within a laborist care model. Further exploration of the role of individual physician decision-making on cesarean rates may help to better elucidate the effect of the laborist model.",2016,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.01.002,214,4,531.e1-531.e6,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Cohort Studies and Pregnancy and Parity and Hospitals, Teaching and Obstetric Labor Complications and Hydrogen-Ion Concentration and *Models, Organizational and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and Extraction, Obstetrical/statistics & numerical data and Labor Stage, Second and Cesarean and Cesarean delivery rate and Faculty, Medical/*statistics & numerical data and Fetal Blood/chemistry and laborist and physician traits",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sawaya_2017_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Effect of professional society recommendations on women's desire for a routine pelvic examination,"Sawaya, George F. and Smith-McCune, Karen K. and Gregorich, Steven E. and Moghadassi, Michelle and Kuppermann, Miriam",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: The American College of Physicians strongly recommends against performing pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women, citing evidence of harm (false-positive testing, unnecessary surgery) and no evidence of benefit. In contrast, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women beginning at age 21 years, citing expert opinion. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate if providing women with professional societies' conflicting statements about pelvic examinations (recommendations and rationales) would influence their desire for a routine examination. STUDY DESIGN: We recruited 452 women ages 21-65 years from 2 women's clinics to participate in a 50-minute face-to-face interview about cervical cancer screening that included a 2-phase study related to pelvic examinations. In the first phase, 262 women were asked about their desire for the examination without being provided information about professional societies' recommendations. In the second phase, 190 women were randomized to review summaries of the American College of Physicians or American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists statement followed by an interview. RESULTS: First-phase participants served as the referent: 79% (208/262) indicated they would want a routine examination if given a choice. In the second phase, a similar percentage of women randomized to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists summary had this desire (82%: 80/97; adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-2.70). Women randomized to the American College of Physicians summary, however, were less likely to indicate they would opt for an examination (39%: 36/93; adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.21). Overall, 94% (179/190) believed the potential benefits and harms should be discussed prior to the examination. CONCLUSION: Providing women with a professional society's recommendation advising against routine pelvic examinations substantially reduced their desire to have one.

Moustafa_2020_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Accurate diagnosis of endometriosis using serum microRNAs,"Moustafa, Sarah and Burn, Martina and Mamillapalli, Ramanaiah and Nematian, Sepide and Flores, Valerie and Taylor, Hugh S.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Endometriosis, a chronic disease that afflicts millions of women worldwide, has traditionally been diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery. This diagnostic barrier delays identification and treatment by years, resulting in prolonged pain and disease progression. Development of a noninvasive diagnostic test could significantly improve timely disease detection. We tested the feasibility of serum microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers of endometriosis in women with gynecologic disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to validate the use of a microRNA panel as a noninvasive diagnostic method for detecting endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study evaluating subjects with a clinical indication for gynecological surgery in an academic medical center. Serum samples were collected prior to surgery from 100 subjects. Women were selected based on the presence of symptoms, and laparoscopy was performed to determine the presence or absence of endometriosis. The control group was categorized based on absence of visual disease at the time of surgery. Circulating miRNAs, miR-125b-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-342-3p, miR-451a, miR-3613-5p, and let-7b, were measured in serum by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in a blinded fashion without knowledge of disease status. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed on individual microRNAs as well as combinations of microRNAs. An algorithm combining the expression values of these microRNAs, built using machine learning with a random forest classifier, was generated to predict the presence or absence of endometriosis on operative findings. This algorithm was then tested in an independent data set of 48 previously identified subjects not included in the training set (24 endometriosis and 24 controls) to validate its diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The mean age of women in the study population was 34.1 and 36.9 years for the endometriosis and control groups, respectively. Control group subjects displayed varying pathologies, with leiomyoma occurring the most often (n = 39). Subjects with endometriosis had significantly higher expression levels of 4 serum microRNAs: miR-125b-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-342-3p, and miR-451a. Two serum microRNAs showed significantly lower levels in the endometriosis group: miR-3613-5p and let-7b. Individual microRNAs had receiver-operating characteristic areas under the curve ranging from 0.68 to 0.92. A classifier combining these microRNAs yielded an area under the curve of 0.94 when validated in the independent set of subjects not included in the training set. Analysis of the expression levels of each microRNA based on revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine staging revealed that all microRNAs could distinguish stage I/II from control and stage III/IV from control but that the difference between stage I/II and stage III/IV was not significant. Subgroup analysis revealed that neither phase of the menstrual cycle or use of hormonal medication had a significant impact on the expression levels in the microRNAs used in our algorithm. CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing that microRNA biomarkers can reliably differentiate between endometriosis and other gynecological pathologies with an area under the curve >0.9 across 2 independent studies. We validated the performance of an algorithm based on previously identified microRNA biomarkers, demonstrating their potential to detect endometriosis in a clinical setting, allowing earlier identification and treatment. The ability to diagnose endometriosis noninvasively could reduce the time to diagnosis, surgical risk, years of discomfort, disease progression, associated comorbidities, and health care costs.",2020,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.050,223,4,557.e1-557.e11,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Algorithms and Machine Learning and Feasibility Studies and Prospective Studies and Area Under Curve and ROC Curve and Laparoscopy and Severity of Illness Index and endometriosis and biomarker and Endometriosis/blood/*diagnosis and microRNA and MicroRNAs/*blood and miR and noninvasive diagnosis,NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although social media, including Twitter, increasingly influences reproductive-age individuals, discussion of contraception in this setting has yet to be characterized. Natural language processing, a type of machine learning in which computers analyze natural language data, enables this analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to illuminate temporal trends in attitudes toward long- and short-acting reversible contraceptive methods in tweets between 2006 and 2019 and establish social media platforms as alternate data sources for large-scale sentiment analysis on contraception. STUDY DESIGN: We studied English-language tweets mentioning reversible prescription contraceptive methods between March 2006 (founding of Twitter) and December 2019. Tweets mentioning contraception were extracted using search terms, including generic or brand names, colloquial names, and abbreviations. We characterized and performed sentiment analysis on tweets. We used Mann-Kendall nonparametric tests to assess temporal trends in the overall number and the number of positive, negative, and neutral tweets referring to each method. The code to reproduce this analysis is available at https://github.com/hms-dbmi/contraceptionOnTwitter. RESULTS: We extracted 838,739 tweets mentioning at least 1 contraceptive method. The annual number of contraception-related tweets increased considerably over the study period. The intrauterine device was the most commonly referenced method (45.9%). Long-acting methods were mentioned more often than short-acting ones (58% vs 42%), and the annual proportion of long-acting reversible contraception-related tweets increased over time. In sentiment analysis of tweets mentioning a single contraceptive method (n=665,064), the greatest proportion of all tweets was negative (65,339 of 160,713 tweets with at least 95% confident sentiment, or 40.66%). Tweets mentioning long-acting methods were nearly twice as likely to be positive compared with tweets mentioning short-acting methods (19.65% vs 10.21%; P<.002).

Donahue_2020_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,A comparative carbon footprint analysis of disposable and reusable vaginal specula,"Donahue, Laura M. and Hilton, Stephen and Bell, Sarah G. and Williams, Brent C. and Keoleian, Gregory A.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare systems in the United States have increasingly turned toward the use of disposable medical equipment in an attempt to save time, lower costs, and reduce the transmission of infections. However, the use of disposable instruments is associated with increased solid waste production and may have negative impacts on the environment, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to inform this discussion; we applied life cycle assessment methods to evaluate the carbon footprints of 3 vaginal specula: a single-use acrylic model and 2 reusable stainless steel models. STUDY DESIGN: The functional unit of the study was defined as the completion of 20 gynecologic examinations by either type of speculum. The greenhouse gas emissions (eg, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) across all life cycle stages, which includes material production and manufacturing, transportation, use and reprocessing, and end-of-life, were analyzed with the use of SimaPro life cycle assessment software and converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. RESULTS: The reusable stainless steel grade 304 speculum was found to have a lesser carbon footprint over multiple model scenarios (different reprocessing techniques, autoclave loading/efficiency, and number of uses) than either the reusable stainless steel grade 316 or the disposable acrylic specula. The material production and manufacturing phase contributed most heavily to the total life cycle carbon footprint of the acrylic speculum, whereas the use and reprocessing phase contributed most to the carbon footprints of both stainless steel specula. CONCLUSION: The use of disposable vaginal specula is associated with increased greenhouse gas equivalents compared with reusable alternatives with no significant difference in clinical utility. These findings can be used to inform decision-making by healthcare systems, because they weigh a wide range of considerations in making final purchase decisions; similar analytic methods can and should be applied to other components of health systems' waste streams.",2020,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.007,223,2,225.e1-225.e7,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,Humans and carbon footprint and *Carbon Footprint and *Surgical Instruments and disposable and Disposable Equipment/*economics and life cycle assessment and reprocessing and reusable and speculum and sterilization and Sterilization/*economics,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates factors that might influence decision making regarding prophylactic surgeries among women with BRCA mutations. STUDY DESIGN: Unaffected BRCA mutation carriers who were counseled at our center and either underwent prophylactic surgery or participated in a high-risk surveillance program at our institution from 1998 through 2010 were included in the study. Medical records were reviewed and data collected included age, family history, parity, mutation type, history of breast biopsy or cosmetic surgery, and uptake of prophylactic surgeries. RESULTS: Among 136 unaffected women with BRCA mutations, uptake of RRM was 42% and uptake of RRBSO was 52%. Family history of first- and second-degree relatives being deceased from breast cancer was predictive of uptake of RRM and of RRBSO (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; P = .005; and OR, 15.8; P = .023, respectively), and history of a mother lost to pelvic cancer was predictive of uptake of RRBSO (OR, 7.9; P = .001). Parity also predicted both RRM and RRBSO uptake (OR, 4.2; P = .001; and OR, 5.4; P = .003, respectively). Age at the time of genetic testing and history of breast biopsy or cosmetic surgery were not predictive of RRM uptake. CONCLUSION: Perceptions of cancer risk are heavily influenced by particular features of an individual's family history and may be motivators in preventive surgery more than actual cancer risk estimations themselves.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all women undergoing a trial of labor after a prior low transverse cesarean delivery in our institution between 1987 and 2004. Patients were categorized according to birth weight (less than 3,500 g [group 1, reference], 3,500-3,999 g [group 2], and 4,000 g or more [group 3]) and prior vaginal delivery. The rates of failed trial of labor, uterine rupture, shoulder dystocia, and third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration were compared among groups. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to adjust for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of 2,586 women, 1,519 (59%), 798 (31%), and 269 (10%) were included in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Birth weight was directly correlated to the rate of failed trial of labor (19%, 28%, and 38% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; P<.01), uterine rupture (0.9%, 1.8%, and 2.6%; P<.05), shoulder dystocia (0.3%, 1.6%, and 7.8%; P<.01), and third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration (5%, 7%, and 12%; P<.01). After adjustment for confounding variables, birth weight of 4,000 g or more remained associated with uterine rupture (odds ratio [OR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-6.85), failed trial of labor (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.82-3.34), shoulder dystocia (OR 25.13, 95% CI 9.31-67.86), and third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.66-4.19). CONCLUSION: Birth weight and specifically macrosomia are linked with failed trial of labor, uterine rupture, shoulder dystocia, and third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration in women who underwent prior cesarean delivery.

Zuckerwise_2020_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Outcomes following a clinical algorithm allowing for delayed hysterectomy in the management of severe placenta accreta spectrum,"Zuckerwise, Lisa C. and Craig, Amanda M. and Newton, J. M. and Zhao, Shillin and Bennett, Kelly A. and Crispens, Marta A.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of placenta accreta spectrum is rising. Management is most commonly with cesarean hysterectomy. These deliveries often are complicated by massive hemorrhage, urinary tract injury, and admission to the intensive care unit. Up to 60% of patients require transfusion of <e2><89><a5>4 units of packed red blood cells. There is also a significant risk of death of up to 7%. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of patients with antenatal diagnosis of placenta percreta that was managed with delayed hysterectomy as compared with those patients who underwent immediate cesarean hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective study of all patients with an antepartum diagnosis of placenta percreta at our large academic institution from January 1, 2012, to May 30, 2018. Patients were treated according to standard clinical practice that included scheduled cesarean delivery at 34-35 weeks gestation and intraoperative multidisciplinary decision-making regarding immediate vs delayed hysterectomy. In cases of delayed hysterectomy, the hysterotomy for cesarean birth used a fetal surgery technique to minimize blood loss, with a plan for hysterectomy 4-6 weeks after delivery. We collected data regarding demographics, maternal comorbidities, time to interval hysterectomy, blood loss, need for transfusion, occurrence of urinary tract injury and other maternal complications, and maternal and fetal mortality rates. Descriptive statistics were performed, and Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-square tests were used as appropriate. RESULTS: We identified 49 patients with an antepartum diagnosis of placenta percreta who were treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center during the specified period. Of these patients, 34 were confirmed to have severe placenta accreta spectrum, defined as increta or percreta at the time of delivery. Delayed hysterectomy was performed in 14 patients: 9 as scheduled and 5 before the scheduled date. Immediate cesarean hysterectomy was completed in 20 patients: 16 because of intraoperative assessment of resectability and 4 because of preoperative or intraoperative bleeding. The median (interquartile range) estimated blood loss at delayed hysterectomy of 750 mL (650-1450 mL) and the sum total for delivery and delayed hysterectomy of 1300 mL (70 -2150 mL) were significantly lower than the estimated blood loss at immediate hysterectomy of 3000 mL (2375-4250 mL; P<.01 and P=.037, respectively). The median (interquartile range) units of packed red blood cells that were transfused at delayed hysterectomy was 0 (0-2 units), which was significantly lower than units transfused at immediate cesarean hysterectomy (4 units [2-8.25 units]; P<.01). Nine of 20 patients (45%) required transfusion of <e2><89><a5>4 units of red blood cells at immediate cesarean hysterectomy, whereas only 2 of 14 patients (14.2%) required transfusion of <e2><89><a5>4 units of red blood cells at the time of delayed hysterectomy (P=.016). There was 1 maternal death in each group, which were incidences of 7% and 5% in the delayed and immediate hysterectomy patients, respectively.

Brabbing.Goldstein_2018_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Dilemmas in genetic counseling for low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci detected on prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis,"Brabbing-Goldstein, Dana and Reches, Adi and Svirsky, Ran and Bar-Shira, Anat and Yaron, Yuval",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Chromosomal microarray analysis is standard of care in fetuses with malformations, detecting clinically significant copy number variants in 5-7% of cases over conventional karyotyping. However, it also detects variants of uncertain significance in 1.6-4.2% of the cases, some of which are low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci. The interpretation of these variants in pregnancy is particularly challenging because the significance is often unclear and the clinical implications may be difficult to predict. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe counseling dilemmas regarding low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci that are detected by prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis. STUDY DESIGN: During the study period (January 2014 to December 2015), 700 prenatal chromosomal microarray analyses were performed. Cases were categorized as ""indicated"" (n=375) if there were abnormal sonographic findings or suggestive medical history and ""patient choice"" (n=325) in the presence of a structurally normal fetus with no other particular indication. The laboratory reported on copy number variants <e2><89><a5>400 Kb in size in loci known to be associated with genetic syndromes and <e2><89><a5>1 Mb in other areas of genome. Results were classified as gross aneuploidy, copy number variants, and normal. Copy number variants were categorized according to the American College of Medical Genetics standards and guidelines: pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance, or benign. Variants of uncertain significance were further subdivided into categories of likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance with no subclassification, and likely benign. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of Chi square test and Fisher's exact test to compare intergroup differences in incidence of the different result categories and demographic data. RESULTS: Patient choice cases became more prevalent with time (35.5% in the beginning of the study, compared with 48.4% at the end of the study period). Clinically significant copy number variants were found in 14 of 375 (3.7%) of indicated cases vs only 2 of 325 (0.6%) of patient choice cases (P=.009). All ""likely benign"" variants consisted of low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci. The incidence thereof was similar between the indicated and patient choice groups (3.7% vs 3.4%; P=.85). In the indicated group, some variants of uncertain significance may have contributed to the abnormal anatomic findings. Conversely, in the patient choice group, the finding of low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci was often unexpected and confounding for prospective parents. CONCLUSION: Prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis added clinically significant information in both groups. However, it also detected low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci in approximately 3.5% of the cases. This fact should be conveyed during pretest counseling to allow patients to make informed choices, particularly when chromosomal microarray is to be performed for patient choice.",2018,10.1016/j.ajog.2017.11.559,218,2,247.e1-247.e12,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Adult and Patient Participation and Pregnancy and Genetic Markers and Decision Making/ethics and *Microarray Analysis and genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis and Truth Disclosure/ethics and Professional-Patient Relations/ethics and *Chromosome Aberrations and *Penetrance and chromosomal microarray analysis and Chromosome Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics and copy number variant and DNA Copy Number Variations and Genetic Counseling/*ethics/methods and low-penetrance neuro-susceptibility loci and Nervous System Diseases/congenital/*diagnosis/genetics and Prenatal Diagnosis/*ethics/methods and variant of uncertain significance,NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Combs_2020_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Special statement: Proposed quality metrics to assess accuracy of prenatal detection of congenital heart defects,"Combs, C. Andrew and Hameed, Afshan B. and Friedman, Alexander M. and Hoskins, Iffath Abbasi",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"Congenital heart defects are a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Accurate prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart defects can reduce morbidity and mortality by improving prenatal care, facilitating predelivery pediatric cardiology consultation, and directing delivery to facilities with resources to manage the complex medical and surgical needs of newborns with congenital heart defects. Unfortunately, less than one half of congenital heart defect cases are detected prenatally, resulting in lost opportunities for counseling, shared decision-making, and delivery at an appropriate facility. Quality improvement initiatives to improve prenatal congenital heart defects detection depend on the ability to measure the rate of detection at the level of providers, facilities, or populations, but no standard metric exists for measuring the detection of congenital heart defects at any level. The need for such a metric was recognized at a Cooperative Workshop held at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which recommended the development of a quality metric to assess the rate of prenatal detection of clinically significant congenital heart defects. In this paper, we propose potential quality metrics to measure prenatal detection of critical congenital heart defects, defined as defects with a high rate of morbidity or mortality or that require surgery or tertiary follow-up. One metric is based on a retrospective approach, assessing whether postnatally diagnosed congenital heart defects had been identified prenatally. Other metrics are based on a prospective approach, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart defects by comparing prenatal ultrasound findings with newborn findings. Potential applications, limitations, challenges, barriers, and value for both approaches are discussed. We conclude that future development of these metrics will depend on an expansion of the International Classification of Diseases system to include specific codes that distinguish fetal congenital heart defects from newborn congenital heart defects and on the development of record systems that facilitate the linkage of fetal records (in the maternal chart) with newborn records.",2020,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.040,222,6,B2-B9,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Retrospective Studies and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prospective Studies and Pregnancy and False Positive Reactions and Infant, Newborn and *Quality Indicators, Health Care and False Negative Reactions and Heart Defects, Congenital/*diagnostic imaging and congenital heart defects and quality metric and Ultrasonography, Prenatal and Fetal Heart/*diagnostic imaging and neonatal morbidity and neonatal mortality",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
McKinney_2016_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,The impact of fetal growth restriction on latency in the setting of expectant management of preeclampsia,"McKinney, David and Boyd, Heather and Langager, Amanda and Oswald, Michael and Pfister, Abbey and Warshak, Carri R.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction is a common complication of preeclampsia. Expectant management for qualifying patients has been found to have acceptable maternal safety while improving neonatal outcomes. Whether fetal growth restriction influences the duration of latency during expectant management of preeclampsia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether fetal growth restriction is associated with a reduced interval to delivery in women with preeclampsia being expectantly managed prior to 34 weeks. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort of singleton, live-born, nonanomalous deliveries at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center between 2008 and 2013. Patients were included in our analysis if they were diagnosed with preeclampsia prior to 34 completed weeks and if the initial management plan was to pursue expectant management beyond administration of steroids for fetal lung maturity. Two study groups were determined based on the presence or absence of fetal growth restriction. Patients were delivered when they developed persistent neurological symptoms, severe hypertension refractory to medical therapy, renal insufficiency, nonreassuring fetal status, pulmonary edema, or hemolysis elevated liver low platelet syndrome or when they reached 37 weeks if they remained stable without any other indication for delivery. Our primary outcome was the interval from diagnosis of preeclampsia to delivery, measured in days. Secondary outcomes included indications for delivery, rates of induction and cesarean delivery, development of severe morbidities of preeclampsia, and select neonatal outcomes. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis comparing those with fetal growth restriction with those with normally grown fetuses to determine whether there is an association between fetal growth restriction and a shortened interval to delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission, prolonged neonatal stay, and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: A total of 851 patients met the criteria for preeclampsia, of which 199 met inclusion criteria, 139 (69%) with normal growth, and 60 (31%) with fetal growth restriction. Interval to delivery was significantly shorter in women with fetal growth restriction, median (interquartile range) of 3 (1.6) days vs normal growth, 5 (2.12) days, P < .001. The association between fetal growth restriction and latency less than 7 days remained significant, even after post hoc analysis controlling for confounding variables (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66 [95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.47]). There were no differences in the development of severe disease (85.9 vs 91.7%, P = .26), need for intravenous antihypertensive medications (47.1 vs 46.7%, P = .96), and the development of severe complications of preeclampsia (51.1 vs 42.9%, P = .30) in normally grown and growth-restricted fetuses, respectively. Fewer women with fetal growth restriction attained their scheduled delivery date, 3 of 60 (5.0%), compared with normally grown fetuses,12 of 139 (15.7%), P = .03. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal length of stay, and neonatal mortality were higher when there was fetal growth restriction; however, after a logistic regression analysis, these associations were no longer significant. CONCLUSION: Fetal growth restriction is associated with a shortened interval to delivery in women undergoing expectant management of preeclampsia when disease is diagnosed prior to 34 weeks. These data may be helpful in counseling patients regarding the expected duration of pregnancy, guiding decision making regarding administration of steroids and determining the need for maternal transport.",2016,10.1016/j.ajog.2015.12.050,214,3,395.e1-7,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Pregnancy and Infant, Newborn and Gestational Age and fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia and *Watchful Waiting and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and Labor, Induced/*statistics & numerical data and *Birth Weight and expectant management of preeclampsia and Fetal Growth Retardation/*etiology and Pre-Eclampsia/diagnosis/*therapy",NA,NA,2016/03//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, conclusive data regarding the clinical validity and utility of this screening tool, both for the originally included common autosomal and sex-chromosomal aneuploidies as well as the more recently added chromosomal microdeletion syndromes, have lagged behind. Thus, there is a continued need to educate clinicians and patients about the current benefits and limitations of this screening tool to inform pre- and posttest counseling, pre/perinatal decision making, and medical risk assessment/management. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the positive predictive value and false-positive rates for different chromosomal abnormalities identified by cell-free fetal DNA screening using a large data set of diagnostic testing results on invasive samples submitted to the laboratory for confirmatory studies. STUDY DESIGN: We tested 712 patient samples sent to our laboratory to confirm a cell-free fetal DNA screening result, indicating high risk for a chromosome abnormality. We compiled data from all cases in which the indication for confirmatory testing was a positive cell-free fetal DNA screen, including the common trisomies, sex chromosomal aneuploidies, microdeletion syndromes, and other large genome-wide copy number abnormalities. Testing modalities included fluorescence in situ hybridization, G-banded karyotype, and/or chromosomal microarray analysis performed on chorionic villus samples, amniotic fluid, or postnatally obtained blood samples. Positive predictive values and false-positive rates were calculated from tabulated data. RESULTS: The positive predictive values for trisomy 13, 18, and 21 were consistent with previous reports at 45%, 76%, and 84%, respectively. For the microdeletion syndrome regions, positive predictive values ranged from 0% for detection of Cri-du-Chat syndrome and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome to 14% for 1p36 deletion syndrome and 21% for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Detection of sex chromosomal aneuploidies had positive predictive values of 26% for monosomy X, 50% for 47,XXX, and 86% for 47,XXY. CONCLUSION: The positive predictive values for detection of common autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploidies by cell-free fetal DNA screening were comparable with other studies. Identification of microdeletions was associated with lower positive predictive values and higher false-positive rates, likely because of the low prevalence of the individual targeted microdeletion syndromes in the general population. Although the obtained positive predictive values compare favorably with those seen in traditional screening approaches for common aneuploidies, they highlight the importance of educating clinicians and patients on the limitations of cell-free fetal DNA screening tests. Improvement of the cell-free fetal DNA screening technology and continued monitoring of its performance after introduction into clinical practice will be important to fully establish its clinical utility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated with removal of normal ovaries at the time of hysterectomy for benign indication in women age <51 years. STUDY DESIGN: Demographics, indication for surgery, adnexal pathology, and surgical approach were analyzed for hysterectomies from a voluntary, statewide surgical quality collaborative. Cases were excluded if the surgical indication was cancer, pelvic mass, or obstetric, or if age was >50 years. Cases were categorized according to pathology of the adnexal specimen as cancer, benign findings, normal ovary, or no ovarian specimen. Variables including demographics, medical comorbidities, and surgical characteristics were analyzed to identify characteristics associated with oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy. A logistic regression model was then developed to identify factors independently associated with removal of normal ovaries. RESULTS: A total of 6789 subjects were included. Oophorectomy was performed in 44.2% of women (n = 3002). In all, 23.1% (n = 1565) had normal ovaries on pathology. Incidental ovarian cancer was found in 0.2% (n = 12), and benign pathology was found in 21% (n = 1425). Removal of normal ovaries was less likely when the surgical approach was vaginal (18%) as opposed to laparoscopic (23.1%) or abdominal (26.0%). With adjustment, abdominal (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.09]) and laparoscopic (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.08-1.50) approach showed significantly higher odds of normal ovary removal compared to vaginal hysterectomy. Age 46-50 years was also significantly associated (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07). Surgical indications associated with increased oophorectomy with normal resultant pathology were family history of cancer (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.94-4.94), endometrial hyperplasia (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.38-4.01), endometriosis (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.30-3.09), and cervical dysplasia (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.28). CONCLUSION: Removal of histologically normal ovaries is performed in nearly 1 of every 4 women age <51 years undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications. Factors associated include age closer to menopause, surgical approach, and certain indications for hysterectomy.

Although the adverse health outcomes that the examination averts were not delineated, the organization stated that it helps establish open communication between patients and physicians. Recent surveys have focused on obstetrician-gynecologists' attitudes and beliefs about the examination, but the perspectives of women have not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to better understand women's beliefs about the purpose and value of routine pelvic examinations. STUDY DESIGN: We completed structured interviews with 262 women who were 21-65 years old who agreed to participate in a 50-minute interview about cervical cancer screening. Recruitment took place in outpatient women's clinics at a public hospital and an academic medical center in San Francisco, CA. Women were shown an illustration of a bimanual pelvic examination and asked a series of closed-ended questions: if they knew why it was performed, if it reassured them of their health, and if they believed it helped establish open communication with their provider. Women were asked an open-ended question about their perception of the examination's purpose. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify demographic predictors of responses. RESULTS: Approximately one-half of the participants (56%) stated that they knew the examination's purpose. The most frequently cited reason was assurance of normalcy. Most of participants (82%) believed that the examination reassured them of their health. Approximately two-thirds of the participants (62%) believed that the examination helps establish open communication with their provider. In multivariate analyses, older age (<e2><89><a5>45 years) independently predicted a higher likelihood of a belief that they knew the examination's purpose (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.6) and a belief that it facilitates open communication (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.9). Non-white race also was associated with a belief that the examination helps facilitate open communication between patients and providers (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.1). CONCLUSION: Approximately one-half of the women who participated in our study reported not knowing the purpose of the pelvic examination, yet most of them believed it to be of some value, especially reassurance of health.

Jelovsek_2018_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Predicting risk of pelvic floor disorders 12 and 20 years after delivery,"Jelovsek, J. Eric and Chagin, Kevin and Gyhagen, Maria and Hagen, Suzanne and Wilson, Don and Kattan, Michael W. and Elders, Andrew and Barber, Matthew D. and Areskoug, Bjorn and MacArthur, Christine and Milsom, Ian",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Little progress has been made in the prevention of pelvic floor disorders, despite their significant health and economic impact. The identification of women who are at risk remains a key element in targeting prevention and planning health resource allocation strategies. Although events around the time of childbirth are recognized clinically as important predictors, it is difficult to counsel women and to intervene around the time of childbirth because of an inability to convey a patient's risk accurately in the presence of multiple risk factors and the long time lapse, which is often decades, between obstetric events and the onset of pelvic floor disorders later in life. Prediction models and scoring systems have been used in other areas of medicine to identify patients who are at risk for chronic diseases. Models have been developed for use before delivery that predict short-term risk of pelvic floor disorders after childbirth, but no models that predict long-term risk exist. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use variables that are known before and during childbirth to develop and validate prognostic models that will estimate the risks of these disorders 12 and 20 years after delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Obstetric variables were collected from 2 cohorts: (1) women who gave birth in the United Kingdom and New Zealand (n=3763) and (2) women from the Swedish Medical Birth Register (n=4991). Pelvic floor disorders were self-reported 12 years after childbirth in the United Kingdom/New Zealand cohort and 20 years after childbirth in the Swedish Register. The cohorts were split so that data during the first half of the cohort's time period were used to fit prediction models, and validation was performed from the second half (temporal validation). Because there is currently no consensus on how to best define pelvic floor disorders from a patient's perspective, we chose to fit the data for each model using multiple outcome definitions for prolapse, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, <e2><89><a5>1 pelvic floor disorder, and <e2><89><a5>2 pelvic floor disorders. Model accuracy was measured in the following manner: (1) by ranking an individual's risk among all subjects in the cohort (discrimination) with the use of a concordance index and (2) by observing whether the predicted probability was too high or low (calibration) at a range of predicted probabilities with the use of visual plots. RESULTS: Models were able to discriminate between women who experienced bothersome symptoms or received treatment at 12 and 20 years, respectively, for pelvic organ prolapse (concordance indices, 0.570, 0.627), urinary incontinence (concordance indices, 0.653, 0.689), fecal incontinence (concordance indices, 0.618, 0.676), <e2><89><a5>1 pelvic floor disorders (concordance indices, 0.639, 0.675), and <e2><89><a5>2 pelvic floor disorders (concordance indices, 0.635, 0.619). Route of delivery and family history of each pelvic floor disorder were strong predictors in most models. Urinary incontinence before and during the index pregnancy was a strong predictor for the development of all pelvic floor disorders in most models 12 years after delivery. The 12- and 20-year bothersome symptoms or treatment for prolapse models were accurate when predictions were provided for risk from 0% to approximately 15%. The 12- and 20-year primiparous model began to over predict when risk rates reached 20%. When we predicted bothersome symptoms or treatment for urinary incontinence, the 12-year models were accurate when predictions ranged from approximately 5-60%; the 20-year primiparous models were accurate from 5% and 80%. For bothersome symptoms or treatment for fecal incontinence, the 12- and 20-year models were accurate from 1-15% risk and began to over predict at rates at >15% and 20%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Models may provide an opportunity before birth to identify women who are at low risk of the development of pelvic floor disorders and may provide institute prevention strategies such as pelvic floor muscle training, weight control, or elective cesarean section for women who are at higher risk.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of all women with singleton pregnancies who presented with PTL at less than 34 + 0 weeks and underwent sonographic measurement of CL in a tertiary medical center between 2007 and 2012. The predictive accuracy of CL for PTD was stratified by GA at presentation. RESULTS: Overall, 1077 women who presented with PTL have had sonographic measurement of CL and met the study inclusion criteria. Of those, 223 (20.7%) presented at 24 + 0-26 + 6 weeks (group 1), 274 (25.4%) at 27 + 0-29 + 6 weeks (group 2), 283 (26.3%) at 30 + 0-31 + 6 weeks (group 3), and 297 (27.6%) at 32 + 0-33 + 6 weeks (group 4). The overall performance CL as a predictive test for PTD was similar in the 4 GA groups, as reflected by the similar degree of correlation between CL with the examination to delivery interval (r = 0.27, r = 0.26, r = 0.28, and r = 0.29, respectively, P = .8), the similar area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (0.641-0.690, 0.631-0.698, 0.643-0.654, and 0.678-0.698, respectively, P = .7), and a similar decrease in the risk of PTD of 5-10% for each additional millimeter of CL. The optimal cutoff of CL, however, was affected by GA at presentation, so that a higher cutoff of CL was needed to achieve a target negative predictive value for delivery within 14 days from presentation for women who presented later in pregnancy. The optimal thresholds to maximize the negative predictive value for delivery within 14 days were 36 mm, 32.5 mm, 24 mm and 20.5 mm for women who presented at 32 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks, 30 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks, 27 + 0 to 29 + 6 weeks and 24 + 0 to 26 + 6, respectively.

In pregnancies identified as being at high risk for preeclampsia by such screening, administration of aspirin (150 mg/d from 11 to 14 weeks' gestation to 36 weeks) reduces the rate of early preeclampsia by about 90% and preterm preeclampsia by about 60%. Recording of maternal history and blood pressure are part of routine prenatal care, but measurement of uterine artery pulsatility index and placental growth factor require additional costs. OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of carrying out first-stage screening in the whole population by maternal factors alone or a combination of maternal factors, mean arterial pressure and uterine artery pulsatility index or maternal factors, mean arterial pressure, and placental growth factor and proceeding to second-stage screening by the triple test only for a subgroup of the population selected on the basis of the risk derived from first-stage screening. STUDY DESIGN: The data for this study were derived from prospective nonintervention screening for preeclampsia at 11(+0) to 13(+6) weeks' gestation in 61,174 singleton pregnancies. Patient-specific risks of delivery with preeclampsia at <37 and <32 weeks' gestation were calculated using the competing risks model to combine the prior distribution of the gestational age at delivery with preeclampsia, obtained from maternal characteristics and medical history, with various combinations of multiple of the median values of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor. We estimated the detection rate of preterm-preeclampsia and early-preeclampsia at overall screen-positive rate of 10%, 15%, and 20% from a policy in which first-stage screening of the whole population is carried out by some of the components of the triple test and second-stage screening by the full triple test on women selected on the basis of results from first-stage screening. RESULTS: If the method of first-stage screening is maternal factors, then measurements of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor can be reserved for only 70% of the population, achieving similar detection rate and screen-positive rate as with screening the whole population with the triple test. In the case of first-stage screening by maternal factors, mean arterial pressure, and uterine artery pulsatility index, then measurement of placental growth factor can be reserved for only 30-40% of the population, and if first-stage screening is by maternal factors, mean arterial pressure, and placental growth factor, measurement of uterine artery pulsatility index can be reserved for only 20-30% of the population. Empirical results were consistent with model-based performance. CONCLUSION: Two-stage screening and biomarker testing for only part of the population will have financial benefits over conducting the test for the entire population.",2019,10.1016/j.ajog.2018.10.092,220,2,197.e1-197.e11,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Bayes theorem and Humans and Female and Adult and Risk Assessment and Pregnancy and Decision Support Techniques and Bayes Theorem and Biomarkers/blood and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Pregnancy Trimester, First and preeclampsia and aspirin and Prenatal Care/*methods and mean arterial pressure and uterine artery Doppler and contingent screening and first-trimester screening and placental growth factor and Pre-Eclampsia/blood/*diagnosis and survival model",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Clark_2017_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,The limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia,"Clark, Steven L. and Hamilton, Emily F. and Garite, Thomas J. and Timmins, Audra and Warrick, Philip A. and Smith, Samuel",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Despite intensive efforts directed at initial training in fetal heart rate interpretation, continuing medical education, board certification/recertification, team training, and the development of specific protocols for the management of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, the goals of consistently preventing hypoxia-induced fetal metabolic acidemia and neurologic injury remain elusive. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate a recently published algorithm for the management of category II fetal heart rate tracings, to examine reasons for the birth of infants with significant metabolic acidemia despite the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and to examine critically the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia. STUDY DESIGN: The potential performance of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring under ideal circumstances was evaluated in an outcomes-blinded examination fetal heart rate tracing of infants with metabolic acidemia at birth (base deficit, >12) and matched control infants (base deficit, <8) under the following conditions: (1) expert primary interpretation, (2) use of a published algorithm that was developed and endorsed by a large group of national experts, (3) assumption of a 30-minute period of evaluation for noncritical category II fetal heart rate tracings, followed by delivery within 30 minutes, (4) evaluation without the need to provide patient care simultaneously, and (5) comparison of results under these circumstances with those achieved in actual clinical practice. RESULTS: During the study period, 120 infants were identified with an arterial cord blood base deficit of >12 mM/L. Matched control infants were not demographically different from subjects. In actual practice, operative intervention on the basis of an abnormal fetal heart rate tracings occurred in 36 of 120 fetuses (30.0%) with metabolic acidemia. Based on expert, algorithm-assisted reviews, 55 of 120 patients with acidemia (45.8%) were judged to need operative intervention for abnormal fetal heart rate tracings. This difference was significant (P=.016). In infants who were born with a base deficit of >12 mM/L in which blinded, algorithm-assisted expert review indicated the need for operative delivery, the decision for delivery would have been made an average of 131 minutes before the actual delivery. The rate of expert intervention for fetal heart rate concerns in the nonacidemic control group (22/120; 18.3%) was similar to the actual intervention rate (23/120; 19.2%; P=1.0) Expert review did not mandate earlier delivery in 65 of 120 patients with metabolic acidemia. The primary features of these 65 cases included the occurrence of sentinel events with prolonged deceleration just before delivery, the rapid deterioration of nonemergent category II fetal heart rate tracings before realistic time frames for recognition and intervention, and the failure of recognized fetal heart rate patterns such as variability to identify metabolic acidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Expert, algorithm-assisted fetal heart rate interpretation has the potential to improve standard clinical performance by facilitating significantly earlier recognition of some tracings that are associated with metabolic acidemia without increasing the rate of operative intervention. However, this improvement is modest. Of infants who are born with metabolic acidemia, only approximately one-half potentially could be identified and have delivery expedited even under ideal circumstances, which are probably not realistic in current US practice. This represents the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring performance. Additional technologies will be necessary if the goal of the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia is to be realized.",2017,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.10.009,216,2,163.e1-163.e6,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Case-Control Studies and Pregnancy and Infant, Newborn and *Algorithms and Cesarean Section and Extraction, Obstetrical and Clinical Decision-Making and Delivery, Obstetric/*methods and Heart Rate, Fetal and Acidosis/etiology/*prevention & control and Cardiotocography/*methods and category II and fetal heart rate monitoring and Hypoxia/complications/*diagnosis and Infant, Newborn, Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control and metabolic acidemia",NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lipschuetz_2020_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean deliveries using machine learning,"Lipschuetz, Michal and Guedalia, Joshua and Rottenstreich, Amihai and Novoselsky Persky, Michal and Cohen, Sarah M. and Kabiri, Doron and Levin, Gabriel and Yagel, Simcha and Unger, Ron and Sompolinsky, Yishai",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Efforts to reduce cesarean delivery rates to 12-15% have been undertaken worldwide. Special focus has been directed towards parturients who undergo a trial of labor after cesarean delivery to reduce the burden of repeated cesarean deliveries. Complication rates are lowest when a vaginal birth is achieved and highest when an unplanned cesarean delivery is performed, which emphasizes the need to assess, in advance, the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery. Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery calculators have been developed in different populations; however, some limitations to their implementation into clinical practice have been described. Machine-learning methods enable investigation of large-scale datasets with input combinations that traditional statistical analysis tools have difficulty processing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using machine-learning methods to predict a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: The electronic medical records of singleton, term labors during a 12-year period in a tertiary referral center were analyzed. With the use of gradient boosting, models that incorporated multiple maternal and fetal features were created to predict successful vaginal birth in parturients who undergo a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. One model was created to provide a personalized risk score for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery with the use of features that are available as early as the first antenatal visit; a second model was created that reassesses this score after features are added that are available only in proximity to delivery. RESULTS: A cohort of 9888 parturients with 1 previous cesarean delivery was identified, of which 75.6% of parturients (n=7473) attempted a trial of labor, with a success rate of 88%. A machine-learning-based model to predict when vaginal delivery would be successful was developed. When features that are available at the first antenatal visit are used, the model showed a receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve of 0.745 (95% confidence interval, 0.728-0.762) that increased to 0.793 (95% confidence interval, 0.778-0.808) when features that are available in proximity to the delivery process were added. Additionally, for the later model, a risk stratification tool was built to allocate parturients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups for failed trial of labor after cesarean delivery. The low- and medium-risk groups (42.4% and 25.6% of parturients, respectively) showed a success rate of 97.3% and 90.9%, respectively. The high-risk group (32.1%) had a vaginal delivery success rate of 73.3%. Application of the model to a cohort of parturients who elected a repeat cesarean delivery (n=2145) demonstrated that 31% of these parturients would have been allocated to the low- and medium-risk groups had a trial of labor been attempted. CONCLUSION: Trial of labor after cesarean delivery is safe for most parturients. Success rates are high, even in a population with high rates of trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Application of a machine-learning algorithm to assign a personalized risk score for a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery may help in decision-making and contribute to a reduction in cesarean delivery rates. Parturient allocation to risk groups may help delivery process management.",2020,10.1016/j.ajog.2019.12.267,222,6,613.e1-613.e12,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"prediction and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Feasibility Studies and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and Parity and Area Under Curve and ROC Curve and Infant, Newborn and Tertiary Care Centers and Delivery, Obstetric and *Machine Learning and Gestational Age and *Trial of Labor and machine-learning and Organ Size and personalized and Fetal Weight and trial of labor and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and Extraction, Obstetrical/statistics & numerical data and Uterine Rupture/epidemiology and Apgar Score and Head/anatomy & histology and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery and Vaginal Birth after Cesarean/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Price_2017_Amjoofobangy,JOUR,Social determinants of access to minimally invasive hysterectomy: reevaluating the relationship between race and route of hysterectomy for benign disease,"Price, Joan T. and Zimmerman, Lilli D. and Koelper, Nathan C. and Sammel, Mary D. and Lee, Sonya and Butts, Samantha F.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,"BACKGROUND: Racial and socioeconomic disparities exist in access to medical and surgical care. Studies of national databases have demonstrated disparities in route of hysterectomy for benign indications, but have not been able to adjust for patient-level factors that affect surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether access to minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign indications is differential according to race independent of the effects of relevant subject-level confounding factors. The secondary study objective was to determine the association between socioeconomic status and ethnicity and access to minimally invasive hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study evaluated factors associated with minimally invasive hysterectomies performed for fibroids and/or abnormal uterine bleeding from 2010 through 2013 at 3 hospitals within an academic university health system in Philadelphia, PA. Univariate tests of association and multivariable logistic regression identified factors significantly associated with minimally invasive hysterectomy compared to the odds of treatment with the referent approach of abdominal hysterectomy. RESULTS: Of 1746 hysterectomies evaluated meeting study inclusion criteria, 861 (49%) were performed abdominally, 248 (14%) vaginally, 310 (18%) laparoscopically, and 327 (19%) with robot assistance. In univariate analysis, African American race (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.97) and Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.00) were associated with lower odds of any minimally invasive hysterectomy relative to abdominal hysterectomy. In analyses adjusted for age, body mass index, income quartile, obstetrical and surgical history, uterine weight, and additional confounding factors, African American race was no longer a risk factor for reduced minimally invasive hysterectomy (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.10), while Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.76) and Medicaid enrollment (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.90) were associated with significantly lower odds of treatment with any minimally invasive hysterectomy. In adjusted analyses, African American women had nearly half the odds of receiving robot-assisted hysterectomy compared to whites (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95%, confidence interval 0.39-0.82), while no differences were noted with other hysterectomy routes. Medicaid enrollment (compared to private insurance; odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.94) and lowest income quartile (compared to highest income quartile; odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.85) were also associated with diminished odds of robot-assisted hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: When accounting for the effect of numerous pertinent demographic and clinical factors, the odds of undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy were diminished in women of Hispanic ethnicity and in those enrolled in Medicaid but were not discrepant along racial lines. However, both racial and socioeconomic disparities were observed with respect to access to robot-assisted hysterectomy despite the availability of robotic assistance in all hospitals treating the study population. Strategies to ensure equal access to all minimally invasive routes for all women should be explored to align delivery of care with the evidence supporting the broad implementation of these procedures as safe, cost-effective, and highly acceptable to patients.",2017,10.1016/j.ajog.2017.07.036,217,5,572.e1-572.e10,eng,1097-6868 0002-9378,"United States and Medicaid and Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Logistic Models and Insurance, Health and disparities and Risk Factors and Body Mass Index and race and Odds Ratio and Age Factors and Racial Groups and Philadelphia and *Health Services Accessibility and insurance and socioeconomic status and African Americans/statistics & numerical data and Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data and Whites/statistics & numerical data and Leiomyoma/*surgery and Uterine Neoplasms/*surgery and hysterectomy and Hysterectomy/*methods and Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data and ethnicity and Hysterectomy, Vaginal/statistics & numerical data and income and Laparoscopy/*statistics & numerical data and minimally invasive and Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data and Robotic Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data and Uterine Hemorrhage/*surgery",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,Am J Obstet Gynecol,NA,NA,NA,NA
