Tran_2019_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Deep learning as a predictive tool for fetal heart pregnancy following time-lapse incubation and blastocyst transfer,"Tran, D. and Cooke, S. and Illingworth, P. J. and Gardner, D. K.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Can a deep learning model predict the probability of pregnancy with fetal heart (FH) from time-lapse videos? SUMMARY ANSWER: We created a deep learning model named IVY, which was an objective and fully automated system that predicts the probability of FH pregnancy directly from raw time-lapse videos without the need for any manual morphokinetic annotation or blastocyst morphology assessment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The contribution of time-lapse imaging in effective embryo selection is promising. Existing algorithms for the analysis of time-lapse imaging are based on morphology and morphokinetic parameters that require subjective human annotation and thus have intrinsic inter-reader and intra-reader variability. Deep learning offers promise for the automation and standardization of embryo selection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective analysis of time-lapse videos and clinical outcomes of 10 638 embryos from eight different IVF clinics, across four different countries, between January 2014 and December 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The deep learning model was trained using time-lapse videos with known FH pregnancy outcome to perform a binary classification task of predicting the probability of pregnancy with FH given time-lapse video sequence. The predictive power of the model was measured using the average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve over 5-fold stratified cross-validation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The deep learning model was able to predict FH pregnancy from time-lapse videos with an AUC of 0.93 [95% CI 0.92-0.94] in 5-fold stratified cross-validation. A hold-out validation test across eight laboratories showed that the AUC was reproducible, ranging from 0.95 to 0.90 across different laboratories with different culture and laboratory processes. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is a retrospective analysis demonstrating that the deep learning model has a high level of predictability of the likelihood that an embryo will implant. The clinical impacts of these findings are still uncertain. Further studies, including prospective randomized controlled trials, are required to evaluate the clinical significance of this deep learning model. The time-lapse videos collected for training and validation are Day 5 embryos; hence, additional adjustment would need to be made for the model to be used in the context of Day 3 transfer. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The high predictive value for embryo implantation obtained by the deep learning model may improve the effectiveness of previous approaches used for time-lapse imaging in embryo selection. This may improve the prioritization of the most viable embryo for a single embryo transfer. The deep learning model may also prove to be useful in providing the optimal order for subsequent transfers of cryopreserved embryos.

Some_2013_Reprheal,JOUR,How decision for seeking maternal care is made--a qualitative study in two rural medical districts of Burkina Faso,"Some, Donmozoun Telesphore and Sombie, Issiaka and Meda, Nicolas",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Delay in decision-making to use skilled care during pregnancy and childbirth is an important factor for maternal death in many developing countries. This paper examines how decisions for maternal care are made in two rural communities in Burkina Faso. METHODS: Focus group discussions (FGDs) and individual interviews (IDIs)) were used to collect information with 30 women in Ouargaye and Diapaga medical districts. All interviews were tape recorded and analyzed using QSR Nvivo 2.0. RESULTS: Decision-making for use of obstetric care in the family follows the logic of the family's management. Husbands, brothers-in-law and parents-in-law make the decision about whether to use a health facility for antenatal care or for delivery. In general, decision-makers are those who can pay, including the woman herself. Payment of care is the responsibility of men, according to women interviewed, because of their social role and status. CONCLUSIONS: To increase use of health facilities in Ouargaye and Diapaga, the empowerment of women could be helpful as well as exemption of fees or cost sharing for care.",2013,10.1186/1742-4755-10-8,10,NA,8,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Male and Burkina Faso and Pregnancy and Family and *Decision Making and *Rural Health Services and Maternal Health Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Fees and Charges and *Spouses and Delivery, Obstetric/economics and Prenatal Care/economics/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/02/07/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aventin_2020_Reprheal,JOUR,Engaging parents in digital sexual and reproductive health education: evidence from the JACK trial,"Aventin, Aine and Gough, Aisling and McShane, Theresa and Gillespie, Kathryn and O'Hare, Liam and Young, Honor and Lewis, Ruth and Warren, Emily and Buckley, Kelly and Lohan, Maria",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Research evidence and international policy highlight the central role that parents play in promoting positive sexual behaviour and outcomes in their children, however they can be difficult to engage in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education programmes. Digital health promotion that uses online and mobile technologies (OMTs) to promote parent-child communication may offer an innovative solution to reach parents, however, few programmes have used OMTs to involve parents in SRH, and none have reported lessons learned in relation to optimising engagement. This study addresses this gap in the literature by reporting acceptability and feasibility of using OMTs to engage parents in SRH education. Findings will be relevant for those wishing to develop and implement digital SRH programmes with parents internationally. METHODS: The Jack Trial is a UK-wide cluster randomised controlled trial recruiting over 8000 adolescents from 66 socially and religiously diverse post-primary schools. An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation explored user engagement with parent components of the If I Were Jack SRH education programme, which include online animated films and a parent-teen homework exercise. RESULTS: A total of 109 adolescents, teachers, parents and SRH policy experts took part in semi-structured interviews and focus groups, 134 parents responded to an online survey, and 3179 adolescents completed a programme engagement and satisfaction questionnaire. Parents who accessed the materials were positive about them; 87% rated them as 'good or excellent' and 67% said they helped them have conversations with their child about SRH. Web analytics revealed that 27% of contacted parents accessed the digital materials, with 9% viewing the animated films. Only 38% of teachers implemented the homework exercise, mainly because they assumed that students would not complete it or it might result in backlash from parents. CONCLUSIONS: While digital parental materials show promise for engaging parents in SRH education, this study suggests that in order to optimise engagement, parental components that give parents the necessary skills to have conversations with their children about sex should be coupled with efforts to increase school and teacher confidence to communicate with parents on sensitive topics.

Jones_2017_Humareprupda,JOUR,What factors hinder the decision-making process for women with cancer and contemplating fertility preservation treatment?,"Jones, Georgina and Hughes, Jane and Mahmoodi, Neda and Smith, Emily and Skull, Jonathan and Ledger, William",Human reproduction update,"BACKGROUND: Although fertility preservation (FP) treatment options have increased, the existing evidence suggests that many women with cancer do not feel well supported in making these decisions, but find them stressful and complex and fail to take up fertility care at this crucial time. Whilst existing reviews have all made important contributions to our understanding of the FP decision-making process, none of them examine solely and specifically these processes for women of reproductive age with a diagnosis of any cancer, leaving a gap in the knowledge base. Given the expectation that care is patient-centred, our review aims to address this gap which may be of help to those managing patients struggling to make difficult decisions in the often brief period before potentially sterilizing cancer treatment is started. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Underpinning this narrative review was the question 'What factors hinder the decision-making process for women with any cancer and contemplating FP treatment?' Our objectives were to (i) assess and summarize this existing literature, (ii) identify the factors that hinder this decision-making process, (iii) explore to what extent these factors may differ for women choosing different methods of FP and (iv) make recommendations for service delivery and future research. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic search of the medical and social science literature from the 1 January 2005 up to the end of January 2016 was carried out using three electronic databases (Web of Science (PubMed), Ovid SP Medline and CINAHL via Ebsco). Included in the review were quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies. Reference lists of relevant papers were also hand searched. From the 983 papers identified, 46 papers were included. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. OUTCOMES: From the analysis, 6 key themes with 15 sub-themes emerged: (i) fertility information provision (lack of information, timing of the information, patient-provider communication); (ii) fear concerning the perceived risks associated with pursuing FP (delaying cancer treatment, aggravating a hormone positive cancer and consequences of a future pregnancy); (iii) non-referral from oncology (personal situation, having a hormone positive cancer, FP not a priority and transition between service issues); (iv) the dilemma (in survival mode, whether to prioritize one treatment over another); (v) personal situation (parity, relationship status) and (iv) costs (financial concerns). WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This review has found that a wide range of internal and external factors impact the FP decision-making process. Key external issues related to current service delivery such as the provision and timing of FP information, and lack of referral from oncology to the fertility clinic. However, internal issues such as women's fears concerning the perceived risks associated with pursuing FP also hindered decision-making but these 'risks' were typically overestimated and non-evidence based. These findings suggest that the implementation of a range of decision support interventions may be of benefit within the clinical care pathway of FP and cancer. Women would benefit from the provision of more evidence-based FP information, ideally received at cancer diagnosis, in advance of seeing a fertility specialist, for example through the implementation of patient decision aids. Healthcare professionals in both oncology and fertility services may also benefit from the implementation of training programmes and educational tools targeted at improving the communication skills needed to improve collaborative decision-making and deliver care that is patient-centred. Exploration of the current barriers, both intellectual and practical, that prevent some patients from accepting FP will help care providers to do better for their patients in the future. Finally, the extent to which a poorer prognosis and moral, ethical and religious beliefs influence the FP decision-making process also warrant further research.",2017,10.1093/humupd/dmx009,23,4,433-457,eng,1460-2369 1355-4786,decision-making and Risk and Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Consumer Health Information and cancer and *Decision Making and *Health Services Accessibility and females and fertility preservation and Fertility Preservation/methods/*psychology and narrative review and Neoplasms/complications/*psychology and oncofertility,NA,NA,2017/07/01/,Hum Reprod Update,NA,NA,NA,NA
Duthie_2017_Reprheal,JOUR,A conceptual framework for patient-centered fertility treatment,"Duthie, Elizabeth A. and Cooper, Alexandra and Davis, Joseph B. and Schoyer, Katherine D. and Sandlow, Jay and Strawn, Estil Y. and Flynn, Kathryn E.",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered care is a pillar of quality health care and is important to patients experiencing infertility. In this study we used empirical, in-depth data on couples' experiences of infertility treatment decision making to inform and revise a conceptual framework for patient-centered fertility treatment that was developed based on health care professionals' conceptualizations of fertility treatment, covering effectiveness, burden, safety, and costs. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal mixed methods study, we collected data from both members (separately) of 37 couples who scheduled an initial consult with a reproductive specialist. Data collection occurred 1 week before the initial consultation, 1 week after the initial consultation, and then roughly 2, 4, 8, and 12 months later. Data collection included semi-structured qualitative interviews, self-reported questionnaires, and medical record review. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed in NVivo. A single coder analyzed all transcripts, with > 25% of transcripts coded by a second coder to ensure quality control and consistency. RESULTS: Content analysis of the interview transcripts revealed 6 treatment dimensions: effectiveness, physical and emotional burden, time, cost, potential risks, and genetic parentage. Thus, the revised framework for patient-centered fertility treatment retains much from the original framework, with modification to one dimension (from safety to potential risks) and the addition of two dimensions (time and genetic parentage). For patients and their partners making fertility treatment decisions, tradeoffs are explicitly considered across dimensions as opposed to each dimension being considered on its own. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered fertility treatment should account for the dimensions of treatment that patients and their partners weigh when making decisions about how to add a child to their family. Based on the lived experiences of couples seeking specialist medical care for infertility, this revised conceptual framework can be used to inform patient-centered treatment and research on infertility and to develop decision support tools for patients and providers.",2017,10.1186/s12978-017-0375-5,14,1,114,eng,1742-4755,Decision making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Longitudinal Studies and Fertility and *Patient-Centered Care and Patient-centered care and Couples and Fertilization in Vitro/methods/psychology and Infertility and Infertility/psychology/*therapy and Reproductive Health Services/economics,NA,NA,2017/09/07/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Arambepola_2014_Reprheal,JOUR,Decision making on unsafe abortions in Sri Lanka: a case-control study,"Arambepola, Carukshi and Rajapaksa, Lalini C.",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Following an unintended pregnancy, not every woman would invariably choose to undergo an unsafe abortion. It suggests that in the decision making process, women face both 'push' factors that favour abortion and 'pull' factors that work against it. This study assessed the circumstances that surrounded a woman's decision to undergo an unsafe abortion, compared to a decision to continue, when faced with an unintended pregnancy in Sri Lanka. METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted among 171 women admitted to nine hospitals in eight districts following an unsafe abortion (Cases) and 600 women admitted to the same hospitals for delivery of an unintended term pregnancy (Controls). Interviewer-administered-questionnaires and in-depth interviews assessed women's characteristics, decision making process and underlying reasons for their decision. The risk of abortion related to their decision making was assessed using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Compared to controls, the cases were significantly less-educated, employed, unmarried and primi-gravid (p < 0.05). All knew the 'illegal' status of abortion, mainly through media (65.5% cases versus 80% controls). When making a decision, the risk of undergoing an unsafe abortion was significant among those who sought assistance (44% versus 32%; OR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.2-2.4)), with more reliance placed on non-medical sources such as spouse/partner, friend, neighbour and family/relation. Speaking to women with past experience of induced abortions (31% versus 21.5%; OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.4) and failure in making the final decision with partners also imparted a significant risk for abortion (64% versus 34%; OR = 3.4; 2.4-4.8). A decision favouring unsafe abortion was predominantly based on their economic instability (29.5%) and poor support by partners (14%), whereas a decision against it was based on ethical considerations (44% religious beliefs: 12% social stigma) over its legal implications (4%). Most abortions were performed by unqualified persons (36.1% self proclaimed abortionists; 26.2% not revealed their qualifications) for a wide range of payment in non-sterile environments (45.9% unknown place) using septic procedures (38.5% trans-vaginal insertions; 24.6% unaware of the procedure). CONCLUSIONS: Women's risk of unsafe abortion was associated with unreliable sources of information during decision making that led to poor knowledge and positive attitudes on its safety; poor access to affordable abortion services; and their economic instability.",2014,10.1186/1742-4755-11-91,11,NA,91,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Surveys and Questionnaires and Case-Control Studies and Socioeconomic Factors and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and Risk-Taking and *Decision Making and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Abortion, Criminal/*psychology and Abortion, Induced/*psychology and Pregnancy, Unplanned/*psychology and Sri Lanka",NA,NA,2014/12/17/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The situation increases the risk of death for both mother and child and has severe maternal complications. The purpose of this study was to describe women's perceptions of homebirths in the medical districts of Ouargaye and Diapaga. METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to gather information. This information was collected by using focus group discussions and individual interviews with 30 women. All the interviews were tape recorded and managed by using QSR NVIVO 2.0, qualitative data management software. RESULTS: The findings show that homebirths are frequent because of prohibitive distance to health facilities, fast labour and easy labour, financial constraints, lack of decision making power to reach health facilities.

Rogers_2019_Reprheal,JOUR,Medical abortion in Nepal: a qualitative study on women's experiences at safe abortion services and pharmacies,"Rogers, Claire and Sapkota, Sabitri and Paudel, Rasmita and Dantas, Jaya A. R.",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Although Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, a significant number of women continue to access unsafe abortions. An estimated 60% of all abortions performed in 2014 were unsafe, with unsafe abortion continuing to be a leading contributor to maternal mortality. Despite medical abortion access being solely permitted through government accredited safe abortion services, medical abortion pills are readily available for illegal purchase at pharmacies throughout the country. METHODS: Utilising an Assets Focused Rapid Participatory Appraisal (AFRPA) research methodology, underpinned by a health information pyramid conceptual framework, this qualitative exploratory study collected data from in-depth, open-ended interviews. The study explored the medical abortion and sexual and reproductive health experiences of ten women who accessed medical abortion through an accredited safe abortion service, and ten women who accessed unsafe medical abortion through pharmacies. RESULTS: Thematic content analysis revealed emerging themes relating to decision-making processes in accessing safe or unsafe medical abortion; knowledge of safe abortion services; and SRH information access and post-abortion contraceptive counselling. Findings emphasised the interconnectivity of sexual and reproductive health and rights; reproductive coercion; education; poverty; spousal separation; and women's personal, social and economic empowerment.

Baram_2019_Humareprupda,JOUR,Fertility preservation for transgender adolescents and young adults: a systematic review,"Baram, Shira and Myers, Samantha A. and Yee, Samantha and Librach, Clifford L.",Human reproduction update,"BACKGROUND: Many transgender individuals choose to undergo gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT) and/or sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to alleviate the distress that is associated with gender dysphoria. Although these treatment options often succeed in alleviating such symptoms, they can also negatively impact future reproductive potential. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the available psychosocial and medical literature on fertility preservation (FP) for transgender adolescents and young adults (TAYAs), to identify gaps in the current research and provide suggestions for future research directions. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic review of English peer-reviewed papers published from 2001 onwards, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, was conducted. Four journal databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed Medline, Ovid Embase and Ovid PsychINFO) were used to identify all relevant studies exploring psychosocial or medical aspects of FP in TAYAs. The search strategy used a combination of subject headings and generic terms related to the study topic and population. Bibliographies of the selected articles were also hand searched and cross-checked to ensure comprehensive coverage. All selected papers were independently reviewed by the co-authors. Characteristics of the studies, objectives and key findings were extracted, and a systematic review was conducted. OUTCOMES: Included in the study were 19 psychosocial-based research papers and 21 medical-based research papers that explore fertility-related aspects specific for this population. Key psychosocial themes included the desire to have children for TAYAs; FP discussions, counselling and referrals provided by healthcare providers (HCPs); FP utilization; the attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of TAYAs, HCPs and the parents/guardians of TAYAs; and barriers to accessing FP. Key medical themes included fertility-related effects of GAHT, FP options and outcomes. From a synthesis of the literature, we conclude that there are many barriers preventing TAYAs from pursuing FP, including a lack of awareness of FP options, high costs, invasiveness of the available procedures and the potential psychological impact of the FP process. The available medical data on the reproductive effects of GAHT are diverse, and while detrimental effects are anticipated, the extent to which these effects are reversible is unknown. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: FP counselling should begin as early as possible as a standard of care before GAHT to allow time for informed decisions. The current lack of high-quality medical data specific to FP counselling practice for this population means there is a reliance on expert opinion and extrapolation from studies in the cisgender population. Future research should include large-scale cohort studies (preferably multi-centered), longitudinal studies of TAYAs across the FP process, qualitative studies of the parents/guardians of TAYAs and studies evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies to improve the attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of HCPs.",2019,10.1093/humupd/dmz026,25,6,694-716,eng,1460-2369 1355-4786,Humans and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Counseling and systematic review and transgender and Fertility Preservation/*methods and fertility preservation and *Transgender Persons and cryopreservation and Fertility/physiology and gender dysphoria and Gender Dysphoria/therapy and gender reassignment and oocyte cryopreservation and sex reassignment and Sex Reassignment Procedures/*methods and sperm cryopreservation,NA,NA,2019/11/05/,Hum Reprod Update,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mselle_2016_Reprheal,JOUR,Healthcare access and quality of birth care: narratives of women living with obstetric fistula in rural Tanzania,"Mselle, Lilian T. and Kohi, Thecla W.",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Increasing births with skilled attendants and increasing health facilities with Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) can reduce maternal mortality and are considered critical interventions for ensuring safe motherhood. Despite Tanzania's policy to support women to give birth with the assistance of skilled personnel, some women do not access this care. This article uses women's stories to illustrate the challenges that caused them to fail to access adequate obstetric care in a timely manner, hence causing the development of fistulas. METHODS: This paper presents the narratives of 16 women who were conveniently selected based on their experiences of not being able to access adequate obstetric care in timely manner. The analysis was guided by recommendations for the identification and interpretation of narratives, and identified important components of women's experiences, paying attention to commonalities, differences and areas of emphasis. Semi-structured interviews were carried out at CCBRT hospital in Dar es Salaam. RESULTS: Four (4) general story lines were identified from women description of their inability to access quality obstetric care in a timely manner. These were; failing to decide on a health care facility for delivery, lacking money to get to a health care facility, lacking transportation to a health care facility and lacking quality birth care at the health care facility. CONCLUSION: Women were unable to reach to the health care facilities providing comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) in time because of their lack of decision-making power, money and transportation, and those who did reach the facilities received low quality birth care. Empowering women socially and financially, upgrading primary health care facilities to provide CEmOC and increased numbers of skilled personnel would promote health care facility deliveries.",2016,10.1186/s12978-016-0189-x,13,1,87,eng,1742-4755,Narratives and Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Tanzania and Socioeconomic Factors and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and *Quality of Health Care and *Emergency Medical Services and *Health Services Accessibility and Emergency obstetric care and Obstetric fistula and Obstetric Labor Complications/*prevention & control and Rectovaginal Fistula/*prevention & control and Women's birth care,NA,NA,2016/07/22/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Puri_2018_Reprheal,JOUR,Providers' perspectives on denial of abortion care in Nepal: a cross sectional study,"Puri, Mahesh C. and Raifman, Sarah and Khanal, Biddhya and Maharjan, Dev Chandra and Foster, Diana Greene",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Despite legalization of abortion in Nepal in 2002, many women are still unable to access legal services. This paper examines providers' views, experiences with abortion denial, and knowledge related to abortion provision, and identifies areas for improvement in quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a structured survey with 106 abortion care providers at 55 government-approved safe abortion facilities across five districts of Nepal in 2017. We assessed reasons for denial of abortion care, knowledge about laws, barriers to provision and attitudes towards abortion. RESULTS: Almost all providers (96%) reported that they have ever refused clients for abortion services. Common reasons included beyond 12 weeks gestation (93%), sex selective abortion (86%), and medical contraindications (85%). One in four providers denied abortion for lack of drugs or trained personnel, and one third denied services when they perceived that the woman's reasons for abortion were insufficient. Only a third of providers knew all three legal indications for abortion -- less than or equal to 12 weeks of pregnancy on request, up to 18 weeks for rape or incest, and any time for maternal or fetal health risk. Overall, providers were in favor of legal abortion but a substantial proportion had mixed or negative attitudes about the service.

DePineres_2017_Reprheal,JOUR,'I felt the world crash down on me': Women's experiences being denied legal abortion in Colombia,"DePineres, Teresa and Raifman, Sarah and Mora, Margoth and Villarreal, Cristina and Foster, Diana Greene and Gerdts, Caitlin",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, Colombia's constitutional court overturned a complete ban on abortion, liberalizing the procedure. Despite a relatively liberal new law, women still struggle to access safe and legal abortion services. We aimed to understand why women are denied services in Colombia, and what factors determine if and how they ultimately terminate pregnancies. METHODS: We recruited women denied abortion at a private facility in Bogota. Twenty-one participants completed an initial interview and eight completed a second longer interview. Two researchers documented themes and developed and applied a codebook to transcripts using ATLAS.ti. RESULTS: Participants faced barriers, such as lack of knowledge of service availability and delayed pregnancy recognition, leading to denial. Five out of eight participants ultimately received abortions in public hospitals, due to support from partners and a robust referral system; nevertheless, they received poor care. Those who continued pregnancies endured stigmatizing events and inaccurate medical counselling at referral facilities. Several women contemplated illegal abortion though were afraid to attempt it. CONCLUSION: We propose the following recommendations: 1) increase awareness about availability and legality of abortion services to prevent delay and consequent denial; 2) provide counseling and referral upon denial; and 3) train providers in interpersonal quality abortion care.",2017,10.1186/s12978-017-0391-5,14,1,133,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Pregnancy and Colombia and Counseling and *Health Services Accessibility and Social Stigma and Abortion and *Abortion, Legal and *Refusal to Treat and Denial of abortion and Unsafe abortion",NA,NA,2017/10/23/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Durand_2008_Humareprupda,JOUR,A review of decision support technologies for amniocentesis,"Durand, M. A. and Boivin, J. and Elwyn, G.",Human reproduction update,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in designing decision tools [decision support technologies (DSTs)] that support patients when they have to decide about health matters. The purpose of this review was to describe and evaluate existing DSTs for amniocentesis testing. METHODS: Ten medical and psychological databases were searched up to January 2008 and key authors and organizations contacted to identify DSTs for amniocentesis (published or otherwise). DSTs that described amniocentesis testing were included. RESULTS: Six DSTs met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated using the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Instrument. The evaluation suggested that most DSTs provided a satisfactory level of information on the index decision and, on the specific features of a diagnostic test; provided structured guidance in making a decision; were based on scientific evidence and disclosed the funding sources and authors' credentials. However, most DSTs failed to communicate probabilistic information, to clarify patient values and use plain language. The majority of DSTs did not use a systematic development process. Furthermore, the DSTs' evaluation often lacked scientific rigour. In most cases, neither the quality nor the effectiveness of the DST could be inferred from the evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights variations in the development, evaluation and quality of existing DSTs for amniocentesis. We do not know what impact DSTs may have when implemented in clinical settings. Decisions in this context have high stakes and strong emotional impacts. It is important to ensure that DSTs achieve high standards.",2008,10.1093/humupd/dmn037,14,6,659-668,eng,1460-2369 1355-4786,Humans and Female and Decision Making and Psychological Theory and Patient Education as Topic and Choice Behavior and *Decision Support Techniques and Amniocentesis/adverse effects/*psychology,NA,NA,2008/12//Nov undefined,Hum Reprod Update,NA,NA,NA,NA
Allvee_2018_Reprheal,JOUR,Quality of IVF status registration in the Estonian Medical Birth Registry: a national record linkage study,"Allvee, Kart and Rahu, Mati and Haldre, Kai and Karro, Helle and Rahu, Kaja",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Information regarding in vitro fertilization (IVF) as a pregnancy risk factor (yes/ no) is stored in each birth record of the Estonian Medical Birth Registry (EMBR). This study aimed to assess the validity of registration of newborns' IVF status in the EMBR. METHODS: To identify the newborns conceived by IVF, the birth records in the EMBR were compared to individual records on the embryo transfer procedures in the Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF) database as a reference. Maternal age was restricted to 40 years, the age limit for IVF treatment covered by the EHIF. The embryo transfer procedures, that dated up to eight weeks before pregnancy, were additionally checked in the infertility treatment clinics. The validity of IVF status was measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). Relative risk (RR) of unrecorded IVF status among IVF mothers by socio-demographic characteristics and birth plurality was estimated using modified Poisson regression models. RESULTS: There were 3198 newborns identified as conceived by IVF in the EMBR in 2005-2014. Eight of them were incorrectly entered as born after IVF. The record linkage with the EHIF database revealed 1014 newborns with unrecorded IVF status in the EMBR. A total of 4204 newborns were verified as conceived by IVF, 24.1% of them were not categorized as born after IVF. The sensitivity of the IVF status registration was poor (75.9%), specificity (100.0%), PPV (99.8%) and NPV (99.3%) were high. The misclassifications were significantly more common among mothers of younger age or non-Estonians or with singleton birth. CONCLUSION: Information based on mother's self-report or her antenatal chart does not accurately identify the newborn's IVF status. The lack of a specialized country-wide assisted reproductive technology register in Estonia requires routine record linkage of the EMBR, EHIF and the infertility treatment clinics' databases to obtain adequate information regarding IVF status in the EMBR. Electronic record linkages between databases would help considerably to improve the validity of data to be used in medical decision making, in research and for statistical purposes.",2018,10.1186/s12978-018-0575-7,15,1,133,eng,1742-4755,"Data quality and Humans and Female and Adult and Child and Pregnancy and Infant, Newborn and Infant, Premature and Infant, Low Birth Weight and *Pregnancy Outcome and Premature Birth/epidemiology and Registries/*standards and *Fertilization in Vitro and Birth registry and Embryo transfer and Estonia/epidemiology and In vitro fertilization and Record linkage",NA,NA,2018/08/08/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Samorinha_2014_Humareprupda,JOUR,Factors associated with the donation and non-donation of embryos for research: a systematic review,"Samorinha, Catarina and Pereira, Margarida and Machado, Helena and Figueiredo, Barbara and Silva, Susana",Human reproduction update,"BACKGROUND: Systematic knowledge on the factors that influence the decisions of IVF users regarding embryo donation for research is a core need for patient-centred policies and ethics in clinical practice. However, no systematic review has been provided on the motivations of patients who must decide embryo disposition. This paper fills this gap, presenting a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies, which synthesizes the current body of knowledge on the factors and reasons associated with IVF patients' decisions to donate or not to donate embryos for research. METHODS: A systematic search of studies indexed in PubMed, ISI WoK and PsycINFO, published before November 2013, was conducted. Only empirical, peer-reviewed, full-length, original studies reporting data on factors and reasons associated with the decision concerning donation or non-donation of embryos for research were included. Eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers and disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer, if required. The main quantitative findings were extracted and synthesized and qualitative data were assessed by thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. More than half of the studies (n = 21) used a quantitative methodology, and the remaining were qualitative (n = 15) or mixed-methods (n = 3) studies. The studies were derived mainly from European countries (n = 18) and the USA (n = 11). The proportion of IVF users who donated embryos for research varied from 7% in a study in France to 73% in a Swiss study. Those who donate embryos for research reported feelings of reciprocity towards science and medicine, positive views of research and high levels of trust in the medical system. They described their decision as better than the destruction of embryos and as an opportunity to help others or to improve health and IVF treatments. The perception of risks, the lack of information concerning research projects and the medical system and the conceptualization of embryos in terms of personhood were the most relevant motives for not donating embryos for research. Results relating to the influence of sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive and gynaecological history were mostly inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Three iterative and dynamic dimensions of the IVF patients' decision to donate or not to donate embryos for research emerged from this review: the hierarquization of the possible options regarding embryo disposition, according to the moral, social and instrumental status attributed to embryos; patients' understanding of expectations and risks of the research on human embryos; and patients' experiences of information exchange and levels of trust in the medical-scientific institutions.",2014,10.1093/humupd/dmu026,20,5,641-655,eng,1460-2369 1355-4786,"Emotions and Humans and Female and Decision Making and Motivation and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and systematic review and Tissue Donors/*psychology and assisted reproductive technologies and embryo disposition and Embryo Disposition/ethics/*psychology and Embryo Research/*ethics and Fertilization in Vitro/psychology and human embryo research and in vitro fertilization and Reproductive History",NA,NA,2014/10//Sep undefined,Hum Reprod Update,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to explore the acceptability, views and preferences of pregnant women and primary healthcare providers for a fixed-dose combined preparation of aspirin and calcium (a polypill) as primary prevention of HDP in an unselected pregnant population. METHODS: In this qualitative study eight in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch primary care midwives and general practitioners. Seven focus group discussions were organised with women with low-risk pregnancies. Topics discussed were: perceptions of preeclampsia; information provision about preeclampsia and a polypill; views on the polypill concept; preferences and needs regarding implementation of a polypill. Thematic analysis of the data transcripts was carried out to identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Two major themes shaped medical professionals' and women's views on the polypill concept: 'Informed Choice' and 'Medicalisation'. Both could be divided into subthemes related to information provision, personal choice and discussions with regard to the balance between 'unnecessary medicalisation' and 'scientific progress'. CONCLUSIONS: In general, women and healthcare practitioners expressed a positive attitude towards a polypill intervention as primary prevention strategy with aspirin and calcium, providing some conditions are met. The most important conditions for implementation of such a strategy were safety, effectiveness and the possibility to make a well-informed autonomous decision.",2019,10.1186/s12978-019-0707-8,16,1,46,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Calcium and Aspirin and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Patient perspective and Aspirin/therapeutic use and Calcium/therapeutic use and General Practitioners/psychology and Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced/*prevention & control and Hypertension/*prevention & control and Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and Primary prevention and Women-centred care",NA,NA,2019/05/02/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet less than 55% do so and we sought to understand more about this paradox by comparing the psychosocial profile and decision-making of women not yet engaged in the medical process to that of those who had consulted. METHODS: A Fertility Decision-Making Questionnaire was designed and posted on a website dedicated to women trying to conceive. RESULTS: A total of 426 women completed the questionnaire, 56% had not yet consulted a doctor about conceiving (non-consulter, NC). Women who had sought treatment had more positive treatment beliefs, and a greater willingness to know if a problem existed, than those who had not yet consulted. Almost 20% of NC women already met the medical definition of infertility and this subgroup had a greater fear of discovering a problem and of being labelled infertile than other women in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Seeking medical advice for fertility problems is mainly associated with what women know or want to know about their fertility and their emotional reactions to that knowledge. Negative reactions can substantially delay seeking help in 20% of women.",2007,10.1093/humrep/dem057,22,6,1662-1668,eng,0268-1161,"Humans and Female and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and Fertility and Pregnancy and *Decision Making and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and *Counseling and *Fertilization and Infertility, Female/*psychology",NA,NA,2007/06//undefined,Hum Reprod,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: This study reviewed the current literature on sociocultural and ethical considerations with regard to male and female sexual dysfunction as well as cultural and cosmetic female and male genital modification procedures. RESULTS: It is recommended that clinicians evaluate their patients and their partners in the context of culture and assess distressing sexual symptoms regardless of whether they are a recognized dysfunction. Both clinicians and researchers should develop culturally sensitive assessment skills and instruments.

The delay in decision making to seek medical care during obstetric emergencies remains a significant factor in maternal mortality. METHODS: We present results from an experimental study in rural Pakistan. Village clusters were randomly assigned to intervention and control arms (16 clusters each). In the intervention clusters, women were provided information on safe motherhood through pictorial booklets and audiocassettes; traditional birth attendants were trained in clean delivery and recognition of obstetric and newborn complications; and emergency transportation systems were set up. In eight of the 16 intervention clusters, husbands also received specially designed education materials on safe motherhood and family planning. Pre- and post-intervention surveys on selected maternal and neonatal health indicators were conducted in all 32 clusters. A district-wide survey was conducted two years after project completion to measure any residual impact of the interventions. RESULTS: Pregnant women in intervention clusters received prenatal care and prophylactic iron therapy more frequently than pregnant women in control clusters. Providing safe motherhood education to husbands resulted in further improvement of some indicators. There was a small but significant increase in percent of hospital deliveries but no impact on the use of skilled birth attendants. Perinatal mortality reduced significantly in clusters where only wives received information and education in safe motherhood. The survey to assess residual impact showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that providing safe motherhood education increased the probability of pregnant women having prenatal care and utilization of health services for obstetric complications.",2010,10.1186/1742-4755-7-30,7,NA,30,eng,1742-4755,NA,NA,NA,2010/11/05/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The main influences on maternal health encompass social, economic, political, environmental and cultural determinants of health. To effectively address maternal mortality in the post-2015 agenda, interventions need to consider the determinants of health so that their delivery is not limited to the health sector. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to identify key community groups' perspectives on the perceived determinants of maternal health in rural areas of southern Mozambique. METHODS: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted with women of reproductive age, pregnant women, matrons, male partners, community leaders and health workers. Participants were recruited using sampling techniques of convenience and snow balling. Focus groups had an average of nine participants each. The heads of 12 administrative posts were also interviewed to understand the local context. Data were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software. RESULTS: A broad range of political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of maternal health were identified by community representatives. It was perceived that the civil war has resulted in local unemployment and poverty that had a number of downstream effects including lack of funds for accessing medical care and transport, and influence on socio-cultural determinants, particularly gender relations that disadvantaged women. Socio-cultural determinants included intimate partner violence toward women, and strained relationships with in-laws and co-spouses. Social relationships were complex as there were both negative and positive impacts on maternal health. Environmental determinants included natural disasters and poor access to roads and transport exacerbated by the wet season and subsequent flooding. CONCLUSIONS: In rural southern Mozambique, community perceptions of the determinants of maternal health included political, economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors. These determinants were closely linked with one another and highlight the importance of including the local history, context, culture and geography in the design of maternal health programs.",2016,10.1186/s12978-016-0217-x,13,Suppl 2,112,eng,1742-4755,Poverty and Equity and Humans and Female and Male and Feasibility Studies and Maternal health and Socioeconomic Factors and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Rural Population and *Decision Making and Disparities and Maternal Health Services/organization & administration/*standards and Community Health Services/*standards and Determinants of health and Early Medical Intervention and Maternal Health/*standards and Mozambique and Pre-Eclampsia/*prevention & control,NA,NA,2016/09/30/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: To explore the relation of SDx diagnosis, chronic health conditions, and prescription medications commonly associated with SDx for men and women in primary care using medical records diagnoses. METHODS: Exploratory descriptive analyses were used to interpret secondary data from a primary care patient database. The database included patient data from 3 family and internal medicine clinics in the St Louis metropolitan area from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2015. Analysis included key demographic variables, chronic illness, and health conditions of hypertension, pain, prostate disorder, menopause, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and associated medications. Analysis of the database yielded 30,627 adult patients (men: n = 12,097, mean age = 46.8 years, 65.6% white race; women: n = 18,530, mean age = 46.6 years, 59.2% white race) with significant comorbid associations between SDx and other chronic illness, health conditions, and medication prescription. RESULTS: Depression, anxiety, pain, hypertension, diabetes, and psychotropic medication use were significantly associated with SDx for men and women. Examination of specific SDx diagnoses showed erectile dysfunction to be significantly associated with all tested variables for men. For women, pain-related SDx diagnoses were associated more with chronic illness, health conditions, and medication use than were psychosexual SDx diagnoses (eg, orgasm), except for menopause. Prevalence varied by sex, with a higher prevalence rate of any SDx for men (13.5%) than for women (1.0%), although sex comparisons were not part of the analytics. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: This study suggests the diagnosis of SDx is closely associated with other common chronic illness and health conditions and could go underdiagnosed in women in primary care. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to draw causal conclusions related to the nature of the associated conditions with SDx diagnoses. The generalizability of the findings also might be limited given the specific demographic or health makeup of the St Louis area where the study was conducted. CONCLUSION: The high comorbidity of SDx with mental health, chronic pain and illnesses, and medication use adds to the growing evidence that sexual health and functioning are essential components of overall well-being and holistic care for men and women.

Although many strategies and tools exist, few are designed for longitudinal use or provide visual aids. Our objective is to present the Family Planning Quotient (FPQ) and Reproductive Life Index (RepLI) (FPQ/RepLI) tool we created to facilitate the discussion of family planning and reproductive life goals between patients and providers and to provide a summary our evaluation of the tool. This tool was developed as a response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's charge of developing a tool that could help facilitate reproductive life planning by giving the patient a better understanding of their reproductive goals and trajectory. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional evaluation of our tool took place with patients and providers at an urban, public hospital in Chicago. Patients spoke with a health educator about their sexual, gynecological, and obstetric history to complete the FPQ/RepLI tool. Our primary objective was to measure the proportion of women who indicated the tool was helpful and that they would use it to track their reproductive goals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and providers completed an evaluation survey rating their satisfaction with the tool. Survey responses were summarized using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: During the study, 790 patients completed the evaluation.. Most patients (n = 725, 91.9%) agreed that the tool was helpful and that they would use it to track their reproductive goals. Fifty-five (83.5%) providers agreed that there is a need for reproductive health tools in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Most agreed that the tool helped the patient communicate goals, aided in educating about contraception, and facilitated the discussion and decision-making process about available contraceptives. The tool gives patients a resource for family and reproductive goal planning.

It is essential to identify the barriers and facilitators that women and families encounter, when deciding to seek maternal care services. This study aimed to understand health-seeking patterns of pregnant women in rural Sindh, Pakistan. METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken in rural Sindh, Pakistan as part of a large multi-country study in 2012. Thirty three focus group discussions and 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with mothers [n = 173], male decision-makers [n = 64], Lady Health Workers [n = 64], Lady Health Supervisors [n = 10], Women Medical Officers [n = 9] and Traditional Birth Attendants [n = 7] in the study communities. A set of a priori themes regarding care-seeking during pregnancy and its complications as well as additional themes as they emerged from the data were used for analysis. Qualitative analysis was done using NVivo version 10. RESULTS: Women stated they usually visited health facilities if they experienced pregnancy complications or danger signs, such as heavy bleeding or headache. Findings revealed the importance of husbands and mothers-in-law as decision makers regarding health care utilization. Participants expressed that poor availability of transport, financial constraints and the unavailability of chaperones were important barriers to seeking care. In addition, private facilities were often preferred due to the perceived superior quality of services. CONCLUSION: Maternal care utilization was influenced by social, economic and cultural factors in rural Pakistani communities. The perceived poor quality care at public hospitals was a significant barrier for many women in accessing health services. If maternal lives are to be saved, policy makers need to develop processes to overcome these barriers and ensure easily accessible high-quality care for women in rural communities.

Holt_2018_Reprheal,JOUR,Women's preferences for contraceptive counseling in Mexico: Results from a focus group study,"Holt, Kelsey and Zavala, Icela and Quintero, Ximena and Mendoza, Doroteo and McCormick, Marie C. and Dehlendorf, Christine and Lieberman, Ellice and Langer, Ana",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Client-centered contraceptive counseling is critical to meeting demand for contraception and protecting human rights. However, despite various efforts to optimize counseling, little is known outside of the United States about what individuals themselves value in counseling. In the present study we investigate women's preferences for contraceptive counseling in Mexico to inform efforts to improve service quality. METHODS: We conducted applied qualitative research, using six focus group discussions with 43 women in two cities in Mexico with distinct sizes and sociocultural contexts (Mexico City and Tepeji del Rio, Hidalgo) to assess contraceptive counseling preferences. We used a framework approach to thematically code and analyze the transcriptions from focus groups. RESULTS: Consistent with quality of care and human rights frameworks for family planning service delivery, participants expressed a desire for privacy, confidentiality, informed choice, and respectful treatment. They expanded on usual concepts of respectful care within family planning to include avoidance of sexual assault or harassment-in line with definitions of respectful care in maternal health. In contrast to counseling approaches with method effectiveness as the organizing principle, participants preferred counseling centered on personalized assessments of needs and preferences. Many, particularly older, less educated women, highly valued hearing provider opinions about what method they should use, based on those personalized assessments. Participants highlighted the necessity of clinical assessments or physical exams to inform provider recommendations for appropriate methods. This desire was largely due to beliefs that more exhaustive medical exams could help prevent negative contraceptive outcomes perceived to be common, in particular expulsion of intra-uterine devices (IUDs), by identifying methods compatible with a woman's body. Trust in provider, built in various ways, was seen as essential to women's contraceptive needs being met. CONCLUSIONS: Findings shed light on under-represented perspectives of clients related to counseling preferences. They highlight specific avenues for service delivery improvement in Mexico to ensure clients experience privacy, confidentiality, informed choice, respectful treatment, and personalized counseling-including around reasons for higher IUD expulsion rates postpartum-during contraceptive visits. Findings suggest interventions to improve provider counseling should prioritize a focus on relationship-building to foster trust, and needs assessment skills to facilitate personalization of decision-making support without imposition of a provider's personal opinions. Trust is particularly important to address in family planning given historical abuses against women's autonomy that may still influence perspectives on contraceptive programs.

The Global Network for Women's and Children's Health maintains a Maternal and Newborn Health Registry (MNHR) in 14 study clusters of district Thatta, Sindh Pakistan. For the last 10 years, the MNHR has recorded a high stillbirths rate with a slow decline. This exploratory study was designed to understand the perspectives of women and traditional birth attendants regarding the high occurrence of stillbirth in Thatta district. METHODS: We used an exploratory qualitative study design by conducting in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) using semi-structured interview guide with rural women (FGDs = 4; n = 29) and traditional birth attendants (FGDs = 4; n = 14) who were permanent residents of Thatta. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with women who had experienced a stillbirth (IDIs = 4). This study presents perceptions and experiences of women and TBAs regarding high rate of stillbirth in Thatta district, Karachi. RESULTS: Women showed reluctance to receive skilled/ standard care when in need due to apprehensions towards operative delivery, poor attitude of skilled health care providers, and poor quality of care as service delivery factors. High cost of care, far distance to facility, lack of transport and need of an escort from the family or village to visit a health facility were additional important factors for not seeking care resulting in stillbirth. The easy availability of unskilled provider in the form of traditional birth attendant is then preferred over a skilled health care provider. TBAs shared their husband or family members restrict them to visit or consult a doctor during pregnancy. According to TBAs after delivering a macerated fetus, women are given herbs to remove infection from woman's body and uterus. Further women are advised to conceive soon so that they get rid of infections. CONCLUSION: Women of this rural community carry lots of apprehension against skilled medical care and as a result follow traditional practices. Conscious efforts are required to increase the awareness of women to develop positive health seeking behavior during pregnancy, delivery and the post-partum period. Alongside, provision of respectful maternity care needs to be emphasized especially at public health facilities.",2020,10.1186/s12978-020-0852-0,17,1,3,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Rural Population and Infant, Newborn and *Patient Acceptance of Health Care and Pakistan/epidemiology and Qualitative study and Maternal Health Services/*statistics & numerical data and Home Childbirth/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data and Midwifery/*statistics & numerical data and Rural setting and Stillbirth/*epidemiology/psychology and Stillbirths and Traditional birth attendant's perspectives and Women perspectives",NA,NA,2020/01/13/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hussein_2016_Reprheal,JOUR,Maternal death and obstetric care audits in Nigeria: a systematic review of barriers and enabling factors in the provision of emergency care,"Hussein, Julia and Hirose, Atsumi and Owolabi, Oluwatoyin and Imamura, Mari and Kanguru, Lovney and Okonofua, Friday",Reproductive health,"BACKGROUND: Maternal death reviews and obstetric audits identify causes and circumstances related to occurrence of a maternal death or serious complication and inform improvements in quality of care. Given Nigeria's high maternal mortality, the lessons learned from past experiences can provide a good evidence base for informed decision making. We aimed to synthesise findings from maternal death reviews and other obstetric audits conducted in Nigeria through a systematic review, seeking to identify common barriers and enabling factors related to the provision of emergency obstetric care. METHODS: We searched for maternal death reviews and obstetric care audits reported in the published literature from 2000-2014. A 'best-fit' framework approach was used to extract data using a structured data extraction form. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were assessed using a nine point quality score. RESULTS: Of the 1,841 abstracts and titles at initial screening, 329 full text articles were reviewed and 43 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four types of barriers were reported related to: transport and referral; health workers; availability of services; and organisational factors. Three elements stand out in Nigeria as contributing to maternal mortality: delays in Caesarean section, unavailability of magnesium sulphate and lack of safe blood transfusion services. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetric care reviews and audits are useful activities to undertake and should be promoted by improving the processes used to conduct them, as well as extending their implementation to rural and basic level health facilities and to the community. Urgent areas for quality improvement in obstetric care, even in tertiary and teaching hospitals should focus on organisational factors to reduce delays in conducting Caesarean section and making blood and magnesium sulphate available for all who need these interventions.",2016,10.1186/s12978-016-0158-4,13,NA,47,eng,1742-4755,"Humans and Female and Adult and Pregnancy and Maternal mortality and Medical Audit and Maternal Mortality and Medically Underserved Area and Quality improvement and Time-to-Treatment and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Quality of Health Care and Audit and Nigeria/epidemiology and Emergency obstetric care and Emergency Service, Hospital/*standards and Blood Banks/supply & distribution and Cesarean Section/adverse effects and Magnesium Sulfate/supply & distribution/therapeutic use and Maternal death reviews and Obstetric Labor Complications/mortality/prevention & control/*therapy and Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Hospital/*standards and Pregnancy Complications/mortality/prevention & control/*therapy and Surveillance and response and Tocolytic Agents/supply & distribution/therapeutic use and Transfusion Reaction",NA,NA,2016/04/22/,Reprod Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most parents still tend to disfavor postponing surgery until the child is old enough to provide consent. AIM: To identify the determinants of parental decisions for or against early sex assignment surgery in DSD children, and in particular to assess the influence of contrasting behavior of health-care professionals and the information they dispense. METHODS: Preliminary data analysis from a focus group identified two broad approaches to counseling information. Two six-minute counseling videos were produced on this basis: one medicalized, by an endocrinologist, the other demedicalized, by a psychologist. Third-year medical students (N = 89) were randomized to watch either video as prospective parents and report its impact on their decision in a self-administered questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical analysis of questionnaire responses regarding decisions for or against surgery, including self-assessed impact of potential determinants. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of eighty-nine ""parents"" (43%) chose early surgery for ""their"" child, including 27/41 ""parents"" (66%) shown the medicalized video vs. 11/48 (23%) shown the demedicalized video (P < 0.001). Desired aims for ""their"" child also differed significantly depending on the counseling approach viewed. Yet ""parents"" perceived their personal attitudes on a four-point Likert scale as the main influence on their decision although their ""attitude"" was significantly shaped by the video. CONCLUSIONS: Parental decisions concerning early sex assignment surgery for DSD children depend on the health professional counseling received, to a degree of which neither parents nor professionals appear fully aware. In the absence of conclusive data for or against early surgery, there is a danger of medicalized or demedicalized parentalism resulting in irreversible and inadequately grounded decisions, regardless of the consensus statement of 2005 and the subsequent call for multidisciplinary management.",2013,10.1111/jsm.12214,10,8,1953-1960,eng,1743-6109 1743-6095,Physicians and Humans and Female and Male and Child and Surveys and Questionnaires and Prospective Studies and Attitude and Counseling and Focus Groups and Informed Consent and *Decision Making and *Parents and Disorders of Sex Development and Disorders of Sex Development/*psychology and Intersex and Normality and Pediatric Endocrinology and Pediatric Psychology,NA,NA,2013/08//undefined,J Sex Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: This cohort study assesses the risk of developing auto-immune conditions and common chronic health conditions after a diagnosis of PD. We hypothesize that an increase in auto-immune disease will be evident in men with PD, as has been suggested in smaller studies. METHODS: We determined the longitudinal incidence of 13 auto-immune diseases and 25 common chronic conditions in a cohort from the Truven Health Analytics (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) database from 2007-2013. The cohort included men with 1 of 3 exposures in 2007: (1) men with PD, (2) men with erectile dysfunction (ED) but not PD, and (3) men without PD or ED, matched on age and follow-up duration. OUTCOMES: To assess incidence, we utilized a Cox regression model adjusting for age, smoking, obesity, health care visits per year, urology visits per year, and years of follow-up. RESULTS: We included 8,728 men with PD; 204,147 men with ED; and 87,280 controls. Men with PD had an increased risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.16-1.27), prostatitis (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.31), and lower urinary tract symptoms (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.16) when compared to both men with ED and age-matched controls without ED or PD even when controlling for the number of urology visits per year. Compared to controls, men with PD also had an increased risk of developing keloids. No significant risk for any auto-immune disease was observed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should have heightened awareness for these relevant co-morbidities when treating men with PD. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Utilizing a claims database provides one of the largest cohorts of men with PD ever published but claims databases lack some individual patient data such as risk factors and demographic information relevant to PD, including: penile injury, history of urologic procedures, and other lifestyle factors. CONCLUSION: Men with PD had a higher risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, prostatitis, and keloids after a diagnosis of PD, but no increased risk of auto-immune conditions. These findings suggest a common etiology for these conditions that may manifest itself in diseases at different times in men's life cycle. Pastuszak AW, Rodriguez KM, Solomon ZJ, et al.

Broderick_2009_Thjoofseme,JOUR,Men's sexual health: evaluating the effectiveness of print- and PDA-based CME,"Broderick, Gregory A. and Abdolrasulnia, Maziar",The journal of sexual medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Personal digital assistant (PDA)-based continuing medical education (CME) activities have become widely available. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of print- and PDA-based CME materials in erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: CME materials describing links between ED and comorbid medical conditions, effects of certain lifestyle modifications on ED, and treatment of ED with phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were distributed as a print supplement and as electronic modules, viewed with PDAs. We evaluated how effectively these materials improved evidence-based clinical choices, using survey questions about case vignettes and comparing responses of CME participants (N = 85) and matched nonparticipants (N = 94). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect size, measuring the difference in evidence-based clinical scores between participants and nonparticipants. RESULTS: CME certificates were awarded to 3,557 participants (459 print, 3,098 PDA). Among survey respondents, significantly more CME participants recognized that ED was associated with greater risk for myocardial infarction (61% participants; 34% nonparticipants; P <or= 0.001) and was a strong marker for diabetes mellitus (37% participants; 9% nonparticipants; P <or= 0.001). In contrast, participants and nonparticipants both displayed a good understanding of the relationships of smoking, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle with ED and of using PDE5 inhibitors to treat ED in patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia; this likely reflects a good baseline understanding of these topics. Participants and nonparticipants each displayed a poor understanding of the recommendations regarding nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and PDE5 inhibitor use. Patient reluctance to discuss sexual concerns was perceived as the most significant barrier to optimal ED management. CONCLUSIONS: Given patient reluctance to discuss sexual concerns, future CME activities should focus on educating health-care providers and patients that ED is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Both print- and PDA-based CME on ED were effective; the large number of lesson completers suggests a trend toward on-demand, self-selected CME is positive.",2009,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01270.x,6,9,2417-2424,eng,1743-6109 1743-6095,"Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Risk Factors and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Computers, Handheld/*statistics & numerical data and Clinical Competence/*statistics & numerical data and Education, Medical, Continuing/*statistics & numerical data and Impotence, Vasculogenic/*drug therapy and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use",NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,J Sex Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Daniluk_2016_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Childless women's beliefs and knowledge about oocyte freezing for social and medical reasons,"Daniluk, J. C. and Koert, E.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What factors inform a woman's decision-making about oocyte freezing to preserve fertility for social and medical reasons? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women lacked knowledge about the costs and viability of oocyte freezing as a fertility preservation option for social and medical reasons, and identified health consequences, costs, and viability as being particularly influential in their decision-making. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Having only recently become a viable fertility preservation option, relatively little is known about childless women's beliefs or knowledge about oocyte freezing for social or medical reasons. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross sectional study of 500 childless women was conducted in August, 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 500 childless, presumed fertile, women from 18 to 38 years of age completed an online, self-report questionnaire assessing beliefs and knowledge about oocyte freezing to preserve fertility for social or medical reasons. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Financial costs (85.6%), health risks to themselves (86.4%) or their offspring (87.8%), and success rates (82%) were the primary factors that women felt would influence their decision to freeze their oocytes. Partner's feelings (88.6%), prognosis for a full recovery (85.4%), and concerns about the health effects of the hormones or oocyte retrieval procedure (85.4%) were identified as being particularly important when considering oocyte freezing for medical reasons. Consistent with their perceptions of having little or no knowledge about oocyte freezing, there was an overall correct response rate of 33% to the 12 knowledge questions. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The online format and use of a survey company to recruit participants may have increased the risk of self-selection bias and limit the generalizability of these findings. The findings may also be limited by the fact that the participants were not facing cancer treatments, and the younger participants were not nearing the end of their reproductive lifespan, and therefore would not have had reason to learn about, or consider, fertility preservation for medical or social reasons. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Given the worldwide trend towards delaying childbearing and the increasing availability of oocyte freezing as an option to preserve women's fertility, it is likely these results could be extended to wider North American, European, and Australasian populations of English speaking childless women.

H. and Bouman, Mark-Bram and Mullender, Margriet G.",The journal of sexual medicine,"BACKGROUND: Genital dissatisfaction is an important reason for transmen to undergo genital gender-confirming surgery (GCS; phalloplasty or metoidioplasty). However, little is known about motives for choosing specific techniques, how transmen benefit postoperatively, and whether psychosexual outcomes improve. AIM: To evaluate motivations for and psychosexual outcomes after GCS. METHODS: A longitudinal study of 21 transmen at least 1 year after GCS was conducted. Participants were recruited through their surgeon. Data were collected when they applied for surgery and at least 1 year after surgery. OUTCOMES: Data collection included semistructured questionnaires on motivations for surgery, postoperative experiences, and standardized measures of psychological symptoms, body image, self-esteem, sexuality, and quality of life (pre- and postoperative). Information on surgical complications and corrections was retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: Most participants underwent phalloplasty with urethral lengthening using a radial forearm flap. Although problematic voiding symptoms were prevalent, many participants were satisfied with their penile function. The strongest motivations to pursue penile surgery were confirmation of one's identity (100%), enabling sexual intercourse (78%), and voiding while standing (74%). No significant differences between postoperative and reference values were observed for standardized measures. After surgery, transmen were more sexually active (masturbation and with a partner) and used their genitals more frequently during sex compared with before surgery (31-78%). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present study provides input for preoperative decision making: (i) main motives for surgery include identity confirmation, voiding, and sexuality, (ii) surgery can result in more sexual activity and genital involvement during sex, although some distress can remain, but (iii) complications and voiding symptoms are prevalent. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: Study strengths include its longitudinal design and the novelty of the studied outcomes. The main limitations include the sample size and the nature of the assessment. CONCLUSION: Counseling and decision making for GCS in transmen should be a highly personalized and interdisciplinary practice. van de Grift TC, Pigot GLS, Boudhan S, et al.

AIM: To investigate the association between acute MI and TT use compared with non-use in men having documented hypogonadism (diagnostic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 257.2, 257.8, 257.9, 758.7) in patient claims records. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a real-world US-based administrative health care claims database (MarketScan 2004-2013; Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) to compare MI rates between TT-treated men and a cohort of untreated hypogonadal men matched by a calendar time-specific propensity score. Subgroup analyses were performed by route of administration, age, and prior cardiovascular disease (CVD). OUTCOMES: Incidence rates of MI (per 1,000 person-years) and hazard ratio. RESULTS: After 1:1 calendar time-specific propensity score matching, 207,176 TT-treated men and 207,176 untreated hypogonadal men were included in the analysis (mean age = 51.8 years). Incidence rates of MI were 4.20 (95% CI = 3.87-4.52) in the TT-treated cohort and 4.67 (95% CI = 4.43-4.90) in the untreated hypogonadal cohort. Cox regression model showed no significant association between TT use and MI when comparing TT-treated with untreated hypogonadal men overall (hazard ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.89-1.09), by age, or by prior CVD. A significant association was observed when comparing a subgroup of injectable (short- and long-acting combined) TT users with untreated hypogonadal men (hazard ratio = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.24-1.93). CLINICAL IMPLICATION: In this study, there was no association between TT (overall) and risk of acute MI. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Strengths included the use of a comprehensive real-world database, sophisticated matching based on calendar blocks of 6 months to decrease potential bias in this observational study, carefully chosen index dates for the untreated cohort to avoid immortal time bias, and implemented sensitivity analysis to further investigate the findings (stratification by administration route, age, and prior CVD). Key limitations included no information about adherence, hypogonadism condition based solely on diagnosis (no information on clinical symptoms or testosterone levels), lack of information on disease severity, inability to capture diagnoses, medical procedures, and medicine dispensing if corresponding billing codes were not generated and findings could contain biases or fail to generalize well to other populations. CONCLUSION: This large, retrospective, real-world observational study showed no significant association between TT use and acute MI when comparing TT-treated with untreated hypogonadal men overall, by age, or by prior CVD; the suggested association between injectable TT and acute MI deserves further investigation.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Blastocysts with higher developmental potential and a higher probability of resulting in a viable pregnancy consume higher levels of glucose and exhibit distinct amino acid profiles. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Morphological and morphokinetic analyses utilized in embryo selection provide insight into developmental potential, but alone are unable to provide a direct measure of embryo physiology and inherent health. Glucose uptake is a physiological biomarker of viability and amino acid utilization is different between embryos of varying qualities. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Two hundred and nine human preimplantation embryos from 50 patients were cultured in a time-lapse incubator system in both freeze all and fresh transfer cycles. A retrospective analysis of morphokinetics, morphology (Gardner grade), KIDScore, artificial intelligence grade (EmbryoScore), glucose and amino acid metabolism, and clinical pregnancies was conducted. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ICSI was conducted in all patients, who were aged <e2><89><a4>37 years and previously had no more than two IVF cycles. Embryos were individually cultured in a time-lapse incubator system, and those reaching the blastocyst stage had their morphokinetics annotated and were each assigned a Gardner grade, KIDScore and EmbryoScore. Glucose and amino acid metabolism were measured. Clinical pregnancies were confirmed by the presence of a fetal heartbeat at 6 weeks of gestation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Glucose consumption was at least 40% higher in blastocysts deemed of high developmental potential using either the Gardner grade (P < 0.01, n = 209), KIDScore (P < 0.05, n = 207) or EmbryoScore (P < 0.05, n = 184), compared to less viable blastocysts and in blastocysts that resulted in a clinical pregnancy compared to those that failed to implant (P < 0.05, n = 37). Additionally, duration of cavitation was inversely related to glucose consumption (P < 0.05, n = 200). Total amino acid consumption was significantly higher in blastocysts with an EmbryoScore higher than the cohort median score (P < 0.01, n = 185). Furthermore, the production of amino acids was significantly lower in blastocysts with a high Gardner grade (P < 0.05, n = 209), KIDScore (P < 0.05, n = 207) and EmbryoScore (P < 0.01, n = 184). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Samples were collected from patients who had ICSI treatment and from only one clinic. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results confirm that metabolites, such as glucose and amino acids, are valid biomarkers of embryo viability and could therefore be used in conjunction with other systems to aid in the selection of a healthy embryo.

AIM: The aim of this article is to investigate a patient's indications for seeking labiaplasty of the labia minora. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients undergoing labiaplasty at our clinic over a 27-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indications for surgery were assessed using standardized questionnaires during the patients' initial history and physical. Patients were divided into three groups as based on the questionnaire, including: Group I-patients seeking the procedure strictly for aesthetic reasons; Group II-patients seeking the procedure strictly for functional impairment (i.e., pain and discomfort); and Group III-patients who feel they are having the surgery for both aesthetic and functional reasons. Patients undergoing the surgery for aesthetic reasons were also asked whether this was strictly a personal decision or was influenced by either another man or woman whether a friend, spouse, or partner. RESULTS: The review revealed 131 patients had undergone a labia reduction surgery: Group I-those who received labia reduction surgery for strictly aesthetic reasons equaled 37% (49/131); Group II-those seeking the surgery strictly for functional impairment equaled 32% (42/131); and Group III-those seeking the surgery for both functional and aesthetic reasons equaled 31% (40/131).

R. and Eeles, R. and Lavery, S. and Ormondroyd, E.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: How do young women, who were identified as carrying a BRCA gene mutation before they had children, approach reproductive decision-making and what are their attitudes towards reproductive genetic testing? SUMMARY ANSWER: Reproductive decision-making within the context of cancer risk is complex and influenced by personal experiences of cancer. Younger women were not concerned with reproductive decision-making at the time of their genetic test; however, the impact on subsequent reproductive decision-making was considerable and left them with unanticipated dilemmas, such as having children who would be at risk of inheriting cancer predisposition, timing risk-reducing surgery and changing perceptions of responsibility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Individuals carrying gene mutations predisposing to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer have concerns about passing on the gene mutation to children. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Qualitative methodology and thematic analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 25 women aged 18-45 who had received a positive result for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation while childless. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Analysis revealed four central themes: (i) the impact of cancer on reproductive decision-making; (ii) motivation for genetic testing; (iii) risk management and timing of planning children; and (iv) optimism for future medical advancements. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study explores the views of female BRCA carriers. Further research should explore the views of couples, men, and include samples with greater ethnic and social diversity. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This evidence highlights the need for reproductive decision-making to be addressed at the time of pretest genetic counselling. More information should be provided on reproductive options as well as counselling/support to guide women's reproductive decision-making and prenatal testing options at the time they undertake genetic testing.

AIM: To provide up-to-date guidance for U.K. (and international) health care professionals managing male sexual dysfunction. METHODS: Source information was obtained from peer-reviewed articles, meetings, and presentations. A search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Reviews was performed, covering the search terms ""hypogonadism,"" ""eugonadal or hypogonadism or hypogonadal or gonadal,"" and ""low or lower testosterone,"" starting from 2009 with a cut-off date of September 2017. OUTCOMES: We offer evidence-based statements and recommendations for clinicians. RESULTS: Expert guidance for health care professionals managing male sexual dysfunction is included. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Current U.K. management has been largely influenced by non-evidence guidance from National Health Service departments, largely based on providing access to care limited by resources. The 2008 BSSM guidelines to date have been widely quoted in U.K. policy decision making. CONCLUSIONS: There is now overwhelming evidence that erectile dysfunction is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, such that newly presenting patients should be thoroughly evaluated for cardiovascular and endocrine risk factors, which should be managed accordingly. Measurement of fasting serum glucose, lipid profile, and morning total testosterone should be considered mandatory in all newly presenting patients. Patients attending their primary care physician with chronic cardiovascular disease should be asked about erectile problems.

AIM: To further the empirical and clinical understanding of hypersexuality by exploring the structure of its symptoms using a network analytic approach. METHODS: In 2014, an online survey advertised as focusing on Internet pornography, sexual health, and relationships was carried out among Croatian men and women aged 18-60 years (M(age) = 31.1 years, SD = 9.67). In a sample of 3,028 participants, we applied a network analytic approach to explore the structure of hypersexuality symptoms. In the network, nodes represented hypersexuality symptoms and associated sexual behaviors, while their connections were operationalized as partial correlations. 4 Research questions were addressed: (1) does the hypersexuality network differ between genders; (2) which symptoms are centrally positioned; (3) what is the topological location of pornography use; and (4) are there distinct clusters (""communities"") of symptoms in the network? OUTCOMES: We estimated and plotted hypersexuality networks by gender using items from the Hypersexual Disorder Screening Inventory and the Hypersexual Behavioral Consequences Scale, as well as indicators of sexual desire, pornography use, sexual intercourse, and masturbation frequency. RESULTS: The structure of the hypersexuality network was surprisingly similar in women and men, both in terms of symptom centrality and the clustering of symptoms. Psychological distress and negative emotions triggered by sexual fantasies and/or behaviors, together with a loss of control over sexual feelings, occupied central positions in the networks. Pornography use was located peripherally in both the men's and women's hypersexuality networks. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Psychological distress and negative emotions triggered by sexual fantasies and/or behaviors constituted the core of the hypersexuality network, which makes them potential prime targets for clinical intervention and calls for normalization of (presumably self-stigmatized) sexual expression through affirmative therapy and interventions that enhance self-care, self-compassion, and adaptive coping mechanisms. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is the first network analytic approach to hypersexuality. Apart from its novel insights about the structure of hypersexuality, the study employed several methods to assure reliability and robustness of findings. Considering that networks were estimated in a convenience-based community sample, the findings might not generalize to clinically distressed individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of network analytics to hypersexuality in a non-clinical sample and we encourage future clinical and longitudinal explorations of hypersexuality using this novel approach.

Sunaryo_2014_Thjoofseme,JOUR,Penile prostheses and the litigious patient: a legal database review,"Sunaryo, Peter L. and Colaco, Marc and Terlecki, Ryan",The journal of sexual medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem with significant impact on patient quality of life. Penile prosthesis implantation provides an effective treatment for ED but as an invasive procedure carries with it an increased risk of medicolegal liability. AIM: To investigate factors associated with malpractice litigation surrounding penile prosthesis implantation. METHODS: The Westlaw legal database was used to perform an advanced search for case reports using the term ""medical malpractice"" in combination with ""penile"" or ""penis"" and ""prosthesis"" or ""implant"" with dates between the January 1990 and December 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each report was examined for trial information including patient demographics, device model and indications, alleged breach of duty, alleged damages, progression to trial, case outcome, and plaintiff award(s). RESULTS: The initial search yielded 76 cases that were narrowed to 40 after exclusions. There were 23 (57.5%) cases that were found in favor of the defendant, while 17 (42.5%) cases led to indemnity payment to the plaintiff including two cases (5.0%) that were settled out of court and 15 (37.5%) favoring the plaintiff in front of a jury. The mean settlement received was $335,500 compared with the mean indemnity award of $831,050 for verdicts decided in favor of the plaintiff (P = 0.68). The most common breach of duty was error in surgical decision making, present in 20 cases (48.8%). Informed consent was an issue in 13 filings (31.7%), and postoperative infection was seen in 13 cases (31.7%). In cases that identified the type of implant used, 58.3% were malleable implants, and 41.7% were inflatable devices. CONCLUSIONS: The main issues involved in malpractice litigation for penile prosthesis implants included surgical performance, informed consent, and postoperative management.

We address the ethical implications of the fact that routine NIPD affects the scope and strategy of current prenatal screening cascades. A decision is needed whether complementary (invasive) testing remains in place in order to avoid a loss of information as compared with current practice.

The MRC, then the major British funder of medical research, declined support on ethical grounds and maintained this policy throughout the 1970s. The work continued with private money, leading to the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 and transforming research in obstetrics, gynaecology and human embryology. METHODS: The MRC decision has been criticized, but the processes by which it was reached have yet to be explored. Here, we present an archive-based analysis of the MRC decision. RESULTS: We find evidence of initial support for Edwards and Steptoe, including from within the MRC, which invited the applicants to join its new directly funded Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital. They declined the offer, preferring long-term grant support at the University of Cambridge, and so exposed the project to competitive funding mode. Referees and the Clinical Research Board saw the institutional set-up in Cambridge as problematic with respect to clinical facilities and patient management; gave infertility a low priority compared with population control; assessed interventions as purely experimental rather than potential treatments, and so set the bar for safety high; feared fatal abnormalities and so wanted primate experiments first; and were antagonized by the applicants' high media profile. The rejection set MRC policy on IVF for 8 years, until, after the birth of just two healthy babies, the Council rapidly converted to enthusiastic support.

Giuliano_2013_Thjoofseme,JOUR,Standard operating procedures for neurophysiologic assessment of male sexual dysfunction,"Giuliano, Francois and Rowland, David L.",The journal of sexual medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Can neurophysiological testing in male patients with sexual dysfunction benefit the decision-making process? The answer remains unclear. AIM: To provide standard operating procedures for the neurophysiologic assessment of male sexual dysfunction. METHODS: Medical literature was reviewed and combined with expert opinion of the authors. RESULTS: Bulbocavernosus reflex latency time, pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials, and sympathetic skin responses have been considered as potential candidates for the diagnosis and assessment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Currently, there is no consensus on a standardized methodology for these neurophysiological investigations in the overall assessment of ED. These procedures are unable to assess the integrity of the efferent parasympathetic proerectile penile innervation; accordingly, none of these assessment procedures is recommended for ED patients. Corpus cavernosum electromyography (CC-EMG) can detect abnormalities in cavernous smooth muscle although these alterations can be attributed both to damage to autonomic penile innervation and to degenerative processes of the cavernous smooth muscle. CC-EMG is still considered experimental. Evidence does not support that men with premature ejaculation (PE) are consistently characterized by penile hypersensitivity; accordingly, penile threshold determination is not recommended to in the diagnosis of PE. Neurophysiological investigation of other components of the penile sensory pathways in PE patients has not provided any definitive contribution to the diagnosis.

Allen_2019_Thjoofseme,JOUR,"Erectile Dysfunction: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses of Risk-Factors, Treatment, and Prevalence Outcomes","Allen, Mark S. and Walter, Emma E.",The journal of sexual medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major health care problem that has implications for quality of life. AIM: This umbrella review sought to synthesize all meta-analytic research on risk factors, treatment, and prevalence of ED. METHODS: 8 electronic databases were searched for relevant meta-analyses in June 2018. The evidence was graded with 2 measures that use quantitative criteria to establish the quality of report writing and confidence in the effect size reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifestyle factors, genetic markers, medical conditions, treatments. RESULTS: In total, 98 meta-analyses were identified that included 421 meta-analytic effects, 4,188 primary-effects, and 3,971,122 participants. Pooled estimates showed that an unhealthy lifestyle, genetic markers, and medical conditions were associated with an increased risk of ED. Testosterone therapy and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors showed the greatest treatment efficacy, with mild adverse events observed across treatments. Psychological and behavior change interventions produced effect sizes that were comparable to medication but had greater imprecision in effect sizes. There was little evidence that combined treatments were more efficacious than single treatments. Meta-analyses of prevalence estimates showed consistent age trends but were limited to particular regions or clinical samples, meaning that global estimates of ED are difficult to determine. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The umbrella review synthesized findings for many treatment options that might aid evidence-based clinical decision-making. Based on prevalence estimates, we recommend that primary care physicians take a proactive approach and enquire about erectile problems in all men over age 40 displaying any health-related issue (eg, overweight, cigarette smoking). STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include the calculation and comparison of summary estimates across multiple meta-analyses. Limitations include heterogeneity in research quality across research themes limiting effect size comparisons. CONCLUSION: The review provides summary estimates for 37 risk factors and 28 treatments. Meta-analyses of risk factors often did not control for important confounders, and meta-analyses of randomized trials were not exclusive to double-blinded trials, active placebo controls, or tests of long-term effects. We recommend further meta-analyses that eliminate lower quality studies and further primary research on behavioral and combined treatments. Allen MS, Walter EE.

The objective of this study was to describe how patients speak about their embryos, in moral (e.g. status) and non-moral terms, and to investigate how patients' narratives are related to their disposition preferences. METHODS: In-depth interviews based on the method of interpretative phenomenological analysis were conducted with patients undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment between May and July 2006. RESULTS: Seven couples and 11 female patients were interviewed. Six major themes emerged from the narratives of the participants when they spoke about their embryos: (i) a medical-technical perspective; (ii) feelings; (iii) genetic link to oneself and/or one's partner; (iv) symbolic meaning of the relationship between the infertile partners; (v) moral status and (vi) instrumental value. All but two participants spontaneously considered the embryo disposition options as a two-stage decision sequence. In the first step, they considered donation to another couple for reproductive purposes. At this stage, the presence of the themes 'genetic link' and 'symbol of the relationship' was linked with a clear reluctance to donate. In the second step of the decision-making process, the option of donation for research and discarding were considered. At this stage, participants' confidence in medical science and the instrumental value they attached to the embryo were related to their decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' conceptualization of their embryos plays an important role in embryo disposition decisions.

C. M. and Postma, S. A. E. and IntHout, J. and Verhaak, C. M. and Braat, D. D. M. and Nelen, W. L. D. M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What are the decisive factors in fertility preservation (FP) decision-making in young women scheduled for gonadotoxic therapy? SUMMARY ANSWER: FP decision-making in young women scheduled for gonadotoxic therapy is mainly based on weighing two issues: the intensity of the wish to conceive a child in the future and the expected burden of undergoing FP treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Future fertility is of importance for young cancer patients whose reproductive function is being threatened by oncological therapy. To prevent or reduce severe psychological effects of infertility as well as feelings of regret about their FP decision after cancer treatment, the quality of fertility preservation counselling (FPC) should be improved. To improve care, those issues forming a decisive factor in FP decision-making for patients should be clarified, as these issues deserve extensive discussion during FPC. Until now, decisive factors have not been isolated from the complex interplay of all aspects of FP that women contemplate during FP decision-making. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: By using a mixed methods methodology, a questionnaire developed after qualitative research involving a selected group of five women who previously received FPC was retrospectively sent to eligible patients (n = 143) who had received FPC (1999 - July 2013) and to whom at least one FP option was offered. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients had received FPC at a university hospital in the Netherlands, in a setting where financial factors do not play a role in FP. They were aged <e2><89><a5>16 years and were scheduled for gonadotoxic treatment. The relationship between patients' baseline characteristics, their attributed importance to 28 relevant importance items and their FP choices was investigated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After five interviews, 28 importance items for FP decision-making were identified and included in our questionnaire. Of these 28 importance items, 24 items could be clustered into seven importance themes. A total of 87 patients (61%) responded to our questionnaire. After performing a multivariable logistic regression analysis, proceeding with FP was related to higher attributed importance during FP decision-making to the theme 'Wish to conceive (in the future)' (odds ratio (OR) 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-34.4) and the item 'Having a stable partner relationship' (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.1), while higher attributed importance to the theme 'Expected burden of FP' during FP decision-making (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.3) more often resulted in refraining from treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Besides possible recall and selection bias, the fact that this study was performed in Dutch patients aged <e2><89><a5>16 years counselled in a single centre, where finance was not an additional consideration, possibly limits the generalizability of our results to a broader European population of cancer patients. Furthermore, we are not able to draw conclusions about the causality of the associations observed in our study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The wish to conceive and the expected burden of FP treatment should be discussed carefully with patients during FP decision-making, either by the referring healthcare provider or by reproductive medicine specialist. Prospective research is needed to explore the causality of the associations found in this study. Furthermore, in order to deliver high quality patient-centred care, the development of tools to explore patients' wish to conceive (for example in different age categories) and tools to provide clear information about the burden of FP treatments (using the preferred information channels suggested by patients) is needed.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Women younger than age 35 were more likely to intend to take measures to improve their chance of conceiving when they were knowledgeable about fertility and felt susceptible to infertility; however, there was no such association in older women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The majority of young adults wish to become parents but many are jeopardizing their chances by engaging in behaviours that decrease fertility (e.g. smoking, not seeking timely medical advice when faced with problems conceiving). Research is needed to establish what motivates people to take steps to optimize their chances of pregnancy. The Health Belief Model (HBM) postulates that knowledge and beliefs about susceptibility to infertility are critical in whether people will engage in fertility-optimizing behaviours. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This cross-sectional survey included 1345 childless women (trying to conceive and having never engaged in fertility medical treatment) from the International Fertility Decision-Making Study (IFDMS). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Infertility risk factors were determined using the FertiSTAT. The Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS) assessed fertility knowledge. Perceived susceptibility was defined as whether a fertility problem was suspected. The outcome measure was intentions to optimize one's fertility by making lifestyle changes and/or seeking help. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In this study, 75.5% of women had an infertility risk factor and 60.3% suspected a fertility problem. The average correct score on the CFKS was 51.9%. Intentions to optimize fertility were lower among women who were heavy smokers (P < 0.05) and who had been trying to conceive for a year or over (P < 0.01), while intentions to optimize fertility were greater among those with a higher body mass index or greater knowledge and those who suspected a fertility problem (all P < 0.001). These overall effects were qualified in some subgroups. Heavy smokers were more likely to intend to seek medical help when they had greater knowledge (P < 0.001) and women having difficulty conceiving were more likely to intend to seek medical help if they felt susceptible to infertility (P < 0.001). Heavy smokers who were knowledgeable intended to change their lifestyle only when they felt they had a fertility problem (P < 0.01). Intentions to change were not dependent on knowledge and perceived susceptibility in older women. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data were cross-sectional and thus we cannot infer causality. The results may have been affected by the sample profile, which was biased towards high levels of perceived susceptibility and low levels of knowledge. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: To maximize impact, educational campaigns should take into account the presence and type of infertility risk factors in the target audience.

AIM: To investigate the experiences WSW have after disclosure of sexual orientation during gynecological care in Brazil. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using content analysis. We recorded and transcribed interviews with 34 WSW from the 5 regions in Brazil. Data were analyzed using descriptive content analysis. OUTCOMES: The main categories of analysis were decision-making process to disclose and attitude of gynecologists after disclosure. RESULTS: WSW disclosed their sexual orientation in an un-favorable environment. Gynecologists rarely asked about patients' sexual orientation and used a script for hetero-normative anamnesis. The reactions of gynecologists were discriminatory, resulting in abbreviated consultations and un-comfortable gynecological exams. They missed a window of opportunity for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of various diseases. The experiences Brazilian WSW had during gynecological care demonstrated the dominant hetero-normativity in the health care scenario. The attitudes of the gynecologists precarized the existence of WSW in health service. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that gynecologists missed an opportunity to use WSW's sexual orientation disclosure to offer specific care to them. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is the first qualitative study about WSW's experiences during gynecological care in Brazil. Future studies should be developed from a wider sampling, especially among lower-class WSW. CONCLUSION: The results point out the need for a change in medical training and guidelines to assist WSW in the country. Rufino AC, Madeiro A, Trinidad AS, et al.

Vercellini_2018_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Medical treatment or surgery for colorectal endometriosis? Results of a shared decision-making approach,"Vercellini, Paolo and Frattaruolo, Maria Pina and Rosati, Riccardo and Dridi, Dhouha and Roberto, Anna and Mosconi, Paola and De Giorgi, Olga and Cribiu, Fulvia Milena and Somigliana, Edgardo","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What is the degree of patient satisfaction in women with symptomatic colorectal endometriosis who choose medical or surgical treatment after a shared decision-making (SDM) process? SUMMARY ANSWER: The degree of satisfaction with treatment was high both in women who chose medical treatment with a low-dose oral contraceptive (OCP) or a progestin, and in those who chose to undergo surgical resection of bowel endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Hormonal therapies and surgery for colorectal endometriosis have been investigated in non-comparative studies with inconsistent results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Parallel cohort study conducted on 87 women referring to our centre with an indication to surgery for colorectal endometriosis. A standardised SDM process was adopted, allowing women to choose their preferred treatment. Median follow-up was 40 [18-60] months in the medical therapy group and 45 [30-67] in the surgery group. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients with endometriosis infiltrating the proximal rectum, the rectosigmoid junction, and the sigmoid, not causing severe sub-occlusive symptoms were enroled. A total of 50 patients chose treatment with an OCP (n = 12) or a progestin (n = 38), whereas 37 women confirmed their previous indication to surgery. Patient satisfaction was graded according to a 5-category scale. Variations in bowel and pain symptoms were measured by means of a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Constipation was assessed with the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom Questionnaire (KESS), health-related quality of life with the Short Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12), psychological status with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and sexual functioning with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Six women in the medical therapy group requested surgery because of drug inefficacy (n = 3) or intolerance (n = 3). Seven major complications were observed in the surgery group (19%). At 12-month follow-up, 39 (78%) women in the medical therapy group were satisfied with their treatment, compared with 28 (76%) in the surgery group (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-4.15; intention-to-treat analysis). Corresponding figures at final follow-up assessment were 72% in the former group and 65% in the latter one (adjusted OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.62-4.85). The 60-month cumulative proportion of dissatisfaction-free participants was 71% in the medical therapy group compared with 61% in the surgery group (P = 0.61); the Hazard incidence rate ratio was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.57-2.62). Intestinal complaints were ameliorated by both treatments. Significant between-group differences in favour of medical treatment were observed at 12-month follow-up in diarrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, non-menstrual pelvic pain and SF-12 physical component scores. The total HADS score improved significantly in both groups, whereas the total FSFI score improved only in women who chose medical therapy. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: As treatments were not randomly assigned, selection bias and confounding are likely. The small sample size exposes to the risk of type II errors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: When adequately informed and empowered through a SDM process, most patients with non-occlusive colorectal endometriosis who had already received a surgical indication, preferred medical therapy. The possibility of choosing the preferred treatment may allow maximisation of the potential effect of the interventions.

The objective of this study is to describe how patients think about (treatment with) cryopreserved embryos. METHODS: In-depth interviews based on the method of interpretative phenomenological analysis were conducted with patients undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment at the Department of Reproductive Medicine of the Ghent University Hospital between May and July 2006. Seven couples (one couple considered as one participant) and 11 female patients who attended the clinic without their partner were interviewed. RESULTS: Most participants knew little about medical-technical procedures involved in treatment with cryopreserved embryos. This was compensated by a high confidence in the medical team. However, seven of the eighteen participants thought the quality of cryopreserved embryos diminished during the storage period. A lack of knowledge about medical-technical procedures was compensated by metaphors related to other domains of experience, especially kitchen metaphors: this might add to the belief that frozen embryos have an expiry date. However, none of the patients who considered treatment with cryopreserved embryos as less effective ever thought of refusing this type of treatment or discussed this with medical staff. In addition, patients rarely discussed the moral status of their cryopreserved embryos.

The practice of hymen reconstruction constitutes a challenge for health care providers in medical, ethical, judicial, social, and cultural dimensions, for which they are not well prepared. AIM: The aim of the presented nationwide survey was to investigate the experience of Swiss gynecologists with women requesting hymen reconstruction. METHODS: A questionnaire specifically designed for this purpose was sent to 100 public hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included demands for (number of requests, origin of women) and attitudes toward hymen reconstruction (requests granted, decision-making for or against intervention, surgical technique applied, problems associated with the requests for hymen repair, cost coverage, need for further information) in Switzerland. RESULTS: The response rate was 68%. Of the 43 clinics (63.2%) confronted with requests for hymen reconstruction, 38 (90.5%) claimed to see up to five patients per year. The predominantly mentioned countries of origin were Turkey in the German-speaking part and Arab countries in the French-speaking part. More than half of the clinics (27/64.3%) reported that they always (12/28.6%) or mostly (15/35.7%) granted the request. Decision for surgery was made after intensive counseling in 44.2% and on demand of the patient after brief counseling in 32.7%. The so-called approximation method was the most frequently applied surgical technique. A third of the participants (19/35.2%) reported problems with confidentiality. More than half of the clinics expressed their need for further information on this topic. CONCLUSIONS: Hymen reconstruction is rarely performed in Switzerland, even though two-thirds of the responding hospitals are confronted with this issue several times per year. No guidelines exist on how health professionals should deal with these requests.

Bunting_2013_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Fertility knowledge and beliefs about fertility treatment: findings from the International Fertility Decision-making Study,"Bunting, Laura and Tsibulsky, Ivan and Boivin, Jacky","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: How good is fertility knowledge and what are treatment beliefs in an international sample of men and women currently trying to conceive? SUMMARY ANSWER: The study population had a modest level of fertility knowledge and held positive and negative views of treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Few studies have examined general fertility treatment attitudes but studies of specific interventions show that attitudes are related to characteristics of the patient, doctor and context. Further, research shows that fertility knowledge is poor. However, the majority of these studies have examined the prevalence of infertility, the optimal fertile period and/or age-related infertility in women, in university students and/or people from high-resource countries making it difficult to generalize findings. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional sample completed the International Fertility Decision-making Study (IFDMS) over a 9-month period, online or via social research panels and in fertility clinics. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were 10 045 people (8355 women, 1690 men) who were on average 31.8 years old, had been trying to conceive for 2.8 years with 53.9% university educated. From a total of 79 countries, sample size was >100 in 18 countries. All 79 countries were assigned to either a very high Human Development Index (VH HDI) or a not very high HDI (NVH HDI). The IFDMS was a 45-min, 64-item English survey translated into 12 languages. The inclusion criteria were the age between 18 and 50 years and currently trying to conceive for at least 6 months. Fertility knowledge was assessed using a 13-item correct/incorrect scale concerned with risk factors, misconceptions and basic fertility facts (range: 0-100% correct). Treatment beliefs were assessed with positive and negative statements about fertility treatment rated on a five-point agree/disagree response scale. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Average correct score for Fertility Knowledge was 56.9%, with greater knowledge significantly related to female gender, university education, paid employment, VH HDI and prior medical consultation for infertility (all P < 0.001). The mean agreement scores for treatment beliefs showed that agreement for positive items (safety, efficacy) was correlated with agreement for negative items (short/long-term physical/emotional effects) (P > 0.001). People who had given birth/fathered a child, been trying to conceive for less than 12 months, who had never consulted for a fertility problem and who lived in a country with an NVH HDI agreed less with negative beliefs. HDI, duration of trying to conceive and help-seeking were also correlates of higher positive beliefs, alongside younger age, living in an urban area and having stepchildren. Greater fertility knowledge was associated with stronger agreement on negative treatment beliefs items (P < 0.001) but was unrelated to positive treatment beliefs items. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There was volunteer bias insofar as more women, people of higher education and people with fertility problems (i.e. met criteria for infertility, had consulted a medical doctor, had conceived with fertility treatment) participated and this was true in VH and NVH HDI countries. The bias may mean that people in this sample had better fertility knowledge and less favourable treatment beliefs than is the case in the general population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Educational interventions should be directed at improving knowledge of fertility health. Future prospective research should be aimed at investigating how fertility knowledge and treatment beliefs affect childbearing and help-seeking decision-making.",2013,10.1093/humrep/des402,28,2,385-397,eng,1460-2350 0268-1161,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Sex Factors and Socioeconomic Factors and Infertility/*psychology and Reproductive Health/education and Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*psychology",NA,NA,2013/02//undefined,Hum Reprod,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth focus group methodology. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT(S): A total of 19 Dutch women diagnosed with DE between 27 and 47 years of age. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Focus group topics were disease impact and motives for treatment, expectations of the treatment process, and important factors in the decision process. RESULT(S): Women reported that pain, fertility, and strong fear of complications are important decisive factors in the treatment process. The goal of conceiving a child is considered important, however, sometimes doctors emphasize this topic too much. It emerged that complication counseling is frequently about surgical complications, whereas side effects of hormonal treatments are neglected. Shared decision making and information about treatment options, complications, and side effects are not always optimal, making it difficult to make a well-considered choice. Despite negative experiences encountered after surgery, the positive effect of surgery ensures that most women do not regret their choice. CONCLUSION(S): In the treatment decision process for patients with DE, pain is almost always the most important decisive factor. The wish to conceive and strong fear of complications can change this choice. Doctors should understand the importance of fertility for the majority of women, but, also, if this is not considered paramount, respect that view.

Van.Hoof_2013_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Reflections of Dutch patients on IVF treatment in Belgium: a qualitative analysis of internet forums,"Van Hoof, Wannes and Provoost, Veerle and Pennings, Guido","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What information is shared on Dutch internet forums with regard to infertility treatment in Belgium? SUMMARY ANSWER: The online discussion mainly regards medical treatments, feelings and experiences, and financial implications. The general tone of the discussion on the forums about fertility treatment in Belgium is that Belgian clinics offer better quality of care. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The internet is the most important source of information for cross-border patients. Many Dutch patients visit Belgian clinics for infertility treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study comprised an inductive thematic analysis of eight Dutch internet forums about infertility. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All the threads that were active in a 15-month period (October 2010-December 2011) were retrieved and checked for relevance. This resulted in 77 threads containing 1813 posts that were used for thematic analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eight themes emerged after data analysis: medical expertise and testing, feelings and experiences, costs, trying out different clinics, travel and waiting times, treatments in the Netherlands, cooperation between clinics/physicians and laws and regulations. Our analysis of shared patient experiences indicates that patients identify respect for the person behind the patient as the fundamental reason why quality of care is higher in Belgium. They define this respect as active involvement in the medical decision-making process, which is considered a form of patient-centred care. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data from internet forums are not representative of the experience of Dutch IVF patients in Belgium. We are presenting a thematic analysis of information that circulates on the web, not making statements about IVF treatment in Belgium or the Netherlands.

Kearney_2016_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Examining the psychosocial determinants of women's decisions to delay childbearing,"Kearney, Allison L. and White, Katherine M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What are the psychosocial determinants of women's intentions to delay childbearing until after 35 years? SUMMARY ANSWER: Attitudes, pressure from important others, perceived self-confidence and anticipated regret all influence the decision-making process of women aged 18-30 years to defer their attempts to conceive their first child until 35+ years. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Research has consistently demonstrated that, for many women, the decision to delay childbearing can lead to 'unintentional childlessness' due to a failure to consider the impact of age-related fertility decline. A large body of literature has also found strong links between age-related involuntary infertility and negative psychological impacts, including an increased prevalence of anxiety, depression, guilt, stigma and poor mental health. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study initially conducted focus groups designed to ascertain important beliefs informing participants' intentions to delay childbearing. A subsequent larger-scale quantitative questionnaire followed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants (n = 358) were female, aged between 18 and 30 years, lived in Australia, identified as being open to the idea of having children, were heterosexual, had not already had children, were not already pregnant, and had not received a diagnosis of medical infertility prior to participating. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed strong support for psychosocial predictors of attitude, pressure from others and perceived self-confidence as predictors of women's intentions to delay childbearing, accounting for 59% of total variance. The extended model that included anticipated regret, accounted for a significant additional 4.4% variance in intention to delay childbearing past the age of 35 years. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Proportionally more participants were younger, Caucasian, and were university students, thus limiting the generalizability of results to the wider Australian community. Future research in this domain is recommended to adopt a prospective design and incorporate a measure of behaviour to investigate the link between intentions to delay childbearing and future fertility behaviour. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This research augments our understanding of the decision-making process and key beliefs underlying the decision to delay childbearing. Further efforts are needed to advise young women to investigate their fertility options during the peak of their reproductive years in order to prevent negative psychological consequences associated with unintentional childlessness.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Thematic analysis of interview transcripts. RESULT(S): Although embryo holders expected that IVF clinics were under obligation to assist in the disposition decision and would be their main source of information, these expectations did not become manifest until years after embryo cryopreservation. Patients expressed a variety of preferences for the timing, format, and content of information and support, ranging from detailed written information to counselor/advocates that could provide logistical guidance and/or psychologic support. Embryo holders perceived an insufficiently defined infrastructure to facilitate donation to other couples, whereas donating to medical research was seen as less complicated and more likely to be encouraged and supported by physicians and clinics. Although increasing storage fees motivated disposition decision making, they could be interpreted as coercive and/or not reflective of actual clinic costs. CONCLUSION(S): Frozen embryo-holding patients' expectations of information and support to assist them with disposition decision making and embryo donation suggests that IVF clinics may benefit from a review of their frozen embryo counseling, storage, and disposition policies and procedures.",2010,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.02.023,94,6,2069-2072,eng,1556-5653 0015-0282,Disclosure and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Interviews as Topic and Patient Preference/*statistics & numerical data and Freezing and *Embryo Disposition/ethics/psychology and *Fertilization in Vitro/ethics/psychology and *Patient Education as Topic/ethics and Ambulatory Care Facilities/ethics and Blastocyst and Perception/*physiology and Tissue Donors/ethics/psychology,NA,NA,2010/11//undefined,Fertil Steril,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and van der Veen, F.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Are we able to develop a model to calculate the chances of pregnancy prior to the start of the first IVF cycle as well as after one or more failed cycles? SUMMARY ANSWER: Our prediction model enables the accurate individualized calculation of the probability of an ongoing pregnancy with IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: To improve counselling, patient selection and clinical decision-making in IVF, a number of prediction models have been developed. These models are of limited use as they were developed before current clinical and laboratory protocols were established. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a cohort study. The development set included 2621 cycles in 1326 couples who had been treated with IVF or ICSI between January 2001 and July 2009. The validation set included additional data from 515 cycles in 440 couples treated between August 2009 and April 2011. The outcome of interest was an ongoing pregnancy after transfer of fresh or frozen-thawed embryos from the same stimulated IVF cycle. If a couple became pregnant after an IVF/ICSI cycle, the follow-up was at a gestational age of at least 11 weeks. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women treated with IVF or ICSI between January 2001 and April 2011 in a university hospital. IVF/ICSI cycles were excluded in the case of oocyte or embryo donation, surgically retrieved spermatozoa, patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus, modified natural IVF and cycles cancelled owing to poor ovarian stimulation, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or other unexpected medical or non-medical reasons. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Thirteen variables were included in the final prediction model. For all cycles, these were female age, duration of subfertility, previous ongoing pregnancy, male subfertility, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, basal FSH and number of failed IVF cycles. After the first cycle: fertilization, number of embryos, mean morphological score per Day 3 embryo, presence of 8-cell embryos on Day 3 and presence of morulae on Day 3 were also included. In validation, the model had moderate discriminative capacity (c-statistic 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.73) but calibrated well, with a range from 0.01 to 0.56 in calculated probabilities. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In our study, the outcome of interest was ongoing pregnancy. Live birth may have been a more appropriate outcome, although only 1-2% of all ongoing pregnancies result in late miscarriage or stillbirth. The model was based on data from a single centre. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The IVF model presented here is the first to calculate the chances of an ongoing pregnancy with IVF, both for the first cycle and after any number of failed cycles. The generalizability of the model to other clinics has to be evaluated more extensively in future studies (geographical validation). Centres with higher or lower success rates could use the model, after recalibration, by adjusting the intercept to reflect the IVF success rates in their centre.

No data have been published from naturalistic studies performed in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) with or without erectile dysfunction (ED) and treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. AIM: The aim of this study (TadaLutsEd Study) was to assess, in the context of medical practice, the effectiveness of tadalafil 5 mg once daily in patients with LUTS/BPH with or without erectile dysfunction. METHODS: The study was a 6-week uncontrolled, prospective, open-label, multicentric, observational study. The patient population involved sexually active males aged <e2><89><a5> 50 years, diagnosed with LUTS/BPH with or without concomitant ED, and treated with tadalafil 5 mg daily in accordance with standard urological practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was assessed through the self-administered International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire; quality of life was evaluated through the IPSS quality of life section (IPSS-QoL). The patients were also evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Adverse events were recorded. Statistical analyses using paired data samples was applied (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (mean age 62.2 years) completed the treatment, of whom 85.5% showed improvement in their urinary symptoms. Pre- and post-treatment differences in the IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and IIEF-5 scores were statistically significant at 4.4, 1, and 5.4 points, respectively (P < 0.0001). Tadalafil was well tolerated, and adverse events were mild, with a discontinuation rate of 1.6%. CONCLUSION: According to study results, the use of tadalafil 5 mg once daily in a nonselected patient population with LUTS/BPH with or without ED led to improvements in terms of symptoms and quality of life and exhibited a safety profile similar to that obtained in controlled tadalafil clinical trials.",2014,10.1111/jsm.12386,11,2,498-505,eng,1743-6109 1743-6095,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Double-Blind Method and Drug Administration Schedule and Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Carbolines/*administration & dosage and Erectile Dysfunction/*drug therapy/etiology and IIEF and IPSS and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms/complications/*drug therapy and Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitor and Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/*administration & dosage and Prostatic Hyperplasia/complications/*drug therapy and Tadalafil",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,J Sex Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

D. and Davis, J. B. and Sandlow, J. and Flynn, K. E.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What are couples' decisional conflicts around family-building approaches before and after seeking a specialty consultation for infertility? SUMMARY ANSWER: Decisional conflict is high among couples before an initial specialty consultation for infertility; on average, women resolved decisional conflict more quickly than men. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Couples have multiple options for addressing infertility, and decisional conflict may arise due to lack of information, uncertainty about options and potential risks or challenges to personal values. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a total of 385 interviews and 405 surveys for this longitudinal, mixed-methods cohort study of 34 opposite-sex couples who sought a new reproductive specialty consultation (n = 68), who enrolled before the initial consultation and were followed over 12 months. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The in-depth, semi-structured interviews included questions about information gathering, deliberation and decision-making, and self-administered surveys included the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), at six time points over 12 months. A DCS total score of 25 is associated with implementing a decision, and higher scores indicate more decisional conflict. A systematic content analysis of interview transcripts identified major themes. Paired t tests identified differences in DCS between women and men within couples. Linear mixed models predicted changes in DCS over time, adjusting for sociodemographic and fertility-related factors. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The major qualitative themes were communication with partners, feeling supported and/or pressured in decision (s), changing decisions over time and ability to execute a desired decision. Average DCS scores were highest before the initial consultation. Within couples, men had significantly higher decisional conflict than women pre-consultation (48.9 versus 40.2, P = 0.037) and at 2 months (28.9 versus 22.1, P = 0.015), but differences at other time points were not significant. In adjusted models, predicted DCS scores declined over time, with women, on average, reaching the DCS threshold for implementing a decision at 2 months while for men it was not until 4 months. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a convenience sample from a single center, and generalizability may be limited. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Understanding how couples discuss and make decisions regarding family-building could improve the delivery of patient-centered infertility care. Our findings are the first to prospectively explore decisional conflict at multiple time points in both men and women; the observed gender differences underlie the importance of supporting both partners in clinical decision-making for infertility.

INTERVENTION(S): Husbands and wives were interviewed together and separately. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Thematic analysis of interview transcripts. RESULT(S): Ninety-five percent of couples came to a united disclosure decision, some ""intuitively,"" but most after discussions influenced by the couples' local sociopolitical environment, professional opinion, counseling, religious and cultural background, family relationships, and individual personal, psychological, and ethical beliefs. Couples who were not initially in agreement ultimately came to a decision after one partner deferred to the wishes or opinions of the other. Deferral could reflect the result of a prior agreement, one partner's recognition of the other's experiential or emotional expertise, or direct persuasion. In disclosing couples, men frequently deferred to their wives, whereas, in nondisclosing couples, women always deferred to their husbands.

M. and van der Veen, F. and Hajenius, P. J. and van Wely, M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Is salpingotomy cost effective compared with salpingectomy in women with tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube? SUMMARY ANSWER: Salpingotomy is not cost effective over salpingectomy as a surgical procedure for tubal pregnancy, as its costs are higher without a better ongoing pregnancy rate while risks of persistent trophoblast are higher. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with a tubal pregnancy treated by salpingotomy or salpingectomy in the presence of a healthy contralateral tube have comparable ongoing pregnancy rates by natural conception. Salpingotomy bears the risk of persistent trophoblast necessitating additional medical or surgical treatment. Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurs slightly more often after salpingotomy compared with salpingectomy. Both consequences imply potentially higher costs after salpingotomy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed an economic evaluation of salpingotomy compared with salpingectomy in an international multicentre randomized controlled trial in women with a tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube. Between 24 September 2004 and 29 November 2011, women were allocated to salpingotomy (n = 215) or salpingectomy (n = 231). Fertility follow-up was done up to 36 months post-operatively. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a hospital perspective. We compared the direct medical costs of salpingotomy and salpingectomy until an ongoing pregnancy occurred by natural conception within a time horizon of 36 months. Direct medical costs included the surgical treatment of the initial tubal pregnancy, readmissions including reinterventions, treatment for persistent trophoblast and interventions for repeat ectopic pregnancy. The analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Mean direct medical costs per woman in the salpingotomy group and in the salpingectomy group were <e2><82><ac>3319 versus <e2><82><ac>2958, respectively, with a mean difference of <e2><82><ac>361 (95% confidence interval <e2><82><ac>217 to <e2><82><ac>515). Salpingotomy resulted in a marginally higher ongoing pregnancy rate by natural conception compared with salpingectomy leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <e2><82><ac>40 982 (95% confidence interval -<e2><82><ac>130 319 to <e2><82><ac>145 491) per ongoing pregnancy. Since salpingotomy resulted in more additional treatments for persistent trophoblast and interventions for repeat ectopic pregnancy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not informative. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Costs of any subsequent IVF cycles were not included in this analysis. The analysis was limited to the perspective of the hospital. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: However, a small treatment benefit of salpingotomy might be enough to cover the costs of subsequent IVF. This uncertainty should be incorporated in shared decision-making. Whether salpingotomy should be offered depends on society's willingness to pay for an additional child.

M. and Kotti, S. and Mandelbaum, J.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: In couples who have chosen and confirmed the fate of surplus frozen embryos, which factors influence their decision, with a special emphasis on their symbolic representation of the embryo(s)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Embryo representation and gamete donation use significantly influence the fate of surplus cryopreserved embryos. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies report difficulties for couples to decide whether or not to continue storing their frozen embryo(s) and different factors have been already highlighted which influence their decision, including embryo conceptualization, information and support provided by the medical institution, quality of embryo(s) and life events. Little is known, however, about couples who definitely decided to stop their parental project and finalized the process of decision-making about the fate of their cryopreserved embryo(s). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2007-2010) and included IVF/ICSI patients with surplus frozen embryos, who made a final embryo disposition decision. Among the 280 eligible IVF/ICSI patients, 247 agreed to participate in the study. According to the available options, 91 persons chose to 'stop cryopreservation', 77 chose donation to 'research' and 48 'embryo donation' to infertile couples. Furthermore, 31 participants who chose embryo donation for a parental project were refused by the center as not compatible with their mandatory medical conditions. Among them, 27 participants then selected donation to research as a new option and were included in a fourth group: 'donation to research after Refusal of Embryo Donation for parental project' or 'research-RED' (n = 27). Four participants chose 'stop cryopreservation', however, given the small number of subjects this latter group was not included in the analysis. In all, 243 participants who made a final choice concerning the fate of their cryopreserved embryos were included in this study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were sent a letter of invitation to a semi-structured interview of 30 min with a psychologist. Interviews were conducted separately for each partner, including a questionnaire with a common part and a specific part, according to the chosen option, and allowing a quantitative evaluation. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the link between their embryo representation and their decision about their embryos' fate. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After adjustment for age, gender, gamete donation, number of children and the different embryo representations, a choice to 'stop cryopreservation' is more frequent if the embryo is represented as a child [odds ratio (OR) adjusted = 3.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.62-6.66], P = 0.0009. Representing the embryo as a project prompts patients to choose 'donation to research' [OR adjusted = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.56-9.06], P = 0.0032. Respondents are more likely to choose 'embryo donation' if they represent the embryo as a potential person [OR adjusted = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.45-9.80], P = 0.0064. Furthermore, patients who benefited from gamete donation are <e2><88><bc>10 times more likely to donate their embryos to another couple [OR adjusted = 10.62, 95% CI = 3.99-28.30], P < 0.0001. For more than half the participants (57%) the decision-making was easy, however, deciding to stop cryopreservation was significantly more difficult than choosing research or embryo donation (P < 0.0001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Socio-economic status, moral and religious affiliations are known to influence the choice of couples but analyzing these factors was not an aim of the present study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: When couples definitely decide to stop their parental project, the embryo symbolic representation remains the main factor that influences the fate of their frozen embryo(s). Moreover, this representation can evolve when influenced by external events and information provided. In order to support patients who are making this difficult decision, it could be helpful to explore this symbolic representation early in the IVF/ICSI procedure, before surplus embryo freezing, as a new tool enhancing the accuracy of counseling.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Hospital-based fertility clinic. PATIENT(S): One hundred seventy-six women participating in IVF treatment. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mood scores, ratings of risk, preference for multiple embryo transfer, and attitudes toward multiple pregnancy. RESULT(S): Growing feelings of tension across the cycle corresponded with increases in the perceived riskiness of double-embryo transfer, but there was no change in strength of transfer preferences. Women experiencing negative moods, such as depression, viewed twin and triplet pregnancy as less likely, whereas increasing positive feelings across the cycle were associated with increasing desire for twin pregnancy. Overall, women perceived double- and triple-embryo transfer as less risky by cycle end than at cycle beginning and felt more certain about multiple-embryo transfer. CONCLUSION(S): The dyssynchrony observed among changes in mood, perceptions of risk, and transfer preferences challenges assumptions about the way medical risk information influences transfer preferences, and the findings suggest that mood states experienced during an IVF cycle might affect transfer preferences by influencing attitudes toward multiple pregnancy.

M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Do clinical characteristics of recurrent miscarriage couples with a chromosomal abnormality and who opt for PGD differ from couples that decline PGD after extensive genetic counselling? SUMMARY ANSWER: No differences in clinical characteristics are identified between recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality who opt for PGD compared with those that decline PGD after extensive genetic counselling. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Couples who have experienced two or more miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage) are at increased recurrence risk if one of the partners carries a structural chromosomal abnormality. PGD can be offered to avoid (another) miscarriage or pregnancy termination when (invasive) prenatal diagnosis shows an abnormal result. To date, no reports are available that describe reproductive decision-making after genetic counselling on PGD in these specific couples. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort study of 294 couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality seeking genetic counselling on PGD between 1996 and 2012. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. They had been referred for genetic counselling to the only national licensed PGD centre. Clinical characteristics analysed included couple associated characteristics, characteristics concerning reproductive history and external characteristics such as type of physician that referred the couple for genetic counselling and the clinical geneticist performing the counselling on PGD. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 294 couples referred for counselling on PGD, 26 were not accepted because they did not meet the criteria for IVF-PGD. The remaining cohort of 268 couples consisted of two-thirds female and one-third male carriers. Main PGD indications were reciprocal translocations (83.9%) and Robertsonian translocations (16.7%). Following genetic counselling, 76.9% of included couples chose PGD as their reproductive option, the others declined PGD. Reproductive choice is not influenced by sex of the translocation carrier (P = 0.499), type of chromosomal abnormality (P = 0.346), number of previous miscarriages (P = 0.882), history of termination of pregnancy (TOP) because of an unbalanced fetal karyotype (P = 0.800), referring physician (P = 0.208) or geneticist who performed the counselling (P = 0.410). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study only included recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality, who were actually referred to a PGD clinic for genetic counselling. We lack information on couples who were not referred for PGD. Some of these patients may not have been informed on PGD at all, while others were not referred for counselling because they did not opt for PGD to start with. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study shows that reproductive choices in couples with recurrent miscarriage on the basis of a structural chromosomal abnormality are not influenced by characteristics of the couple itself, nor by their obstetric history or external characteristics. These findings suggest that a couples' intrinsic attitude towards PGD treatment is a major factor influencing their reproductive choice.

The occurrence of a live birth was associated with lower female age, first TESE-ICSI cycle, lower male LH, higher male testosterone, the use of motile spermatozoa for ICSI and having obstructive azoospermia as an initial suspected diagnosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.62. From validation data, the model had moderate discriminative capacity (c-statistic 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.72) but calibrated well, with a range from 0.06 to 0.56 in calculated probabilities. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We had a lack of data about the motility of spermatozoa during TESE, therefore, we used motility of the spermatozoa used for ICSI after freeze-thawing, information which is only available during treatment. We had to exclude data on paternal BMI in the model because too many missing values in the validation data hindered testing. We did not include a histologic diagnosis, which would have made our data set less heterogeneous and, finally, our model may not be applicable in centres which have a different policy for the indication for performing sperm extraction. The prognostic value of the model is limited because of a low 'area under the curve'. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This model enables the differentiation between couples with a low or high chance to reach a live birth using TESE-ICSI. As such it can aid in the counselling of patients and in clinical decision-making.

M. and Fleischer, K. and van Wely, M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Can an externally validated model, based on biological variables, be developed to predict successful sperm retrieval with testicular sperm extraction (TESE) in men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) using a large nationwide cohort? SUMMARY ANSWER: Our prediction model including six variables was able to make a good distinction between men with a good chance and men with a poor chance of obtaining spermatozoa with TESE. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Using ICSI in combination with TESE even men suffering from NOA are able to father their own biological child. Only in approximately half of the patients with NOA can testicular sperm be retrieved successfully. The few models that have been developed to predict the chance of obtaining spermatozoa with TESE were based on small datasets and none of them have been validated externally. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a retrospective nationwide cohort study. Data from 1371 TESE procedures were collected between June 2007 and June 2015 in the two fertility centres. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All men with NOA undergoing their first TESE procedure as part of a fertility treatment were included. The primary end-point was the presence of one or more spermatozoa (regardless of their motility) in the testicular biopsies.We constructed a model for the prediction of successful sperm retrieval, using univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis and the dataset from one centre. This model was then validated using the dataset from the other centre. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated and model calibration was assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 599 (43.7%) successful sperm retrievals after a first TESE procedure. The prediction model, built after multivariable logistic regression analysis, demonstrated that higher male age, higher levels of serum testosterone and lower levels of FSH and LH were predictive for successful sperm retrieval. Diagnosis of idiopathic NOA and the presence of an azoospermia factor c gene deletion were predictive for unsuccessful sperm retrieval. The AUC was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.72). The difference between the mean observed chance and the mean predicted chance was <2.0% in all groups, indicating good calibration. In validation, the model had moderate discriminative capacity (AUC 0.65, 95% CI: 0.62-0.72) and moderate calibration: the predicted probability never differed by more than 9.2% of the mean observed probability. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The percentage of men with Klinefelter syndrome among men diagnosed with NOA is expected to be higher than in our study population, which is a potential selection bias. The ability of the sperm retrieved to fertilize an oocyte and produce a live birth was not tested. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This model can help in clinical decision-making in men with NOA by reliably predicting the chance of obtaining spermatozoa with TESE.

METHODS: A randomized-controlled trial was conducted. Using a Solomon-four group design, 190 female patients were recruited from three US fertility centers and were randomized into two experimental and two no-treatment control groups. The psychological outcomes assessed included infertility distress, infertility self-efficacy, decisional conflict, marital cohesion and coping style. Program dosage and satisfaction were also assessed at four weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Women exposed to the online program significantly improved in the area of social concerns (P = 0.038) related to infertility distress, and felt more informed about a medical decision with which they were contending (P = 0.037). Trends were observed for decreased global stress(P = 0.10), sexual concerns (P = 0.059), distress related to child-free living (P = 0.063), increased infertility self-efficacy (P = 0.067) and decision making clarity (P = 0.079).

Klitzman_2016_Ferandste,JOUR,How old is too old? Challenges faced by clinicians concerning age cutoffs for patients undergoing in vitro fertilization,"Klitzman, Robert L.",Fertility and sterility,"OBJECTIVE: To study how IVF providers view and make decisions concerning age cutoffs and futility (e.g., whether they establish clear cutoffs, and if so, where). DESIGN: In-depth interviews of approximately 1 hour. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Interviewees: 27 ART providers (17 physicians, 10 other providers) and 10 patients. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Attitudes and decisions concerning age cutoffs were assessed. RESULT(S): Providers face several challenges and dilemmas concerning both the content and the process of decision-making about age cutoffs-what age cutoff to use for potential parents (women both using and not using their own eggs) and potential fathers (whether to consider the father's age, and if so, separately or only with the mother's age); what criteria to use in these decisions (how much to consider and weigh the mother's autonomy vs. the future child's well-being); how to make these decisions (e.g., ""gut feelings"" or perceptions of public opinion); who makes these decisions (e.g., physicians on their own vs. a formal ethics or Quality Assurance committee); and how to present/frame these issues to patients (e.g., how much to discourage older women). Patients' responses to age limitations vary (e.g., minimizing or feeling exceptions to the risks; or lying about their age). CONCLUSION(S): These data, the first to explore how providers make decisions about age cutoffs for patients, raise several critical issues.

Jo and Rosen, Mitchell","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Is random start ovarian stimulation associated with delays in initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer? SUMMARY ANSWER: Among women who complete fertility preservation (FP) consultation, random start ovarian stimulation is unlikely to delay time to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy start. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now a widely accepted treatment modality for operable breast cancer and random start ovarian stimulation is an increasingly-utilized modality for FP. While conventional ovarian stimulation does not appear to delay starting adjuvant chemotherapy, the relationship between random start ovarian stimulation and neoadjuvant chemotherapy start is not well-understood. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cross-sectional study of all women seen between from January 2011 to April 2017 for FP consultation prior to starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A chart-review was performed. Study inclusion criteria were female sex; age 18-45; non-metastatic breast cancer diagnosis; underwent FP consultation; underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Referrals for FP evaluation came from a regional referral base of oncology clinics. Various time-points related to cancer diagnosis, FP or chemotherapy were obtained from medical record review. We compared time-points between those who underwent ovarian stimulation for FP versus those who did not using T-tests and linear modeling. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 89 women who had FP consultation prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were identified. Sixty-seven percent underwent ovarian stimulation prior to cancer treatment and 33% did not. Women who underwent ovarian stimulation were similar in parity and clinical cancer stage to those who did not. Overall, the average time from cancer diagnosis to chemotherapy start was similar between the group that did undergo ovarian stimulation and those who did not (38.1 <c2><b1> 11.3 versus 39.4 <c2><b1> 18.5 days, P = 0.672). Those that underwent ovarian stimulation were referred 9.4 <c2><b1> 6.8 days after diagnosis versus 17.9 <c2><b1> 15.3 days for those who did not undergo ovarian stimulation (P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Retrospective study with potential for selection bias among those who underwent ovarian stimulation versus those who did not. Reasons for caution include the possibility of unmeasured differences among those who did and did not undergo ovarian stimulation, including: patients' and providers' perceptions of the urgency to start chemotherapy, ongoing oncology work-up and treatment planning, FP decision-making, and the pursuit of second and third opinions. The difference in time from referral to FP consultation may have also influenced patients' decisions about whether to undergo ovarian stimulation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In this study, FP with random start ovarian stimulation was not associated with a delay cancer treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, so long as there was a prompt FP referral. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be informed of these findings to avoid unnecessary anxiety due to concern for delays.

X2019_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Towards a more pragmatic and wiser approach to infertility care,NA,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","Infertility represents a very peculiar area of medicine. Contrary to other areas, where signs and symptoms lead to a diagnosis, which in turn leads to a specific treatment, in reproduction the lack of signs and symptoms for more than 12 months suggests the diagnosis of 'unexplained subfertility', and if this condition has lasted for some years, couples qualify for IVF. Diagnosis and treatments can extend over long periods of time (even years) and the accuracy of the diagnostic armamentarium is not optimal. Uncertainty about diagnosis and the need for significant perseverance is demanding on both couples and physicians, and actually constitute a very favourable situation for overdiagnosis ('unexplained subfertility') and overtreatment (IVF) on one hand, and, on the other, it may also affect compliance with treatments. To improve our capacity to properly handle this challenging situation, increased attention should be given to the duration of pregnancy seeking. Initiating treatments earlier in older women is unwise because this population has a lower fecundity and, therefore, duration of pregnancy seeking is even more important to achieve a reliable diagnosis of infertility. Moreover, if the infertility work-up is unremarkable, duration of pregnancy seeking should be extended up to more than 2 years prior to making a diagnosis of unexplained infertility regardless of age. An adequate period of pregnancy seeking is also required for couples who are diagnosed with conditions that can interfere with fertility to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Indeed, most causes of infertility will reduce but not impair natural conception. Within this sometimes long-term management, physicians should also pay attention to detrimental life habits in order to optimize the chances of both natural and assisted reproduction technology -mediated pregnancy. Even if interventional studies are not conclusive, it is advisable to address the problems of obesity and smoking. Focussing on frequency of sexual intercourse may be also beneficial for natural conception. Finally, there is the need for improving our capacity to handle compliance. Providing information on the importance of persevering at the start of treatment, promoting shared decision-making and tackling patient, clinic and treatment causes of drop-out can all improve the overall chances of parenthood. Thus, we plead for a wiser and more pragmatic approach to infertility, paying more attention to these neglected, but in our opinion essential, aspects of infertility care.",2019,10.1093/humrep/dez101,34,7,1165-1172,eng,1460-2350 0268-1161,"Humans and Female and Male and Patient Compliance and Pregnancy and Life Style and Prevalence and Maternal Age and *Medical Overuse and Watchful Waiting and Reproductive Techniques, Assisted and ART / infertility / IVF / ageing / overdiagnosis and Infertility/*diagnosis/epidemiology",NA,NA,2019/07/08/,Hum Reprod,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative interview report. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Forty-five couples donating embryos to stem cell research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Likert scales were used to assess whether participants regarded embryos as children and whether donation was analogous to organ or blood donation. Use of counseling, consideration of disposition options, and value of the interview were assessed. Recorded responses were analyzed for themes. RESULT(S): The average length of cryopreservation was 4.8 years. Twenty percent of the embryos were created with donor gametes; 53% of respondents viewed embryos as completely different from children; 31% and 27% considered embryo donation ""identical"" to organ and blood donation, respectively; 47% chose stem cell research to help others; 96% had not sought counseling in making their decision; and 20% were told they could not donate embryos to other couples. CONCLUSION(S): Although many couples had questions/concerns regarding disposition, few sought formal counseling. Outside programs may unnecessarily limit the option of donation to other couples.

M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: To what extent are BRCA mutation carriers and their partners in the Netherlands aware about preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal diagnosis (PND) as reproductive options and what is their attitude towards these options? SUMMARY ANSWER: Awareness of PGD (66%) and PND (61%) among BRCA mutation carriers and their partners is relatively high and 80% and 26%, respectively, of BRCA carriers and their partners find offering PGD and PND for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) acceptable. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Internationally, awareness of PGD among persons with a genetic cancer predisposition appears to be relatively low (35%) and although acceptability is generally high (71%), only a small proportion of mutation carriers would consider using PGD (36%). However, for HBOC, there are no studies available that investigated the perspective of individuals with a confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation and their partners about PGD and PND including demographic and medical correlates of awareness and acceptability. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 191 participants between July 2012 and June 2013. Participants were recruited through patient organizations (88%) and the databases of two Clinical Genetics departments in the Netherlands (12%). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Male and female BRCA carriers and their partners completed an online survey, which assessed demographic and medical characteristics, and awareness, knowledge, acceptability and consideration of PGD and PND as main outcomes. Correlations between demographic and medical characteristics and the main outcomes were investigated. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: The majority of respondents were female (87%), of reproductive age (86%) and about half reported a desire for a child in the future. About two-thirds (66%) were aware of PGD and 61% of PND for HBOC. PGD knowledge was moderate (5.5 on a 9-point scale) and acceptability of PGD and PND for HBOC was 80% and 26%, respectively. A minority would personally consider using PGD (39%) or PND (20%). Individuals with a higher educational level were more likely to be aware of PGD (P < 0.001) and PND (P < 0.001) and persons with a more immediate child wish were more often aware of PGD (P = 0.044) and had more knowledge about PGD (P = 0.001). PGD acceptability was positively associated with knowledge about PGD (P = 0.047), and PND acceptability was higher among partners in comparison to carriers (P = 0.001). Participants with a history of cancer and with a higher perceived seriousness of breast and ovarian cancer were more likely to consider using PGD (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001 respectively) or PND (P = 0.021 and P = 0.017 respectively). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The response rate (23%) of participants invited by the clinical genetics departments was low, probably related to a simultaneous study that used a similar recruitment strategy within the same target group, which may have resulted in selection bias. Moreover, PGD knowledge was measured with an instrument that is not yet validated since to date such an instrument is not available in the literature. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study limits us from drawing any causal conclusions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Improvement of information provision remains needed, in order to timely inform all couples with HBOC about the available reproductive options and enable them to make a balanced reproductive decision.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The content of information given to patients and parents and hope for future parenthood appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility in the pediatric population and, therefore, deserves special attention to improve FP care. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A vast body of literature on adult cancer patients shows that reproductive capacity is a major quality-of-life issue. Patients also have a strong desire to be informed of available FP options with a view to future parenthood of their own genetic child, considering that <10% chose to adopt or used donated gametes. Furthermore, the quality of fertility counseling provided at the time of cancer diagnosis has been identified as a crucial factor in the decision-making process. By contrast, in the pediatric population, while it was shown that parents were able to make an informed and voluntary decision for their prepubertal sons despite the heavy emotional burden at the time of diagnosis, there is so far very limited information on patient expectations regarding FP. A lack of awareness often equates to suboptimal care by oncologists and FP specialists, and poor access to FP, therefore improving knowledge and identifying the expectations of pediatric patients and their parents are crucial for optimizing multidisciplinary collaborative care pathways (MCCPs), including counseling and access to FP methods, in the youngest population. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A questionnaire survey was posted to an eligible population between May 2005 and May 2013. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 348 prepubertal boys and adolescents aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with cancer in a university hospital setting, were eligible. Three different questionnaires for two age groups of children (<12 and 12-18 years) and parents were established based on information from focus groups. Questions were subsequently reviewed by the institutional ethics board before being sent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the 348 eligible patients, 44 died and 14 were lost to follow-up. Thus, 290 patients (77 aged 12-18 years and 213 aged <12 years) were sent a questionnaire. In total, 120 questionnaires were recovered, 45.5% (n = 35/77) from adolescents and 39.9% (n = 85/213) from children. FP acceptance rates were, respectively, 74 and 78.6% for boys aged <12 and 12-18 years. The content of information provided to patients and parents appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility (P = 0.04). While the majority of boys aged >12 years considered the information to be clear (72%), complete (80%) and understandable (90.9%), only 33.3% of boys aged <12 years were able to comprehend the information. Pressure from doctors to reduce the delay between diagnosis and cancer treatment increased the number of refusals (P<0.01), while hope for future parenthood favored acceptance (P < 0.01). Family support was considered important for 75% of adolescents and 58% of children, and medical support for 50% of adolescents and 42% of children. LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: This single-center survey does not allow extrapolation of the information to other settings. Recall bias and lack of full external validation of the questionnaires are further limitations. Modification of the current MCCP should be further evaluated according to our results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Acknowledging the issues faced and familiarizing oneself with the care of patients undergoing fertility-threatening therapies supply primary care providers with the appropriate quality management tools in the field of FP in centers for reproductive medicine.

Program directors were emailed via the ACOG Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology server listing and asked to solicit resident participation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants included 238 residents evenly distributed between post-graduate years 1-4 with varied post-residency plans; 90% of residents were women and 75% were 26-30 years old. The survey was divided into three sections: demographics, fertility awareness, and attitudes toward discussing fertility preservation options with patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A strong majority of residents (83%) believed an OB/GYN should initiate discussions about age-related fertility decline with patients (mean patient age 31.8), and 73% percent believed these discussions should be part of an annual exam. One third of residents overestimated the age at which there is a slight decline in female fertility, while nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines. Over three-quarters of residents (78.4%) also overestimated the likelihood of success using assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). Residents were likely to support oocyte cryopreservation in cancer patients irrespective of the woman's age, but much less likely to support elective oocyte cryopreservation. For elective oocyte cryopreservation, 40% believed OB/GYNs should initiate discussions with patients (mean age 31.1), while only 20% believed this topic should be part of an annual exam. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Because the study invitation was sent through US OB/GYN residency program directors rather than directly to residents, it is possible that some residents did not receive the invitation to participate. This limits the generalizability of the findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Within the USA, there appears to be a critical need for improved education on fertility decline in OB/GYN residency programs. To promote informed reproductive decision-making among patients, efforts should be made to help OB/GYNs provide comprehensive fertility education to all women, while also respecting patient choices.

Copp_2017_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Influence of the disease label 'polycystic ovary syndrome' on intention to have an ultrasound and psychosocial outcomes: a randomised online study in young women,"Copp, Tessa and McCaffery, Kirsten and Azizi, Lamiae and Doust, Jenny and Mol, Ben W. J. and Jansen, Jesse","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Does the disease label 'polycystic ovary syndrome' (PCOS) have an impact on desire for medical testing and psychosocial outcomes? SUMMARY ANSWER: When given the disease label PCOS in a hypothetical scenario, participants had higher intention to have an ultrasound, perceived the condition to be more severe and had lower self-esteem than those not given the disease label. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Widening diagnostic criteria and improved imaging sensitivity have increased the number of reproductive-aged women diagnosed with PCOS from 4% to 8% to up to 21%. The uncertain clinical benefit of knowing this diagnosis needs to be weighed against the potential for poor psychological outcomes in women labelled with PCOS. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This experimental online study randomised 181 young women to receive one of four hypothetical scenarios of a doctor's visit in a 2 (PCOS disease label versus no disease label) x 2 (information about unreliability of ultrasounds in clarifying diagnosis versus no information) design. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were university students (mean age: 19.4). After presenting the scenario, intention to have an ultrasound, negative affect, self-esteem, perceived severity of condition, credibility of the doctor and interest in a second opinion were measured. Participants were then presented with a second scenario, where the possibility of PCOS overdiagnosis was mentioned. Change in intention and perceived severity were then measured. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Participants given the PCOS label had significantly higher intention to have an ultrasound (mean = 6.62 versus mean = 5.76, P = 0.033, 95% CI(difference) = 0.069-1.599), perceived the condition to be more severe (17.17 versus 15.82, P = 0.019, 95% CI(difference) = 0.229-2.479) and had lower self-esteem (25.86 versus 27.56, P = 0.031, 95% CI(difference) = -3.187 to -0.157). After receiving overdiagnosis information, both intention and perceived severity decreased, regardless of condition (both P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study used hypothetical scenarios; it is likely that for women facing a real diagnosis of PCOS, outcomes would be more affected than in the current study. The hypothetical design, however, allowed the symptoms and risks of PCOS to be held constant across conditions, the impact on intention and psychosocial outcomes directly attributable to the effect of the disease label. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings demonstrate the potential negative consequences of PCOS labelling. It is crucial we consider the impact of the label before diagnosing more women with PCOS when clinical benefit of this diagnosis is uncertain.

Kaing_2020_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,"Perceptions, motivations and decision regret surrounding preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy","Kaing, Amy and Rosen, Mitchell P. and Quinn, Molly M.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Is there a difference in level of decision regret following IVF treatment between those who choose to complete or not complete preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy [PGT-A]? SUMMARY ANSWER: Approximately one-third of the participants expressed moderate to severe regret (MSR) following their decision to either complete or not complete PGT-A; notably, decision regret was higher in those who chose not to complete PGT-A, primarily driven by significantly higher regret scores in those that experienced a miscarriage after not testing. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous research has found that 39% of participants who completed PGT-A expressed some degree of decision regret and that negative clinical outcomes, such as lack of euploid embryos, negative pregnancy test or miscarriage, were associated with a higher level of decision regret. To date, there are no published studies assessing the possible disparity in decision regret surrounding PGT-A in a population of IVF patients that either chose to pursue PGT-A or not. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: An anonymous online survey was distributed to 1583 patients who underwent IVF with or without PGT-A at a single university institution between January 2016 and December 2017. In total, 335 women accessed the survey, 220 met eligibility criteria and 130 completed the full study survey. Six participants were excluded due to refusal of medical record review, and nine participants were excluded after record review due to not meeting eligibility based on cycle start date or completing only embryo banking without attempting transfer. One hundred and fifteen participants were included in the final analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Of the 115 participants included, 55 (48%) completed PGT-A and 60 (52%) did not complete PGT-A. The online survey included four sections: Demographics; Perceptions about PGT-A risks and benefits [scale from 0 (absolutely not true) to 100 (absolutely true)]; Decision-making factors [scale from 0 (not important) to 100 (very important)]; and Brehaut Decision Regret Scale [DRS] [range 0-100, with >25 indicating MSR]. A retrospective chart review was conducted to confirm study eligibility and collect cumulative clinical outcomes of consenting participants who completed the survey. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Demographics of the PGT-A and no PGT-A cohorts were similar, with the majority of respondents being Caucasian or Asian, unaffiliated with any religion and with a graduate or professional degree. The two groups differed significantly in mean age, with the PGT-A group being slightly older (mean <c2><b1> SD: 37 <c2><b1> 3.7 versus 36 <c2><b1> 3.4; P = 0.048), and in rate of miscarriages, with fewer participants in the PGT-A cohort experiencing a miscarriage (5% versus 22%; P = 0.012). The majority of participants in both PGT-A and no PGT-A cohorts strongly believed in the purported benefits of PGT-A, including that it decreases the risk of birth defects (median 82 versus 77; P = 0.046), improves the chances of having a healthy baby (median 89 versus 74; P = 0.002) and selects the best embryo for transfer (median 85 versus 80; P = 0.049). When asked to report their motivating factors for decision-making, both groups cited physician counseling as important (median 70 versus 71; P = 0.671); however, the PGT-A cohort was more strongly motivated by a desire to not transfer abnormal embryos (median 84 versus 53; P = 0.0001). Comparison of DRS score between those who did or did not undergo PGT-A showed significantly higher median DRS score after not completing PGT-A (median 15 versus 0; P = 0.013). There was a significantly higher proportion of participants who did not complete PGT-A that expressed mild (36% versus 16%) and MSR (32% versus 24%) compared to those who completed PGT-A (<cf><87>2 = 9.03, df = 2; P = 0.011). Sub-group analyses of DRS scores by outcomes of clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth revealed that the higher DRS score in those not completing PGT-A was driven by a large increase in regret noted by those with history of a miscarriage (median 45 versus 0; P = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression modeling found no evidence that any specific demographic factor, clinical outcome or perception/motivation surrounding PGT-A was independently predictive of increased risk for MSR. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective nature of data collection incurs the possibility of sampling and recall bias. As only 59% of eligible respondents completed the full survey, it is possible that mainly those with very positive or negative sentiments following treatment felt compelled to complete their response. This bias, however, would apply to the whole of the population, and not simply to those who did or did not complete PGT-A. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The proportion of participants expressing any degree of decision regret in this PGT-A cohort was 40%, which is comparable to that shown in prior research. This study adds to prior data by also assessing decision regret experienced by those who went through IVF without PGT-A, and showed that 68% expressed some level of regret with their decision-making. These results should not be interpreted to mean that all patients should opt for PGT-A to pre-emptively mitigate their risk of regret. Instead, it suggests that drivers of decision regret are likely multifactorial and unique to the experience of one's personal expectations regarding PGT-A, motivations for pursuing or not pursuing it and resultant clinical outcome. Highlighting the complex nature of regret, these data should encourage physicians to more carefully consider individual patient values toward risk-taking or risk-averse behavior, as well as their own positions regarding PGT-A. Until there are clear recommendations regarding utilization of PGT-A, a strong collaboration between physicians and genetic counselors is recommended to educate patients on the risks and potential benefits of PGT-A in a balanced and individualized manner.

Providers also may conclude that the risks are too high for them to treat particular patients ethically; such determinations must be made in a medically objective and unbiased manner and patients must be fully informed of the decision. Counseling of women who wish to initiate fertility treatment with underlying medical conditions that confer increased risk during treatment or pregnancy should incorporate the most current knowledge available, being cognizant of the woman's personal determinants in relation to her reproductive desires.

Bottomley_2013_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Accurate prediction of pregnancy viability by means of a simple scoring system,"Bottomley, Cecilia and Van Belle, Vanya and Kirk, Emma and Van Huffel, Sabine and Timmerman, Dirk and Bourne, Tom","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What is the performance of a simple scoring system to predict whether women will have an ongoing viable intrauterine pregnancy beyond the first trimester? SUMMARY ANSWER: A simple scoring system using demographic and initial ultrasound variables accurately predicts pregnancy viability beyond the first trimester with an area under the curve (AUC) in a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.924 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.900-0.947] on an independent test set. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Individual demographic and ultrasound factors, such as maternal age, vaginal bleeding and gestational sac size, are strong predictors of miscarriage. Previous mathematical models have combined individual risk factors with reasonable performance. A simple scoring system derived from a mathematical model that can be easily implemented in clinical practice has not previously been described for the prediction of ongoing viability. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This was a prospective observational study in a single early pregnancy assessment centre during a 9-month period. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: A cohort of 1881 consecutive women undergoing transvaginal ultrasound scan at a gestational age <84 days were included. Women were excluded if the first trimester outcome was not known. Demographic features, symptoms and ultrasound variables were tested for their influence on ongoing viability. Logistic regression was used to determine the influence on first trimester viability from demographics and symptoms alone, ultrasound findings alone and then from all the variables combined. Each model was developed on a training data set, and a simple scoring system was derived from this. This scoring system was tested on an independent test data set. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The final outcome based on a total of 1435 participants was an ongoing viable pregnancy in 885 (61.7%) and early pregnancy loss in 550 (38.3%) women. The scoring system using significant demographic variables alone (maternal age and amount of bleeding) to predict ongoing viability gave an AUC of 0.724 (95% CI = 0.692-0.756) in the training set and 0.729 (95% CI = 0.684-0.774) in the test set. The scoring system using significant ultrasound variables alone (mean gestation sac diameter, mean yolk sac diameter and the presence of fetal heart beat) gave an AUC of 0.873 (95% CI = 0.850-0.897) and 0.900 (95% CI = 0.871-0.928) in the training and the test sets, respectively. The final scoring system using demographic and ultrasound variables together gave an AUC of 0.901 (95% CI = 0.881-0.920) and 0.924 (CI = 0.900-0.947) in the training and the test sets, respectively. After defining the cut-off at which the sensitivity is 0.90 on the training set, this model performed with a sensitivity of 0.92, specificity of 0.73, positive predictive value of 84.7% and negative predictive value of 85.4% in the test set. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: BMI and smoking variables were a potential omission in the data collection and might further improve the model performance if included. A further limitation is the absence of information on either bleeding or pain in 18% of women. Caution should be exercised before implementation of this scoring system prior to further external validation studies WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This simple scoring system incorporates readily available data that are routinely collected in clinical practice and does not rely on complex data entry. As such it could, unlike most mathematical models, be easily incorporated into normal early pregnancy care, where women may appreciate an individualized calculation of the likelihood of ongoing pregnancy viability.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We propose a framework that distinguishes between three instead of two types of treatment and describes a continuum from experimental over innovative to established treatment, offering a tool meant to facilitate decision-making about the introduction of new technologies in the clinic. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Traditionally, guidelines from medical societies on the notion of 'experimental treatment' depart from a dichotomy between experimental and established treatment. However, in the field of reproductive medicine, there are several problems with a dichotomous framework. First, it does not offer an adequate account of the reality in the clinic. Secondly, this view may bring about several negative effects for the patient, such as techniques being considered established too early, holding risks unknown to patients. A further drawback of the dichotomy is that if a technique is no longer considered experimental, centres offering the technique may no longer consider it useful gathering and critically examining (follow-up) data. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The framework and scoring tool were developed over several phases during which the authors operated as a consensus group of experts. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The scoring tool reflects the continuous progression of a new procedure from experimental through innovative to established. For this evolution, four criteria were considered relevant. The first (efficacy) is a categorical criterion (pass/fail). The other three criteria (safety, procedural reliability and transparency and effectiveness) are ordinal in nature. Thresholds have been introduced for all four criteria to avoid that a technology scoring high on procedure and effectiveness but extremely low on safety could move to the next level because of a sufficiently high overall score. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Only treatments that are rated above the thresholds for all four criteria could be considered at least innovative treatments. When they score 4 or higher on the last three criteria, they are considered established treatments. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Knowledge about the procedures or techniques under discussion is essential in order to use the tool. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The tool is designed to be used on a macro-level (e.g. by professional societies) although it could also be valuable in the local setting. Both the framework and the tool can bring more clarity on the notion of 'experimental treatment', especially with regard to how to decide when a specific technology or treatment falls in this category and when it can move into one of the other categories.

Ferreux_2019_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Is it time to reconsider how to manage oocytes affected by smooth endoplasmic reticulum aggregates?,"Ferreux, Lucile and Sallem, Amira and Chargui, Ahmed and Gille, Anne-Sophie and Bourdon, Mathilde and Maignien, Chloe and Santulli, Pietro and Wolf, Jean Philippe and Patrat, Catherine and Pocate-Cheriet, Khaled","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Did the revised Alpha/ESHRE consensus (Vienna, 2017) bring a real answer on managing oocytes with aggregates of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SERa)? SUMMARY ANSWER: According to the currently available literature, a case by case approach on the time of injecting/inseminating SERa+ oocytes may be not helpful for embryologists making a decision, so we suggest fertilizing both SERa+ and SERa- oocytes and prioritizing embryos derived from SERa- oocytes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY? In 2011, the Istanbul consensus recommended not to inject/inseminate SER+ oocytes due to adverse foetal outcomes reported in literature. At the end of 2017, a panel of experts reconsidered this recommendation and advised a case by case approach. Hence, with a lack of clear recommendations, in-vitro fertilization practitioners still have heterogeneous attitudes when managing SERa+ oocytes. In this context of controversy, an updated review could be helpful in (i) forming a common language for managing cases of SERa+ oocytes and (ii) offering the most ethical practice and best care for patients seeking infertility treatment or fertility preservation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This review (with a last literature search on 1 June 2018) evaluated the effect of the SER dysmorphism on embryological and neonatal outcomes. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Studies were considered for inclusion if they were prospective or retrospective cohort or case-control studies. Electronic searches of the Pubmed and Embase databases were done using the keyword combination: smooth endoplasmic reticulum, SER, oocyte and zygote. Abstracts and articles written in English and limited to humans were included. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The search returned a total of 726 studies among which 21 met the inclusion criteria. The literature does not unanimously support a negative association between SERa and embryogenesis, implantation or assisted reproductive therapy outcomes. The reviewed studies reported 112 neonatal outcomes after transfers where at least one embryo originated from oocyte affected by SERa. They included 101 healthy babies, three live births with malformations, three neonatal deaths, one stillbirth and four medical interruptions of pregnancy. After transfer of embryos exclusively derived from SERa+ oocytes, a total of 48 healthy newborns were reported along with four babies with perinatal complications (including one ventricular septal defect), one stillbirth, one neonatal death and one pregnancy termination for multiple malformations. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: As with any review, this review was limited by the quality of the included studies especially in terms of possible methodological limitations, the limited sample size and the retrospective aspect of the studies. Among the 21 selected studies, seven were abstracts and two were case reports. Of the remaining 14 studies, only three were prospective. The tools used in identifying SERa+ oocytes may have varied from one study to another and a consequent misclassification cannot be excluded. Considering the poor resolution of light microscopy in detecting SER aggregates, we are not sure that apparently SERa- oocytes do not really exhibit such a dysmorphism if they were analysed under electronic microscopy or a time lapse system. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In the light of the existing data and the lack of a real link between fertilizing SERa+ oocytes and the occurrence of embryo aneuploidy/malformations, we think that discarding SERa+ oocytes may be not the most ethical approach even in patients with large cohorts on the day of oocyte retrieval. Avoiding the wastage of oocytes and embryos with respect to medical ethics remains a constant concern in daily IVF practice. Thus, we recommend that all mature oocytes could be fertilized and embryos originating from SERa- oocytes would be preferably transferred, even if they come from a cohort with SERa+ oocytes. The remaining embryos derived from SERa+ oocytes could be considered with a lower priority for transfer after obtaining consent from the couple if a strict follow-up of the pregnancy and the baby is performed.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Participants in the intervention group retained some knowledge after 2 years and the partnered women had a new child more quickly than the comparison group. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fertility education improves knowledge, at least in the short-term. Attitudes toward childbearing and its timing can change after exposure to educational materials. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Participants were recruited via an online social research panel. In the original randomized controlled trial (RCT), knowledge of reproductive-aged participants was assessed before (T1) and immediately after (T2) receiving one of three information brochures: fertility (intervention group), healthy pre-pregnancy (focused on intake of folic acid during pregnancy, control group 1), or family policies in Japan (childcare provision, control group 2). The present follow-up study was conducted 2 years later in January 2017 (T3) with the same participants. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Of the T1 participants (n = 1455), 383 men and 360 women (51%) responded to the T3 survey. Fertility knowledge measured with the Japanese version of the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS-J) and fertility status (e.g. new births, new medical consultations, and the timing of new birth) was assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Baseline (T1) characteristics of the T3 participants were well balanced between groups, but T3 participants were older, married, and more educated compared to those lost to follow-up. A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant knowledge gains among the intervention group from T1 to T3 (11.2% and 7.0% among men and women, respectively) but no significant change over time for the control groups. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of new births or new medical consultations. However, subgroup analysis showed that timing of new births was accelerated for partnered individuals in the intervention group. Specifically, the proportion of partnered participants at T1 who had a new birth in the first year subsequent to presentation of information was higher in the intervention group versus control group 1 (folic acid): 8.8% versus 1.4% (P = 0.09) among men and 10.6% versus 2.3% (P = 0.03) among women, respectively. The odds ratios (adjusted for age) were 7.8 (95% CI: 0.86-70.7) and 5.2 (95% CI: 1.09-25.0) among men and women, respectively. The timing of births and the proportion of new births during the 2-year follow-up period in the intervention group were similar to that of control group 2 (family policy). The incidence of new medical consultation was higher in the male intervention group (12.0%) than in male control group 2 (family policy, 1.5%, P = 0.04) but similar among women in all groups. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: First, the high attrition rate may limit the generalizability of these findings for longer-term acquisition of fertility knowledge, especially when applied to younger people who were more likely to be lost to follow-up. Second, this is a 2-year follow-up study and the results may change in the longer-term. Finally, we relied on self-reported questionnaire data and there is a possibility that some women were unknowingly pregnant at T1 but this risk should be distributed equally in the three groups through randomization. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Effects of one-time education were limited but retained beyond baseline levels. Importantly, education was found to potentially accelerate decision-making about achieving births in partnered subgroups compared to receiving healthy pre-pregnancy information. However, this finding should be confirmed in future stratified RCTs designed to evaluate effects in these subgroups. Follow-up 'booster' education sessions might help people retain knowledge and facilitate reproductive decisions for longer. In view of the high attrition rate, especially among young populations, novel educational strategies to retain young people in fertility education cohorts should be explored.

Donnez_2017_Ferandste,JOUR,"Choosing the right surgical technique for deep endometriosis: shaving, disc excision, or bowel resection?","Donnez, Olivier and Roman, Horace",Fertility and sterility,"Deep endometriosis (DE) remains the most difficult endometriotic entity to treat. Medical treatment for DE can reduce symptoms but does not cure the disease, and surgical removal of the lesion is required when lesions are symptomatic, impairing bowel, urinary, sexual, and reproductive functions. Although several surgical techniques such as laparoscopic bowel resection, disc excision, and rectal shaving have been described, there is no consensus regarding the choice of technique or the timing of surgery. Our review of publications reporting results and complications of surgery for rectovaginal DE reveals a relatively higher complication rate after bowel resection compared with shaving and disc excision, especially for rectovaginal fistulas, anastomotic leakage, delayed hemorrhage, and long-term bladder catheterization. Data show that shaving is feasible even in advanced disease. The risk of immediate complications after shaving and disc excision is probably lower than after colorectal resection, allowing for better functional outcomes. The presumed higher risk of recurrence related to shaving has not been demonstrated. For these reasons, surgeons should consider rectal shaving as a first-line surgical treatment of rectovaginal DE, regardless of nodule size or association with other digestive localizations. When the result of rectal shaving is unsatisfactory (rare cases), disc excision may be performed either exclusively by laparoscopy or by using transanal staplers. Segmental resection may ultimately be reserved for advanced lesions responsible for major stenosis or for several cases of multiple nodules infiltrating the rectosigmoid junction or sigmoid colon.",2017,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2017.09.006,108,6,931-942,eng,1556-5653 0015-0282,Humans and Female and Male and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and surgery and *Patient Selection and *Clinical Decision-Making and Postoperative Complications/etiology and Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods and *Laparoscopy/adverse effects and bowel resection and Deep endometriosis and Digestive System Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods and disc excision and Endometriosis/complications/diagnosis/*surgery and Rectal Diseases/diagnosis/*surgery and shaving and Vaginal Diseases/diagnosis/*surgery,NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Fertil Steril,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seventy participated in a follow-up survey from September to October 2019 clarifying reproductive desires or intentions. INTERVENTION: Multiple-choice questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Perceived barriers to access fertility preservation and decisional regret surrounding choice to pursue fertility preservation as measured with the use of the validated Decision Regret Scale (scored 0 to 100). RESULT(S): Barriers to accessing care were primarily cost of treatment (36%), discontinuation/delay of hormonal therapy (19%), or worsening of gender dysphoria with treatment/pregnancy (11%). Respondents indicated that their family planning goals were addressed by primary care providers and/or medical endocrinologists (multiple responses allowed), but 37% stated that their family planning goals were not adequately addressed.

Salevaara_2013_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Attitudes and disclosure decisions of Finnish parents with children conceived using donor sperm,"Salevaara, M. and Suikkari, A.-M. and Soderstrom-Anttila, V.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What are disclosure intentions and experiences of heterosexual parents with children born after assisted donor insemination (DI) or IVF with donor sperm (dIVF)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Only 16.5% of Finnish DI/dIVF heterosexual parents had told their child of his/her origin; 18% of all children above 3 years of age had received the information. Parents with older children were more unwilling to tell or were more uncertain regarding what to do than parents with younger children. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In general, 10-35% of parents of DI offspring are willing to inform their child about their conception. Men who need donor sperm to become a father are more secretive than women who need donated oocytes and are less willing to participate in counselling about parenthood. In the past, couples conceiving through gamete donation were adviced to maintain secrecy or sufficient advice on information sharing was not available. Evidence suggests that parental attitudes are moving towards greater openness. In 2007, Finland enacted a law on assisted fertility treatments (1237/2006) stating that gamete donors have to register their identifying information in a registry so that at the age of 18 years, offspring can obtain information about their donor. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This retrospective questionnaire study included 139 mothers and 127 fathers with altogether 240 children born after DI or dIVF during 1992-2007. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING AND METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to heterosexual couples who had undergone DI/dIVF treatment at the Vaestoliitto Fertility Clinic in Helsinki resulting in live birth (n = 277, 252 mothers and 239 fathers). The parents were asked to report their disclosure intentions towards the child and towards other people about the decision to use donated sperm, their concerns about donor characteristics, their evaluation of the counselling that they received and their views about the current Finnish assisted reproduction law. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The response rate was 55% (139/252) among the mothers and 53% (127/239) among the fathers. Answers provided information on 58% (240/415) of the children born, 91% of whom were at least 3 years old at the time. Of all parents, 16.5% reported that they had already told their child of his/her conception. Of all 240 children, 16.3% had already received information about their conception. The children had been between 3 and 14 years of age (mean 6.8 years) when they were told. Parents of older children were significantly more unwilling to tell their child than parents of younger children (P < 0.005). No difference in disclosure between DI and dIVF emerged. Less than half of the parents (42%) had been satisfied with the psychological support offered to them, with parents of older children having been most dissatisfied. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although the response rate was relatively high, more than 40% of the parents chose not to participate. As has been shown before, it is likely that those who do not take part are less inclined to disclose and this should be taken into consideration when conclusions are drawn. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results on disclosure rates are in agreement with previous studies. General attitudes have moved towards greater openness about the use of donated gametes. Furthermore, the availability of psychological counselling before treatment has increased the understanding of the importance of disclosure. People who have become parents after DI or dIVF should also be offered counselling after the child has been born.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs) remain high with a low cumulative multiple live birth rate when compared with other registries and publications. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In ART, a reduction in the multiple live birth rate could be achieved by reducing the number of embryos transferred. It has been shown that by doing so, live birth rates per cycle were maintained, particularly when the augmentation effect of attached frozen-thawed cycles was considered. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study included all patients with a Belgian national insurance number who were registered in the national ART registry (Belrap) and who started a first fresh ART cycle between 1 July 2009 until 31 December 2011 with follow up until 31 December 2012. We analysed 12 869 patients and 38 008 cycles (both fresh and attached frozen cycles). PARTICIPANTS, MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: CLBRs per patient who started a first ART cycle including fresh and consecutive frozen cycles leading to a live birth. Conservative estimates of cumulative live birth assumed that patients who did not return for treatment had no chance of achieving an ART-related live birth, whereas optimal estimates assumed that women discontinuing treatment would have the same chance of achieving a live birth as those continuing treatment. A maximum of six fresh ART cycles with corresponding frozen cycles was investigated and compared with other registries and publications. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: The CLBR was age dependent and declined from 62.9% for women <35 years, to 51.4% for women 35-37 years, to 34.1% for women 38-40 years and 17.7% for women 41-42 years in the conservative analysis after six cycles. In the optimal estimate, the CLBR declined from 85.9% for women <35 years, to 72.0% for women 35-37 years, to 50.4% for women 38-40 years and 36.4% for women 41-42 years. The cumulative multiple live birth rates for the whole population were 5.1 and 8.6% for the conservative and optimal estimate, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Conservative and optimal estimates use assumptions for the whole ART population and do not take the individual patient into account. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These data reinforce the validity of the Belgian model of coupling reimbursement of ART costs to a restriction in the number of embryos transferred. Our data can improve decision-making in medical ART practice both on the patient level and for society at large and could provide health care takers and insurance companies with a valid model.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The choice of PGT-A at the start of the first IVF cycle decreases the CLB per oocyte retrieval for patients <38 years of age, however patients <e2><89><a5>38 years of age benefit significantly per embryo transfer (ET) when live birth (LB) is evaluated. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PGT-A has been shown to reduce the practice of transferring multiple embryos and to confer a higher live birth rate per transfer. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a retrospective cohort study from December 2014 to September 2016, involving 600 patients: those intending PGT-A for their first IVF cycle (N = 300) and their matched controls. Post-hoc power calculations (alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80) indicated that our study was powered adequately to demonstrate significant differences in CLB per retrieval and LB per transfer. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study was performed at a large academically affiliated infertility practice where approximately 80% of patients have insurance coverage for fertility care. Patients were identified through electronic medical records, and those who intended to pursue PGT-A at the start of stimulation were assessed. Patients were matched by age, time of oocyte retrieval and oocyte yield to the same number of controls. CLB outcomes per single retrieval, including the fresh and frozen transfers arising from the initial stimulation cycle, were calculated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: PGT-A was not beneficial when CLB rate was assessed per retrieval, however its benefits were significant when LB rate was assessed per transfer. First cycle, <38 year-old patients who intended to have PGT-A had a significantly (P < 0.001) lower CLB rate per oocyte retrieval compared to controls (49.4% vs. 69.1%). Conversely, patients <e2><89><a5> 38 years in the PGT-A group had similar CLB rates compared to controls per oocyte retrieval, while LB rates per transfer were doubled compared to controls (62.1% vs. 31.7%; P < 0.001). Of the first-cycle PGT-A and control patients, 25.3% and 2.3% failed to achieve a transfer, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is not a true intention-to-treat study, due to its retrospective nature. Additionally, the number of patients with two or more previous miscarriages was significantly greater in the PGT-A group as compared to controls, however a sub-analysis showed that this failed to impact outcomes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings indicate that PGT-A may be detrimental for those <38 years old undergoing their first IVF cycle. PGT-A has the greatest clinical impact when a transfer is achieved in the <e2><89><a5>38 years old population. This study evaluates the typical treatment path following a patient's choice to pursue PGT-A at the cycle start, and can be used as a guide for counselling patients in relation to age and cycle number.

E. and van Dulmen-den Broeder, E.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Do female childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) express a decreased desire to have children and do they use reproductive health care more often compared to women without a history of cancer? SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall, no difference was found in the desire to have children between CCSs and controls, whereas CCSs consult a fertility specialist more often, at a younger age, and sooner after their first attempt at conceiving. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Female CCSs may face a shorter than anticipated reproductive window as a result of their cancer treatment. Little is known about their desire to have children and use of reproductive health care, especially in relation to their former cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study is part of the DCOG LATER-VEVO study, a nationwide retrospective cohort study on female fertility in Dutch CCSs. In total, 1749 CCSs and 1673 controls were invited for the study. Data collection took place between January 2008 and May 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data on the desire to have children and use of reproductive health care were collected by questionnaire. The control group consisted of sisters from CCSs and females from the general population. In total, 1106 (63%) CCSs and 818 (49%) controls completed the questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Overall, no difference was found in the desire to have children between CCSs and controls (86% and 89%, respectively). However, survivors of a CNS tumour were less likely to desire children and CCSs without biological children at time of study were more likely to report that their desire to have children was unfulfilled because of medical reasons (9%), compared to controls (1%). In total, 12% of CCSs ever consulted a fertility specialist compared to 10% of controls (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.4). Mean (SD) age at time of their first visit was 27.7 (4.4) years for CCSs and 29.9 (3.9) years for controls (P < 0.01). In total, 43% of CCSs consulted a fertility specialist within 12 months after they had started trying to achieve a pregnancy, compared to 27% of controls. Risk factors for consulting a fertility specialist included a previous diagnosis of renal tumour, leukaemia, lymphoma or a CNS tumour, and treatment with alkylating chemotherapy, gonadotoxic radiotherapy or both. In total, 70% of CCSs reported a female factor as cause of subfertility compared to 34% of controls (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.3-8.7) and in this specific group, CCSs seemed more likely to use fertility treatment (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.0-8.2). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Because of the low number of CCSs who used fertility treatment, we were not able to look at specific diagnoses and treatment types associated with using fertility treatment. Nevertheless, we were able to identify diagnostic- and treatment-related risk factors for consulting a fertility specialist. Details regarding consultations with a fertility specialist and fertility treatment were based on self-report and may therefore be subject to recall bias. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Decisions about parenthood affect all CCSs. It's important to evaluate reproductive intentions and function timely after cancer treatment, so CCSs can be adequately counselled regarding family planning and fertility treatment.

Pedro_2013_Humarepr.OxfEngl,JOUR,Positive experiences of patient-centred care are associated with intentions to comply with fertility treatment: findings from the validation of the Portuguese version of the PCQ-Infertility tool,"Pedro, Juliana and Canavarro, Maria Cristina and Boivin, Jacky and Gameiro, Sofia","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Are positive experiences of different aspects of patient-centred care (PCC) associated with higher intentions to comply with fertility treatment? SUMMARY ANSWER: Positive experiences regarding information received, respect from staff about values and preferences, continuity in treatment and competence of staff are directly associated with higher compliance intentions, while positive experiences regarding accessibility to and involvement in the treatment and communication with staff are indirectly associated, via associations with less concerns about treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The quality of infertility services can influence patients' intentions to comply with treatment. Patients cite negative care experiences as one of the main reasons why they discontinue treatment prematurely. Delivering PCC in routine infertility care is associated with higher quality of life and lower distress during treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this cross-sectional study of 265 women and 83 men, we investigated first, the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the Patient-Centredness Questionnaire (PCQ)-Infertility tool, which assesses infertility PCC, and secondly, the associations between PCC and intentions to comply with treatment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Men and women undergoing fertility diagnostic investigation or treatment at Portuguese fertility clinics were recruited online and in clinical setting. Participants filled out a socio-demographic and fertility data file and other questionnaires to assess PCC (PCQ-Infertility), intentions to comply with treatment (FertiQoL Persistence Scale), wellbeing (Anxiety and Depression subscales of the BSI and FertiQoL), concerns about treatment (CART Scale) and treatment tolerability (FertiQoL Tolerability Domain). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 265 women and 83 men who completed the questionnaires. The confirmatory factor analysis for the PCQ-Infertility indicated a good fit [X<c2><b2> = 479.097; P < 0.001; comparative fit index = 0.929; root mean square error of approximation = 0.058 (0.051-0.065)]. All PCQ-Infertility dimensions showed good internal consistency (<ce><b1> <e2><89><a5> 0.70, excepting for organization: <ce><b1> = 0.57). Information provision, respect for patients' values, continuity of care and competence of the team were directly associated with higher intentions to comply with treatment (r from 0.13 to 0.23). Greater accessibility, patient involvement and good communication were negatively associated with concerns about treatment (r from -0.14 to -0.16) and less concerns were associated with higher intentions to comply with treatment (r from -0.14 to -0.15). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Of the sample, 49% were recruited online. Patients recruited online had higher education and were more likely to be undergoing assisted reproduction treatment and this could have influenced the ratings of PCC reported. We did not account for treatment prognosis factors and/or doctor censuring and this may have resulted in underestimation of the strength of associations reported involving compliance intentions. The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for cause and effect analysis between the study variables. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: To promote treatment compliance, clinics should allow patients to establish stable relationships with a reference doctor who is competent and respectful of their interests and values and who provides them with the information they need. Clinics can also alleviate their patients' concerns regarding medical procedures by ensuring that these professionals are easily accessible, have good communication skills, and involve patients in the treatment process and associated decision-making.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We could not demonstrate non-inferiority of IVM compared with IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: IVF with ovarian hyperstimulation has limitations in some subgroups of women at high risk of ovarian stimulation, such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome. IVM is an alternative ART for these women. IVM may be a feasible alternative to IVF in women with a high AFC, but there is a lack of data from randomized clinical trials comparing IVM with IVF in women at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This single-center, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial was conducted at an academic infertility center in Vietnam from January 2018 to April 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In total, 546 women with an indication for ART and a high AFC (<e2><89><a5>24 follicles in both ovaries) were randomized to the IVM (n = 273) group or the IVF (n = 273) group; each underwent one cycle of IVM with a prematuration step versus one cycle of IVF using a standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist triggering. The primary endpoint was live birth rate after the first embryo transfer. The non-inferiority margin for IVM versus IVF was -10%. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Live birth after the first embryo transfer occurred in 96 women (35.2%) in the IVM group and 118 women (43.2%) in the IVF group (absolute risk difference -8.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.6%, 0.5%). Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates at 12 months after randomization were 44.0% in the IVM group and 62.6% in the IVF group (absolute risk difference -18.7%; 95% CI -27.3%, -10.1%). Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome did not occur in the IVM group, versus two cases in the IVF group. There were no statistically significant differences between the IVM and IVF groups with respect to the occurrence of pregnancy complications, obstetric and perinatal complications, preterm delivery, birth weight and neonatal complications. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitation of the study was its open-label design. In addition, the findings are only applicable to IVM conducted using the prematuration step protocol used in this study. Finally, the single ethnicity population limits the external generalizability of the findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our randomized clinical trial compares live birth rates after IVM and IVF. Although IVM is a viable and safe alternative to IVF that may be suitable for some women seeking a mild ART approach, the current study findings approach inferiority for IVM compared with IVF when cumulative outcomes are considered. Future research should incorporate multiple cycles of IVM in the study design to estimate cumulative fertility outcomes and better inform clinical decision-making.

Preston and Pennings, Guido and Lindheim, Steven R.",Fertility and sterility,"OBJECTIVE: To study patient and provider feedback on how a multimedia platform (EngagedMD) helps patients to understand the risks and consequences of in vitro fertilization (IVF), ovulation induction (OI), and intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatments and the impact of the informed consent process. DESIGN: Prospective survey study. SETTING: IVF units in the United States. PATIENT(S): Six-thousand three-hundred and thirty-three patients who viewed the multimedia platform before IVF or OI-IUI treatment at 13 U.S. IVF centers and 128 providers. INTERVENTION(S): Quantitative survey with 17 questions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Assessment of the impact of a multimedia platform on patient anxiety, comprehension, and satisfaction and provider/nurse feedback related to the informed consent process. RESULT(S): The survey was completed by 3,097 respondents (66% IVF treatment; 34% OI-IUI treatment) and 44 providers. Overall, 93% felt the media platform was intuitive, and 90% and 95% felt it had appropriate duration and detail, respectively. Most agreed/strongly agreed it better prepared them to consent (88%), increased their comfort in pursuing treatment (77%) and increased their satisfaction with their care (83%). Compared with the OI-IUI group, statistically significantly more participants who viewed the IVF media platform strongly agreed that the comprehension questions reinforced key concepts (47% vs. 40%), educated them about treatment risks (55% vs. 44%), helped them ask providers informed questions (45% vs. 36%), and better prepared them to sign consent forms (46% vs. 37%). Overall, 63% of providers felt that the media platform improved patient learning, made patients more accountable, and standardized information dissemination.

Patient-reported outcomes and experiences from the Antarctica-2 randomised controlled trial,"Zaat, T. R. and de Bruin, J. P. and Goddijn, M. and Visser, J. and Kaaijk, E. M. and Lambalk, C. B. and Groenewoud, E. R. and van Wely, M. and Mol, F.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What are the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-reported experiences (PREs) in home-based monitoring compared to those in hospital-based monitoring of ovulation for scheduling frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women undergoing either home-based or hospital-based monitoring experience an increase in anxiety/sadness symptoms over time, but women undergoing home-based monitoring felt more empowered during the treatment and classified the monitoring as more discreet compared to hospital-based monitoring. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: FET is at the heart of modern IVF. The two types of FET cycles that are mainly are used are artificial cycle FET, using artificial preparation of the endometrium with exogenous progesterone and oestrogen, and natural cycle FET (NC-FET). During a natural cycle FET, women visit the hospital repeatedly and receive an ovulation trigger to time FET (i.e. modified NC-FET or hospital-based monitoring). The previously published Antarctica randomised controlled trial (NTR 1586) showed that modified NC-FET is more cost-effective compared to artificial cycle FET. From the women's point of view a more natural approach using home-based monitoring of ovulation with LH urine tests to time FET may be desired (true NC-FET or home-based monitoring). Currently, the multicentre Antarctica-2 randomised controlled trial (RCT) is comparing the cost-effectiveness of home-based monitoring of ovulation with that of hospital-based monitoring of ovulation. The Antarctica-2 RCT enables us to study PROs, defined as the view of participating women of their healthcare status, and PREs, defined as the perception of the received care of participating women, in both FET strategies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: PROs and PREs were assessed alongside the Antarctica-2 RCT. PROs were assessed using the validated EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire. Currently, there are no guidelines for assessing PREs in this population. Therefore, members of the Dutch Patient Organisation for Couples with Fertility Problems (FREYA) filled out an online survey and selected the following PREs to assess (i) anxiety about missing ovulation, (ii) perceived level of partner participation, (iii) level of discretion, (iv) feeling of empowerment and (v) satisfaction with treatment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women participating in the RCT also participated in PRO and PRE assessment. We assessed PROs and PREs at three time points: (i) before randomisation, (ii) at the time of the FET and (iii) at the time of the pregnancy test. A sample size of 200 participants was needed to find a difference of 0.3 with a standard deviation in both groups of 0.7, an alpha of 5%, power of 80% and a drop-out rate of 10%. We performed mixed model analysis for between-group comparison of treatment and time effects. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 260 women were randomised. Of these, 132 women were treated with home-based monitoring and 128 women were treated with hospital-based monitoring. Data before randomisation were available for 232 women (home-based monitoring n = 116, hospital-based monitoring n = 116). For the PROs, we found a significant increase in anxiety/sadness symptoms over time (P < 0.001) in both groups. We found no treatment effect of home-based versus hospital-based monitoring for the PROs (P = 0.8). Concerning the PRES, we found that women felt more empowered during home-based monitoring (P = 0.001) and classified the home-based monitoring as more discreet (P = 0.000) compared to the hospital-based monitoring. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The results are applicable only to women undergoing NC-FET and not to women undergoing artificial cycle FET. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Apart from clinical outcomes, PROs and PREs are also of importance in clinical decision-making and to support tailoring treatment even more specifically to the wishes of patients. Measurement of PROs and PREs should therefore be incorporated in future clinical research.

E.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: Is the presence or absence of certain vaginal bacteria associated with failure or success to become pregnant after an in vitro fertilization (IVF) or IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) treatment? SUMMARY ANSWER: Microbiome profiling with the use of interspace profiling (IS-pro) technique enables stratification of the chance of becoming pregnant prior to the start of an IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Live-birth rates for an IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment vary between 25 and 35% per cycle and it is difficult to predict who will or will not get pregnant after embryo transfer (ET). Recently, it was suggested that the composition of the vaginal microbiota prior to treatment might predict pregnancy outcome. Analysis of the vaginal microbiome prior to treatment might, therefore, offer an opportunity to improve the success rate of IVF or IVF-ICSI. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In a prospective cohort study, 303 women (age, 20-42 years) undergoing IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment in the Netherlands were included between June 2015 and March 2016. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Study subjects provided a vaginal sample before the start of the IVF or IVF-ICSI procedure. The vaginal microbiota composition was determined using the IS-pro technique. IS-pro is a eubacterial technique based on the detection and categorization of the length of the 16S-23S rRNA gene interspace region. Microbiome profiles were assigned to community state types based on the dominant bacterial species. The predictive accuracy of the microbiome profiles for IVF and IVF-ICSI outcome of fresh ET was evaluated by a combined prediction model based on a small number of bacterial species. From this cohort, a model was built to predict outcome of fertility treatment. This model was externally validated in a cohort of 50 women who were undergoing IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment between March 2018 and May 2018 in the Dutch division of the MVZ VivaNeo Kinderwunschzentrum Dusseldorf, Germany. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, the vaginal microbiota of 192 women who underwent a fresh ET could be analysed. Women with a low percentage of Lactobacillus in their vaginal sample were less likely to have a successful embryo implantation. The prediction model identified a subgroup of women (17.7%, n = 34) who had a low chance to become pregnant following fresh ET. This failure was correctly predicted in 32 out of 34 women based on the vaginal microbiota composition, resulting in a predictive accuracy of 94% (sensitivity, 26%; specificity, 97%). Additionally, the degree of dominance of Lactobacillus crispatus was an important factor in predicting pregnancy. Women who had a favourable profile as well as <60% L. crispatus had a high chance of pregnancy: more than half of these women (50 out of 95) became pregnant. In the external validation cohort, none of the women who had a negative prediction (low chance of pregnancy) became pregnant. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Because our study uses a well-defined study population, the results will be limited to the IVF or IVF-ICSI population. Whether these results can be extrapolated to the general population trying to achieve pregnancy without ART cannot be determined from these data. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results indicate that vaginal microbiome profiling using the IS-pro technique enables stratification of the chance of becoming pregnant prior to the start of an IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment. Knowledge of their vaginal microbiota may enable couples to make a more balanced decision regarding timing and continuation of their IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment cycles.
