Panesar_2020_Neur,JOUR,Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence in Neurosurgery,"Panesar, Sandip S. and Kliot, Michel and Parrish, Rob and Fernandez-Miranda, Juan and Cagle, Yvonne and Britz, Gavin W.",Neurosurgery,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-facilitated clinical automation is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the near future. AI techniques may permit rapid and detailed analysis of the large quantities of clinical data generated in modern healthcare settings, at a level that is otherwise impossible by humans. Subsequently, AI may enhance clinical practice by pushing the limits of diagnostics, clinical decision making, and prognostication. Moreover, if combined with surgical robotics and other surgical adjuncts such as image guidance, AI may find its way into the operating room and permit more accurate interventions, with fewer errors. Despite the considerable hype surrounding the impending medical AI revolution, little has been written about potential downsides to increasing clinical automation. These may include both direct and indirect consequences. Directly, faulty, inadequately trained, or poorly understood algorithms may produce erroneous results, which may have wide-scale impact. Indirectly, increasing use of automation may exacerbate de-skilling of human physicians due to over-reliance, poor understanding, overconfidence, and lack of necessary vigilance of an automated clinical workflow. Many of these negative phenomena have already been witnessed in other industries that have already undergone, or are undergoing ""automation revolutions,"" namely commercial aviation and the automotive industry.

The upsurge in big data applications is a direct consequence of the drastic boom in information technology as well as the growing number of internet-connected devices called the Internet of Things in healthcare. Compared with business, marketing, and other sectors, healthcare applications are lagging due to a lack of technical knowledge among healthcare workers, technological limitations in acquiring and analyzing the data, and improper governance of healthcare big data. Despite these limitations, the medical literature is flooded with big data-related articles, and most of these are filled with abstruse terminologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, and algorithm. Many of the recent articles are restricted to neurosurgical registries, creating a false impression that big data is synonymous with registries. Others advocate that the utilization of big data will be the panacea to all healthcare problems and research in the future. Without a proper understanding of these principles, it becomes easy to get lost without the ability to differentiate hype from reality. To that end, the authors give a brief narrative of big data analysis in neurosurgery and review its applications, limitations, and the challenges it presents for neurosurgeons and healthcare professionals naive to this field.

The object of this article was to examine how clinical registries might be used to generate new evidence to support a particular treatment option when comparable options exist. Lumbar spondylolisthesis is used as an example.METHODSThe authors reviewed the literature examining the comparative effectiveness of decompression alone versus decompression with fusion for lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Modern data acquisition for the creation of registries was also reviewed with an eye toward how artificial intelligence for the treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis might be explored.RESULTSCurrent randomized controlled trials differ on the importance of adding fusion when performing decompression for lumbar spondylolisthesis. Standardized approaches to extracting data from the electronic medical record as well as the ability to capture radiographic imaging and incorporate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will ultimately lead to the development of modern, structured, data-filled registries that will lay the foundation for machine learning.CONCLUSIONSThere is a growing realization that patient experience, satisfaction, and outcomes are essential to improving the overall quality of spine care.

As epidemiological datasets continue to burgeon in size and complexity, powerful methods such as statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) become necessary to interpret and develop prognostic models from underlying data. Through such analysis, machine learning can be used to facilitate personalized medicine via its precise predictions. Additionally, other AI tools, such as natural language processing and computer vision, can play an instrumental part in personalizing the care provided to patients with spine disease. In the present report, we discuss the current strides made in incorporating AI into research on spine disease, especially traumatic spinal cord injury and degenerative spine disease. We describe studies using AI to build accurate prognostic models, extract important information from medical reports via natural language processing, and evaluate functional status in a granular manner using computer vision.

Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Unplanned preventable hospital readmissions within 30 days are a great burden to patients and the healthcare system. With an estimated $41.3 billion spent yearly, reducing such readmission rates is of the utmost importance. With the widespread adoption of big data and machine learning, clinicians can use these analytical tools to understand these complex relationships and find predictive factors that can be generalized to future patients. The object of this study was to assess the efficacy of a machine learning algorithm in the prediction of 30-day hospital readmission after posterior spinal fusion surgery. METHODS: The authors analyzed the distribution of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) posterior lumbar fusions from 2011 to 2016 by using machine learning techniques to create a model predictive of hospital readmissions. A deep neural network was trained using 177 unique input variables. The model was trained and tested using cross-validation, in which the data were randomly partitioned into training (n = 17,448 [75%]) and testing (n = 5816 [25%]) data sets. In training, the 17,448 training cases were fed through a series of 7 layers, each with varying degrees of forward and backward communicating nodes (neurons). RESULTS: Mean and median positive predictive values were 78.5% and 78.0%, respectively. Mean and median negative predictive values were both 97%, respectively. Mean and median areas under the curve for the model were 0.812 and 0.810, respectively. The five most heavily weighted inputs were (in order of importance) return to the operating room, septic shock, superficial surgical site infection, sepsis, and being on a ventilator for > 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are powerful tools with the ability to improve understanding of predictive metrics in clinical spine surgery. The authors' model was able to predict those patients who would not require readmission. Similarly, the majority of predicted readmissions (up to 60%) were predicted by the model while retaining a 0% false-positive rate.

Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) have been developed; however, they have not been well implemented into the clinician workflow. Therefore, clinicians have been left to make decisions with incomplete information. Equally underused are the electronic health records (EHRs), which house enormous amounts of health data, but the power of that ""big data"" has failed to be capitalized on. METHODS: Early attempts at EBGs were rigid and nonadaptive; however, with the current advances in data informatics and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to integrate ""big data"" and rapid data processing into clinical decision support tools. We have presented an overview of the background of EHRs and EBGs in neurosurgery and explored the possibility of integrating them to reduce unwanted variance. RESULTS: As we strive toward variance reduction in healthcare, the integration of ""big data"" and EBGs for decision-making will be key. We have proposed that EHRs are an ideal platform for integrating EBGs into the clinician workflow and have presented as an example of a successful early generation model, Neurocore. With this approach, it will be possible to build EBGs into the EHR software, to continuously update and optimize EBGs according to the flow of patient data into the EHR, and to present data-driven clinical decision support at the point of care.

The purpose of this study was to use machine learning algorithms to develop an open-access web application for preoperative prediction of nonroutine discharges in surgery for elective inpatient lumbar degenerative disc disorders.METHODSThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried to identify patients who underwent elective inpatient spine surgery for lumbar disc herniation or lumbar disc degeneration between 2011 and 2016. Four machine learning algorithms were developed to predict nonroutine discharge and the best algorithm was incorporated into an open-access web application.RESULTSThe rate of nonroutine discharge for 26,364 patients who underwent elective inpatient surgery for lumbar degenerative disc disorders was 9.28%.

Yet, this type of linear analysis is limited due to lack of consideration of the trend's effects both pre- and postintervention and the potential for confounding influences. The aim of this study was to illustrate interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) as applied to an example in the neurosurgical literature and highlight ITSA's potential for future applications. METHODS The methods used in previous neurosurgical studies were analyzed and then compared with the methodology of ITSA. RESULTS The ITSA method was identified in the neurosurgical literature as an important technique for isolating the effect of an intervention (such as a policy change or a quality and safety initiative) on a health outcome independent of other factors driving trends in the outcome. The authors determined that ITSA allows for analysis of the intervention's immediate impact on outcome level and on subsequent trends and enables a more careful measure of the causal effects of interventions on health care outcomes.

Identifying drivers of total charges for transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for pituitary tumors, which are poorly understood, represents an opportunity for neurosurgeons to reduce waste and provide higher-quality care for their patients. In this study the authors used a large, national database to build machine learning (ML) ensembles that directly predict total charges in this patient population. They then interrogated the ensembles to identify variables that predict high charges. METHODS: The authors created a training data set of 15,487 patients who underwent TSS between 2002 and 2011 and were registered in the National Inpatient Sample. Thirty-two ML algorithms were trained to predict total charges from 71 collected variables, and the most predictive algorithms combined to form an ensemble model. The model was internally and externally validated to demonstrate generalizability. Permutation importance and partial dependence analyses were performed to identify the strongest drivers of total charges. Given the overwhelming influence of length of stay (LOS), a second ensemble excluding LOS as a predictor was built to identify additional drivers of total charges. RESULTS: An ensemble model comprising 3 gradient boosted tree classifiers best predicted total charges (root mean square logarithmic error = 0.446; 95% CI 0.439-0.453; holdout = 0.455). LOS was by far the strongest predictor of total charges, increasing total predicted charges by approximately $5000 per day.In the absence of LOS, the strongest predictors of total charges were admission type, hospital region, race, any postoperative complication, and hospital ownership type.

D. and Schwab, Joseph H. and Smith, Timothy R. and Gormley, William B.",Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Nonroutine discharge after elective spine surgery increases healthcare costs, negatively impacts patient satisfaction, and exposes patients to additional hospital-acquired complications. Therefore, prediction of nonroutine discharge in this population may improve clinical management. The authors previously developed a machine learning algorithm from national data that predicts risk of nonhome discharge for patients undergoing surgery for lumbar disc disorders. In this paper the authors externally validate their algorithm in an independent institutional population of neurosurgical spine patients. METHODS: Medical records from elective inpatient surgery for lumbar disc herniation or degeneration in the Transitional Care Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital (2013-2015) were retrospectively reviewed. Variables included age, sex, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, preoperative functional status, number of fusion levels, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, and discharge disposition. Nonroutine discharge was defined as postoperative discharge to any setting other than home. The discrimination (c-statistic), calibration, and positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs) of the algorithm were assessed in the institutional sample. RESULTS: Overall, 144 patients underwent elective inpatient surgery for lumbar disc disorders with a nonroutine discharge rate of 6.9% (n = 10). The median patient age was 50 years and 45.1% of patients were female. Most patients were ASA class II (66.0%), had 1 or 2 levels fused (80.6%), and had no diabetes (91.7%). The median hematocrit level was 41.2%. The neural network algorithm generalized well to the institutional data, with a c-statistic (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.89, calibration slope of 1.09, and calibration intercept of -0.08. At a threshold of 0.25, the PPV was 0.50 and the NPV was 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: This institutional external validation of a previously developed machine learning algorithm suggests a reliable method for identifying patients with lumbar disc disorder at risk for nonroutine discharge. Performance in the institutional cohort was comparable to performance in the derivation cohort and represents an improved predictive value over clinician intuition. This finding substantiates initial use of this algorithm in clinical practice.

Identifying factors contributing to readmission risk presents opportunities for actionable change to reduce readmission rates. OBJECTIVE: To combine machine learning classification and feature importance analysis to identify drivers of readmission in a large cohort of spine patients. METHODS: Cases involving surgical procedures for degenerative spine conditions between 2008 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Of 11 150 cases, 396 patients (3.6%) experienced an unplanned hospital readmission within 30 d of discharge. Over 75 pre-discharge variables were collected and categorized into demographic, perioperative, and resource utilization feature domains. Random forest classification was used to construct predictive models for readmission from feature domains. An ensemble tree-specific method was used to quantify and rank features by relative importance. RESULTS: In the demographics domain, age and comorbidity burden were the most important features for readmission prediction. Surgical duration and intraoperative oral morphine equivalents were the most important perioperative features, whereas total direct cost and length of stay were most important in the resource utilization domain. In supervised learning experiments for predicting readmission, the demographic domain model performed the best alone, suggesting that demographic features may contribute more to readmission risk than perioperative variables following spine surgery. A predictive model, created using only enriched features showing substantial importance, demonstrated improved predictive capacity compared to previous models, and approached the performance of state-of-the-art, deep-learning models for readmission.

We also assessed the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to prognosticate and predict outcome and compared this to conventional statistical analyses. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of BAVM during a 22-year period in a national neuroscience center was performed. Clinical presentation, imaging, procedural details, complications, and outcome were recorded. The data was analyzed with artificial intelligence techniques to identify predictors of outcome and assess accuracy in predicting clinical outcome at final follow-up. RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-nine patients underwent treatment for BAVM with a mean follow-up duration of 63 months. The commonest clinical presentation was intracranial hemorrhage (56%). During the follow-up period, there were 51 further hemorrhagic events, comprising spontaneous hemorrhage (n = 27) and procedural related hemorrhage (n = 24). All spontaneous events occurred in previously embolized BAVMs remote from the procedure. Complications included ischemic stroke in 10%, symptomatic hemorrhage in 9.8%, and mortality rate of 4.7%. Standard regression analysis model had an accuracy of 43% in predicting final outcome (mortality), with the type of treatment complication identified as the most important predictor.

The authors present a review of the recently published neurosurgical literature that employs Markov modeling and provide a conceptual framework with which to evaluate, critique, and apply the findings generated from health economics research. METHODS The PubMed online database was searched to identify neurosurgical literature published from January 2010 to December 2017 that had utilized Markov modeling for neurosurgical cost-effectiveness studies. Included articles were then assessed with regard to year of publication, subspecialty of neurosurgery, decision analytical techniques utilized, and source information for model inputs. RESULTS A total of 55 articles utilizing Markov models were identified across a broad range of neurosurgical subspecialties. Sixty-five percent of the papers were published within the past 3 years alone. The majority of models derived health transition probabilities, health utilities, and cost information from previously published studies or publicly available information. Only 62% of the studies incorporated indirect costs. Ninety-three percent of the studies performed a 1-way or 2-way sensitivity analysis, and 67% performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. A review of the conceptual framework of Markov modeling and an explanation of the different terminology and methodology are provided. CONCLUSIONS As neurosurgeons continue to innovate and identify novel treatment strategies for patients, Markov modeling will allow for better characterization of the impact of these interventions on a patient and societal level.

D. and Smith, Timothy R. and Arnaout, Omar",World neurosurgery,"OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of surgical outcomes is highly desirable to optimize surgical decision-making. An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction. METHODS: A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5% and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15% and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions.

Previous work by our group has demonstrated that the majority of patients and their relatives feel comfortable with the application of AI to augment surgical care. The aim of this study was to similarly evaluate the attitudes of surgeons and the wider surgical team toward the role of AI in neurosurgery. METHODS: In a 2-stage cross sectional survey, an initial open-question qualitative survey was created to determine the perspective of the surgical team on AI in neurosurgery including surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, and operating room practitioners. Thematic analysis was performed to develop a second-stage quantitative survey that was distributed via social media. We assessed the extent to which they agreed and were comfortable with real-world AI implementation using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: In the first-stage survey, 33 participants responded. Six main themes were identified: imaging interpretation and preoperative diagnosis, coordination of the surgical team, operative planning, real-time alert of hazards and complications, autonomous surgery, and postoperative management and follow-up. In the second stage, 100 participants responded. Responders somewhat agreed or strongly agreed about AI being used for imaging interpretation (62%), operative planning (82%), coordination of the surgical team (70%), real-time alert of hazards and complications (85%), and autonomous surgery (66%).

Here, we use guided machine learning (ML) ensembles to model the impact of race on discharge disposition and length of stay (LOS) after brain tumor surgery from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 41,222 patients who underwent craniotomies for brain tumors from 2002 to 2011 and were registered in the National Inpatient Sample. Twenty-six ML algorithms were trained on prehospitalization variables to predict non-home discharge and extended LOS (>7 days) after brain tumor resection, and the most predictive algorithms combined to create ensemble models. Partial dependence analysis was performed to measure the independent impact of race on the ensembles. RESULTS: The guided ML ensembles predicted non-home disposition (area under the curve, 0.796) and extended LOS (area under the curve, 0.824) with good discrimination. Partial dependence analysis showed that black race increases the risk of non-home discharge and extended LOS over white race by 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Other, nonblack race increases the risk of extended LOS over white race by 6.0%. The impact of race on these outcomes is not seen when analyzing the general inpatient or general operative population. CONCLUSIONS: Minority race independently increases the risk of extended LOS and black race increases the risk of non-home discharge in patients undergoing brain tumor resection, a finding not mimicked in the general inpatient or operative population.

However, the 2 differ in sampling methodology, which may result in conflicting findings when used for research studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the differences regarding predictors of 30-day readmissions after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and posterior lumbar fusion (PLF). METHODS: In this case-control study, NSQIP and NRD were queried for patients undergoing elective ACDF and PLF between 2014 and 2015. The outcome of interest was 30-day readmissions following ACDF and PLF, which were unplanned and related to the index procedure. Subsequently, univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of 30-day readmissions using both databases. RESULTS: For ACDF procedures, diagnosis, outpatient status, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and length of hospital stay were found to be significant predictors of 30-day readmissions in NSQIP, whereas only age and hypertension were significant in NRD. Among patients undergoing PLF procedures, body mass index, functional status, smoking, steroid use, diabetes, dyspnea, dialysis, emergency, discharge to rehab facility, and length of hospital stay were found to be significant predictors of 30-day readmissions in NSQIP, whereas only alcohol abuse and obesity were significant predictors in NRD.

Outcomes in this patient population are generally poor, prognostication is often uncertain, and treatment strategies offer limited benefits. Studies demonstrate variability in the type and intensity of treatment offered, which is attributed to clinical uncertainty and habits of training. Research has focused on new techniques and more stringent evidence-based selection criteria to improve outcomes and produce consensus around treatment strategies for patients with ICH. Such focus, however, offers little description of how ICH treatment decisions are made and how such decisions reflect patient preferences regarding medical care. A growing body of literature suggests that the process of decision making in ICH is laden with bias, value assumptions, and subjective impressions. Factors such as geography, cognitive biases, patient perceptions, and physician characteristics can all shape decision making and the selection of treatment. Such factors often serve as a barrier to providing patient-centered medical care. In this article, the authors review how surgical decision making for patients with ICH is shaped by these decisional factors and suggest future research pathways to study decision making in ICH.

Information regarding the patient's condition is conveyed in the papyrus with sufficient clarity to allow a clinical assessment of each injury. The ancient Egyptian physician/teacher lists the key diagnostic elements in each case, and then pronounces his opinion of the treatment potential in one of three verdicts: 1) ""a medical condition I can treat;"" 2) ""a medical condition I can contend with;"" or 3) ""a medical condition you will not be able to treat."" The structural organization of the text according to regional injuries of increasing severity permits analysis of sequential cases, and makes it possible to determine which clinical features led the ancient Egyptian physician to give the first or second verdict in the less severe injuries, but the third in the worst cases. Interestingly, the ancient physicians were not deterred from contending with injuries in the presence of basilar skull fractures, traumatic meningismus, skull perforation without overt neurological deficit, drowsiness, limited facial fractures, or closed head injuries without depressed fragments. Factors identified as determinant for the third verdict in head injuries are depressed skull fragments, dura laceration with exposed brain, infected cranial wounds/tetanus, major craniofacial fractures, deep skull-penetrating stab wounds, and aphasia.

It is a uniformly fatal disease (median overall survival 16 months) even with aggressive resection and an adjuvant temozolomide-based chemoradiation regimen. Age remains an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis. Several factors contribute to the dismal outcomes in the elderly population with GBM, including poor baseline health status, differences in underlying genomic alterations, and variability in the surgical and medical management of this subpopulation. The latter arises from a lack of adequate representation of elderly patients in clinical trials, resulting in limited data on the response of this subpopulation to standard treatment. Results from retrospective and some prospective studies have indicated that resection of only contrast-enhancing lesions and administration of hypofractionated radiotherapy in combination with temozolomide are effective strategies for optimizing survival while maintaining baseline quality of life in elderly GBM patients; however, survival remains dismal relative to that in a younger cohort.

Its ambitions include universal access to health care, a focus on population health, payment reform, and cost control. Each of these aims is complicated by a number of ethical challenges, of which 7 stand out because of their potential influence on patient care: the accountability of physicians and surgeons to individual patients; the effects of financial incentives on clinical judgment; the definition and management of conflicting interests; the duty to preserve patient autonomy in the face of protocolized care; problems in information exchange and communication; issues related to electronic health records and data security; and the appropriate use of ""Big Data.""Systematic social and economic reforms inevitably raise ethical concerns.

We performed a qualitative analysis of online interpatient discussions to investigate perspectives on medical decision making. METHODS: On an aneurysm-specific forum, we identified patient conversation threads created between December 3, 2016 and December 3, 2018 containing discussion of medical decision making. These threads were analyzed using an adapted grounded-theory approach. Two researchers coded each thread and discussed discrepancies until consensus was reached. Coded content was analyzed to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: We analyzed 40 threads from a foundation-sponsored intracranial aneurysm-specific patient forum in the public domain. There were 110 user accounts, contributing 527 posts of average length 108 words. Fifty-seven users described diagnosis of UIA without history of rupture, and 20 described presentation with rupture. Patients 1) felt fortunate for diagnosis with UIA but were challenged by decision making and concern for rupture, 2) desired treatment by providers with large case volumes, clear communication, and an unbiased approach to decision making, 3) acted on qualitative understandings of individual risk, 4) considered psychological, social, and clinical factors in forming preferences for management, 5) sought information for purposes other than informing decision making, and 6) regained control through decision-making processes.

D.",World neurosurgery,"Neurosurgical interventions frequently occur in an emergency setting. In this setting, patients often have impaired consciousness and are unable to directly express their values and wishes regarding their treatment. The limited time available for clinical decision making has great ethical implications, as the informed consent procedure may become compromised. The ethical situation may be further challenged by different views between the patient, family members, and the neurosurgeon; the presence of advance directives; the use of an innovative procedure; or if the procedure is part of a research project. This moral opinion piece presents the implications of time constraints and a lack of patient capacity for autonomous decision making in emergency neurosurgical situations. Potential solutions to these challenges are presented that may help to improve ethical patient management in emergency settings.

Spine,"OBJECTIVEIt is important to identify differences in the treatment of common diseases over time and across geographic regions. Several studies have reported increased use of arthrodesis to treat lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The purpose of this study was to investigate geographic variations in the treatment of LSS by US region.METHODSThe authors reviewed inpatient and outpatient medical claims from 2010 to 2014 using the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Truven Health Analytics), which includes data on commercially insured members younger than 65 years. ICD-9 code 724.02 was used to identify patients aged <e2><89><a5> 40 and < 65 years who underwent surgery for ""spinal stenosis of the lumbar region"" and for whom LSS was the only principal diagnosis. The primary outcome was the performance of spinal arthrodesis as part of the procedure. Geographic regions were based on patient residence and defined according to the US Census Bureau as the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.RESULTSRates of arthrodesis, as opposed to decompression alone, varied significantly by region, from 48% in the South, to 42% in the Midwest, 36% in the Northeast, and 31% in the West. After controlling for patient age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index values, the differences remained significant. Compared with patients in the Northeast, those in the South (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.50-1.75) and Midwest (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.18-1.41) were significantly more likely to undergo spinal arthrodesis. On multivariate analysis, patients in the West were significantly less likely to have a prolonged hospital stay (> 3 days) than those in the Northeast (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94). Compared with the rate in the Northeast, the rates of discharge to a skilled nursing facility were lower in the South (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.55) and West (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98). The 30-day readmission rate was significantly lower in the West (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-0.98) than in the Northeast and similar between the other regions. Mean payments were significantly higher in the Midwest (mean difference $5503, 95% CI $4279-$6762), South (mean difference $6187, 95% CI $5041-$7332), and West (mean difference $7732, 95% CI $6384-$9080) than in the Northeast.CONCLUSIONSThe use of spinal arthrodesis, as well as surgical outcomes and payments for the treatment of LSS, varies significantly by US region.

Spine,"OBJECT: The load-sharing score (LSS) of vertebral body comminution is predictive of results after short-segment posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Some authors have posited that an LSS > 6 is predictive of neurological injury, ligamentous injury, and the need for surgical intervention. However, the authors of the present study hypothesized that the LSS does not predict ligamentous or neurological injury. METHODS: The prospectively collected spinal cord injury database from a single institution was queried for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Study inclusion criteria were acute (< 24 hours) burst fractures between T-10 and L-2 with preoperative CT and MRI. Flexion-distraction injuries and pathological fractures were excluded. Four experienced spine surgeons determined the LSS and posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) integrity. Neurological status was assessed from a review of the medical records. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included in the study. There were 4 patients for whom all observers assigned an LSS > 6, recommending operative treatment. Eleven patients had LSSs <e2><89><a4> 6 across all observers, suggesting that nonoperative treatment would be appropriate. There was moderate interobserver agreement (0.43) for the overall LSS and fair agreement (0.24) for an LSS > 6. Correlations between the LSS and the PLC score averaged 0.18 across all observers (range -0.02 to 0.34, p value range 0.02-0.89). Correlations between the LSS and the American Spinal Injury Association motor score averaged -0.12 across all observers (range -0.25 to -0.03, p value range 0.1-0.87). Correlations describing the relationship between an LSS > 6 and the treating physician's decision to operate averaged 0.17 across all observers (range 0.11-0.24, p value range 0.12-0.47). CONCLUSIONS: The LSS does not uniformly correlate with the PLC injury, neurological status, or empirical clinical decision making. The LSSs of only one observer correlated significantly with PLC injury.

Current strategies that make use of molecular markers and imaging techniques and therapeutic considerations offer additional options for management of LGGs. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes suggest a role for this abnormal metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis and progression of these primary brain tumors. Use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide preoperative detection of IDH-mutated gliomas and affect surgical planning. In addition, IDH1 and IDH2 mutation status may have an effect on surgical resectability of gliomas. The IDH-mutated tumors exhibit better prognosis throughout every grade of glioma, and mutation may be an early genetic event, preceding lineage-specific secondary and tertiary alterations that transform LGGs into secondary glioblastomas. The O6-methylguanine-DNAmethyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and 1p19q codeletion status can predict sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation in low- and intermediate-grade gliomas.

Spine,"OBJECT: Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition is a rare cause of retroodontoid mass lesions in elderly individuals. However, this condition may be severely underdiagnosed if sufficient attention is not paid to imaging characteristics and clinical presentation. The authors sought to evaluate the decision-making process in both the diagnosis and surgical treatment of CPPD. METHODS: A retrospective review of University of Iowa medical records and radiographs accumulated between 1977 and 2006 was performed. The inclusion criterion was histopathological findings consistent with pseudogout at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). Twenty-one patients with a mean age of 70.3 years and a mean symptom duration prior to presentation of 17.5 months were identified and included in this study. RESULTS: The patients presented most frequently with occipital and neck pain (85%) and numbness or paresthesias (61%). Lower cranial nerve deficits were seen in 29%. Calcification of the mass or transverse ligament was seen on computed tomography in all included patients. Gross-total resection was achieved in all patients: 19 of 21 patients underwent transoral-transpalatopharyngeal resection, with only 16 requiring concomitant dorsal occipital-cervical fusion. The mean follow-up duration was 15 months. Eighteen patients (86%) had improvement or resolution of symptoms after treatment, and 3 were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, CPPD deposition at the CVJ should be suspected on finding calcification of and around the transverse ligament on neuroimaging. Transoral-transpalatopharyngeal resection is preferred to halt the progression of neurological deterioration; dorsal fusion is not always mandatory as concomitant ligamentous calcification and atlantoaxial joint ankylosis may provide added stability.",2008,10.3171/SPI-08/01/022,8,1,22-29,eng,1547-5654 1547-5646,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Follow-Up Studies and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Diagnosis, Differential and Spinal Fusion and Atlanto-Axial Joint/*pathology/surgery and Atlanto-Occipital Joint/*pathology/surgery and Calcinosis/diagnosis and Chondrocalcinosis/*diagnosis/surgery and Cranial Nerve Diseases/diagnosis and Hypesthesia/diagnosis and Ligaments, Articular/pathology and Neck Pain/diagnosis and Odontoid Process/pathology/surgery and Paresthesia/diagnosis",NA,NA,2008/01//undefined,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current tools have poor to fair predictive performance for intermediate (90-d) and long-term (1-yr) mortality. OBJECTIVE: To develop predictive algorithms for spinal metastatic disease at these time points and to provide patient-specific explanations of the predictions generated by these algorithms. METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted at 2 large academic medical centers to identify patients undergoing initial operative management for spinal metastatic disease between January 2000 and December 2016. Five models (penalized logistic regression, random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, neural network, and support vector machine) were developed to predict 90-d and 1-yr mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 732 patients were identified with 90-d and 1-yr mortality rates of 181 (25.1%) and 385 (54.3%), respectively. The stochastic gradient boosting algorithm had the best performance for 90-d mortality and 1-yr mortality. On global variable importance assessment, albumin, primary tumor histology, and performance status were the 3 most important predictors of 90-d mortality. The final models were incorporated into an open access web application able to provide predictions as well as patient-specific explanations of the results generated by the algorithms. The application can be found at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/spinemetssurvival/.

Spine,"OBJECT: Current health care reform calls for a reduction of procedures and treatments that are less effective, more costly, and of little value (high cost/low quality). The authors assessed the 2-year cost and effectiveness of comprehensive medical management for lumbar spondylolisthesis, stenosis, and herniation by utilizing a prospective single-center multidisciplinary spine center registry in a real-world practice setting. METHODS: Analysis was performed on a prospective longitudinal quality of life spine registry. Patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis (n = 50), stenosis (n = 50), and disc herniation (n = 50) who had symptoms persisting after 6 weeks of medical management and who were eligible for surgical treatment were entered into a prospective registry after deciding on nonsurgical treatment. In all cases, comprehensive medical management included spinal steroid injections, physical therapy, muscle relaxants, antiinflammatory medication, and narcotic oral agents. Two-year patient-reported outcomes, back-related medical resource utilization, and occupational work-day losses were prospectively collected and used to calculate Medicare fee-based direct and indirect costs from the payer and societal perspectives. The maximum health gain associated with medical management was defined as the improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life experienced after 2 years of medical treatment or at the time a patient decided to cross over to surgery. RESULTS: The maximum health gain in back pain, leg pain, disability, quality of life, depression, and general health state did not achieve statistical significance by 2 years of medical management, except for pain and disability in patients with disc herniation and back pain in patients with lumbar stenosis. Eighteen patients (36%) with spondylolisthesis, 11 (22%) with stenosis, and 17 (34%) with disc herniation eventually required surgical management due to lack of improvement. The 2-year improvement did not achieve a minimum clinically important difference in any outcome measure. The mean 2-year total cost (direct plus indirect) of medical management was $6606 for spondylolisthesis, $7747 for stenosis, and $7097 for herniation. CONCLUSIONS: In an institution-wide, prospective, longitudinal quality of life registry that measures cost and effectiveness of all spine care provided, comprehensive medical management did not result in sustained improvement in pain, disability, or quality of life for patients with surgically eligible degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, stenosis, or disc herniation. From both the societal and payer perspective, continued medical management of patients with these lumbar pathologies in whom 6 weeks of conservative therapy failed was of minimal value given its lack of health utility and effectiveness and its health care costs.

Shlobin_2020_Neurfocu,JOUR,Informed consent in neurosurgery: a systematic review,"Shlobin, Nathan A. and Sheldon, Mark and Lam, Sandi",Neurosurgical focus,"OBJECTIVE: Informed consent has served as a main principle of medical ethics and laws in the United States. The 1986 American Association of Neurological Surgeons Code of Ethics implied medicolegal liability for the failure to obtain informed consent without providing practical guidance regarding the application of informed consent to individual patient encounters in a medicolegal environment. Here, the authors aimed to identify baseline patient recall after discussions with neurosurgeons and their capacity to provide informed consent, describe the effects of interventions to improve patient comprehension, and elucidate the role of informed consent in malpractice litigation in neurosurgery. Their findings may guide neurosurgeons in discussions to properly inform patients and reduce the risk of litigation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to explore informed consent within neurosurgery and its application to medicolegal liability using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Titles and abstracts from articles identified in the search were read and selected for full-text review. Studies meeting prespecified inclusion criteria were reviewed in full and analyzed for study design, aim, population, interventions, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1428 resultant articles, 21 were included in the review. Baseline patient recall was low, particularly for risks and alternatives of treatments, and even decreased over time. Cognitive impairment was noted as a factor limiting the ability to provide informed consent. Interventions incorporating a combination of modalities in informed consent discussions, a specialized consent form with points for neurosurgeons to check off upon discussion, interactive websites, question prompt lists, and illustrations were found to be effective in improving patient knowledge. Lack of informed consent was a common factor for malpractice litigation. Spine surgery was particularly prone to costly lawsuits. Payments were generally greater for plaintiff verdicts than for settlements. CONCLUSIONS: The application of informed consent to patient encounters is an important facet of clinical practice. Neurosurgeons have a duty to provide patients with all pertinent information to allow them to make decisions about their care. The authors examined baseline patient comprehension and capacity, interventions to improve informed consent, and malpractice litigation; it appears that determining the proper capacity to provide informed consent and considering informed consent as a process that depends on the setting are important. There is room to improve the informed consent process centered on baseline patient health literacy and understanding as well as clear communication using multiple modalities.",2020,10.3171/2020.8.FOCUS20611,49,5,E6,eng,1092-0684,decision-making and United States and Humans and Informed Consent and *Malpractice and *Neurosurgery and Neurosurgeons and informed consent and neurosurgery and Neurosurgical Procedures and medical malpractice and medicolegal,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

Treatment, however, is expensive and complication rates are high. Predictive analytics has the potential to use many variables to make accurate predictions in large data sets. A validated minimum clinically important difference (MCID) model has the potential to assist in patient selection, thereby improving outcomes and, potentially, cost-effectiveness. METHODS The present study was a retrospective analysis of a multiinstitutional database of patients with ASD. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age <e2><89><a5> 18 years, radiographic evidence of ASD, 2-year follow-up, and preoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) > 15. Forty-six variables were used for model training: demographic data, radiographic parameters, surgical variables, and results on the health-related quality of life questionnaire. Patients were grouped as reaching a 2-year ODI MCID (+MCID) or not (-MCID). An ensemble of 5 different bootstrapped decision trees was constructed using the C5.0 algorithm. Internal validation was performed via 70:30 data split for training/testing. Model accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. The mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and QALYs gained at 2 years were calculated and discounted at 3.5% per year. The QALYs were compared between patients in the +MCID and -MCID groups. RESULTS A total of 234 patients met inclusion criteria (+MCID 129, -MCID 105). Sixty-nine patients (29.5%) were included for model testing. Predicted versus actual results were 50 versus 40 for +MCID and 19 versus 29 for -MCID (i.e., 10 patients were misclassified). Model accuracy was 85.5%, with 0.96 AUC. Predicted results showed that patients in the +MCID group had significantly greater 2-year mean QALYs (p = 0.0057) and QALYs gained (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS A successful model with 85.5% accuracy and 0.96 AUC was constructed to predict which patients would reach ODI MCID.

Ferraris_2020_Neurfocu,JOUR,Recapitulating the Bayesian framework for neurosurgical outpatient care and a cost-benefit analysis of telemedicine for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in the Philippines during the pandemic,"Ferraris, Kevin Paul and Golidtum, Jared Paul and Zuniga, Brian Karlo W. and Bautista, Maria Cristina G. and Alcazaren, Jose Carlos and Seng, Kenny and Navarro, Joseph Erroll",Neurosurgical focus,"OBJECTIVE: In the Philippines during recent months, a neurosurgical center that caters primarily to socioeconomically disadvantaged patients has encountered unprecedented changes in practice patterns brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the usual task of outpatient care has shifted to the telemedicine format, bringing along all of its attendant advantages and gargantuan challenges. The authors sought to determine the responsiveness of this telemedicine setup to the needs of their disadvantaged patients and explored the application of Bayesian inference to enhance the use of teleconsultation in daily clinical decision-making. METHODS: The authors used the following methods to assess the telemedicine setup used in a low-resource setting during the pandemic: 1) a cross-sectional survey of patients who participated in a medical consultation via telemedicine during the 16-week period from March 16, 2020, to July 15, 2020; 2) a cost-benefit analysis of the use of telemedicine by patients; and 3) a case illustration of a Bayesian approach application unique to the teleconsultation scenario. RESULTS: Of the 272 patient beneficiaries of telemedicine in a 16-week period, 57 responded to the survey. The survey responses regarding neurosurgical outpatient care through telemedicine yielded high ratings of utility for the patients and their caregivers. According to 64% of respondents, the affordability of the telemedicine setup also prevented them from borrowing money from others, among other adverse life events prevented. There were realized financial gains on the part of the patients in terms of cost savings and protection from further impoverishment. The benefit-cost ratio was 3.51 for the patients, signifying that the benefits outweighed the costs. An actual teleconsultation case vignette was reported that is meant to be instructive and contributory to the preparedness of the neurosurgeon on the provider end of the service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine holds promise as a viable and safe method for health service delivery during the pandemic. In the setting of a health system that is continually challenged by shortages of resources, this study shows that an effective telemedicine setup can come with high benefit-cost ratios and quality of care, along with the assurance of patient satisfaction. The potential for high-quality care can be enhanced by the inclusion of the Bayesian framework to the basic toolkit of remote clinical assessment. When confronted with choices in terms of differential diagnosis and tests, the rigor of a simple application of the Bayesian framework can minimize costs arising from uncertainties.",2020,10.3171/2020.9.FOCUS20695,49,6,E14,eng,1092-0684,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and telemedicine and Bayes Theorem and clinical decision-making and pandemic and Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods and Telemedicine/*economics and *Social Class and *Vulnerable Populations and cost-benefit analysis and Ambulatory Surgical Procedures/*economics and Bayesian framework and COVID-19/*economics/epidemiology/therapy and Neurosurgical Procedures/*economics and Philippines/epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

Administrative data offer the unique advantage of accessing large amounts of information previously collected from a population-based sample with geographic diversity. When using administrative data sets, researchers can benefit from application of risk adjustment instruments, which help stratify patients and tailor the original sample for specific research questions. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index are 2 of the most common indices. The Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm and Clinical Classification Software are other promising tools.

In addition, it is one of the most expensive complications of ASD surgery. Risk factors contributing to pseudarthrosis in ASD have been described; however, a preoperative model predicting the development of pseudarthrosis does not exist. The goal of this study was to create a preoperative predictive model for pseudarthrosis based on demographic, radiographic, and surgical factors.METHODSA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained, multicenter ASD database was conducted. Study inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients (age <e2><89><a5> 18 years) with spinal deformity and surgery for the ASD. From among 82 variables assessed, 21 were used for model building after applying collinearity testing, redundancy, and univariable predictor importance <e2><89><a5> 0.90. Variables included demographic data along with comorbidities, modifiable surgical variables, baseline coronal and sagittal radiographic parameters, and baseline scores for health-related quality of life measures. Patients groups were determined according to their Lenke radiographic fusion type at the 2-year follow-up: bilateral or unilateral fusion (union) or pseudarthrosis (nonunion). A decision tree was constructed, and internal validation was accomplished via bootstrapped training and testing data sets. Accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the model.RESULTSA total of 336 patients were included in the study (nonunion: 105, union: 231).

However, there is wide variability in outcome after spine surgery at the individual patient level. All stakeholders in spine care will benefit from identification of the unique patient or disease subgroups that are least likely to benefit from surgery, are prone to costly complications, and have increased health care utilization. There remains a large demand for individual patient-level predictive analytics to guide decision support to optimize outcomes at the patient and population levels. METHODS One thousand eight hundred three consecutive patients undergoing spine surgery for various degenerative lumbar diagnoses were prospectively enrolled and followed for 1 year. A comprehensive patient interview and health assessment was performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after surgery. All predictive covariates were selected a priori. Eighty percent of the sample was randomly selected for model development, and 20% for model validation. Linear regression was performed with Bayesian model averaging to model 12-month ODI (Oswestry Disability Index). Logistic regression with Bayesian model averaging was used to model likelihood of complications, 30-day readmission, need for inpatient rehabilitation, and return to work. Goodness-of-fit was assessed via R(2) for 12-month ODI and via the c-statistic, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), for the categorical endpoints. Discrimination (predictive performance) was assessed, using R(2) for the ODI model and the c-statistic for the categorical endpoint models. Calibration was assessed using a plot of predicted versus observed values for the ODI model and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the categorical endpoint models. RESULTS On average, all patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were improved after surgery (ODI baseline vs 12 month: 50.4 vs 29.5%, p < 0.001). Complications occurred in 121 patients (6.6%), 108 (5.9%) were readmitted within 30 days of surgery, 188 (10.3%) required discharge to inpatient rehabilitation, 1630 (88.9%) returned to work, and 449 (24.5%) experienced an unplanned outcome (no improvement in ODI, a complication, or readmission). There were 45 unique baseline variable inputs, derived from 39 clinical variables and 38 questionnaire items (ODI, SF-12, MSPQ, VAS-BP, VAS-LP, VAS-NP), included in each model. For prediction of 12-month ODI, R(2) was 0.51 for development and 0.47 for the validation study. For prediction of a complication, readmission, inpatient rehabilitation, and return to work, AUC values ranged 0.72-0.84 for development and 0.79-0.84 for validation study. CONCLUSIONS A novel prediction model utilizing both clinical data and patient interview inputs explained the majority of variation in outcome observed after lumbar spine surgery and reliably predicted 12-month improvement in physical disability, return to work, major complications, readmission, and need for inpatient rehabilitation for individual patients. Application of these models may allow clinicians to offer spine surgery specifically to those who are most likely to benefit and least likely to incur complications and excess costs.",2015,10.3171/2015.8.FOCUS15338,39,6,E13,eng,1092-0684,predictive modeling and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Cohort Studies and Patient Satisfaction and Predictive Value of Tests and Self Report and Pain Measurement and Registries and Disability Evaluation and *Treatment Outcome and Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data and Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data and *Return to Work and patient-reported outcomes and registry and ROC = receiver operating characteristic and ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists and AUC = area under the ROC curve and Lumbosacral Region/surgery and MCID = minimum clinically important difference and *Likelihood Functions and MSPQ = Modified Somatic Performance Index and ODI = Oswesuy Disability Index and Postoperative Complications/*physiopathology and PRO = patientreported outcome and Spinal Cord Diseases/surgery and Spinal Fusion/*methods and VAS = visual analog scale and VAS-BP = VAS for back pain and VAS-LP = VAS for leg pain and VAS-NP = VAS for neck pain,NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

While hypertension facilitated by vasopressors is often initiated to prevent DCI, which vasopressor is most effective in improving outcomes is not known. The objective of this study was to determine associations between initial vasopressor choice and mortality in patients with nontraumatic SAH. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large, national electronic medical record data set from 2000-2014 to identify patients with a new diagnosis of nontraumatic SAH (based on ICD-9 codes) who were treated with the vasopressors dopamine, phenylephrine, or norepinephrine. The relationship between the initial choice of vasopressor therapy and the primary outcome, which was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care, was examined. RESULTS: In total, 2634 patients were identified with nontraumatic SAH who were treated with a vasopressor. In this cohort, the average age was 56.5 years, 63.9% were female, and 36.5% of patients developed the primary outcome. The incidence of the primary outcome was higher in those initially treated with either norepinephrine (47.6%) or dopamine (50.6%) than with phenylephrine (24.5%). After adjusting for possible confounders using propensity score methods, the adjusted OR of the primary outcome was higher with dopamine (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.70-2.81) and norepinephrine (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.80-2.80) compared with phenylephrine. Sensitivity analyses using different variable selection procedures, causal inference models, and machine-learning methods confirmed the main findings.

Jr and Ames, Christopher P. and Berven, Sigurd H. and Perra, Joseph H. and McCarthy, Richard E. and Knapp, D. Raymond Jr and Shaffrey, Christopher I.",Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,"OBJECT: Patients with varied medical comorbidities often present with spinal pathology for which operative intervention is potentially indicated, but few studies have examined risk stratification in determining morbidity and mortality rates associated with the operative treatment of spinal disorders. This study provides an analysis of morbidity and mortality data associated with 22,857 cases reported in the multicenter, multisurgeon Scoliosis Research Society Morbidity and Mortality database stratified by American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, a commonly used system to describe preoperative physical status and to predict operative morbidity. METHODS: The Scoliosis Research Society Morbidity and Mortality database was queried for the year 2007, the year in which ASA data were collected. Inclusion criterion was a reported ASA grade. Cases were categorized by operation type and disease process. Details on the surgical approach and type of instrumentation were recorded. Major perioperative complications and deaths were evaluated. Two large subgroups--patients with adult degenerative lumbar disease and patients with major deformity--were also analyzed separately. Statistical analyses were performed with the chi-square test. RESULTS: The population studied comprised 22,857 patients. Spinal disease included degenerative disease (9409 cases), scoliosis (6782 cases), spondylolisthesis (2144 cases), trauma (1314 cases), kyphosis (831 cases), and other (2377 cases). The overall complication rate was 8.4%. Complication rates for ASA Grades 1 through 5 were 5.4%, 9.0%, 14.4%, 20.3%, and 50.0%, respectively (p = 0.001). In patients undergoing surgery for degenerative lumbar diseases and major adult deformity, similarly increasing rates of morbidity were found in higher-grade patients. The mortality rate was also higher in higher-grade patients. The incidence of major complications, including wound infections, hematomas, respiratory problems, and thromboembolic events, was also greater in patients with higher ASA grades. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher ASA grades undergoing spinal surgery had significantly higher rates of morbidity than those with lower ASA grades. Given the common application of the ASA system to surgical patients, this grade may prove helpful for surgical decision making and preoperative counseling with regard to risks of morbidity and mortality.",2011,10.3171/2010.12.SPINE10486,14,4,470-474,eng,1547-5646,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Databases, Factual and Treatment Outcome and Incidence and Societies, Medical and Anesthesiology and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology and Orthopedic Procedures/*adverse effects/*mortality and Spinal Diseases/*surgery and Spine/*surgery",NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, studies on this condition have been rampant in the literature. The authors present an 11-year institutional experience with SEA patients. Additionally, through an analysis of the contemporary literature, they provide an update on the challenging and controversial nature of this increasingly encountered condition. METHODS: An electronic medical record database was used to retrospectively analyze patients admitted with SEA from January 2001 through February 2012. Presenting symptoms, concurrent conditions, microorganisms, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes were examined. For the literature search, PubMed was used as the search engine. Studies published from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2013, were critically reviewed. Data from articles on methodology, demographics, treatments, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with bacterial SEA were identified. The mean <c2><b1> SD age of patients was 63.3 <c2><b1> 13.7 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Common presenting signs and symptoms were back pain (47.1%) and focal neurological deficits (47.1%). Over 75% of SEAs were in the thoracolumbar spine, and over 50% were ventral. Approximately 34% had an infectious origin. Concurrent conditions included diabetes mellitus (35.8%), vascular conditions (31.3%), and renal insufficiency/dialysis (30.2%). The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus (70.7%), followed by Streptococcus spp. (6.6%). Surgery along with antibiotics was the treatment for 63 (59.4%) patients. Surgery involved spinal fusion for 19 (30.2%), discectomy for 14 (22.2%), and corpectomy for 9 (14.3%). Outcomes were reported objectively; at a mean <c2><b1> SD follow-up time of 8.4 <c2><b1> 26 weeks (range 0-192 weeks), outcome was good for 60.7% of patients and poor for 39.3%. The literature search yielded 40 articles, and the authors discuss the result of these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial SEA is an ominous condition that calls for early recognition. Neurological status at the time of presentation is a key factor in decision making and patient outcome. In recent years, surgical treatment has been advocated for patients with neurological deficits and failed response to medical therapy. Surgery should be performed immediately and before 36-72 hours from onset of neurological sequelae.

Panspinal imaging (preferably MRI), modern aggressive antibiotic therapy, and prompt surgical intervention remain the standard of care for all spinal axis infections including HEAs; however, the surgical decision making on timing and extent of the procedure still remain ill defined for HEAs. Decompression including skip laminectomies or laminoplasties is described, with varied clinical outcomes. In this review the authors present the illustrative cases of 2 patients with HEAs who were treated using skip laminectomies and epidural catheter irrigation techniques. The discussion highlights different management strategies including the role of conservative (nonsurgical) management in these lesions, especially with an already identified pathogen and the absence of mass effect on MRI or significant neurological defects. Among fewer than 25 case reports of HEA published in the past 25 years, the most important aspect in deciding a role for surgery is the neurological examination. Nearly 20% were treated successfully with medical therapy alone if neurologically intact. None of the reported cases had an associated cranial infection with HEA, because the dural adhesion around the foramen magnum prevented rostral spread of infection. Traditionally a posterior approach to the epidural space with irrigation is performed, unless an extensive focal ventral collection is causing cord compression. Surgical intervention for HEA should be an adjuvant treatment strategy for all acutely deteriorating patients, whereas aspiration of other infected sites like a psoas abscess can determine an infective pathogen, and appropriate antibiotic treatment may avoid surgical intervention in the neurologically intact patient.",2014,10.3171/2014.5.FOCUS14136,37,2,E11,eng,1092-0684,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Child, Preschool and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Axis, Cervical Vertebra/*pathology/*surgery and Decompression, Surgical/*methods and epidural abscess and Epidural Abscess/diagnosis/*surgery and HEA = holospinal epidural abscess and holospinal epidural abscess and skip laminectomy and spinal infection",NA,NA,2014/08//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of this study was to systematically review publications that describe the challenges and benefits of participating in neurosurgery-related training programs in LMICs in the service of individuals with NTDs. METHODS: Using MEDLINE (PubMed), the authors conducted a systematic review of English- and Spanish-language articles published from 1974 to 2019 that describe the experiences of in-country neurosurgery-related training programs in LMICs. The inclusion criteria were as follows-1) population/exposure: US residents, US neurosurgeons, and local in-country medical staff participating in neurosurgical training programs aimed at improving healthcare for individuals with NTDs; 2) comparison: qualitative studies; and 3) outcome: description of the challenges and benefits of neurosurgical training programs. Articles meeting these criteria were assessed within a global health education conceptual framework. RESULTS: Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, with the majority of the in-country neurosurgical training programs being seen in subregions of Africa (8/9 [89%]) and one in South/Central America. US-based residents and neurosurgeons who participated in global health neurosurgical training had increased exposure to rare diseases not common in the US, were given the opportunity to work with a collaborative team to educate local healthcare professionals, and had increased exposure to neurosurgical procedures involved in treating NTDs. US neurosurgeons agreed that participating in international training improved their own clinical practices but also recognized that identifying international partners, travel expenses, and interference with their current practice are major barriers to participating in global health education. In contrast, the local medical personnel learned surgical techniques from visiting neurosurgeons, had increased exposure to intraoperative decision-making, and were given guidance to improve postoperative care. The most significant challenges identified were difficulties in local long-term retention of trained fellows and staff, deficient infrastructure, and lower compensation offered for pediatric neurosurgery in comparison to adult care. CONCLUSIONS: The challenges and benefits of international neurosurgical training programs need to be considered to effectively promote the development of neurosurgical care for individuals with NTDs in LMICs.

The rates of decompression with arthrodesis versus decompression only and of simple (1- or 2-level, single-approach) versus complex (> 2-level or combined-approach) arthrodesis were analyzed by year and geographic region. These trends were further analyzed with respect to complications, length of hospital stay, payments made to the hospital, and patient discharge status. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS The proportion of patients who underwent decompression with arthrodesis compared with decompression only increased significantly and linearly from 2010 to 2014 (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.10). Arthrodesis was more likely to be complex rather than simple with each subsequent year (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.33-1.49). This trend was accompanied by an increased likelihood of postoperative complications (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.21), higher costs (payments increased by a mean of US$1633 per year; 95% CI 1327-1939), and greater likelihood of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility as opposed to home (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20). The South and Midwest regions of the US had the highest proportions of patients undergoing arthrodesis (48% and 42%, respectively). The mean length of hospital stay did not change significantly (p = 0.324). CONCLUSIONS From 2010 to 2014, the proportion of adults undergoing decompression with arthrodesis versus decompression only for the treatment of LSS increased, especially in the South and Midwest regions of the US. A greater proportion of these fusions were complex and were associated with more complications, higher costs, and a greater likelihood of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility.",2018,10.3171/2018.1.SPINE17964,29,2,169-175,eng,1547-5646,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and outcomes and trends and Incidence and Length of Stay and Lumbar Vertebrae/*surgery and CCI = Charlson Comorbidity Index and ICD-9 = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and LSS = lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar spinal stenosis and SNF = skilled nursing facility and Arthrodesis/economics/methods/*trends and complex fusion and Decompression, Surgical/economics/methods/*trends and hospital payments and Postoperative Complications/epidemiology and Spinal Stenosis/economics/epidemiology/*surgery and USD = US dollar",NA,NA,2018/08//undefined,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spine,"OBJECT: In this retrospective analysis the authors describe the assessment and outcomes of 90 patients who underwent placement of posterior instrumentation at the cervicothoracic junction following the resection of a primary or metastatic tumor during a 10-year period. METHODS: All patients underwent a posterolateral laminectomy including uni- or bilateral facetectomy, and 44 patients additionally required vertebral body resection and reconstruction. In patients who underwent C-6 or C-7 decompression, the posterior instrumentation strategies changed from the use of lateral mass plate systems (LMPSs) to lateral mass screw/rod systems (LMSRSs). Similarly, for T1-3 tumor decompression, the strategy shifted from sublaminar hook/rod systems (SHRSs) to the use of pedicle screw systems (PSSs) in which the surgeon used either a 6.25-mm rod or dual-diameter rods with or without a connector. RESULTS: The overall surgical complication rate was 19% including fixation failure in 11 patients (12%), 6 of whom required reoperation. Fixation failure rates for cervical decompression decreased from 2 (29%) of 7 patients in the LMPS group to 0 (0%) of 8 in the LMSRS group (p = 0.2). The fixation failure rates for thoracic decompression were 7 (15%) of 48 patients in the SHRS group, and there was a decrease to 2 (7%) of 27 in the PSS group (p = 0.48). Neurological and functional outcomes including American Spinal Injury Association, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and Medical Research Council muscle strength and pain scores remained stable or improved in 94, 96, 100, and 96% of patients, respectively.

Vargas_2018_Worlneur,JOUR,Initial Experiences with Artificial Neural Networks in the Detection of Computed Tomography Perfusion Deficits,"Vargas, Jan and Spiotta, Alejandro and Chatterjee, Arindram Rano",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Head computed tomography (CT) with perfusion imaging has become crucial in the selection of patients for mechanical thrombectomy. In recent years, machine learning has rapidly evolved and found applications in a wide variety of health care tasks. We report our initial experiences with training a neural network to predict the presence and laterality of a perfusion deficit in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: CT perfusion images of patients with suspicion for acute ischemic stroke were obtained. The data were split into training and validation sets. A long-term, recurrent convolutional network was constructed, which consisted of a convolutional neural network stacked on top of a long short-term memory layer. RESULTS: Of the 396 patients, 139 (35.1%) had a right-sided perfusion deficit, 199 (50.3%) had a left-sided deficit, and 58 (14.6%) had no evidence of a deficit. The best model was able to achieve an accuracy of 85.8% on validation data. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for each class, and an area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each class. For right-sided deficits, the AUC was 0.90, for left-sided deficits, the AUC was 0.96, and for no deficit, the AUC was 0.93. CONCLUSIONS: The field of machine learning, powered by convolutional neural networks for the task of image recognition and processing, has quickly developed in recent years.

Chan_2018_Neurfocu,JOUR,A scoping review on health economics in neurosurgery for acute spine trauma,"Chan, Brian C. F. and Craven, B. Catharine and Furlan, Julio C.",Neurosurgical focus,"OBJECTIVE Acute spine trauma (AST) has a relatively low incidence, but it often results in substantial individual impairments and societal economic burden resulting from the associated disability. Given the key role of neurosurgeons in the decision-making regarding operative management of individuals with AST, the authors performed a systematic search with scoping synthesis of relevant literature to review current knowledge regarding the economic burden of AST. METHODS This systematic review with scoping synthesis included original articles reporting cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, cost-minimization, cost-comparison, and economic analyses related to surgical management of AST, whereby AST is defined as trauma to the spine that may result in spinal cord injury with motor, sensory, and/or autonomic impairment. The initial literature search was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CCTR, and PubMed. All original articles captured in the literature search and published from 1946 to September 27, 2017, were included. Search terms used were the following: (cost analysis, cost effectiveness, cost benefit, economic evaluation or economic impact) AND (spine or spinal cord) AND (surgery or surgical). RESULTS The literature search captured 5770 titles, of which 11 original studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These 11 studies included 4 cost-utility analyses, 5 cost analyses that compared the cost of intervention with a comparator, and 2 studies examining direct costs without a comparator. There are a few potentially cost-saving strategies in the neurosurgical management of individuals with AST, including 1) early surgical spinal cord decompression for acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (or traumatic thoracolumbar fractures, traumatic cervical fractures); 2) surgical treatment of the elderly with type-II odontoid fractures, which is more costly but more effective than the nonoperative approach among individuals with age at AST between 65 and 84 years; 3) surgical treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures, which is implicated in greater direct costs but lower general-practitioner visit costs, private expenditures, and absenteeism costs than nonsurgical management; and 4) removal of pedicle screws 1-2 years after posterior instrumented fusion for individuals with thoracolumbar burst fractures, which is more cost-effective than retaining the pedicle screws. CONCLUSIONS This scoping synthesis underscores a number of potentially cost-saving opportunities for neurosurgeons when managing patients with AST.

METHODS: The authors identified 9 patients with persistent acromegaly following primary intervention (TSS <c2><b1> medical therapy <c2><b1> radiotherapy) in whom further surgery had initially been discounted because of equivocal MRI findings with suspected lateral sellar and/or parasellar disease (cases with clear Knosp grade 4 disease were excluded). All patients underwent Met-PET/MRCR. Scan findings were used by the pituitary multidisciplinary team to inform decision-making regarding repeat surgery. Revision TSS was performed with wide lateral exploration as guided by the PET findings. Endocrine reassessment was performed at 6-10 weeks after surgery, with longitudinal follow-up thereafter. RESULTS: Met-PET/MRCR revealed focal tracer uptake in the lateral sellar and/or parasellar region(s) in all 9 patients, which correlated with sites of suspected residual tumor on volumetric MRI. At surgery, tumor was identified and resected in 5 patients, although histological analysis confirmed somatotroph tumor in only 4 cases. In the other 4 patients, no definite tumor was seen, but equivocal tissue was removed. Despite the uncertainty at surgery, all patients showed immediate significant improvements in clinical and biochemical parameters. In the 8 patients for whom long-term follow-up data were available, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was <e2><89><a4> 1.2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in all subjects and <e2><89><a4> 1 times the ULN in 6 subjects, and these findings have been maintained for up to 28 months (median 8 months, mean 13 months) with no requirement for adjunctive medical therapy or radiotherapy.

Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Medical comorbidities, particularly preoperatively diagnosed anxiety, depression, and obesity, may influence how patients perceive and measure clinical benefit after a surgical intervention. The current study was performed to define and compare the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity who underwent spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis. METHODS: The Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients who underwent lumbar fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis during the period from January 2014 to August 2017. Collected patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), health status (EQ-5D), and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for back pain (NRS-BP) and leg pain (NRS-LP). Both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for MCID calculation were employed. RESULTS: Of 462 patients included in the prospective registry who underwent a decompression and fusion procedure, 356 patients (77.1%) had complete baseline and 12-month PRO data and were included in the study. The MCID values for ODI scores did not significantly differ in patients with and those without a preoperative diagnosis of obesity (20.58 and 20.69, respectively). In addition, the MCID values for ODI scores did not differ in patients with and without a preoperative diagnosis of anxiety or depression (24.72 and 22.56, respectively). Similarly, the threshold MCID values for NRS-BP, NRS-LP, and EQ-5D scores were not statistically different between all groups. Based on both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for determination of MCID thresholds, there were no statistically significant differences between all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: MCID thresholds were similar for ODI, EQ-5D, NRS-BP, and NRS-LP in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity undergoing spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Franzblau_2015_Joofne,JOUR,Medical treatment decision making after total avulsion brachial plexus injury: a qualitative study,"Franzblau, Lauren E. and Maynard, Mallory and Chung, Kevin C. and Yang, Lynda J.-S.",Journal of neurosurgery,"OBJECT: Complete avulsion traumatic brachial plexus injuries (BPIs) can be treated using nerve and musculoskeletal reconstruction procedures. However, these interventions are most viable within certain timeframes, and even then they cannot restore all lost function. Little is known about how patients make decisions regarding surgical treatment or what impediments they face during the decision-making process. Using qualitative methodology, the authors aimed to describe how and why patients elect to pursue or forego surgical reconstruction, identify the barriers precluding adequate information transfer, and determine whether these patients are satisfied with their treatment choices over time. METHODS: Twelve patients with total avulsion BPIs were interviewed according to a semi-structured guide. The interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using the systematic inductive techniques of grounded theory to identify key themes related to the decision-making process and long-term satisfaction with decisions. RESULTS: Four decision factors emerged from our analysis: desire to restore function, perceived value of functional gains, weighing the risks and costs of surgery, and having concomitant injuries. Lack of insurance coverage (4 patients), delayed diagnosis (3 patients), and insufficient information regarding treatment (4 patients) prevented patients from making informed decisions and accessing care. Three individuals, all of whom had decided against reconstruction, had regrets about their treatment choices. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with panplexus avulsion injuries are missing opportunities for reconstruction and often not considering the long-term outcomes of surgery. As more Americans gain health insurance coverage, it is very likely that the number of patients able to pursue reconstruction will increase. The authors recommend implementing clinical pathways to help patients meet critical points in care within the ideal timeframe and using a patient- and family-centered care approach combined with patient decision aids to foster shared decision making, increase access to information, and improve patient satisfaction with decisions. These measures could greatly benefit patients with BPI while reducing costs, improving efficiency, and generating better outcomes.",2015,10.3171/2015.2.JNS132686,122,6,1413-1420,eng,1933-0693 0022-3085,Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Qualitative Research and patient education and *Decision Making and *Reconstructive Surgical Procedures and BPI = brachial plexus injury and brachial plexus injury and Brachial Plexus Neuropathies/*surgery and Brachial Plexus/*injuries/*surgery and FFMT = functioning free-muscle transfer and medical treatment decision making and peripheral nerve and PFCC = patient- and family-centered care,NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Out of necessity we used free-to-use apps in our practice. We studied the applicability and cost effective aspect of a systematic use of these apps in neurosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed the Free-to-use apps in neurosurgery (FAN) module in 4 phases at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital over the last 3 years. We used free apps like Viber, Dropbox, Skype, and VLC media player on 3G and Wi-Fi network. Users were trained in ethics and measures to ensure confidentiality and privacy of patient-related data. Endpoints studied were feasibility, reliability, cost effectiveness, and overall satisfaction of the users. RESULTS: In the FAN module, the Viber app was used to send pictures of digital images via smartphones within 30 minutes, enabling quick decisions by the consultants. Dropbox not only helped store images but also helped quick verification of discharge summaries as early as 15 minutes increasing overall efficiency. With Skype, consultants could be contacted even when they were abroad, and with the use of FAN they remain updated of their patients. By the use of Skype and VLC media player, 2 operative live workshops from abroad were transmitted live with good visual and audio reception, allowing question-and-answer sessions with the faculties. User satisfaction was more than 90%.

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a comparative effectiveness analysis for endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement in pediatric hydrocephalus patients in the US using a large administrative claims database through the application of propensity scores matching. METHODS: The MarketScan(R) database (Truven Health Analytics, Atlanta, Georgia) 2003 to 2011 was used. Patients 19 yr or younger at first occurrence of ETV or shunt during the study period were included. The study outcome, surgery failure, was defined as further surgical treatment for hydrocephalus subsequent to initial ETV or shunt procedure. Age, etiology of hydrocephalus, and history of shunt were used to create matched samples for the ETV and shunt cohorts. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, stratified log-rank test, and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to analyze samples. RESULTS: There were 3231 eligible cases (478 ETV; 2753 shunt). Propensity scores matching produced 455 balanced pairs. For matched samples, 326 of 455 (72%) pairs were concordant, while 129 pairs were discordant in surgery outcomes within 3 mo. Among discordant pairs, ETV patients were more likely to experience surgery failure compared to patients receiving shunt (relative risk = 1.4, P value = .011). Furthermore, patients' age < 1 yr had lower ETV success rates than those with shunt (P value = .009). No similar pattern was found in patients' age <e2><89><a5> 1 yr.

Since the implementation of the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist, their use has become widespread. The aim of this review was to systematically review the state of the literature on surgical safety checklists in neurosurgery. Also, in the new era of robotics and artificial intelligence, there is a need to re-evaluate patient safety procedures in neurosurgery. A systematic review was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and MEDLINE for articles published between 2008 and 2016 using MeSH (medical subject heading) terms and keywords describing postoperative complications and surgical adverse events, and some additional searches were carried out until January 2019. Twenty-six original studies or reviews were eligible for this review. They were categorized into studies with patient-related outcomes, personnel-related outcomes, or previous reviews. Checklist use in neurosurgery was found to reduce hospital-acquired infectious complications and to enhance operating room safety culture. Checklists seem to improve patient safety in neurosurgery, although the amount of evidence is still limited.

A. and Sisti, Jonathan A. and Christophe, Brandon R. and Lord, Aaron S. and Lewis, Ariane K. and Frey, Hans-Peter and Claassen, Jan and Connolly, E. Sander Jr",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: The morbidity, mortality, and monetary cost associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is devastatingly high. Several scoring systems have been proposed to prognosticate outcomes after ICH, although the original ICH Score is still the most widely used. However, recent research suggests that systemic physiologic factors, such as those included in the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, may also influence outcome. In addition, no scoring systems to date have included premorbid functional status. Therefore, we propose a scoring system that incorporates these factors to prognosticate 3-month and 12-month functional outcomes. METHODS: We used the Random Forest machine-learning technique to identify factors from a dataset of more than 200 data points per patient that were most strongly affiliated with functional outcome. We then used linear regression to create an initial model based on these factors and modified weightings to improve accuracy. Our scoring system was compared with the ICH Score for prognosticating functional outcomes. RESULTS: Two separate scoring systems (Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project 3 [ICHOP(3)] and ICHOP(12)) were developed for 3-month and 12-month functional outcomes using Glasgow Coma Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and hematoma volume (3-month only). Patient outcomes were dichotomized into good (mRS score, 0-3) and poor (mRS score, 4-6) categories based on functional status. Areas under the curve in the derivation cohort for predicting mRS score were 0.89 (3-month) and 0.87 (12-month); both were significantly more discriminatory than the original ICH Score. CONCLUSIONS: The ICHOP scores may provide more comprehensive evaluation of a patient's long-term functional prognosis by taking into account systemic physiologic factors as well as premorbid functional status.",2017,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.02.082,101,NA,577-583,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Stroke and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Aged, 80 and over and Prognostication and Follow-Up Studies and *Severity of Illness Index and *Machine Learning/trends and *Recovery of Function/physiology and Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/*physiopathology and Functional outcome and ICH Score and Intracerebral hemorrhage",NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Spinal trauma is a major cause of disability worldwide. The burden is especially severe in low-income countries, where hospital infrastructure is poor, resources are limited, and the volume of cases is high. Currently, there are no reliable data available on incidence, management, and outcomes of spinal trauma in East Africa. The main objective of this study was to describe, for the first time, the demographics, management, costs of surgery and implants, treatment decision factors, and outcomes of patients with spine trauma in Tanzania. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data on spinal trauma patients in the single surgical referral center in Tanzania (Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute [MOI]) from October 2016 to December 2017. They collected general demographics and the following information: distance from site of trauma to the center, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), time to surgery, steroid use, and mechanism of trauma and AOSpine classification and costs. Surgical details and complications were recorded. Primary outcome was neurological status on discharge. The authors analyzed surgical outcome and determined predicting factors for positive outcome. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were included and analyzed in this study. The mean distance from site of trauma to MOI was 278.0 km, and the time to admission was on average 5.9 days after trauma. Young males were primarily affected (82.8% males, average age 35.7 years). On admission, 47.2% of patients presented with AIS grade A. Most common mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accidents (28.9%) and falls from height (32.8%). Forty percent of admitted patients underwent surgery. The mean time to surgery was 33.2 days; 21.4% of patients who underwent surgery improved in AIS grade at discharge (p = 0.030). Overall, the only factor associated with improvement in neurological status was undergoing surgery (p = 0.03) and shorter time to surgery (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the management and outcomes of spinal trauma in East Africa. Due to the lack of referral hospitals, patients are admitted late after trauma, often with severe neurological deficit. Surgery is performed but generally late in the course of hospital stay. The decision to perform surgery and timing are heavily influenced by the availability of implants and economic factors such as insurance status. Patients with incomplete deficits who may benefit most from surgery are not prioritized. The authors' results suggest that surgery may have a positive impact on patient outcome. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm our results. These results provide strong support to implement evidence-based protocols for the management of spinal trauma.",2019,10.3171/2018.12.SPINE18635,31,1,103-111,eng,1547-5646,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Tanzania and Disease Management and Length of Stay and Clinical Decision-Making and Geography, Medical and Tanzania/epidemiology and global neurosurgery and LOS = length of stay and SCI = spinal cord injury and AIS = American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and East Africa and GDP = gross domestic product and global surgery and LMICs = low- and middle-income countries and MOI = Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute and MVA = motor vehicle accident and Spinal Cord Injuries/economics/epidemiology/*therapy and Spinal Injuries/economics/epidemiology/*therapy and spine trauma and ST = spinal trauma and traumatic spinal cord injury",NA,NA,2019/04/05/,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, regulatory implementation has created a complex network of reporting requirements for physicians and medical practices. These include Medicare's Physician Quality Reporting System, Electronic Health Records Meaningful Use, and Value-Based Payment Modifier programs. The common denominator of all these initiatives is that to avoid penalties, physicians must meet ""generic"" quality standards that, in the case of neurosurgery and many other specialties, are not pertinent to everyday clinical practice and hold specialists accountable for care decisions outside of their direct control. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has recently authorized alternative quality reporting mechanisms for the Physician Quality Reporting System, which allow registries to become subspecialty-reporting mechanisms under the Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) program. These programs further give subspecialties latitude to develop measures of health care quality that are relevant to the care provided. As such, these programs amplify the power of clinical registries by allowing more accurate assessment of practice patterns, patient experiences, and overall health care value. Neurosurgery has been at the forefront of these developments, leveraging the experience of the National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database to create one of the first specialty-specific QCDRs. Recent legislative reform has continued to change this landscape and has fueled optimism that registries (including QCDRs) and other specialty-driven quality measures will be a prominent feature of federal and private sector quality improvement initiatives. These physician- and patient-driven methods will allow neurosurgery to underscore the value of interventions, contribute to the development of sustainable health care solutions, and actively participate in meaningful quality initiatives for the benefit of the patients served.",2015,10.3171/2015.8.FOCUS15354,39,6,E3,eng,1092-0684,"Humans and value and quality measures and *Quality of Health Care and *Forecasting and Neurosurgery/*methods/*trends and EHR = electronic health record and N2QOD = National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database and *Quality Assurance, Health Care/methods/trends and CEHRT = certified EHR technology and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and CMS = Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and EP = eligible professional and MACRA = Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act and MIPS = Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and NQF = National Quality Forum and Physician Quality Reporting System and PQRS = Physician Quality Reporting System and QCDR = Qualified Clinical Data Registry and Qualified Clinical Data Registry and VM = Value-Based Payment Modifier",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, no relevant data exists to accurately quantify the extent of optic apparatus compromise to further guide clinical decision-making. We aimed to assess for a possible quantitative correlation between optic chiasm geometric properties on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and VF deficits. METHODS: Visual assessments and concurrent MRI scans were retrospectively reviewed from patients treated for pituitary macroadenoma in a single medical institution. Chiasm width, chiasm minimal and maximal height, and chiasm angle were measured on MRI coronal plane images by 3 independent reviewers (for the sake of variability analysis). VF numerical summary parameters were also retrieved. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included in the final analysis. Average VF index was 70% (<c2><b1>30), and averaged mean deviation was 10.0 db (<c2><b1>9). Chiasm angle and width (which together represents the bending and stretching of the chiasm by the upward directed compression; both of which demonstrated high inter- and intraobserver agreement) showed strong correlation with VF loss. Chiasmal compression index derived from those parameters showed even stronger correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The strong correlation demonstrated by our results of this relatively simple radiologic measurement with VF status, despite the relatively small cohort, calls for further investigation in this promising direction, and may facilitate with basic assessment and clinical decision-making for patients with equivocal neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, as well as with poor compliance.",2020,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.086,143,NA,e44-e50,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Decision-Making and Visual Field Tests and Tumor Burden and Adenoma/complications/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology and Compression and Hemianopsia/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology and Nerve Compression Syndromes/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology and Optic chiasm and Optic Chiasm/*diagnostic imaging and Pituitary macroadenoma and Pituitary Neoplasms/complications/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology and Vision Disorders and Visual Fields and Visual fields deficits,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although neurosurgery has incorporated simulation-based training as a part of the training curriculum in the United Kingdom, it has yet to formally introduce NTS training. The present study, therefore, queried both neurosurgical trainees and tutors regarding how much they valued NTSs and their development. METHODS: We performed a questionnaire-based, mixed-methods study to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of both neurosurgical trainees and tutors regarding NTSs across neurosurgical centers in the United Kingdom in 2015. RESULTS: The trainees valued NTSs and their development more than did their tutor counterparts (P < 0.05, z-testing). This was evident from both the quantitative results and the qualitative data gained from the questionnaire. Various areas for potential improvement of the curriculum were also identified. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study highlight the importance of NTS development in neurosurgery.

D. and Smith, Timothy R.",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: The neurosurgery literature lacks a comprehensive report of neurosurgical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in general medical journals. RCTs published in these journals have high visibility and impact on decision-making by general medical practitioners and health care policymakers. METHODS: A systematic review of neurosurgical RCTs in the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, The BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine was completed. RESULTS: There were 78 neurosurgical RCTs published in the selected high-impact journals from 2000 to 2017. The most common study topics were neurovascular (n = 39, 50%) and spine (n = 24, 30.8%). Of these RCTs, 44 (56.4%) compared operative with nonoperative management. For studies published before 2017, the mean number of citations was 899. Approximately half of the studies showed superiority of operative management over nonoperative management in the intent to treat primary outcome of interest (n = 24, 54.5%). However, stratified by subsubspecialty, 7 (87.5%) of the functional RCTs, 9 (50%) of the neurovascular RCTs, 1 (50%) of the trauma RCTs, and 7 (43.8%) of the spinal RCTs demonstrated superiority of operative management over nonoperative management. Additionally, there were large subspecialty differences in study characteristics, such as rate of double blinding, proportion of patient enrollment from patients screened, and proportion of crossover from nonsurgical to surgical arm.

Prior studies have assessed the comparative effectiveness of ulnar and median nerve transfers for upper trunk brachial plexus injury, yet no study has examined the cost-effectiveness of this surgery to improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The authors present a cost-effectiveness model of the Oberlin nerve transfer and median nerve transfer to restore elbow flexion in the adult population with upper brachial plexus injury. METHODS Using a Markov model, the authors simulated ulnar and median nerve transfers and conservative measures in terms of neurological recovery and improvements in quality of life (QOL) for patients with upper brachial plexus injury. Transition probabilities were collected from previous studies that assessed the surgical efficacy of ulnar and median nerve transfers, complication rates associated with comparable surgical interventions, and the natural history of conservative measures. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as cost in dollars per QALY, were calculated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $50,000/QALY were considered cost-effective. One-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses were used to assess parameter uncertainty. Probabilistic sampling was used to assess ranges of outcomes across 100,000 trials. RESULTS The authors' base-case model demonstrated that ulnar and median nerve transfers, with an estimated cost of $5066.19, improved effectiveness by 0.79 QALY over a lifetime compared with conservative management. Without modeling the indirect cost due to loss of income over lifetime associated with elbow function loss, surgical treatment had an ICER of $6453.41/QALY gained. Factoring in the loss of income as indirect cost, surgical treatment had an ICER of -$96,755.42/QALY gained, demonstrating an overall lifetime cost savings due to increased probability of returning to work. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to assumptions about cost of surgery, probability of good surgical outcome, and spontaneous recovery of neurological function with conservative treatment. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that surgical intervention was cost-effective with an ICER of $18,828.06/QALY even with the authors' most conservative parameters with surgical costs at $50,000 and probability of success of 50% when considering the potential income recovered through returning to work. Probabilistic sampling demonstrated that surgical intervention was cost-effective in 76% of cases at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.

Spine,"OBJECTIVE Despite the significant incidence of rod fractures (RFs) following long-segment corrective fusion surgery, little is known about the optimal treatment strategy. The objectives of this study were to investigate the time course of clinical symptoms and treatments in patients with RFs following adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery and to establish treatment recommendations. METHODS This study was a retrospective case series of patients with RFs whose data were retrieved from a prospectively collected single-center database. The authors reviewed the cases of 304 patients (mean age 62.9 years) who underwent ASD surgery. Primary symptoms, time course of symptoms, and treatments were investigated by reviewing medical records. Standing whole-spine radiographs obtained before and after RF development and at last follow-up were evaluated. Osseous union was assessed using CT scans and intraoperative findings. RESULTS There were 54 RFs in 53 patients (mean age 68.5 years [range 41-84 years]) occurring at a mean of 21 months (range 6-47 months) after surgery. In 1 patient RF occurred twice, with each case at a different time and level, and the symptoms and treatments for these 2 RFs were analyzed separately (1 case of revision surgery and 1 case of nonoperative treatment). The overall rate of RF observed on radiographs after a minimum follow-up of 1 year was 18.0% (54 of 300 cases). The clinical symptoms at the time of RF were pain in 77.8% (42 of 54 cases) and no onset of new symptoms in 20.5% (11 of 54 cases). The pain was temporary and had subsided in 19 of 42 cases (45%) within 2 weeks. In 36 of the 54 cases (66.7%) (including the first RF in the patient with 2 RFs), patients underwent revision surgery at a mean of 116 days (range 5-888 days) after diagnosis. In 18 cases patients received only nonoperative treatment as of the last follow-up, including 17 cases in which the patients experienced no pain and no remarkable progression of deformity (mean 18.5 months after RF development). CONCLUSIONS This analysis of 54 RFs in 53 patients following corrective fusion surgery for ASD demonstrates a relationship between symptoms and alignment change. Revision surgeries were performed in a total of 36 cases. Nonoperative care was offered in 18 (33.3%) of 54 cases at the last follow-up, with no additional symptoms in 17 of the 18 cases.

Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Despite efforts toward achieving gender equality in clinical trial enrollment, females are often underrepresented, and gender-specific data analysis is often unavailable. Identifying and reducing gender bias in medical decision-making and outcome reporting may facilitate equitable healthcare delivery. Gender disparity in the utilization of surgical therapy has been exemplified in the orthopedic literature through studies of total joint arthroplasty. A paucity of literature is available to guide the management of lumbar degenerative disease, which stratifies on the basis of demographic factors. The objective of this study was to systematically map and synthesize the adult surgical literature regarding gender differences in pre- and postoperative patient-reported clinical assessment scores for patients with lumbar degenerative disease (disc degeneration, disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, and spinal canal stenosis). METHODS: A systematic scoping review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to September 2018. Study characteristics including patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and pre- and postoperative clinical assessment scores (pain, disability, and health-related quality of life [HRQoL]) were collected. RESULTS: Thirty articles were identified, accounting for 32,951 patients. Six studies accounted for 84% of patients; 5 of the 6 studies were published by European groups. The most common lumbar degenerative conditions were disc herniation (59.0%), disc degeneration (20.3%), and spinal canal stenosis (15.9%). The majority of studies reported worse preoperative pain (93.3%), disability (81.3%), and HRQoL (75%) among females. The remainder reported equivalent preoperative scores between males and females. The majority of studies (63.3%) did not report preoperative duration of symptoms, and this represents a limitation of the data. Eighty percent of studies found that females had worse absolute postoperative scores in at least one outcome category (pain, disability, or HRQoL). The remainder reported equivalent absolute postoperative scores between males and females. Seventy-three percent of studies reported either an equivalent or greater interval change for females. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients undergoing surgery for lumbar degenerative disease (disc degeneration, disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, and spinal canal stenosis) have worse absolute preoperative pain, disability, and HRQoL. Following surgery, females have worse absolute pain, disability, and HRQoL, but demonstrate an equal or greater interval change compared to males.

Kenrik",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Lumbar herniated disc is a ""preference-sensitive"" condition, in which the optimal treatment choice is crucially dependent on an informed patient's goals and values. Little is known about decisional conflict, defined as an individual's level of uncertainty regarding a decision, in patients considering treatment for lumbar herniated discs. Our work aims to identify factors associated with decisional conflict and areas for improved shared decision making. METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients seeking treatment for a lumbar herniated disc at L4-L5 and/or L5-S1 with a physician at the UCLA Spine Center. Decisional conflict was measured using the validated SURE questionnaire. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic analysis to identify predictors of decisional conflict. RESULTS: Among the 174 participants surveyed, 47% reported experiencing decisional conflict and 44% changed their treatment preference after the visit, with 61% of these opting for more invasive treatment. Participants with decisional conflict were less satisfied with their treatment decision (P < 0.001) and less willing to recommend their physician (P = 0.003) and physician's medical group to others (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that participants were more likely to experience decisional conflict if they consulted with a physiatrist compared with a surgeon (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; P = 0.019) and if they did not feel able to discuss the various treatment options with the doctor during the visit (OR, 8.5; P < 0.001).

CD was defined as at least one of the following: cervical kyphosis (C2-7 Cobb angle > 10<c2><b0>), cervical scoliosis (coronal Cobb angle > 10<c2><b0>), C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (cSVA) > 4 cm, or chin-brow vertical angle (CBVA) > 25<c2><b0>. Patients were categorized based on having an overall poor outcome or not. Health-related quality of life measures consisted of Neck Disability Index (NDI), EQ-5D, and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale scores. A poor outcome was defined as having all 3 of the following categories met: 1) radiographic poor outcome: deterioration or severe radiographic malalignment 1 year postoperatively for cSVA or T1 slope-cervical lordosis mismatch (TS-CL); 2) clinical poor outcome: failing to meet the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for NDI or having a severe mJOA Ames modifier; and 3) complications/reoperation poor outcome: major complication, death, or reoperation for a complication other than infection. Univariate logistic regression followed by multivariate regression models was performed, and internal validation was performed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: In total, 89 patients with CD were included (mean age 61.9 years, female sex 65.2%, BMI 29.2 kg/m2). By 1 year postoperatively, 18 (20.2%) patients were characterized as having an overall poor outcome. For radiographic poor outcomes, patients' conditions either deteriorated or remained severe for TS-CL (73% of patients), cSVA (8%), horizontal gaze (34%), and global SVA (28%). For clinical poor outcomes, 80% and 60% of patients did not reach MCID for EQ-5D and NDI, respectively, and 24% of patients had severe symptoms (mJOA score 0-11). For the complications/reoperation poor outcome, 28 patients experienced a major complication, 11 underwent a reoperation, and 1 had a complication-related death. Of patients with a poor clinical outcome, 75% had a poor radiographic outcome; 35% of poor radiographic and 37% of poor clinical outcome patients had a major complication. A poor outcome was predicted by the following combination of factors: osteoporosis, baseline neurological status, use of a transition rod, number of posterior decompressions, baseline pelvic tilt, T2-12 kyphosis, TS-CL, C2-T3 SVA, C2-T1 pelvic angle (C2 slope), global SVA, and number of levels in maximum thoracic kyphosis. The final model predicting a poor outcome (AUC 86%) included the following: osteoporosis (OR 5.9, 95% CI 0.9-39), worse baseline neurological status (OR 11.4, 95% CI 1.8-70.8), baseline pelvic tilt > 20<c2><b0> (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.98), > 9 levels in maximum thoracic kyphosis (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.1-4.1), preoperative C2-T3 SVA > 5.4 cm (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.9-1.1), and global SVA > 4 cm (OR 3.2, 95% CI 0.09-10.3). CONCLUSIONS: Of all CD patients in this study, 20.2% had a poor overall outcome, defined by deterioration in radiographic and clinical outcomes, and a major complication. Additionally, 75% of patients with a poor clinical outcome also had a poor radiographic outcome. A poor overall outcome was most strongly predicted by severe baseline neurological deficit, global SVA > 4 cm, and including more of the thoracic maximal kyphosis in the construct.",2019,10.3171/2019.7.SPINE18651,32,2,182-190,eng,1547-5646,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and predictive analytics and Prospective Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Quality of Life and Posture/physiology and AUC = area under the curve and Cervical Vertebrae/*surgery and MCID = minimum clinically important difference and complications and PT = pelvic tilt and sagittal malalignment and SVA = sagittal vertical axis and CBVA = chin-brow vertical angle and CD = cervical deformity and cervical deformity and CL = C2-7 lordosis and cSVA = C2-7 SVA and Kyphosis/surgery and Lordosis/*surgery and mJOA = modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association and NDI = Neck Disability Index and PI-LL = mismatch between pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis and poor outcome and Scoliosis/*surgery and Thoracic Vertebrae/surgery and TS-CL = mismatch between T1 slope and CL",NA,NA,2019/11/01/,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA
Samuel_2018_Worlneur,JOUR,Canadian Neurosurgery Educators' Views on Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Residency Training,"Samuel, Nardin and Philteos, Justine and Alotaibi, Naif M. and Ahuja, Christopher and Mansouri, Alireza and Kulkarni, Abhaya V.",World neurosurgery,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing prominence of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in treating intracranial and spinal pathologies, there is currently a dearth of exposure to this modality in the neurosurgical residency. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to assess neurosurgery educators' views regarding the current state of SRS exposure, and to identify potential approaches to improve residency education in this domain. METHODS: Qualitative thematic analysis and constructivist grounded theory methodology were employed. Semistructured telephone-based interviews were conducted with current or past residency program directors, as well as current departmental chairs across neurosurgical departments in Canada. Interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis using open and axial coding. RESULTS: Of the 34 eligible participants, the overall response rate was 41.1% (14/34), with a 35.3% participation rate (12/34). Participants represented 9 of the 12 Canadian institutions surveyed. The majority of participants were current program directors (n = 8), followed by past program directors (n = 2), and departmental chairs (n = 2). Most respondents 75% (9/12) view an increasing role for SRS in neurosurgery. Unanimously, respondents endorse greater exposure to SRS during residency through formal residency rotations and engagement in interdisciplinary tumor boards to facilitate involvement in clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically collate neurosurgery educators' views on SRS in residency in Canada and demonstrates recognition of the discordance between SRS in practice and residency training. Neurosurgery educators broadly endorse increased exposure to this modality. Future work is needed to delineate the requirements necessary to achieve adequate competency in SRS.",2018,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.019,112,NA,e208-e215,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Canada and Internship and Residency and *Education, Medical, Graduate and Neurosurgery/*education and Competency-based medical education and Neurosurgery residency and Radiosurgery/*education and Residency training and Stereotactic radiosurgery",NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Breshears_2020_Neur,JOUR,Residual Tumor Volume and Location Predict Progression After Primary Subtotal Resection of Sporadic Vestibular Schwannomas: A Retrospective Volumetric Study,"Breshears, Jonathan D. and Morshed, Ramin A. and Molinaro, Annette M. and McDermott, Michael W. and Cheung, Steven W. and Theodosopoulos, Philip V.",Neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Preservation of functional integrity during vestibular schwannoma surgery has become critical in the era of patient-centric medical decision-making. Subtotal tumor removal is often necessary when dense adhesions between the tumor and critical structures are present. However, it is unclear what the rate of tumor control is after subtotal resection (STR) and what factors are associated with recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of residual tumor growth after STR and identify clinical and radiographic predictors of tumor progression. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective study was performed on all sporadic vestibular schwannomas that underwent surgical resection between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2015. Clinical charts, pathology, radiology, and operative reports were reviewed. Volumetric analysis was performed on all pre- and postoperative MR imaging. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of the primary endpoint of tumor progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare progression free survival between 2 groups of residual tumor volumes and location. RESULTS: In this cohort of 66 patients who underwent primary STR, 30% had documented progression within a median follow up period of 3.1 yr. Greater residual tumor volume (OR 2.0 [1.1-4.0]) and residual disease within the internal auditory canal (OR 3.7 [1.0-13.4]) predicted progression on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: These longitudinal data provide insight into the behavior of residual tumor, helping clinicians to determine if and when STR is an acceptable surgical strategy and to anchor expectations during shared medical decision-making consultation with patients.",2020,10.1093/neuros/nyz200,86,3,410-416,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Disease Progression and Tumor Burden and Internal auditory canal and Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality and Neoplasm, Residual/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery and Neuroma, Acoustic/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery and Subtotal resection and Vestibular schwannoma and Volumetric analysis",NA,NA,2020/03/01/,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasing health costs and an aging population will make this issue even more crucial in the future. METHODS: We reviewed the number of spinal procedures performed by neurosurgeons in Belgium between 2000 and 2005. During this period, the number of lumbar spinal operations for degenerative spinal diseases has increased by 20%, reaching more than 23,000 operations per year, among which 77% were decompressive surgeries, 43% posterior fusions, and 50% anterior fusions, all done by neurosurgeons. The neurosurgical prevalence is even more striking in cervical or intradural procedures. CONCLUSION: As a result we created a neurosurgical spine society to represent neurosurgeons who were otherwise almost absent from the political decision-making processes. These observations, not unique to Belgium, should encourage colleagues to play a pivotal role in all spine-related discussions with healthcare providers, state or private, to get involved in teaching spinal surgery, and to participate in clinical and laboratory research leading to the publications that are essential to put forward the contribution of neurosurgeons in spinal surgery.",2010,10.1016/j.wneu.2010.03.023,74,4-5,422-424,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and History, 21st Century and Belgium and Neurosurgery/*history and Neurosurgical Procedures/*history and Societies, Medical/*history and Spinal Diseases/*history and Surgery Department, Hospital/*history",NA,NA,2010/11//Oct undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spine,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a progressive degenerative pathology that frequently affects older individuals and causes spinal cord compression with symptoms of neck pain, radiculopathy, and weakness. Anterior decompression and fusion is the primary intervention to prevent neurological deterioration; however, in severe cases, circumferential decompression and fusion is necessary. Published data regarding perioperative morbidity associated with these complex operations are scarce. In this study, the authors sought to add to this important body of literature by documenting a large single-surgeon experience of single-session circumferential cervical decompression and fusion. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to identify intended single-stage anterior-posterior or posterior-anterior-posterior cervical spine decompression and fusion surgeries performed by the primary surgeon (V.C.T.) at Rush University Medical Center between 2009 and 2016. Cases in which true anterior-posterior cervical decompression and fusion was not performed (i.e., those involving anterior-only, posterior-only, or delayed circumferential fusion) were excluded from analysis. Data including standard patient demographic information, comorbidities, previous surgeries, and intraoperative course, along with postoperative outcomes and complications, were collected and analyzed. Perioperative morbidity was recorded during the 90 days following surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (29 male and 43 female, mean age 57.6 years) were included in the study. Fourteen patients (19.4%) were active smokers, and 56.9% had hypertension, the most common comorbidity. The most common clinical presentation was neck pain in 57 patients (79.2%). Twenty-three patients (31.9%) had myelopathy, and 32 patients (44.4%) had undergone prior cervical spine surgery. Average blood loss was 613 ml. Injury to the vertebral artery was encountered in 1 patient (1.4%). Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was observed in 2 patients (2.8%). Two patients (2.8%) had transient unilateral hand grip weakness. There were no permanent neurological deficits. Dysphagia was encountered in 45 patients (62.5%) postoperatively, with 23 (32%) requiring nasogastric parenteral nutrition and 9 (12.5%) patients ultimately undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Nine of the 72 patients required a tracheostomy. The incidence of pneumonia was 6.9% (5 patients) overall, and 2 of these patients were in the tracheostomy group. Superficial wound infections occurred in 4 patients (5.6%). Perioperative death occurred in 1 patient. Reoperation was necessary in 10 patients (13.9%). Major perioperative complications (permanent neurological deficit, vascular injury, tracheostomy, PEG tube, stroke, or death) occurred in 30.6% of patients. The risk of minor perioperative complications (temporary deficit, dysphagia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or wound infection) was 80.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Single-session anterior-posterior cervical decompression and fusion is an inherently morbid operation required in select patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. In this large single-surgeon series, there was a major perioperative complication risk of 30.6% and minor perioperative complication risk of 80.6%. This overall elevated risk for postoperative complications must be carefully considered and discussed with the patient preoperatively. In some situations, shared decision making may lead to the conclusion that a procedure of lesser magnitude may be more appropriate.",2019,10.3171/2019.6.SPINE198,NA,NA,1-6,eng,1547-5646,fusion and dysphagia and complication and cervical and CLT = cuff-leak test and COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and CSM = cervical spondylotic myelopathy and decompression and DVT = deep vein thrombosis and PE = pulmonary embolism and PEG = percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and perioperative and RLN = recurrent laryngeal nerve and UTI = urinary tract infection,NA,NA,2019/09/20/,J Neurosurg Spine,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS Using the National Inpatient Sample database, the authors performed a retrospective cohort study that involved patients who underwent surgery for an intradural spinal tumor between 2002 and 2011. Using national estimates, they identified associations of patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and hospital characteristics with inpatient postoperative outcomes. In addition, the effect of hospital volume on unfavorable outcomes was investigated. Hospitals that performed fewer than 14 resections in adult patients with an intradural spine tumor between 2002 and 2011 were labeled as low-volume centers, whereas those that performed 14 or more operations in that period were classified as high-volume centers (HVCs). These cutoffs were based on the median number of resections performed by hospitals registered in the National Inpatient Sample during the study period. RESULTS Overall, 18,297 patients across 774 hospitals in the United States underwent surgery for an intradural spine tumor. The mean age of the cohort was 56.53 <c2><b1> 16.28 years, and 63% were female. The inpatient postoperative risks included mortality (0.3%), discharge to rehabilitation (28.8%), prolonged length of stay (> 75th percentile) (20.0%), high-end hospital charges (> 75th percentile) (24.9%), wound complications (1.2%), cardiac complications (0.6%), deep vein thrombosis (1.4%), pulmonary embolism (2.1%), and neurological complications, including durai tears (2.4%). Undergoing surgery at an HVC was significantly associated with a decreased chance of inpatient mortality (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.16-0.98), unfavorable discharge (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.98), prolonged length of stay (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.62-0.77), high-end hospital charges (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.60-0.74), neurological complications (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.26-0.44), deep vein thrombosis (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.94), wound complications (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41-0.86), and gastrointestinal complications (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46-0.92). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study provide individualized estimates of the risks of postoperative complications based on patient demographics and comorbidities and hospital characteristics and shows a decreased risk for most unfavorable outcomes for those who underwent surgery at an HVC. These findings could be used as a tool for risk stratification, directing presurgical evaluation, assisting with surgical decision making, and strengthening referral systems for complex cases.",2015,10.3171/2015.5.FOCUS15157,39,2,E4,eng,1092-0684,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Databases, Factual and Cohort Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Comorbidity and Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data and NIS = National Inpatient Sample and Inpatients/*statistics & numerical data and spine surgery and LOS = length of stay and CCI = Charlson Comorbidity Index and Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data and HCUP = Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and DVT = deep vein thrombosis and PE = pulmonary embolism and ARF = acute renal failure and CAD = coronary artery disease and CHF = congestive heart failure and CRF = chronic renal failure and DM = diabetes mellitus and HVC = high-volume center and ICD-9-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and intradural spine tumors and LVC = low-volume center and National Inpatient Sample and NF = neurofibromatosis and NF-1, -2 = NF Type 1, Type 2 and NIS and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/*mortality and PVD = peripheral vascular disease and SCT = spinal cord tumor and Spinal Cord Neoplasms/rehabilitation/*surgery and unfavorable outcomes",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,Neurosurg Focus,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the last 10 years, there has been significant progress in applying this technology to medical applications. We present a case of osteogenesis imperfecta in which treatment was aided by prospectively using patient-specific, anatomically accurate 3D prints of the calvaria. The patient-specific, anatomically accurate 3D prints were used in the clinic and in the operating room to augment patient education, improve surgical decision making, and enhance preoperative planning. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman with osteogenesis imperfecta and an extensive neurosurgical history presented for cranioplasty revision. Computed tomography (CT) data obtained as part of routine preoperative imaging were processed into a 3D model. The 3D patient-specific models were used in the clinic for patient education and in the operating room for preoperative visualization, planning, and intraoperative evaluation of anatomy. The patient reported the 3D models improved her understanding and comfort with the planned surgery when compared with discussing the procedure with the neurosurgeon or viewing the CT images with a neuroradiologist. The neurosurgeon reported an improved understanding of the patient's anatomy and potential cause of patient symptoms as well as improved preoperative planning compared with viewing the CT imaging alone. The neurosurgeon also reported an improvement in the planned surgical approach with a better intraoperative visualization and confirmation of the regions of planned calvarial resection.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically develop a comprehensive model for predicting retreatment with various types of endovascular treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records that were prospectively collected for 305 patients who received endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms from 2007 to 2013. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on candidate predictors identified by univariable screening analysis to detect independent predictors of retreatment. A composite risk score was constructed based on the proportional contribution of independent predictors in the multivariable model. RESULTS: Size (>10 mm), aneurysm rupture, stent assistance, and posttreatment degree of aneurysm occlusion were independently associated with retreatment, whereas intraluminal thrombosis and flow diversion demonstrated a trend toward retreatment. The Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale was constructed by assigning the following weights to statistically and clinically significant predictors: aneurysm-specific factors: size (>10 mm), 2 points; rupture, 2 points; presence of thrombus, 2 points. Treatment-related factors were stent assistance, -1 point; flow diversion, -2 points; Raymond Roy occlusion class 2, 1 point; Raymond Roy occlusion class 3, 2 points. This scale demonstrated good discrimination with a C-statistic of 0.799. CONCLUSION: Surgical decision making and patient-centered informed consent require comprehensive and accessible information on treatment efficacy.

Accordingly, it has stressed health systems worldwide, leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding health care resource rationing. It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging patients for emergent and elective spine surgery. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling. RESULTS: The devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurologic status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a high-risk postoperative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden. The resultant calculator was deployed as a freely available Web-based calculator (https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/SpineUrgencyCalculator/).

The authors describe their experience with incorporation of two neurosurgical skills simulation modules into the dedicated resident training curriculum of a single ACGME-accredited training program, using lumbar dural repair (5) and posterior cervical laminoforaminotomy modules from the CNS simulation initiative (6). METHODS: Each of the available 22 neurosurgery residents at a single residency program was given two 20-question pretests for a cervical laminoforaminotomy and durotomy repair module as a basic test of regional anatomy, general disease knowledge, surgical decision making, and recently published literature. This was followed by a faculty-directed skills simulation course and concluded with a final 20 question post-test. RESULTS: Posterior cervical laminoforaminotomy was performed once by each resident, and grading was conducted using the predetermined OSATs. The overall score was 56.1 (70%, range 26-76, maximum 80 points) with a trend towards higher scores with advanced levels of training. All residents completed the durotomy repair OSATs for a total of three trials. Of a maximum composite score of 60, a mean 37.2 (62%, range 15-58) was scored by the residents (Table 3). The mean OSAT scores for each durotomy trial was 2.66, 3.15, and 3.48 on each success test. A trend towards higher scores in advanced years of training was observed, but did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3). CONCLUSIONS: Duty hour limitations and regulatory pressure for enhanced quality and outcomes may limit access of neurosurgical residents to fundamental skills training.

Although numerous TBI prognostic models have been developed, none are widely used in clinical practice, largely because of a lack of feasibility research to inform implementation. We previously developed a prognostic model and Web-based application for in-hospital TBI care in low-resource settings. In this study, we tested the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the application with potential end-users. METHODS: We performed our feasibility assessment with providers involved in TBI care at both a regional and national referral hospital in Uganda. We collected qualitative and quantitative data on decision support needs, application ease of use, and implementation design. RESULTS: We completed 25 questionnaires on potential uses of the app and 11 semistructured feasibility interviews. Top-cited uses were informing the decision to operate, informing the decision to send the patient to intensive care, and counseling patients and relatives. Participants affirmed the potential of the application to support difficult triage situations, particularly in the setting of limited access to diagnostics and interventions, but were hesitant to use this technology with end-of-life decisions. Although all participants were satisfied with the application and agreed that it was easy to use, several expressed a need for this technology to be accessible by smartphone and offline.

OBJECTIVE: To study the complications and resource use associated with adult CM-1 surgery using administrative data. METHODS: We used a recently validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code algorithm to retrospectively study adult CM-1 surgeries from 2004 to 2010 in California, Florida, and New York using State Inpatient Databases. Outcomes included complications and resource use within 30 and 90 days of treatment. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for morbidity and negative binomial models to determine risk-adjusted costs. RESULTS: We identified 1947 CM-1 operations. Surgical complications were more common than medical complications at both 30 days (14.3% vs 4.4%) and 90 days (18.7% vs 5.0%) postoperatively. Certain comorbidities were associated with increased morbidity; for example, hydrocephalus increased the risk for surgical (odds ratio [OR] = 4.51) and medical (OR = 3.98) complications. Medical but not surgical complications were also more common in older patients (OR = 5.57 for oldest vs youngest age category) and male patients (OR = 3.19). Risk-adjusted hospital costs were $22530 at 30 days and $24852 at 90 days postoperatively. Risk-adjusted 90-day costs were more than twice as high for patients experiencing surgical ($46264) or medical ($65679) complications than for patients without complications ($18880). CONCLUSION: Complications after CM-1 surgery are common, and surgical complications are more frequent than medical complications. Certain comorbidities and demographic characteristics are associated with increased risk for complications. Beyond harming patients, complications are also associated with substantially higher hospital costs.

Here, the authors compared demographic variables, aneurysm-related variables, and comorbidities in patients who received microsurgical or endovascular treatment and those who were conservatively managed to determine which factors push the surgeon toward recommending treatment. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm at their institution between January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2016. These patients were dichotomized based on whether their aneurysm was treated. Demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, comorbidity, and aneurysm-related information was analyzed to assess which factors were associated with the decision to treat. RESULTS A total of 424 patients were identified, 163 who were treated surgically or endovascularly and 261 who were managed conservatively. In a multivariable model, an age < 65 years (OR 2.913, 95% CI 1.298-6.541, p = 0.010), a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.536, 95% CI 1.274-1.855, p < 0.001), a larger aneurysm size (OR 1.176, 95% CI 1.100-1.257, p < 0.001), multiple aneurysms (OR 2.093, 95% CI 1.121-3.907, p = 0.020), a white race (OR 2.288, 95% CI 1.245-4.204, p = 0.008), and living further from the medical center (OR 2.125, 95% CI 1.281-3.522, p = 0.003) were all associated with the decision to treat rather than observe. CONCLUSIONS Whereas several factors were expected to be considered in the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms, including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, aneurysm size, and multiple aneurysms, other factors such as race and proximity to the medical center were unanticipated.

Despite having been endorsed by major medical journals and shown to improve the quality of reported trials, neurosurgical journals have yet to formally adopt these reporting criteria. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality and reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in neurosurgery and the factors that may affect the quality of reported trials. METHODS: The authors evaluated all neurosurgical RCTs published in 2006 and 2007 in the principal neurosurgical journals (Journal of Neurosurgery; Neurosurgery; Surgical Neurology; Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry; and Acta Neurochirurgica) and in 3 leading general medical journals (Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine). Randomized controlled trials that addressed operative decision making or the treatment of neurosurgical patients were included in this analysis. The RCT quality was evaluated using the Jadad score and the CONSORT checklist. RESULTS: In 2006 and 2007, 27 RCTs relevant to intracranial neurosurgery were reported. Of these trials, only 59% had a Jadad score <e2><89><a5> 3. The 3 major medical journals all endorsed the CONSORT guidelines, while none of the neurosurgical journals have adopted these guidelines. Randomized controlled trials published in the 3 major medical journals had a significantly higher mean CONSORT score (mean 41, range 39-44) compared with those published in neurosurgical journals (mean 26.4, range 17-38; p < 0.0001). Jadad scores were also significantly higher for the major medical journals (mean 3.42, range 2-5) than neurosurgical journals (mean 2.45, range 1-5; p = 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack rates in a cohort of patients with symptomatic >50% intracranial stenosis in whom intracranial angioplasty and stent placement was initially deferred. METHODS: All patients presenting to 2 academic hospitals with symptomatic intracranial disease between 2006 and 2008 who underwent catheter angiography were identified. Patients with complete intracranial occlusion or stenosis less than 50% stenosis were excluded (n = 14). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients met the study criteria. Sixteen (52%) patients were on antiplatelet medications at the time of the initial event, and 2 patients were also on anticoagulant medications. Six patients (19%) underwent intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement with their initial diagnostic angiogram. Twenty-five patients (81%) had endovascular treatment deferred for best medical treatment in the interim period.

Despite its emerging role in both clinical medicine and public policy, many neurosurgeons are unaware of the history of CER, the principles fundamental to its implementation, and the nature and extent to which it impacts patient care. We present a review of literature that provides a brief history of the evolution of CER, an overview of its scientific, financial, and public policy implications, and a discussion of its implementation and potential significance in modern clinical practice. We discuss how CER seeks to combine treatment efficacy data with quality of life, outcomes, and other forms of effectiveness data to guide selection of optimal patient management strategies. This research paradigm strengthens the final step in clinical research that should follow the traditional demonstration of efficacy and reemphasizes the potentially important role of observational and retrospective investigations in establishing effectiveness of efficacious procedures in actual application to individual patients. It is useful for neurosurgeons to understand the CER model, because it occupies an emerging role in both clinical medicine and public policy and presents a potentially useful model for informing medical decision-making in the type of real-world situations commonly encountered by clinical neurosurgeons.",2012,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182320a9e,70,2,425-434; discussion 434,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,"Humans and Models, Neurological and *Comparative Effectiveness Research",NA,NA,2012/02//undefined,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA

Robinson_2020_Worlneur,JOUR,Regional Variation in the Management of Nontraumatic Subdural Hematomas Across the United States,"Robinson, David and Khoury, Jane C. and Kleindorfer, Dawn",World neurosurgery,"BACKGOUND: Nontraumatic subdural hematomas are a common indication for inpatient hospitalization in the United States, yet there is little high-quality evidence regarding which patients should receive surgical or medical treatment. We sought to assess variation in surgical management and medical treatment with steroids for nontraumatic subdural hematomas across the United States. METHODS: Using the Premier database, we analyzed patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of nontraumatic subdural hematoma in 2014. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure codes were used to identify patients who underwent surgical management, and pharmacy data were used to identify patients treated with dexamethasone. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine the association of age, race, sex, academic versus nonacademic center, and regions of the United States with conservative or surgical management. RESULTS: There were 3915 inpatient hospitalizations for nontraumatic subdural hematomas in 2014 in the Premier database, of whom 1860 (47.5%) underwent surgery, and 360 (9.2%) underwent treatment with dexamethasone, either as a primary treatment or as an adjuvant to surgery. Older age, female sex, and being managed outside of the Western U.S. region were associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing surgical management on multivariable analysis; only younger age was associated with a greater likelihood of being treated with dexamethasone.

METHODS: To identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality or vegetative state in a geriatric population and calculate an intuitive scoring system, we screened 480 patients after TBI treated at a single department of neurosurgery over a 2-year period. We analyzed data of 214 consecutive patients aged <e2><89><a5>65 years, including demographics, medical history, cause and time of injury, neurologic state, radiologic reports, and laboratory results. A predictive model was developed using logistic regression modeling with a backward stepwise feature selection. RESULTS: The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission was 14 (interquartile range, 12-15), whereas the 30-day mortality or vegetative state rate amounted to 23.4%. Starting with 20 predefined features, the final prediction model highlighted the importance of GCS motor score (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.32); presence of comorbid cardiac, pulmonary, or renal dysfunction or malignancy (OR, 2.86; 9 5% CI, 1.08-7.61); platelets <e2><89><a4>100 * 10(9) cells/L (OR, 13.60; 95% CI, 3.33-55.49); and red blood cell distribution width coefficient of variation <e2><89><a5>14.5% (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.09-7.78). The discovered coefficients were used for nomogram development. It was further simplified to facilitate clinical use. The proposed scoring system, Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score (eTBI Score), yielded similar performance metrics.

The act of making a recommendation can alter the clinical course being taken. The authors sought to understand this dynamic across different neurosurgical scenarios by examining how neurosurgeons value the procedures that they offer. METHODS: The authors conducted an online survey using the Congress of Neurological Surgeons listserv in May 2013. Respondents were randomized to answer either as the surgeon or as the patient. Questions encompassed an array of distinct neurosurgical scenarios. Data on practice parameters and experience levels were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 534 survey responses, 279 responded as the ""neurosurgeon"" and 255 as the ""patient."" For both vestibular schwannoma and arteriovenous malformation management, more respondents chose resection for their patient but radiosurgery for themselves (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Aneurysm coiling was chosen more often than clipping, but those whose practice was <e2><89><a5> 30% open cerebrovascular neurosurgery were less likely to choose coiling. Overall, neurosurgeons who focus predominantly on tumors were more aggressive in managing the glioma, vestibular schwannoma, arteriovenous malformation, and trauma. Neurosurgeons more than 10 years out of residency were less likely to recommend surgery for management of spinal pain, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, and trauma scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of cases, altering the role of the surgeon did not change the decision to pursue treatment. In certain clinical scenarios, however, neurosurgeons chose treatment options for themselves that were different from what they would have chosen for (or recommended to) their patients. For the management of vestibular schwannomas, arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and hypertensive hemorrhages, responses favored less invasive interventions when the surgeon was the patient. These findings are likely a result of cognitive biases, previous training, experience, areas of expertise, and personal values.",2015,10.3171/2014.11.JNS14400,122,3,678-691,eng,1933-0693 0022-3085,Humans and Data Collection and survey and Physician's Role and surgery and cognitive biases and Attitude of Health Personnel and Patients/psychology and medical decision making and Brain Neoplasms/surgery and Radiosurgery and IVH = intraventricular hemorrhage and clinical care and brain tumor and Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods and Surgeons/*psychology and Pain/surgery and ACoA = anterior communicating artery and AVM = arteriovenous malformation and observation and PGY = postgraduate year and PT>10 = more than 10 years posttraining and PT1-5 = 1-5 years posttraining and PT5-10 = 5-10 years posttraining and radiosurgery and Wounds and Injuries/surgery,NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old male without any previous medical history presented with Hakim triad. Imaging showed a calcified lesion of the posterior third ventricle with hydrocephalus. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed. Endoscopic removal or debulking of the lesion was impossible due to its rock-hard consistency, and thus the procedure was aborted after biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: When encountering such calcified lesions within the ventricular system, especially in proximity to eloquent regions, the decision making process should include the hard consistency and parenchymal adhesions as obstacles to neuroendoscopic removal. Even for biopsy, a higher morbidity rate compared with typical soft tumors should be assumed. Although data on intraventricular CAPNON is limited, biopsy of the lesion and treatment of associated hydrocephalus appear to be the primary neurosurgical goals, followed by imaging surveillance.",2020,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.02.126,138,NA,481-484,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Biopsy and Ventriculostomy and Calcification and Calcinosis/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery and Cerebral Ventricle Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery and Diplopia and Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure/diagnostic imaging/etiology/surgery and Hydrocephalus/diagnostic imaging/etiology/surgery and Neuroendoscopy/*methods and Normal pressure hydrocephalus and Third Ventricle/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Ventricular tumor",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to primarily stratify and compare degree of occlusion per treatment modality in basilar apex aneurysms. Secondary outcomes were retreatment, posttreatment hemorrhage, and procedure-related complications. METHODS: Medical literature including MEDLINE and EMBASE database was searched. We performed metaregressions, bias analysis, and fail-safe N. We controlled for the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Data from eligible studies (N = 12) and study center patients (n = 117) were pooled for a total of 396 nonduplicated patients. Stent-assisted coiling had a lower rate of retreatment (17% vs. 24%) and higher rate of posttreatment hemorrhage (5% vs. 3%) compared with coiling. Stent-assisted coiling had a higher rate of complete occlusion (55% vs. 45%) and a lower rate of residual aneurysm (15% vs. 23%) compared with coiling. Comparative analyses were performed. Microsurgical technique remained the most morbid treatment modality with the best rate of complete occlusion (93%) and lowest rates of rehemorrhage (2%) and retreatment (5%).

In low-resource settings, where neurosurgical capacity is diminished through fewer human and technological resources, neurosurgeons may not be prepared to operate on aneurysm cases in emergent situations. We report a patient presented with aneurysmal SAH in rural Iran, creating the dilemma of the will for the neurosurgeon. We discuss the impact of the knowledge of neurosurgical anatomy on the resolution of this dilemma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old female presented with aneurysmal SAH to a remote medical facility in rural Iran. A safe and fast referral to a nearby vascular neurosurgery center was not available. A contrasted computed tomography (the only available imaging modality) revealed a carotid bifurcation aneurysm. The situation was explained to the patient and family, and they decided to proceed with surgery. With the minimum technical radiological and surgical equipment available, the surgeon managed to successfully treat the patient, aided by his mastery of the neurosurgical anatomy.

Jha_2019_Worlneur,JOUR,Arterial Sling Decompression for Hemifacial Spasm,"Jha, R. Tushar and Kumar, Jay and Pressman, Elliot and Agazzi, Siviero",World neurosurgery,"Hemifacial spasm is a cranial nerve compression syndrome caused by impingement on the facial nerve most frequently by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. It can be treated with microvascular decompression (MVD) to separate the nerve from the offending artery. Rarely, a large-caliber vessel such as a dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar system may be implicated, requiring more than an MVD. One technique involves placing a sling around the offending vessel to decompress the facial nerve. We find our ""neck-tie"" technique to be unique and present it in this detailed video. A 36-year-old-woman presented with a 3-month history of severe left hemifacial spasm refractory to medical management. Imaging demonstrated compression of the left facial nerve and its root entry zone by a dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar complex and anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A left retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed. A Dacron sling was placed around the offending vertebral artery in a ""neck-tie"" fashion. This sling was used to displace the vertebral artery off of the facial nerve and the sling was then sutured in its final position to the petrous dura. In addition, MVD was performed around the facial nerve's root entry zone. Following sling placement and MVD, neuromonitoring demonstrated absence of abnormal motor responses. Postoperative course was uneventful, she remained neurologically intact, and she remained free of symptoms at 6 months' follow-up.

Darsaut_2019_Worlneur,JOUR,Reporting Interim Results Can Show the Feasibility of Practicing Outcome-Based Neurovascular Care Within Randomized Trials: An Opinion,"Darsaut, Tim E. and Fahed, Robert and Raymond, Jean",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Randomized trials of commonly performed surgical interventions are notoriously difficult to conduct. The trial methodology may nevertheless be the best way to offer outcome-based neurovascular care in the presence of uncertainty. One obstacle to promoting such trials is the conventional prohibition of publication and dissemination of interim results as the trial progresses. METHODS: We review the scientific and statistical reasons against the publication of interim analyses as well as exceptions that can occur when 1 treatment is unexpectedly shown to be harmful or when the results of other trials have convincingly shown the comparative benefits of a new intervention. We also discuss the promotion of difficult surgical trials. RESULTS: Reasons to support the conventional ban on publication of interim results include control of statistical errors, prevention of invalid conclusions, and dissemination of false claims of equivalence of rival interventions. In the early phases of a trial, usually 1 treatment cannot be shown superior to the other. We believe, contrary to the received view, that a transparent report of the early progress of certain trials can be justified, even when interim results are inconclusive, to promote the recruitment of participating centers and the practice of a novel way to offer neurovascular care in the presence of uncertainty in the best medical interest of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the early publication of inconclusive interim results may increase awareness of the feasibility of surgical care trials.",2019,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.10.180,122,NA,e955-e960,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,Randomized controlled trials and Humans and Decision Making and Feasibility Studies and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *Research Design/standards and Care trial and Interim results and Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods/standards and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods/standards and Trial methodology and Vascular Surgical Procedures/*methods/standards,NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Komotar_2008_Neur,JOUR,Guidelines for the surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: the first annual J. Lawrence pool memorial research symposium--controversies in the management of cerebral aneurysms,"Komotar, Ricardo J. and Mocco, J. and Solomon, Robert A.",Neurosurgery,"The management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms remains one of the most controversial topics in neurosurgery. To this end, we discuss the diagnosis and estimated prevalence of these lesions as well as review the literature regarding the rate of rupture for cerebral aneurysms and risks of operative intervention. Our interpretation of the literature concludes that aneurysms are present in approximately 1% of the adult population, varying between less than 1% in young adults to 4% in the elderly. The yearly risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage for an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is approximately 1% for lesions 7 to 10 mm in diameter. Based on these assumptions, we recommend that 1) with rare exceptions, all symptomatic unruptured aneurysms should be treated; 2) small, incidental aneurysms less than 5 mm in diameter should be managed conservatively in virtually all cases; 3) aneurysms larger than 5 mm in patients younger than 60 years of age should be seriously considered for treatment; 4) large, incidental aneurysms larger than 10 mm should be treated in nearly all patients younger than 70 years of age; and 5) microsurgical clipping rather than endovascular coiling should be the first treatment choice in low-risk cases. Critical to our guidelines is collaboration by a highly experienced cerebrovascular team of microneurosurgeons and endovascular neurosurgeons working at a tertiary medical center with a high case volume and using a decision-making paradigm designed to offer only low-risk treatments. In certain patients for whom both treatment and natural history carry high risks, such as those with giant aneurysms, nonoperative management is typically elected.",2008,10.1227/01.NEU.0000311076.64109.2E,62,1,183-93; discussion 193-194,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,"Humans and Time Factors and Age Factors and *Guidelines as Topic and *Embolization, Therapeutic and Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy and Neurosurgery/*methods",NA,NA,2008/01//undefined,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA
Henaux_2019_Worlneur,JOUR,Nontechnical Skills in Neurosurgery: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Henaux, Pierre-Louis and Jannin, Pierre and Riffaud, Laurent",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Undesirable events in the neurosurgery operating theater have less often been the result of a technical error than of a dysfunction linked to nontechnical skills (NTSs). The essential aim of our study was to perform a systematic review of the reported data on NTS in neurosurgery. Our secondary objective was to identify the NTSs more specific to neurosurgery to define the training needs of neurosurgery trainees. METHODS: The MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) guidelines. The search initially identified 2132 reports, of which 21 were eligible for systematic study. Data were extracted from the report regarding study design, sample size, NTSs assessed, and assessment tools, and the key results were collected. RESULTS: Interpersonal skills (communication, teamwork), cognitive skills (decision making, situational awareness), and personal resource factors (coping with stress or fatigue) were specifically identified. No study had used assessment tools such as NOTECHS (nontechnical skills), NOTSS (nontechnical skills for surgeons), or OTAS (observational teamwork assessment for surgery). They were performed in a real environment in 11 cases, in a simulated environment in 9, and during theoretical teaching in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS: Very few studies have been performed concerning neurosurgical NTSs, despite the increasing the number of studies during the past few years on NTSs in other domains of surgery. Society has been concentrating more and more on the quality and safety of medical care. The development and application of NTS assessment tools is, therefore, essential to provide assistance in the training of future neurosurgeons.",2019,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.06.204,130,NA,e726-e736,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,Communication and Patient safety and Humans and Leadership and Clinical Competence/*standards and Neurosurgery and *Social Skills and Cognitive skills and Interpersonal skills and Neurosurgeons/education/psychology/*standards and Neurosurgical Procedures/education/psychology/*standards and Nontechnical skills,NA,NA,2019/10//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to characterize survival following neurosurgical intervention for cSDH in a selected cohort aged >90 years and to identify prognostic factors that may inform clinical decision-making. METHODS: In total, we identified a cohort of 548 consecutive patients who had undergone burr hole drainage for cSDH in a 5-year period between 2009-2013. Of these patients, 41 were aged >90 years. For each patient, information was gathered from local hospital records, general practice records, and the patients directly. Long-term survival was compared with actuarial data obtained from the National Life Tables. RESULTS: Overall mortality at the time of discharge was 2%. Mortality was 26.8% at 6 months, 36.8% at 1 year, and 47.9% at 2 years. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the actuarial curve and the survival curve following surgery (hazard ratio, 1.17; confidence interval, 0.67-2.05; P = 0.57). Despite initially departing from the actuarial curve, the survival curve becomes parallel at approximately 1 year. Multivariate analysis showed that preadmission residence and the number of comorbid conditions were significant predictors of survival.

However, there are few reports on a persistent or recurrent syrinx or worsening neurologic symptoms after FMD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients who attended Xuanwu Hospital between January 2018 and July 2019 with persistent or recurrent syringomyelia after FMD. RESULTS: All 8 patients had syringomyelia preoperatively with a mean disease course of 43 (range, 3-120) months and underwent FMD. The presenting symptoms improved in 1 patient. There was radiologic evidence of decreased syrinx size in 1 patient. Worsening syringomyelia presented at a median of 65 (range, 7-168) months after the primary FMD. Secondary decompression was performed in all patients. A structural, pathological cause for the first FMD failure was identified in all cases at the time of the second decompression. Symptoms were resolved in all patients after repeat decompression surgery. Radiologically, 6 patients had a decrease in syringomyelia size. The level of the upper segment of the syringomyelia was higher in 7 of our revision patients, among which 6 patients had a decrease in syringomyelia size. The median follow-up duration after the secondary decompression was 11.5 (range, 6-22) months. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with persistent syringomyelia after FMD and the higher level of the upper segment of the syringomyelia often have a surgically remediable structural cause.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of patient and hospital characteristics, including age, on in-hospital mortality, and complication rates of 3 routine neurosurgical operations: subdural hematoma evacuation, brain tumor resection, and degenerative spine procedures. METHODS: A retrospective multivariable analysis of the 2014 National Inpatient Sample was performed. The setting was a national sample of hospitalized inpatient stays occurring in 2014 in the United States. Patients (N = 48,963) included those undergoing subdural hematoma evacuation, brain tumor resection, or degenerative spine procedures, stratified according to age group (<65, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years). Mortality and complication rate were measured. RESULTS: Age <e2><89><a5>85 years was found to increase the odds of mortality (odds ratio 11.32) and complications (odds ratio 2.64) in patients undergoing degenerative spine procedures, whereas age had no significant effect on mortality and complication rate in subdural hematoma evacuation and brain tumor resection. Multiple comorbidities and nonelective status were predictors of increased mortality and complication rate in all procedure groups.

Surgical site infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, increased health care expenditure, and decreased quality of life. With the increasing prevalence of adult spinal deformity and spinal fusion surgery, it is imperative to understand the potential benefits of adjunctive treatments. HBOT is a safe and common procedure indicated to treat various medical conditions. We conducted a literature search across 3 databases for English articles published between December 1, 2019 and December 1, 2000. Thirteen studies were included. HBOT may lessen the duration of antimicrobial therapy and mitigate instrument removal and revision surgery. The current usage indications for HBOT are supported by level III evidence for chronic osteomyelitis and level IV evidence for osteoradionecrosis. However, the same level of evidence exists to support the beneficial use of adjunctive HBOT for noncomplicated spinal infections within 2 months after surgery. When cultured, the most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and other low-virulence organisms.

Clinicians often rely on varied and intuitively disparate ways of evaluating rupture risk that may only partially take into account complex hemodynamic and morphologic factors. We developed a prototype of a clinically oriented, streamlined, computational platform, AView, for rapid assessment of hemodynamics and morphometrics in clinical settings. To show the potential clinical utility of AView, we report our initial multicenter experience highlighting the possible advantages of morphologic and hemodynamic analysis of IAs. METHODS: AView software was deployed across 8 medical centers (6 in the United States, 2 in Japan). Eight clinicians were trained and used the AView software between September 2012 and January 2013. RESULTS: We present 12 illustrative cases that show the potential clinical utility of AView. For all, morphology and hemodynamics, flow visualization, and rupture resemblance score (a surrogate for rupture risk) were provided. In 3 cases, AView could confirm the clinicians' decision to treat; in 3 cases, it could suggest which aneurysms may be at greater risk among multiple aneurysms; in 5 cases, AView could provide additional information for use during treatment decisions for ambiguous situations. In one stent-assisted coiling case, flow visualization predicted that the intuitive choice for stent placement could have resulted in sacrifice of an anterior cerebral artery due to blockage by coils and led clinicians to reconsider treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: AView has the potential to confirm decisions to treat IAs, suggest which among multiple aneurysms to treat, and guide treatment decisions.

Ament_2017_Neur,JOUR,Understanding United States Investigational Device Exemption Studies-Clinical Relevance and Importance for Healthcare Economics,"Ament, Jared D. and Mollan, Scott and Greenan, Krista and Binyamin, Tamar and Kim, Kee D.",Neurosurgery,"INTRODUCTION: The US Food and Drug Administration allows a previously unapproved device to be used clinically to collect safety and effectiveness data under their Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) category. The process usually falls under 3 different trial categories: noninferiority, equivalency, and superiority. To confidently inform our patients, understanding the basic concepts of these trials is paramount. The purpose of this manuscript was to provide a comprehensive review of these topics using recently published IDE trials and economic analyses of cervical total disc replacement as illustrative examples. CASE STUDY MOBI-C ARTIFICIAL CERVICAL DISC: In 2006, an IDE was initiated to study the safety and effectiveness of total disc replacement controlled against the standard of care, anterior cervical discectomy, and fusion. Under the IDE, randomized controlled trials comparing both 1 and 2 level cervical disease were completed. The sponsor designed the initial trial as noninferiority; however, using adaptive methodology, superiority could be claimed in the 2-level investigation. REVIEWING HEALTHCARE ECONOMICS: Healthcare economics are critical in medical decision making and reimbursement practices. Once both cost- and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) are known for each patient, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated. Willingness-to-pay is controversial, but a commonly cited guideline considers interventions costing below 20 000 $/QALY strongly cost effective and more than 100 000 $/QALY as not cost effective. CONCLUSION: While large Food and Drug Administration IDE studies are often besieged by complex statistical considerations and calculations, it is fundamentally important that clinicians understand at least the terminology and basic concepts on a practical level.",2017,10.1093/neuros/nyx048,80,6,840-846,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,United States and Humans and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and Clinical trial design and Randomized controlled trial and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and United States Food and Drug Administration and *Cost-Benefit Analysis and Cervical total disc arthroplasty and Device Approval/*legislation & jurisprudence/*standards and Noninferiority and Statistical review and Superiority and Total Disc Replacement/instrumentation,NA,NA,2017/06/01/,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESULTS: Seventeen patients underwent treatment of unruptured internal carotid artery aneurysms. Three patients (17.6%) developed visual symptoms after the procedure: 2 permanent and 1 transient. Four patients (23.5%) developed delayed internal carotid artery stenosis at the 6- to 8-month follow-up angiography, despite a standard antiplatelet regimen with confirmed sensitivities to aspirin and clopidogrel. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography was obtained in all patients with stenosis to guide treatment. One patient progressed to complete but asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion. The second and third patients had asymptomatic stenosis of 40% and 70%, respectively, both of which resolved on follow-up angiography. The fourth patient developed critical stenosis distal to the aneurysm neck. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated adequate flow in the first 3 patients and decreased flow in the fourth patient, necessitating angioplasty and stenting. Prolonged dual antiplatelet regimens were continued in 2 of the 4 patients, 1 with progression of stenosis and 1 with improvement of stenosis. CONCLUSION: We observed a higher rate of parent vessel steno-occlusive progression after aneurysm embolization with Onyx HD-500 than reported in the literature, despite overall low morbidity. Quantitative vessel flow imaging was useful in subsequent medical management and decision making to perform therapeutic angioplasty/stenting to preserve flow.",2013,10.1227/NEU.0b013e31828048a3,72,3,341-352; discussion 352,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,"Humans and Retrospective Studies and Databases, Factual and Treatment Outcome and Disease Progression and Stents and Angioplasty and Clopidogrel and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods and Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use and Aspirin/therapeutic use and Magnetic Resonance Angiography and Constriction, Pathologic and Carotid Artery Diseases/pathology/therapy and Carotid Stenosis/pathology/therapy and Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects and Intracranial Aneurysm/pathology/*therapy and Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/pathology/surgery and Ticlopidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2013/03//undefined,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA
O.Donohoe_2019_Neur,JOUR,Reporting Quality of Systematic Review Abstracts Published in Leading Neurosurgical Journals: A Research on Research Study,"O'Donohoe, Tom J. and Dhillon, Rana and Bridson, Tahnee L. and Tee, Jin",Neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Systematic review (SR) abstracts are frequently relied upon to guide clinical decision-making. However, there is mounting evidence that the quality of abstract reporting in the medical literature is suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: To appraise SR abstract reporting quality in neurosurgical journals and identify factors associated with improved reporting. METHODS: This study systematically surveyed SR abstracts published in 8 leading neurosurgical journals between 8 April 2007 and 21 August 2017. Abstracts were identified through a search of the MEDLINE database and their reporting quality was determined in duplicate using a tool derived from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Abstracts (PRISMA-A) statement. All SR abstracts that provided comparison between treatment strategies were eligible for inclusion. Descriptive statistics were utilized to identify factors associated with improved reporting. RESULTS: A total of 257 abstracts were included in the analysis, with a mean of 22.8 (<c2><b1>25.3) included studies. The overall quality of reporting in included abstracts was suboptimal, with a mean score of 53.05% (<c2><b1>11.18). Reporting scores were higher among abstracts published after the release of the PRISMA-A guidelines (M = 56.52; 21.74-73.91) compared with those published beforehand (M = 47.83; 8.70-69.57; U = 4346.00, z = -4.61, P < .001). Similarly, both word count (r = 0.338, P < .001) and journal impact factor (r = 0.199, P = .001) were associated with an improved reporting score. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the overall reporting quality of abstracts in leading neurosurgical journals requires improvement. Strengths include the large number abstracts assessed, and its weaknesses include the fact that only neurosurgery-specific journals were surveyed. We recommend that attention be turned toward strengthening abstract submission and peer-review processes.",2019,10.1093/neuros/nyy615,85,1,1-10,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Systematic review and *Systematic Reviews as Topic and Neurosurgery and Neurosurgical Procedures and Periodicals as Topic/*standards and Abstracting and Indexing/*standards and PRISMA and Reporting quality and Research on research,NA,NA,2019/07/01/,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Between November 2016 and August 2017, a transvenous endovascular embolization protocol was implemented at the Henan Provincial People's Hospital for consecutive patients with ruptured brain AVMs. Therapeutic decision making was based on Spetzler-Martin grade, brain AVM location, pattern of venous drainage, and angioarchitecture. Transvenous embolization was combined with transarterial support. Complete angiographic obliteration of the nidus was the objective of treatment. RESULTS: Among 10 patients with ruptured brain AVMs, 8 were male. Spetzler-Martin grades before transvenous embolization were IV in 3 patients, III in 5 patients, II in 1 patient, and I in 1 patient. Modified Rankin Scale score before the procedure was 0-2 for 6 of 10 patients. Five patients also had deep venous drainage. Arterial blood pressure control and venous pressure cooker technique were used in all 10 patients; 9 patients had immediate angiographic occlusion. Two patients had a ventricular hemorrhage, which did not cause any disability after medical treatment. Seven patients underwent angiography 3-5 months after the procedure, and complete obliteration of the nidus was confirmed. Median clinical follow-up for all 10 patients was 8 months (range, 3-12 months). Epilepsy occurred in 1 patient 3 months after the procedure, and modified Rankin Scale scores for all patients were <e2><89><a4>1.

Garces_2017_Worlneur,JOUR,First Case of Autonomic Dysreflexia Following Elective Lower Thoracic Spinal Cord Transection in a Spina Bifida Adult,"Garces, Juanita and Mathkour, Mansour and Scullen, Tyler and Kahn, Lora and Biro, Erin and Pham, Alex and Sulaiman, Olawale A. R. and Smith, Roger and Bui, Cuong J.",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Spinal cord transection is a radical but effective treatment for highly selective cases of symptomatic spinal retethering in paraplegic spina bifida patients. Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome involving a dysregulated sympathetic discharge reflex commonly seen following cervical and high thoracic spinal cord injury, leading to a disconnect between autonomic pathways above and below the lesion that can lead to severe complications including uncontrolled hypertension, bradycardia, stroke, and potentially death. Herein we present a case in which a paraplegic spina bifida patient presenting with symptomatic spinal retethering experienced autonomic dysreflexia following an elective spinal cord transection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old male with a history of complex spina bifida presented with an active cerebrospinal fluid leak. Physical examination revealed a thin covering of abnormal epidermis over the large placode. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large myelomeningocele defect with posterior element defects spanning from L2 to the sacrum with evidence of tethering. The patient underwent an intradural transection of the spinal cord with a ""blind-pouch"" closure of the dura at the level of T12/L1. Postoperatively, the patient developed intermittent episodes of hypertension, bradycardia, headaches, altered mental status, severe perspiration, and red flushing of the upper torso, face, and arms. The diagnosis of AD was made clinically and managed with a positive response to a combination of beta- and alpha-blockade along with patient education on avoidance of common AD triggers. At 5-year follow-up the patient has continued to do well on medication. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a potential major side effect from elective transection of the spinal cord. If unrecognized and untreated, AD can cause significant distress and morbidity. We hope this first case report serves to supplement existing data and aid in future surgical and medical decision-making.",2017,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.147,108,NA,988.e1-988.e5,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Follow-Up Studies and Diagnosis, Differential and *Postoperative Complications and *Elective Surgical Procedures and Neurosurgical Procedures and Autonomic dysreflexia and Autonomic Dysreflexia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology and Cord untethering and Meningomyelocele/complications/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Spina bifida and Spinal cord transection and Spinal Cord/*surgery and Spinal Dysraphism/complications/diagnostic imaging/*surgery and Tethered cord",NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mahmood_2017_Worlneur,JOUR,Mini-Craniotomy Under Local Anesthesia for Chronic Subdural Hematoma: An Effective Choice for Elderly Patients and for Patients in a Resource-Strained Environment,"Mahmood, Shaikh Danish and Waqas, Muhammad and Baig, Mirza Zain and Darbar, Aneela",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Mini-craniotomy for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is associated with lower rates of recurrence. However, the procedure is performed mostly with the patient under general anesthesia (GA) and therefore frequently requires an intensive care unit (ICU) facility, especially in the elderly population. Because of the unavailability of ICU beds, and to avoid GA, we started to perform this procedure with the patient under local anesthesia (LA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective medical chart review conducted in the section of Neurosurgery at the Aga Khan Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. The study duration was 1 year. We included patients aged 55 years or older undergoing surgery for CSDH. Clinical characteristics, hospital stay, and recurrence rates were compared between 2 groups, local versus general anesthesia. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients underwent mini-craniotomy for CSDH in the study period. Sixteen patients underwent mini-craniotomy under LA versus 19 patients for GA. Median age for the LA group was 67 years compared with 70 years in the GA group. Four patients from the LA group experienced postoperative complications versus 7 from the GA group. Only one patient in the LA group required an ICU bed in the postoperative period. There was no recurrence in LA group. The overall recurrence was 2.86%. CONCLUSIONS: Mini-craniotomy for CSDH under LA is an equally effective procedure compared with mini-craniotomy under GA. In addition, it minimizes the risks of GA in the elderly population and obviates the need of a postoperative ICU bed. It also reduces operative time and hospital stay as compared with GA.",2017,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.057,106,NA,676-679,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Pakistan/epidemiology and *Health Resources/economics and Anesthesia, Local/economics/*methods and Burr-hole drainage and Chronic subdural hematoma and Craniotomy/economics/*methods and Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic/economics/epidemiology/*surgery and Local anesthesia and Mini-craniotomy",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether sarcopenia predicts survival in patients with lung, breast, prostate, or multiple myeloma spinal metastases. METHODS: Psoas muscle measurements in patients with spinal metastasis were taken from computed tomography scans at 2 time points: at first episode of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and from the most recent scan available. Overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated with multivariate cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: In 417 patients with spinal metastases, 40% had lung cancer, 27% breast, 21% prostate, and 11% myeloma. Overall survival was not associated with age, sex, ethnicity, levels treated, or SBRT volume. Multivariate analysis showed patients in the lowest psoas tertile had shorter survival (222 d, 95% CI = 185-323 d) as compared to the largest tertile (579 d, 95% CI = 405-815 d), (HR1.54, P = .005). Median psoas size as a cutoff value was also strongly predictive for survival (HR1.48, P = .002). Survival was independent of tumor histology. The psoas/vertebral body ratio was also successful in predicting overall survival independent of tumor histology and gender (HR1.52, P < .01). Kaplan-Meier survival curves visually represent survival (P = .0005). CONCLUSION: In patients with spine metastases, psoas muscle size as a hallmark of frailty/sarcopenia is an objective, simple, and effective way to identify patients who are at risk for shorter survival, regardless of tumor histology. This information can be used to help with surgical decision making in patients with advanced cancer, as patients with small psoas sizes are at higher risk of death.",2020,10.1093/neuros/nyz216,86,5,705-716,eng,1524-4040 0148-396X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Multivariate Analysis and Frailty and Aged, 80 and over and Proportional Hazards Models and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and Medical oncology and Radiosurgery/methods and Metastasis and Sarcopenia and Spine and *Frailty/etiology and *Sarcopenia/etiology/pathology and Breast Neoplasms/complications/pathology and Lung Neoplasms/complications/pathology and Multiple Myeloma/complications/pathology and Prostatic Neoplasms/complications/pathology and Psoas Muscles/pathology and Spinal Neoplasms/*mortality/*secondary",NA,NA,2020/05/01/,Neurosurgery,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lu_2020_Worlneur,JOUR,Decompressive Craniectomy for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Pooled Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Lu, Guangyu and Zhu, Lei and Wang, Xingdong and Zhang, Hengzhu and Li, Yuping",World neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) is widely applied for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although previous studies have indicated that DHC can lead to similar or worse outcomes compared with medical treatment (MT) in patients with TBI, recent trials have suggested the benefit of DHC for neurologic function recovery. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and functional outcomes of DHC in patients with TBI. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, we searched English and Chinese databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting DHC for TBI. The outcomes measures included mortality, favorable outcome, unfavorable outcome, postoperative intracranial pressure (ICP), adverse events with hematoma, and hospital stay. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with a total of 779 patients with TBI were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the MT group, the DHC group demonstrated significantly lower rates of mortality (P < 0.00001), postoperative ICP (P < 0.00001), and postoperative hematoma (P = 0.01), and significantly shorter hospital length of stay (P = 0.02). However, the rate of unfavorable outcomes was higher in the DHC group compared with the MT group (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that DHC could be effective in reducing the mortality rate, incidence of ICP, and hospital length of stay in patients with TBI. However, the proportion of patients surviving with unfavorable outcomes was significantly higher in the DHC group compared with the MT group.

A controversial issue in neurosurgery is the common practice of administering perioperative anticonvulsant prophylaxis to these patients despite a paucity of supporting data in the literature. The foreseeable benefits of this strategy must be balanced against potential adverse effects and interactions with critical medications such as chemotherapeutic agents and corticosteroids. Multiple disparate metaanalyses have been published on this topic but have not been applied into clinical practice, and, instead, personal preference frequently determines practice patterns in this area of management. Therefore, to select the current best available evidence to guide clinical decision making, the literature was evaluated to identify meta-analyses that investigated the efficacy and/or safety of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in this patient population. Six meta-analyses published between 1996 and 2011 were included in the present study. The Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses and Oxman-Guyatt methodological quality assessment tools were used to score these meta-analyses, and the Jadad decision algorithm was applied to determine the highest-quality meta-analysis. According to this analysis, 2 metaanalyses were deemed to be the current best available evidence, both of which conclude that prophylactic treatment does not improve seizure control in these patients.

Because the median age for the diagnosis is 65 years, the patients' general health condition, comorbidities, and procedural risks will influence the postoperative functional outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the long-term impairments of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after meningioma resection in different age groups of elderly patients. METHODS: We analyzed the HRQOL of 133 patients aged >54 years at surgery who had undergone surgical meningioma resection from 2004 to 2010. The median age was 67.3 <c2><b1> 7.4 years. The average interval between surgery and questionnaire completion was 3.8 <c2><b1> 2.5 years. Six different 5-year age groups were established. The patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study short-form 36-item questionnaire, and the results were compared with general population values. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We found significantly lower levels of physical function, vitality, social role functioning, mental health, and general health perception and significantly greater levels of pain between the older age groups (in particular, 75-79 years) and younger patients aged 55-59 years. The physical component summary showed a steadily and stepwise decline from younger to older patients. However, the most significant differences in HRQOL were not related to age but to comorbidities.

The projectile trajectory (PT) has been shown to impact mortality, but the significant lobar tracks have not been defined. The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to test for associations between distinct ballistic trajectories, missile types, and patient outcomes. METHODS: A total of 243 patients who presented with a PBI to the Saint Louis University emergency department from 2008 through 2019 were identified from the hospital registry. Conventional CT scans combined with 3D CT reconstructions and medical records were reviewed for each patient to identify distinct PTs. RESULTS: A total of 65 ballistic lobar trajectories were identified. Multivariable regression models were used, and the results were compared with those in the literature. Penetrating and perforating types of PBI associated with bitemporal (t-statistic = -2.283, p = 0.023) or frontal-to-contralateral parietal (t-statistic = -2.311, p = 0.025) projectile paths were universally found to be fatal. In the group in which the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation was lower than 8, a favorable penetrating missile trajectory was one that involved a single frontal lobe (adjusted OR 0.02 [95% CI 0.00-0.38], p = 0.022) or parietal lobe (adjusted OR 0.15 [95% CI 0.02-0.97], p = 0.048). Expanding or fragmenting types of projectiles carry higher mortality rates (OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.32-4.83], p < 0.001) than do nondeformable missiles. Patient age was not associated with worse outcomes when controlled by other significant predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with penetrating or perforating types of PBI associated with bitemporal or frontal-to-contralateral parietal PTs should be considered as potential donor candidates. Trauma patients with penetrating missile trajectories involving a single frontal or parietal lobe should be considered for early neurosurgical intervention, especially in the circumstances of a low GCS score (< 8). Surgeons should not base their decision-making solely on advanced patient age to defer further treatment.

Advances in medical imaging technology allow for direct visualization of the offending blood vessels in hemifacial spasm and similar conditions (such as trigeminal neuralgia). The utility of high resolution 3D MR angiography and 3D spoiled-gradient recalled (SPGR) imaging sequences for surgical decision-making in hemifacial spasm, as measured by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, has not been previously determined. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 23 patients with hemifacial spasm who underwent operations between January 2001 and December 2006 at Oregon Health & Science University. All patients underwent preoperative high-resolution 3D MR angiography and 3D SPGR imaging. The sensitivity of the SPGR imaging/MR angiography interpretation of neurovascular compression (NVC) by both a neurosurgeon and 2 neuroradiologists was determined in relation to the presence of actual NVC during surgery. RESULTS: All patients were found to have NVC at surgery. After review by a neurosurgeon and 2 neuroradiologists, imaging data from 19 of the 23 patients were evaluated. The neurosurgeon's interpretation had a sensitivity of 79% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. The first neuroradiologist's interpretation had a sensitivity of 21% with a PPV of 100%. Further interpretation by a blinded second neuroradiologist with expertise in MR imaging of hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia was conducted, and sensitivity was 59% and PPV was 100%. Specificity was not determined because there were no true negative cases. The negative predictive value was 0% for both the neurosurgeon's and neuroradiologists' evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Although high-resolution 3D MR angiography and 3D SPGR imaging was helpful in providing information about the anatomical relationship of cranial nerve VII and surrounding blood vessels, the authors determined that in the case of hemifacial spasm these types of imaging did not influence preoperative surgical decisionmaking.",2009,10.3171/2009.3.JNS08393,111,4,733-736,eng,1933-0693 0022-3085,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods and Neurosurgical Procedures/methods and Facial Nerve/pathology and Blood Vessels/*pathology and Brain/*blood supply and Hemifacial Spasm/*diagnosis/*pathology/surgery and Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods and Trigeminal Neuralgia/diagnosis/pathology/surgery",NA,NA,2009/10//undefined,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The authors propose a classification system for MFFD with the potential to guide clinical decision making. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records (years 1995-2012) of patients who had undergone temporal craniotomy for the surgical repair of an MFFD syndrome at a single institution was undertaken. Reviewed data included demographic, operative, presentation, and outcome details. Middle fossa floor dehiscence was classified as follows: Class A, bony dehiscence without herniation of the brain and/or meninges; Class B, herniation of the brain and/or meninges through the middle fossa floor without CSF leakage; Class C, dehiscence with CSF leakage without meningitis; or Class D, dehiscence with meningitis. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 22 males and 29 females, were included in the analysis. The mean age was 48.7 <c2><b1> 15.5 years, mean body mass index was 32.65 <c2><b1> 6.86 kg/m(2), and mean symptom duration was 33 <c2><b1> 42 months. Seven patients underwent repeat surgery for symptomatic recurrence; therefore, there were 58 surgical encounters. Repair included bony reconstruction with hydroxyapatite with or without resection of encephaloceles and/or repair of a dural defect. According to the MFFD classification system described, 15, 8, 27, and 8 cases were categorized as Class A, B, C, and D, respectively. The prevalence of hearing loss was 87%, 63%, and 70% in Classes A, B, and C, respectively. Vestibular symptoms were more prevalent in Class A. Seven patients reported persistent symptoms at the last follow-up. Transient complications were similar in each classification (13%-25%), and a single permanent complication related to anesthesia was observed. There were no mortalities or severe neurological morbidities in the series. CONCLUSIONS: Middle fossa floor dehiscence has a spectrum of clinical presentations. A classification system may help to clarify the diagnosis and guide therapy.

Michael and Spetzler, Robert F. and Lawton, Michael T.",Journal of neurosurgery,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the existing Spetzler-Martin (SM), Spetzler-Ponce (SP), and Lawton-Young (LY) grading systems for cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to propose a new grading system to estimate the risks associated with these lesions. METHODS: Data for patients with cerebellar AVMs treated microsurgically in two tertiary medical centers were retrospectively reviewed. Data from patients at institution 1 were collected from September 1999 to February 2013, and at institution 2 from October 2008 to October 2015. Patient outcomes were classified as favorable (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-2) or poor (mRS score 3-6) at the time of discharge. Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis, variables associated with poor outcomes were assigned risk points to design the proposed grading system. The proposed system included neurological status prior to treatment (poor, +2 points), emergency surgery (+1 point), age > 60 years (+1 point), and deep venous drainage (deep, +1 point). Risk point totals of 0-1 comprised grade 1, 2-3 grade 2, and 4-5 grade 3. RESULTS: A total of 125 cerebellar AVMs of 1328 brain AVMs were reviewed in 125 patients, 120 of which were treated microsurgically and included in the study. With our proposed grading system, we found poor outcomes differed significantly between each grade (p < 0.001), while with the SM, SP, and LY grading systems they did not (p = 0.22, p = 0.25, and p = 1, respectively). Logistic regression revealed grade 2 had 3.3 times the risk of experiencing a poor outcome (p = 0.008), while grade 3 had 9.9 times the risk (p < 0.001). The proposed grading system demonstrated a superior level of predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] of 0.72) compared with the SM, SP, and LY grading systems (AUROC of 0.61, 0.57, and 0.51, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose a novel grading system for cerebellar AVMs based on emergency surgery, venous drainage, preoperative neurological status, and age that provides a superior prognostication power than the formerly proposed SM, SP, and LY grading systems.

Wang_2018_Worlneur,JOUR,Predisposing Factors of Fracture Nonunion After Posterior C1 Lateral Mass Screws Combined with C2 Pedicle/Laminar Screw Fixation for Type II Odontoid Fracture,"Wang, Hui and Wang, Qian and Ma, Lei and Yang, Dalong and Ding, Wenyuan",World neurosurgery,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to explore the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after a lateral screw was combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw for a type II odontoid fracture and hopefully provide references in decision making and surgical planning for spinal surgeons. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. By retrieving the medical records from January 2010 to July 2015 in our hospital, 117 type II odontoid fracture patients were reviewed. According to the occurrence of fracture union at the final follow-up, patients were divided into 2 groups: union and nonunion. To investigate the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion, 3 categorized factors were analyzed statistically: patient characteristics-age, sex, body mass index, preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, duration, comorbidity, and complicated injuries; surgical variables-surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2; radiographic parameters-preoperative and immediate postoperative data of C(0-2) curvature, C(2-7) curvature, C(2-7) sagittal vertical axis, C7 slope, fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, and the separation and displacement of the odontoid fracture. Other variables including JOA and visual analog scale scores for neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Postoperative fracture nonunion was detected in 76 of 117 patients (65%) at final follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in patient characteristics of sex, body mass index, JOA score, comorbidity, and complicated injuries. The mean age at operation was younger in the union group than in the nonunion group, and the mean duration was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. There was no difference in surgical variables of surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2. There was no difference in radiographic parameters of fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, preoperative and immediate postoperative C(0-2) curvature, C(2-7) curvature, C(2-7) SVA, and C7 slope. No difference was found in preoperative and immediate postoperative displacement of the odontoid fracture or immediate postoperative separation of the odontoid fracture, while the preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced age (>45 years), long duration (>2 months), and preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture (>4 mm) were independently associated with the postoperative fracture nonunion. There were no differences between the 2 groups in JOA, neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, long duration, and preoperative separation of odontoid fracture >4 mm are predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after posterior C1 lateral screw combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture. Our findings did not demonstrate any evidence of lower functional outcome and patients satisfaction for those patients who had odontoid nonunion.",2018,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.09.198,109,NA,e417-e425,eng,1878-8769 1878-8750,"Radiography and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Logistic Models and Risk Factors and Age Factors and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and *Neurosurgical Procedures and *Bone Screws and *Fracture Fixation, Internal and Advanced age and Axis, Cervical Vertebra/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Cervical Atlas/diagnostic imaging/*surgery and Fracture nonunion and Fracture separation and Fractures, Ununited/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology and Long duration and Odontoid fracture and Odontoid Process/diagnostic imaging/injuries/*surgery and Spinal Fractures/diagnostic imaging/*surgery",NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,World Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Labidi_2015_Joofne,JOUR,Predicting success of endoscopic third ventriculostomy: validation of the ETV Success Score in a mixed population of adult and pediatric patients,"Labidi, Moujahed and Lavoie, Pascale and Lapointe, Genevieve and Obaid, Sami and Weil, Alexander G. and Bojanowski, Michel W. and Turmel, Andre",Journal of neurosurgery,"OBJECT: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has become the first line of treatment in obstructive hydrocephalus. The Toronto group (Kulkarni et al.) developed the ETV Success Score (ETVSS) to predict the clinical response following ETV based on age, previous shunt, and cause of hydrocephalus in a pediatric population. However, the use of the ETVSS has not been validated for a population comprising adults. The objective of this study was to validate the ETVSS in a ""closed-skull"" population, including patients 2 years of age and older. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, medical charts of all consecutive cases of ETV performed in two university hospitals were reviewed. The primary outcome, the success of ETV, was defined as the absence of reoperation or death attributable to hydrocephalus at 6 months. The ETVSS was calculated for all patients. Discriminative properties along with calibration of the ETVSS were established for the study population. The secondary outcome is the reoperation-free survival. RESULTS: This study included 168 primary ETVs. The mean age was 40 years (range 3-85 years). ETV was successful at 6 months in 126 patients (75%) compared with a mean ETVSS of 82.4%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.61, revealing insufficient discrimination from the ETVSS in this population. In contrast, calibration of the ETVSS was excellent (calibration slope = 1.01), although the expected low numbers were obtained for scores < 70. Decision curve analyses demonstrate that ETVSS is marginally beneficial in clinical decision-making, a reduction of 4 and 2 avoidable ETVs per 100 cases if the threshold used on the ETVSS is set at 70 and 60, respectively. However, the use of the ETVSS showed inferior net benefit when compared with the strategy of not recommending ETV at all as a surgical option for thresholds set at 80 and 90. In this cohort, neither age nor previous shunt were significantly associated with unsuccessful ETV. However, better outcomes were achieved in patients with aqueductal stenosis, tectal compressions, and other tumor-associated hydrocephalus than in cases secondary to myelomeningocele, infection, or hemorrhage (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The ETVSS did not show adequate discrimination but demonstrated excellent calibration in this population of patients 2 years and older. According to decision-curve analyses, the ETVSS is marginally useful in clinical scenarios in which 60% or 70% success rates are the thresholds for preferring ETV to CSF shunt. Previous history of CSF shunt and age were not associated with worse outcomes, whereas posthemorrhagic and postinfectious causes of the hydrocephalus were significantly associated with reduced success rates following ETV.",2015,10.3171/2014.12.JNS141240,123,6,1447-1455,eng,1933-0693 0022-3085,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Age Factors and Reoperation and ROC = receiver operating characteristic and EVD = external ventricular drain and *Neuroendoscopy and *Ventriculostomy and ETV = endoscopic third ventriculostomy and ETVSS = ETV Success Score and hydrocephalus and Hydrocephalus/etiology/mortality/*surgery and minimally invasive neurosurgery and neuroendoscopy and Third Ventricle/*surgery and third ventriculostomy",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of this study was to understand the state of the volume-outcome relationship at different levels of trauma centers in the United States. METHODS: The authors queried the National Trauma Data Bank for the years 2007-2014 for patients with severe TBI. Case volumes for each level of trauma center organized into quintiles (Q1-Q5) served as the primary predictor. Analyzed outcomes included in-hospital mortality, total hospital length of stay (LOS), and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Multivariable regression models were performed for in-hospital mortality, overall complications, and total hospital and ICU LOSs to adjust for possible confounders. The analysis was stratified by level designation of the trauma center. Statistical significance was established at p < 0.001 to avoid a type I error due to a large sample size. RESULTS: A total of 122,445 patients were included. Adjusted analysis did not demonstrate a significant relationship between increasing hospital volume of severe TBI cases and in-hospital mortality, complications, and nonhome hospital discharge disposition among level I-IV trauma centers. However, among level II trauma centers, hospital LOS was longer for the highest volume quintile (adjusted mean difference [MD] for Q5: 2.83 days, 95% CI 1.40-4.26 days, p < 0.001, reference = Q1). For level III and IV trauma centers, both hospital LOS and ICU LOS were longer for the highest volume quintile (adjusted MD for Q5: LOS 4.6 days, 95% CI 2.3-7.0 days, p < 0.001; ICU LOS 3.2 days, 95% CI 1.6-4.8 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher volumes of severe TBI cases at a lower level of trauma center may be associated with a longer LOS.

The authors describe the decision-making process concerning cerebral revascularization and present outcomes that were achieved in a large case series of complex IAs managed with cerebral revascularization and parent artery occlusion.METHODSThe authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records, including neuroimaging studies, operative reports, and follow-up clinic notes, of all patients who were treated at the National Brain Aneurysm Center between July 1997 and June 2015 using cerebral revascularization as part of the management of an IA. They recorded the location, rupture status, and size of each IA, as well as neurological outcome using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), aneurysm and bypass status at follow-up, and morbidity and mortality.RESULTSThe authors identified 126 patients who underwent revascularization surgery for 126 complex, atheromatous, calcified, or previously coiled aneurysms. Ninety-seven lesions (77.0%) were unruptured, and 99 (78.6%) were located in the anterior circulation. Aneurysm size was giant (<e2><89><a5> 25 mm) in 101 patients, large (10-24 mm) in 9, and small (<e2><89><a4> 9 mm) in 16 patients. Eighty-four low-flow bypasses were performed in 83 patients (65.9%). High-flow bypass was performed in 32 patients (25.4%). Eleven patients (8.7%) underwent in situ or intracranial-intracranial bypasses. Major morbidity (mRS score 4 or 5) occurred in 2 (2.4%) low-flow cases and 3 (9.1%) high-flow cases. Mortality occurred in 2 (2.4%) low-flow cases and 2 (6.1%) high-flow cases. At the 12-month follow-up, 83 (98.8%) low-flow and 30 (93.8%) high-flow bypasses were patent. Seventy-five patients (90.4%) undergoing low-flow and 28 (84.8%) high-flow bypasses had an mRS score <e2><89><a4> 2. There were no statistically significant differences in patency rates or complications between low- and high-flow bypasses.CONCLUSIONSWhen treating challenging and complex IAs, incorporating revascularization strategies into the surgical repertoire may contribute to achieving favorable outcomes. In our series, low-flow bypass combined with isolated proximal or distal parent artery occlusion was associated with a low rate of ischemic complications while providing good long-term aneurysm control, potentially supporting its wider utilization in this setting. The authors suggest that consideration should be given to managing complex IAs at high-volume centers that offer a multidisciplinary team approach and the full spectrum of surgical and endovascular treatment options to optimize patient outcomes.",2018,10.3171/2018.4.JNS172752,NA,NA,1-11,eng,1933-0693 0022-3085,SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage and revascularization and vascular disorders and ACA = anterior cerebral artery and BTO = balloon test occlusion and complex aneurysms and ECA = external carotid artery and high-flow bypass and IA = intracranial aneurysm and IC = intracranial and ICA = internal carotid artery and low-flow bypass and MCA = middle cerebral artery and mRS = modified Rankin Scale and OA = occipital artery and PCA = posterior cerebral artery and PICA = posterior inferior cerebellar artery and STA = superficial temporal artery,NA,NA,2018/10/01/,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Kondziolka, Douglas",Journal of neurosurgery,"OBJECTIVE A randomized trial that compares clinical outcomes following microsurgery (MS) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with small- and medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VSs) is impractical, but would have important implications for clinical decision making. A matched cohort analysis was conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients treated with MS or SRS. METHODS The records of 399 VS patients who were cared for by 2 neurosurgeons and 1 neurotologist between 2001 and 2014 were evaluated. From this data set, 3 retrospective matched cohorts were created to compare hearing preservation (21 matched pairs), facial nerve preservation (83 matched pairs), intervention-free survival, and complication rates (85 matched pairs) between cases managed with SRS and patients managed with MS. Cases were matched for age at surgery (<c2><b1> 10 years) and lesion size (<c2><b1> 0.1 cm). To compare hearing outcomes, cases were additionally matched for preoperative Class A hearing according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines. To compare facial nerve (i.e., cranial nerve [CN] VII) outcomes, cases were additionally matched for preoperative House-Brackmann (HB) score. Investigators who were not involved with patient care reviewed the clinical and imaging records. The reported outcomes were as assessed at the time of the last follow-up, unless otherwise stated. RESULTS The preservation of preoperative Class A hearing status was achieved in 14.3% of MS cases compared with 42.9% of SRS cases (OR 4.5; p < 0.05) after an average follow-up interval of 43.7 months and 30.3 months, respectively. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 42.8% of MS cases compared with 85.7% of SRS cases (OR 8.0; p < 0.01). The rates of postoperative CN VII dysfunction were low for both groups, although significantly higher in the MS group (HB III-IV 11% vs 0% for SRS; OR 21.3; p < 0.01) at a median follow-up interval of 35.7 and 19.0 months for MS and SRS, respectively. There was no difference in the need for subsequent intervention (2 MS patients and 2 SRS patients). CONCLUSIONS At this high-volume center, VS resection or radiosurgery for tumors <e2><89><a4> 2.8 cm in diameter was associated with low overall morbidity. The need for subsequent intervention was the same in both groups. SRS was associated with improved hearing and facial preservation rates and reduced morbidity, but with a shorter average follow-up period. Facial function was excellent in both groups. Since patients were not randomly selected for surgery, different clinical outcomes may be of different value to individual patients.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was performed by using stratified blocked randomization. The primary eligibility criterion of the study was being a surgical candidate for brainstem CMs (with informed consent). The study enrolled 23 patients who underwent preoperative DTI/DTT and 24 patients who did not (the control group). The pre- and postoperative muscle strength of both limbs and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were evaluated. Muscle strength of any limb at 12 months after surgery at the clinic visit was the primary outcome; worsened muscle strength was considered to be a poor outcome. Outcome assessors were blinded to patient management. This study reports the preliminary results of the interim analysis. RESULTS: The cohort included 47 patients (22 women) with a mean age of 35.7 years. The clinical baselines between these 2 groups were not significantly different. In the DTI/DTT group, the corticospinal tract was affected in 17 patients (73.9%): it was displaced, deformed/partially interrupted, or completely interrupted in 6, 7, and 4 patients, respectively. The surgical approach and brainstem entry point were adjusted in 3 patients (13.0%) based on DTI/DTT data. The surgical morbidity of the DTI/DTT group (7/23, 30.4%) was significantly lower than that of the control group (19/24, 79.2%, p = 0.001). At 12 months, the mean mRS score (1.1, p = 0.034) and percentage of patients with worsened motor deficits (4.3%, p = 0.006) were significantly lower in the DTI/DTT group than in the control group (1.7% and 37.5%). Multivariate logistic regression identified the absence of preoperative DTI/DTT (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.73, p = 0.028) and use of the 2-point method (OR 4.15, 95% CI 1.38-12.49, p = 0.011) as independent adverse factors for a worsened motor deficit. The multivariate model found a significant correlation between poor mRS score and both an increased preoperative mRS score (t = 3.559, p = 0.001) and absence of preoperative DTI/DTT (t = -2.747, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: DTI/DTT noninvasively allowed for visualization of the anatomical relationship between vital tracts and pathologies as well as facilitated the brainstem surgical approach and entry-point decision making. The technique was valuable for complex neurosurgical planning to reduce morbidity. Nonetheless, DTI/DTT data should be interpreted cautiously.<e2><96><a0> CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Type of question: therapeutic; study design: randomized controlled trial; evidence: class I.
