Koerner_2014_Clinreha,JOUR,A multicentre cluster-randomized controlled study to evaluate a train-the-trainer programme for implementing internal and external participation in medical rehabilitation,"Koerner, Mirjam and Wirtz, Markus and Michaelis, Martina and Ehrhardt, Heike and Steger, Anne-Kathrin and Zerpies, Eva and Bengel, Jurgen",Clinical rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effect of the train-the-trainer programme 'Fit for Shared Decision-Making' on internal (team) and external (patient) participation in medical rehabilitation from a patient and staff perspective. DESIGN: A multicentre, cluster-randomized controlled study. SETTING: Eleven medical rehabilitation clinics, divided into intervention and control groups. SUBJECTS: A staff and a patient survey were conducted pre- and post-intervention, plus a further patient survey six months later. INTERVENTION: Train-the-trainer programme 'Fit for Shared Decision-Making' for interprofessional settings. MAIN MEASURES: Each survey measured internal participation with a self-compiled six-item scale (Internal Participation Scale, IPS), and external participation by means of a nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) for the patients and for healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Patient samples numbered 402 for the pre-, 463 for the post-intervention data collection period and 461 six months after the intervention. Patients' appraisal of external participation (Fperiod x group (2) = 0.256, p=0.774, <ce><b7>(2)=0.000) showed no change, whereas internal participation (Fperiod x group (2) = 3.785, p=0.023, <ce><b7>(2)=0.007) showed a significant increase. A total of 195 healthcare professionals participated in the pre- and 168 in the post-intervention staff survey. Here external participation was significantly enhanced in the intervention group (F(period x group) (1) = 4.893, p=0.028, <ce><b7>(2)=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The train-the-trainer approach can be recommended for implementing internal and external participation in interprofessional settings such as medical rehabilitation clinics. However, there is a need for more intensive staff training for internal participation and an additional intervention for patients to achieve success in all aspects.",2014,10.1177/0269215513494874,28,1,20-35,eng,1477-0873 0269-2155,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Decision Making and patient-centred care and *Patient Participation and *Patient Care Team and Shared decision-making and cluster-randomized controlled study and interprofessional team and Rehabilitation/*education and Teaching/*methods and train-the-trainer programme,NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,Clin Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dubois_2019_Joofneanre,JOUR,Fast and automatic assessment of fall risk by coupling machine learning algorithms with a depth camera to monitor simple balance tasks,"Dubois, Amandine and Mouthon, Audrey and Sivagnanaselvam, Ranjith Steve and Bresciani, Jean-Pierre",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Falls in the elderly constitute a major health issue associated to population ageing. Current clinical tests evaluating fall risk mostly consist in assessing balance abilities. The devices used for these tests can be expensive or inconvenient to set up. We investigated whether, how and to which extent fall risk could be assessed using a low cost ambient sensor to monitor balance tasks. METHOD: Eighty four participants, forty of which were 65 or older, performed eight simple balance tasks in front of a Microsoft Kinect sensor. Custom-made algorithms coupled to the Kinect sensor were used to automatically extract body configuration parameters such as body centroid and dispersion. Participants were then classified in two groups using a clustering method. The clusters were formed based on the parameters measured by the sensor for each balance task. For each participant, fall risk was independently assessed using known risk factors as age and average physical activity, as well as the participant's performance on the Timed Up and Go clinical test. RESULTS: Standing with a normal stance and the eyes closed on a foam pad, and standing with a narrow stance and the eyes closed on regular ground were the two balance tasks for which the classification's outcome best matched fall risk as assessed by the three known risk factors. Standing on a foam pad with eyes closed was the task driving to the most robust results. CONCLUSION: Our method constitutes a simple, fast, and reliable way to assess fall risk more often with elderly people. Importantly, this method requires very little space, time and equipment, so that it could be easily and frequently used by a large number of health professionals, and in particular by family physicians. Therefore, we believe that the use of this method would substantially contribute to improve fall prevention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CER-VD 2015-00035.

Wade_2019_Clinreha,JOUR,Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence,"Wade, Derick T. and Kitzinger, Celia",Clinical rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify the concept of best interests, setting out how they should be ascertained and used to make healthcare decisions for patients who lack the mental capacity to make decisions. CONTEXT: The legal framework is the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005, which applies to England and Wales. THEORY: Unless there is a valid and applicable Advance Decision, an appointed decision-maker needs to decide for those without capacity. This may be someone appointed by the patient through a Lasting Power of Attorney, or a Deputy appointed by the court. Otherwise the decision-maker is usually the responsible clinician. Different approaches exist to surrogate decision-making cross-nationally. In England and Wales, decision-making is governed by the MCA 2005, which uses a person-centred, flexible best interests (substituted interests) approach. OBSERVATIONS: The MCA is often not followed in healthcare settings, despite widespread mandatory training. The possible reasons include its focus on single decisions, when multiple decisions are made daily, the potential time involved and lack of clarity about who is the responsible decision-maker. SOLUTION: One solution is to decide a strategic policy to cover more significant (usually health-related) decisions and to separate these from day-to-day relational decisions covering care and activities. Once persistent lack of capacity is confirmed, an early meeting should be arranged with family and friends, to start a process of sharing information about the patient's medical condition and their values, wishes, feelings and beliefs with a view to making timely treatment decisions in the patient's best interests.",2019,10.1177/0269215519852987,33,10,1571-1585,eng,1477-0873 0269-2155,decision-making and Humans and Advance Directives and *Decision Making and Clinical Decision-Making and *Mental Competency and Professional-Family Relations and *Proxy and best interests and Mental capacity,NA,NA,2019/10//undefined,Clin Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Harari_2020_Joofneanre,JOUR,Inpatient stroke rehabilitation: prediction of clinical outcomes using a machine-learning approach,"Harari, Yaar and O'Brien, Megan K. and Lieber, Richard L. and Jayaraman, Arun",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, therapists often rely on clinical outcome measures to quantify a patient's impairment and function. Predicting a patient's discharge outcome using baseline clinical information may help clinicians design more targeted treatment strategies and better anticipate the patient's assistive needs and discharge care plan. The objective of this study was to develop predictive models for four standardized clinical outcome measures (Functional Independence Measure, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Six-Minute Walk Test, Berg Balance Scale) during inpatient rehabilitation. METHODS: Fifty stroke survivors admitted to a United States inpatient rehabilitation hospital participated in this study. Predictors chosen for the clinical discharge scores included demographics, stroke characteristics, and scores of clinical tests at admission. We used the Pearson product-moment and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to calculate correlations among clinical outcome measures and predictors, a cross-validated Lasso regression to develop predictive equations for discharge scores of each clinical outcome measure, and a Random Forest based permutation analysis to compare the relative importance of the predictors. RESULTS: The predictive equations explained 70-77% of the variance in discharge scores and resulted in a normalized error of 13-15% for predicting the outcomes of new patients. The most important predictors were clinical test scores at admission. Additional variables that affected the discharge score of at least one clinical outcome were time from stroke onset to rehabilitation admission, age, sex, body mass index, race, and diagnosis of dysphasia or speech impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The models presented in this study could help clinicians and researchers to predict the discharge scores of clinical outcomes for individuals enrolled in an inpatient stroke rehabilitation program that adheres to U.S. Medicare standards.",2020,10.1186/s12984-020-00704-3,17,1,71,eng,1743-0003,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Inpatients and *Machine Learning and *Treatment Outcome and Gait and Stroke Rehabilitation/*methods and *Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Balance and Functional Independence measure and Lasso regression and Physical therapy and Stroke/physiopathology",NA,NA,2020/06/10/,J Neuroeng Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ahmadi_2018_Joofneanre,JOUR,Machine learning algorithms for activity recognition in ambulant children and adolescents with cerebral palsy,"Ahmadi, Matthew and O'Neil, Margaret and Fragala-Pinkham, Maria and Lennon, Nancy and Trost, Stewart",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability among children (2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births). Inadequate physical activity (PA) is a major problem effecting the health and well-being of children with CP. Practical, yet accurate measures of PA are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and therapy-based interventions to increase PA. Accelerometer-based motion sensors have become the standard for objectively measuring PA in children and adolescents; however, current methods for estimating physical activity intensity in children with CP are associated with significant error and may dramatically underestimate HPA in children with more severe mobility limitations. Machine learning (ML) models that first classify the PA type and then predict PA intensity or energy expenditure using activity specific regression equations may be more accurate than standalone regression models. However, the feasibility and validity of ML methods has not been explored in youth with CP. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and test ML models for the automatic identification of PA type in ambulant children with CP. METHODS: Twenty two children and adolescents (mean age: 12.8 <c2><b1> 2.9 y) with CP classified at GMFCS Levels I to III completed 7 activity trials while wearing an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the hip and wrist. Trials were categorised as sedentary (SED), standing utilitarian movements (SUM), comfortable walking (CW), and brisk walking (BW). Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and binary decision tree (BDT) classifiers were trained with features extracted from the vector magnitude (VM) of the raw acceleration signal using 10 s non-overlapping windows. Performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject out cross validation. RESULTS: SVM (82.0-89.0%) and RF (82.6-88.8%) provided significantly better classification accuracy than BDT (76.1-86.2%). Hip (82.7-85.5%) and wrist (76.1-82.6%) classifiers exhibited comparable prediction accuracy, while the combined hip and wrist (86.2-89.0%) classifiers achieved the best overall performance. For all classifiers, recognition accuracy was excellent for SED (94.1-97.9%), good to excellent for SUM (74.0-96.6%) and brisk walking (71.5-86.0%), and modest for comfortable walking (47.6-70.4%). When comfortable and brisk walking were combined into a single walking class, recognition accuracy ranged from 90.3 to 96.5%. CONCLUSIONS: ML methods provided acceptable classification accuracy for detection of a range of activities commonly performed by ambulatory children with CP. The resultant models can help clinicians more effectively monitor bouts of brisk walking in the community. The results indicate that 2-step models that first classify PA type and then predict energy expenditure using activity specific regression equations are worthy of exploration in this patient group.",2018,10.1186/s12984-018-0456-x,15,1,105,eng,1743-0003,Wearable sensors and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and *Algorithms and *Machine Learning and *Exercise and Accelerometers and Accelerometry/*methods and Cerebral Palsy/physiopathology/*radiotherapy and CP and Feature fusion and GMFCS level and Habitual physical activity and Placement,NA,NA,2018/11/15/,J Neuroeng Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Keshner_2019_Joofneanre,JOUR,Tracking the evolution of virtual reality applications to rehabilitation as a field of study,"Keshner, Emily A. and Weiss, Patrice Tamar and Geifman, Dorit and Raban, Daphne",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Application of virtual reality (VR) to rehabilitation is relatively recent with clinical implementation very rapidly following technological advancement and scientific discovery. Implementation is often so rapid that demonstrating intervention efficacy and establishing research priorities is more reactive than proactive. This study used analytical tools from information science to examine whether application of VR to rehabilitation has evolved as a distinct field of research or is primarily a methodology in core disciplines such as biomedical engineering, medicine and psychology. METHODS: The analysis was performed in three-stages: 1) a bibliographic search in the ISI Web of Science database created an initial corpus of publications, 2) the corpus was refined through topic modeling, and 3) themes dominating the corpus from the refined search results were identified by topic modeling and network analytics. This was applied separately to each of three time periods: 1996 to 2005 (418 publications), 2006 to 2014 (1454 publications), and 2015 to mid-2018 (1269 publications). RESULTS: Publication rates have continuously increased across time periods with principal topics shifting from an emphasis on computer science and psychology to rehabilitation and public health. No terminology specific to the field of VR-based rehabilitation emerged; rather a range of central concepts including ""virtual reality"", ""virtual gaming"", ""virtual environments"", ""simulated environments"" continue to be used. Communities engaged in research or clinical application of VR form assemblages distinguished by a focus on physical or psychological rehabilitation; these appear to be weakly linked through tele-rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Varying terms exemplify the main corpus of VR-based rehabilitation and terms are not consistent across the many scientific domains. Numerous distinguishable areas of research and clinical foci (e.g., Tele-rehabilitation, Gait & Balance, Cognitive Rehabilitation, Gaming) define the agenda. We conclude that VR-based rehabilitation consists of a network of scientific communities with a shared interest in the methodology rather than a directed and focused research field. An interlinked team approach is important to maintain scientific rigor and technological validity within this diverse group. Future studies should examine how these interdisciplinary communities individually define themselves with the goals of gathering knowledge and working collectively toward disseminating information essential to associated research communities.",2019,10.1186/s12984-019-0552-6,16,1,76,eng,1743-0003,Humans and Terminology as Topic and Interdisciplinary and Topic modeling and *Virtual Reality and Rehabilitation/*methods/standards and Scientific communities and Virtual rehabilitation,NA,NA,2019/06/21/,J Neuroeng Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Young_2016_Joofneanre,JOUR,Exploratory analysis of real personal emergency response call conversations: considerations for personal emergency response spoken dialogue systems,"Young, Victoria and Rochon, Elizabeth and Mihailidis, Alex",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to derive data from real, recorded, personal emergency response call conversations to help improve the artificial intelligence and decision making capability of a spoken dialogue system in a smart personal emergency response system. The main study objectives were to: develop a model of personal emergency response; determine categories for the model's features; identify and calculate measures from call conversations (verbal ability, conversational structure, timing); and examine conversational patterns and relationships between measures and model features applicable for improving the system's ability to automatically identify call model categories and predict a target response. METHODS: This study was exploratory and used mixed methods. Personal emergency response calls were pre-classified according to call model categories identified qualitatively from response call transcripts. The relationships between six verbal ability measures, three conversational structure measures, two timing measures and three independent factors: caller type, risk level, and speaker type, were examined statistically. RESULTS: Emergency medical response services were the preferred response for the majority of medium and high risk calls for both caller types. Older adult callers mainly requested non-emergency medical service responders during medium risk situations. By measuring the number of spoken words-per-minute and turn-length-in-words for the first spoken utterance of a call, older adult and care provider callers could be identified with moderate accuracy. Average call taker response time was calculated using the number-of-speaker-turns and time-in-seconds measures. Care providers and older adults used different conversational strategies when responding to call takers. The words 'ambulance' and 'paramedic' may hold different latent connotations for different callers. CONCLUSIONS: The data derived from the real personal emergency response recordings may help a spoken dialogue system classify incoming calls by caller type with moderate probability shortly after the initial caller utterance. Knowing the caller type, the target response for the call may be predicted with some degree of probability and the output dialogue could be tailored to this caller type. The average call taker response time measured from real calls may be used to limit the conversation length in a spoken dialogue system before defaulting to a live call taker.",2016,10.1186/s12984-016-0207-9,13,1,97,eng,1743-0003,"Artificial intelligence and Human-computer interaction and Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Aged and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and *Language and Emergency Medical Services/*methods and Aging-in-place and Conversation analysis and Dialogue planning and Personal emergency response system",NA,NA,2016/11/14/,J Neuroeng Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Paynter_2022_Disandreh,JOUR,How people living with motor neurone disease and their carers experience healthcare decision making: a qualitative exploration,"Paynter, C. and Mathers, S. and Gregory, H. and Vogel, A. P. and Cruice, M.",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: Healthcare decision making in motor neurone disease (MND) focuses on symptom management and quality of life. Decision making may be affected by personal approach to receiving information, decision making style, and disease symptoms. This study explored decision making from the perspectives of people living with motor neurone disease (plwMND). The issues impacting engagement and involvement in healthcare decisions were investigated. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 plwMND and 15 carers. Interview data was inductively analysed to identify and describe patterns and themes. RESULTS: Data analysis identified six overarching themes: Dimensions of decision making; Window of opportunity for choice; Intrinsic influences on decision making; Extrinsic influences impacting decision making; Planning in uncertainty; and, Communication is core. Many participants did not identify a process of ""decision-making"" except if considering early gastrostomy placement. Information provision requires a balance between ensuring patients are informed but not overwhelmed. Communication impairment impacts involvement. Healthcare professionals' communication style influences engagement in decision making. CONCLUSION: PlwMND perceive a lack of clinical decisions to make because disease symptoms and clinical phenotypes dictate necessary interventions. PlwMND describe communication impairment as a barrier to involvement in decision making and extra support is required to ensure they maintain engagement.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPeople living with MND (plwMND) perceive they have few clinical decisions to make and viewed this process as ""accepting a recommendation"", rather than ""making a decision"" although early gastrostomy placement is the exception with considerable deliberation evident.Specialist multidisciplinary clinic advice is especially helpful for plwMND without dysphagia (swallowing problems) when considering early gastrostomy placement.Communication impairment may be a barrier to involvement in healthcare decisions and extra support to remain engaged is required.Some plwMND choose not to involve others in their decisions, and patients/families with medical or scientific backgrounds are more likely to collaborate with each other outside the context of clinic appointments.",2022,10.1080/09638288.2020.1855261,44,13,3095-3103,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,Uncertainty and Humans and Delivery of Health Care and Decision Making and qualitative research and shared decision making and Caregivers and Qualitative Research and Quality of Life and *Deglutition Disorders/etiology and *Motor Neuron Disease/complications and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dysarthria and gastrostomy and motor neurone disease,NA,NA,2022/06//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Douglas_2020_Disandreh,JOUR,Development of an evidence-based practice framework to guide decision making support for people with cognitive impairment due to acquired brain injury or intellectual disability,"Douglas, Jacinta and Bigby, Christine",Disability and rehabilitation,"Purpose: At least 5% of people in Australia and the USA have cognitive impairment and require support for decision-making. This paper details a research program whereby an evidence-based Support for Decision Making Practice Framework has been developed for those who support people with cognitive disabilities to make their own decisions across life domains.Methods: The La Trobe framework was derived from a research program modeled on the Medical Research Council four-phase approach to development and evaluation of complex interventions. We completed phase one (development) by: (1) systematically reviewing peer-reviewed literature; and (2) undertaking qualitative exploration of the experience of support for decision-making from the perspectives of people with cognitive disabilities and their supporters through seven grounded theory studies. Results of phase two (feasibility and piloting) involving direct support workers and health professionals supported phase three (evaluation) and four (implementation), currently underway.Results: The framework outlines the steps, principles, and strategies involved in support for decision-making. It focuses on understanding the will and preferences of people with cognitive disabilities and guides those who provide support including families, support workers, guardians, and health professionals.Conclusions: This framework applies across diverse contemporary contexts and is the first evidence-based guide to support for decision-making.Implications for RehabilitationSupport for decision-making is essential to maximise the participation of people with cognitive disability in decisions about their lives.Research has shown that support for decision making is a complex multifaceted process comprising multiple overlapping steps, delivered through individually tailored strategies and informed by practice principles.The La Trobe practice framework provides an evidence-based guide for engaging in effective support for decision-making with people with cognitive disability.",2020,10.1080/09638288.2018.1498546,42,3,434-441,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,Humans and Patient Participation and Grounded Theory and Health Personnel and Professional Role and *Decision Making and Australia/epidemiology and *Cognitive Dysfunction/etiology/psychology/rehabilitation and *Evidence-Based Practice/methods/organization & administration and *Intellectual Disability/etiology/psychology/rehabilitation and *Psychosocial Support Systems and acquired brain injury and Brain Injuries/*complications and cognitive disabilities and intellectual disability and practice framework and Support for decision-making and supported decision making,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

The cost of hospitalization for stroke is high. It is desirable to consider a patient's discharge destination soon after onset and thereby screen patients for further care. This study aims to review the evidence of factors that determine discharge destinations after acute phase of stroke in adult patients. METHODS: The systematic literature search was performed in seven databases. This systematic review was conducted by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA statement). Full-text articles were included and assessed for methodological quality by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were selected that demonstrate factors defining discharge destination. Younger age, good post-stroke admission to a teaching hospital, and a number of medical factors are determinants to a favorable discharge destination. Determinants for unfavorable discharge destinations were a severe stroke, high body mass index, alcohol abuse, statin withdrawal during hospitalization, the presence of comorbidities like respiratory failure and dementia or having a Medicaid insurance.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional multicenter study. SETTING: Ten inpatient rehabilitation centers in Germany. SUBJECTS: The CCRQ was completed by patients in the ten rehabilitation centers. MAIN MEASURES: The psychometric analysis of the CCRQ was conducted using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The CCRQ was completed by 496 patients (average age: 59 years; 59.7% women). The CCRQ's 7-factor structure could not be confirmed. Factor analysis showed that the three latent constructs ""decision-making/communication"", ""self-management/empowerment"", and ""psychosocial well-being"" (60.73% variance explained) adequately represent patient-centeredness in medical rehabilitation assessed by the CCRQ.

T.",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To compare the attitudes and preferences of persons with spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) and healthcare providers regarding prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and natural health products (NHPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers (n = 32) and persons with SCI/D (n = 19) in Canada. Inductive descriptive and interpretive analyses were conducted using data display matrices and a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: Participants described differing perceptions of therapeutic benefits based on medication type, with shared attitudes about the therapeutic benefits of prescription medications and differing views about the effectiveness of NHPs. Despite the perceived effectiveness of prescription medications, persons with SCI/D preferred to avoid them due to concerns about side effects, safety, and stigma. Persons with SCI/D were often concerned about the long-term safety of prescription medications, whereas providers focused more on medication-related addictions. Participants discussed stigma relating to prescription medications, NHPs, and medicinal marijuana. CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers and persons with SCI/D described different attitudes about and preferences for pharmacotherapeutic products, contributing to challenges in optimizing medication management. Strategies to improve medication management include shared decision-making to incorporate patient preferences into care plans and explicit discussions about long-term medication safety. Further, steps are needed to combat the stigma associated with medication use.Implications for rehabilitationFollowing a person-centered approach to shared decision-making, prescribers should initiate explicit conversations about patient medication preferences, short and long-term prescription medication side effects, and alternative treatment options.Regarding prescription medication safety, persons with spinal cord injury/dysfunction focused on the long term impact of medications, while providers focused on medication-related addictions, highlighting a disconnect that should be discussed during initiation, continuation, or discontinuation of a medication.Providers should be mindful of the stigma associated with taking multiple prescription medications, including medicinal marijuana, as well as the stigma associated with over-the-counter medications and natural health products.Providers could benefit from education about spinal cord injury/dysfunction-specific prescription medications and could benefit from increased education about natural health products.",2022,10.1080/09638288.2020.1799249,44,8,1252-1259,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,Humans and Qualitative Research and Health Personnel and medication management and Patient Preference and shared decision-making and health personnel and *Medical Marijuana/therapeutic use and *Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/drug therapy and natural health products and Patient attitudes and preferences and prescription medications,NA,NA,2022/04//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yeh_2017_Disandreh,JOUR,Factors related to the indecision of older adults with knee osteoarthritis about receiving physician-recommended total knee arthroplasty,"Yeh, Wen-Ling and Tsai, Yun-Fang and Hsu, Kuo-Yao and Chen, Dave Weichih and Chen, Ching-Yen",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To explore factors related to the indecision of older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA) about receiving physician-recommended total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and their needs during the decision-making process. METHOD: Older outpatients with knee OA and undecided about physician-recommended TKA (N = 26) were recruited by convenience from two medical centers and one regional hospital in northern Taiwan. Data were collected in individual interviews using a semi-structured guide and analyzed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants' indecision about receiving physician-recommended TKA was due to four major concerns: treatment-related concerns, physical condition-related concerns, surgery-related concerns, and postsurgical care concerns. The few participants (n = 6) who expressed needs during the decision-making process wanted more information about preparing for surgery, postsurgical care, rehabilitation, and medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers are challenged to respect the decision-making process of older adults with OA regarding recommended TKA while maintaining their quality of life. These adults need appropriate information not only about the relationship between OA suffering and quality of life, but also TKA. While these patients are deciding whether to undergo physician-recommended TKA, they also need information about preparations for surgery, postsurgical care, rehabilitation, and medicines. Implications for Rehabilitation Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can significantly relieve pain and improve function for older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA), but many are unwilling to receive the surgery. Our older adult participants with knee OA ascribed their indecision about receiving physician-recommended TKA to treatment-related, physical condition-related, surgery-related, and postsurgical care-related concerns. Healthcare providers need to provide appropriate information to older adults with knee OA not only about the relationship between OA suffering and quality of life, but also about TKA. Healthcare providers should also provide these patients information about preparing for surgery, postsurgical care, rehabilitation, and medicines while they are deciding whether to undergo TKA.",2017,10.1080/09638288.2016.1226407,39,22,2302-2307,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and decision making and Interviews as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and Patient Education as Topic and Quality of Life and Health Services Needs and Demand and Sampling Studies and Osteoarthritis and needs and *Decision Making and Taiwan and older adults and total knee arthroplasty and *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee and Osteoarthritis, Knee/*surgery",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

With longer life expectancy the number of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures being performed worldwide is projected to increase dramatically. Patient education, physical activity, bodyweight levels, expectations and goals regarding the ability to continue athletic activity participation are also increasing. For the subset of motivated patients with knee osteoarthritis who have athletic activity approach type goals, early TKA may not be the best knee osteoarthritis treatment option to improve satisfaction, quality of life and outcomes. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to present a conceptual decision-making model designed to improve the knee osteoarthritis treatment intervention outcome for motivated patients with athletic activity approach type goals. The model focuses on improving knee surgeon, patient and rehabilitation clinician dialogue by rank ordering routine activities of daily living and quality of life evoking athletic activities based on knee symptom exacerbation or re-injury risk. This process should help establish realistic patient expectations and goals for a given knee osteoarthritis treatment intervention that will more likely improve self-efficacy, functional independence, satisfaction and outcomes while decreasing the failure risk associated with early TKA.",2011,10.3109/09638288.2010.533816,33,17-18,1683-1692,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Patient Satisfaction and Quality of Life and Activities of Daily Living and Self Efficacy and Recovery of Function and *Motivation and *Goals and Osteoarthritis, Knee/*surgery and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*rehabilitation and Exercise/*physiology/*psychology",NA,NA,2011///,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since employment-related demands and challenges pose a potential source of strain regarding employees' health and work ability, rehabilitative treatment in Germany is increasingly geared towards including work-related issues in diagnostics and therapy. To date, German rehabilitation research and practice have focussed primarily on the development of screening instruments for identifying vocational problems, interface management and inter-sectoral cooperation and the specification and standardisation of vocationally oriented interventions and programmes (e.g. work hardening, group interventions). Further developments in VOMR should examine the varying needs of patients for work-related interventions as well as the neglect of specific subgroups of patients (e.g. long-term unemployed) and topics (e.g. interference between work and other life domains).",2011,10.3109/09638288.2011.575528,33,25-26,2646-2655,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"Humans and Adult and Chronic Disease and Decision Making and Delphi Technique and Germany and *Rehabilitation, Vocational/statistics & numerical data and Counseling/organization & administration and Occupational Therapy/organization & administration and Rehabilitation/organization & administration",NA,NA,2011///,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sakellariou_2013_Disandreh,JOUR,Experiences of living with motor neurone disease: a review of qualitative research,"Sakellariou, Dikaios and Boniface, Gail and Brown, Paul",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: This review sought to answer the question ""what is known about people's experiences of living with MND?"". METHODS: The review followed the guidelines of the Centre of Reviews and Dissemination. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria and their results were analysed thematically. Data were managed and coded using the software package NVIVO and the analysis was performed in two stages, with the first stage aiming to develop descriptive themes offering an overview of the included data. During the second stage, analytical themes were developed with the explicit aim to answer the review question. RESULTS: The themes that emerged point to the following: (a) people with motor neurone disease (MND) develop experiential knowledge that helps them to live with the disease and (b) while people with MND believe they do not have any control over the disease, they try to have control over their lives through active choices, e.g. how and when to use adaptive equipment. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the decision-making and knowledge generating processes used by people with MND. Further research is required to explore these processes and their implications for the care of people with MND. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Decision-making process by MND patients regarding their care is complex and takes into account the social elements of the disease as well as the medical.

Cowey_2012_Clinreha,JOUR,Urinary catheterization in acute stroke: clinical realities. A mixed methods study,"Cowey, Eileen and Smith, Lorraine N. and Booth, Jo and Weir, Christopher J.",Clinical rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To determine what influences the decision to insert an indwelling urinary catheter in acute stroke patients. DESIGN: A prospective casenote review and semi-structured interviews were conducted and corporate catheterization policy in the study sites was investigated. SETTING: Three teaching hospitals, typical of stroke service provision in most developed countries. SUBJECTS: Casenotes from 70 consecutive acute stroke admissions; 50 doctors, nurses and physiotherapists working in acute stroke units and medical receiving units. RESULTS: Stroke patients were catheterized for output monitoring, relief of urinary retention or, especially for older patients, continence-related issues. Half of all catheterizations occurred in acute stroke units. Continence and catheterization were considered less important than other aspects of acute stroke care. No catheterization policy or standardized continence assessment tool was in use. Documentation was often lacking. Patients and relatives were not fully involved in the decision to catheterize. Continence assessment and catheterization practices varied widely. Complex unwritten rules relating to gender proliferated. Such rules demonstrated heuristic problem-solving could potentially cause conflict. Decisions to catheterize 'belonged' to doctors or nurses depending upon clinical indications. Clinical assessment and specialist referrals were often seen as 'not my job'. CONCLUSIONS: Clear corporate policy on catheterization is required to direct practice. Use of standardized continence assessment tools is recommended to set and monitor standards of care.

DESIGN: Longitudinal study comparing controls and patients with TBI 1 month after injury (t1) and 6 months after injury (t2). SETTING: Inpatient TBI rehabilitation unit and outpatient neurology department. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=151) consisted of control subjects (n=60) and patients with TBI (n=91) stratified by injury severity: mild TBI (mTBI; n=27), complicated mild TBI (cmTBI; n=20), and moderate/severe TBI (msevTBI; n=44). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument to evaluate MDC performance on 5 consent standards (expressing choice, reasonable choice, appreciation, reasoning, and understanding). We also assigned capacity impairment ratings on the consent standards to each participant with TBI using cut scores referenced to control performance. RESULTS: Control performance was stable across time on the consent standards. Patients with mTBI and cmTBI performed below controls on the understanding standard at t1 but not t2. Patients with msevTBI performed below controls on appreciation, reasoning, and understanding at t1, and on appreciation and understanding at t2, but showed substantial improvement over time. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of injury severity, all groups with TBI demonstrated baseline impairment of MDC with subsequent partial or full recovery of MDC over a 6-month period. However, a sizeable proportion of individual patients with TBI in each group continued to demonstrate capacity compromise at 6 months postinjury.

Kyrola_2021_Disandreh,JOUR,Further validation of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-30) questionnaire among adult patients with degenerative spinal disorder,"Kyrola, Kati and Hakkinen, Arja H. and Ylinen, Jari and Repo, Jussi P.",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-30) questionnaire proved valid in measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients with spinal deformity or degenerative disease. This study further assesses the validity of the SRS-30 by comparing its results with other HRQoL instruments, such as Oswestry disability index (ODI) and the RAND-36, among unselected adult patients with degenerative spinal disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 628 consecutive patients completed the SRS-30, the ODI, the pain visual analog scale (VAS), and RAND-36 questionnaires. Using a 9 mm minimal important difference threshold of the VAS, patients were divided into three groups of symptom location: back pain (n = 226), lower extremity pain (n = 161), and combination of both (n = 241). Statistical and illustrative tests using beta coefficients, Rasch measurement analytics, and score distributions were used for analysis. RESULTS: The SRS-30 functioned well for all three subgroups. There were small differences in convergent validity of the SRS-30 compared to the ODI and the RAND-36 between the three subgroups. The SRS-30 performed similarly in different pain groups independent of age, gender, or deformity severity. The scale displayed good coverage and targeting for all three subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SRS-30 proved to provide valid HRQoL scores for all adult patients with degenerative spinal disorders. Implications for Rehabilitation Degenerative spinal conditions associated with spinal deformities are common in patients over 60 years. Low back pain is globally the leading cause of disability. The applicability of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-30) questionnaire has not been tested in relation to different pain origins. The SRS-30 proved to provide valid health-related quality of life assessment among patients with degenerative spinal disease independent of pain location.

Turesson_2019_Disandreh,JOUR,Patients' needs during a surgical intervention process for Dupuytren's disease,"Turesson, Christina and Kvist, Joanna and Krevers, Barbro",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To explore and describe clients' needs during a surgical intervention process for Dupuytren's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Design: Interview study with 21 men undergoing surgical intervention for Dupuytren's disease. Qualitative content analysis was performed with the model of Patient Evaluation Process as a theoretical framework. RESULTS: The primary reason for seeking medical care was to receive an intervention to improve hand function. The need for knowledge was evident during the care process, and was connected to involvement in decision-making. During surgery and rehabilitation, participants needed support with pain relief, a sense of security, support for self-care, or sick leave. There was also a need for participation in the evaluation and improvement of care. Clients' life situations contributed to the occurrence of needs or were a resource for handling them. Depending on patient character, clients handled their perceived needs differently. CONCLUSIONS: Clients' needs during a surgical intervention process include needs for improvement of hand function, knowledge, and support during treatment, and participation in evaluation. Clients' needs change during the care process and can be influenced by their life situation or their character. The identified needs ought to be included in quality assessments from the carers' perspective, to ensure that important needs of the clients are met by the surgical intervention process. Communication and interaction between client and health care provider is a key aspect of fulfilling clients' needs. Implications for rehabilitation Patients have need for knowledge throughout the care process: about the disease, risk factors, treatment options, practical and medical information related to the treatment and recovery, and about the care process as a whole. Need for knowledge is closely connected to patients' experience of being involved in decision making. Patients need support with both general human and specific medical issues during surgery and rehabilitation.

Moore_2019_Disandreh,JOUR,Interpreting intracorporeal landscapes: how patients visualize pathophysiology and utilize medical images in their understanding of chronic musculoskeletal illness,"Moore, Andrew J. and Richardson, Jane C. and Bernard, Miriam and Sim, Julius",Disability and rehabilitation,"Medical science and other sources, such as the media, increasingly inform the general public's understanding of disease. There is often discordance between this understanding and the diagnostic interpretations of health care practitioners (HCPs). In this paper - based on a supra-analysis of qualitative interview data from two studies of joint pain, including osteoarthritis - we investigate how people imagine and make sense of the pathophysiology of their illness, and how these understandings may affect self-management behavior. We then explore how HCPs' use of medical images and models can inform patients' understanding. In conceptualizing their illness to make sense of their experience of the disease, individuals often used visualizations of their inner body; these images may arise from their own lay understanding, or may be based on images provided by HCPs. When HCPs used anatomical models or medical images judiciously, patients' orientation to their illness changed. Including patients in a more collaborative diagnostic event that uses medical images and visual models to support explanations about their condition may help them to achieve a more meaningful understanding of their illness and to manage their condition more effectively. Implications for Rehabilitation Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of pain and years lived with disability, and despite its being common, patients and healthcare professionals often have a different understanding of the underlying disease. An individual's understanding of his or her pathophysiology plays an important role in making sense of painful joint conditions and in decision-making about self-management and care. Including patients in a more collaborative diagnostic event using medical images and anatomical models to support explanations about their symptoms may help them to better understand their condition and manage it more effectively. Using visually informed explanations and anatomical models may also help to reassure patients about the safety and effectiveness of core treatments such as physical exercise and thereby help restore or improve patients' activity levels and return to social participation.",2019,10.1080/09638288.2018.1443162,41,14,1647-1654,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"Humans and Female and Male and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Disease Management and pain and Medical Illustration and Sampling Studies and Diagnostic Imaging and *Patient Education as Topic and *Comprehension and Models, Anatomic and *Chronic Disease and Self-Management and osteoarthritis and *Imagination and Musculoskeletal Diseases/*physiopathology and Pathophysiology and patient information and practitioner-patient communication",NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews with medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists were conducted from three geriatric rehabilitation hospitals in Ontario. Qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach was used to identify barriers to and facilitators of outcome measurement in geriatric rehabilitation settings. RESULTS: A total of 20 healthcare providers from different disciplines were interviewed. Barriers are standardized outcome measures that (1) cannot be used in isolation to inform clinical decision-making for older patients, (2) are difficult to complete and interpret in older complex patients, (3) may not be useful for all members of the clinical team and (4) are used for reasons unrelated to patient care. Facilitators are to (1) divide the standardized outcome measure into components that are useful for each team member's practice, (2) encourage standardized outcome measures as tools for improving daily communication and (3) provide adequate education and support for their daily use. CONCLUSION: This study revealed important barriers to using standardized outcome measures in geriatric rehabilitation from the perspective of healthcare providers.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional semiquantitative survey. SETTING: Five specialized neurologic rehabilitation facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of primary family members (N=44) of patients with DOC as determined by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, surveyed 6 months after the patient's brain injury. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perception of level of consciousness as compared with the medical diagnosis; assessment of communicative status and prognosis; and practice of treatment decision-making. RESULTS: The study included 44 family members of patients, most of whom had sustained global cerebral ischemia. Six months after brain injury, 36% were in a vegetative state (VS), 20% were in a minimally conscious state (MCS), and 39% had emerged from an MCS. In 76% of cases, the relatives assumed the same level of consciousness that diagnostic tests showed. In the other cases, consciousness was mostly underestimated. While relatives of patients in a VS, and to a lesser extent of those in an MCS, were more skeptical about the patients' chances to advance to an independent life, all had high hopes that the patients would regain the ability to communicate. Yet, 59% of family members had thought about limiting life-sustaining treatment. Most of them base treatment decisions on the patient's well-being; very few relied on previously expressed patient wishes. CONCLUSIONS: According to our sample, family members of patients with DOC largely assess the level of consciousness correctly and express high hopes to reestablish communication with the patient.",2015,10.1016/j.apmr.2014.09.030,96,2,323-330,eng,1532-821X 0003-9993,"Diagnosis and Decision making and Ethics and Rehabilitation and Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Perception and Prognosis and Aged, 80 and over and *Decision Making and Patient Acuity and Consciousness and Life Support Care and Family members and Consciousness Disorders/*diagnosis and Euthanasia, Passive and Nuclear Family/*psychology and Persistent vegetative state and Persistent Vegetative State/diagnosis",NA,NA,2015/02//undefined,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

Landstad_2009_Disandreh,JOUR,Factors explaining return to work for long-term sick workers in Norway,"Landstad, Bodil J. and Wendelborg, Christian and Hedlund, Marianne",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: This study investigates factors that will affect the chances of long-term sick workers returning to work. METHOD: The study is based on a representative sample of persons with mental illnesses and musculoskeletal disorders who received a rehabilitation allowance in Norway in 2002. Their occupational status in 2005 and experiences from the rehabilitation process were charted through their responses to a questionnaire in combination with national register data. Our analytical framework is based on three domains: the medical domain, the domain of authoritative bodies and the production domain (working life), as described by Lindqvist (Att satta granser: organisationer och reformer i arbetsrehabiliteringen. Umea: Borea; 2000). RESULTS: Our main findings are that earlier work experience, age and other members in household, in addition, to influence over one's own rehabilitation process explains whether workers on long-term sick leave return to work. Furthermore, individual factors such as gender and diagnosis (i.e. musculoskeletal disorder and mental illness) do not explain the probability to return to work. Experience and contact with representatives of the medical, the authoritative bodies and the production domain only explain to a small extent the probability to return to work. It is even interesting to note that regular contact with the social insurance office (SIO) has a negative effect on the probability to return to work. This may indicate that contact with the SIO subjects sick workers to a risk of developing a 'social insurance career' to secure their income. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that the medical, the authoritative bodies and the production domain might represent different logics that can pull a sick worker in different directions during the rehabilitation process. However, these different logics do not fully explain, which outcome a rehabilitation process takes. It is important to extend the analysis to include how the individuals respond to these logics during the rehabilitation process.",2009,10.1080/09638280802510999,31,15,1215-1226,eng,0963-8288,Humans and Logistic Models and Decision Making and Norway and Sick Leave and *Occupational Health and Work Capacity Evaluation and Chronic Disease/*rehabilitation and *Employment,NA,NA,2009///,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHOD: Twelve healthcare professionals working in the neurological and the Accident and Emergency (A&E) units of an acute general hospital participated and experimental control was achieved by employing a pre-test post-test control group experimental design. Members of the control group used the current reasoning model of their discipline whereas the new integrated model was used by the members of the experimental group irrespective of their professions. Outcomes were measured by scoring on a protocol derived from the UK National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke divided into the three main clinical reasoning processes. RESULTS: Collectively, data from 186 protocols based on the medical records of 49 patients showed that median percentages of correct responses in clinical reasoning were substantially higher for the experimental group by using the new integrated model.

OH professionals figure prominently in formal and informal decision-making around fitness within education and employment settings, regardless of regulatory prescriptions. There is a multitude of approaches. There are, however, particular issues in the deployment of OH expertise within the employment setting. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of fitness should not rely solely on medical information. Blanket fitness requirements that are not contextualized against specific competencies for particular jobs are inappropriate. More collaborative and integrated working is necessary, particularly in exploring how reasonable adjustments may be provided to enable safe and effective practice. The positive spirit of the disability equality duty should be embraced.",2009,10.1080/09638280903031572,31,18,1520-1528,eng,0963-8288,"Humans and United Kingdom and Students, Nursing and Occupational Health and Disabled Persons/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Work Capacity Evaluation and Social Work/education and Civil Rights/*legislation & jurisprudence and Faculty and Personnel Selection/*legislation & jurisprudence/*standards and School Admission Criteria",NA,NA,2009///,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Downs, J.",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To develop a consensus statement for the prescription of a Powered Wheelchair Standing Device (PWSD) in young people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An international multidisciplinary panel comprising clinicians and users (young people with DMD) along with their parents was consulted. A literature review was undertaken and a Delphi method was utilised to generate consensus statements. To supplement limited literature, round one of the Delphi process comprised questions consistent with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model of disability to generate items based on expert opinion and was completed by 38 clinicians and nine users. Thirty-seven participants completed two further rounds rating the importance of each item with a five-point scale. Agreement of 70% or more participants for items indicated consensus. RESULTS: Consensus was reached for 47 of 80 items. Tolerance and comfort in supported standing for at least 10 min, ankle contracture less than 10 degrees and user goals reflecting motivation to use the standing function were agreed as necessary in guiding the decision to trial a PWSD. Evidence of family, therapist and servicing support were also considered critical in enabling continuity of PWSD use. CONCLUSIONS: PWSD is a mobility option that offers choice, control and opportunity for independence. This consensus statement can assist clinicians with decision-making around factors influencing successful implementation and optimisation of PWSD for young people with DMD.Implications for RehabilitationTolerance and comfort in supported standing for at least 10 minutes, ankle contracture limited to less than 10 degrees and the child's goals reflecting motivation to use the standing position were agreed to be necessary considerations in guiding the decision to trial a PWSD.Trialling a PWSD when the child is predicted to lose the ability to walk within a one to two year period was recommended although a PWSD could be suitable for a child who was unable to walk.Evidence of family, therapist and servicing support was considered critical in enabling continuity of PWSD use.",2022,10.1080/09638288.2020.1810786,44,10,1889-1897,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"Humans and Adolescent and Prescriptions and Child and Delphi Technique and Delphi technique and clinical decision-making and *Wheelchairs and *Contracture and *Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne and Duchenne muscular dystrophy and durable medical equipment and posture rehabilitation and powered standing wheelchair devices and Standing Position and wheelchairs",NA,NA,2022/05//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using machine learning, video titles/descriptions about home exercise ordered by relevance populated on YouTube between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 were examined.

Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD. The global pause the pandemic has induced may be the right moment to construct a comprehensive, indexed digital library of home-based fitness video content for the disabled. There is a further need for more nuanced understandings of accessibility as technological advancements continue.Implications for RehabilitationPhysical activity is incredibly important to the quality of life and health of all people.Physical activity levels, however, remain lower among persons with disabilities.Access to disability-friendly resources remains a challenge and worsened by the circumstances of COVID-19 due to an apparent lack of digital fitness resources for persons with disabilities.A broader and comprehensive definition of accessibility must recognize digital advances and access to physical activity for persons with disabilities must feature digital resources.",2022,10.1080/09638288.2020.1854873,44,13,3301-3303,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,Humans and Exercise and Pandemics and Quality of Life and Accessibility and *COVID-19 and *Disabled Persons and digital resources and home exercise and inclusive and people with disabilities,NA,NA,2022/06//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patients, so impaired, have lost their decision-making capacity and the ability to direct their own care. Surrogates-family members, friends, or other intimates-must step in and make decisions about ongoing care or its withdrawal. This article shares the narrative experiences of these surrogate decision makers as they encounter the American health care system and accompany patients from injury through rehabilitation. Through their perspectives, the article considers challenges to ongoing care and rehabilitation that are a function of a prevailing medical infrastructure and reimbursement framework better suited to patients with acute care needs. Specific attention is paid to the ethical challenges posed by reimbursement strategies such as ""medical necessity"" as well as those proposed for the Affordable Care Act.

The aim of this paper is to explore the childbearing experience of women with MS to determine what support and information may be useful to this target group. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with women with MS (n = 9). Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the interviews with women living with MS. We found women were concerned about both medical and practical issues associated with having children. Limited access to information about relationships between MS and childbearing and receiving conflicting or wrong information was recounted. Opinions of family members and clinicians regarding having children in the context of MS impacted on women's experience of making decision about having children and childbearing.

DESIGN: A prospective 3-part study: (1) consensus identification of influential factors in mobilization via survey; (2) development of an early rehabilitation decision tree; (3) measurement of practitioner mobilization decision-making. Treating practitioners of patients expected to stay >96 hours were asked if they would provide out-of-bed rehabilitation and rank factors that influenced this decision from an a priori defined list developed from a literature review and expert consultation. SETTING: Four tertiary metropolitan ICUs. PARTICIPANTS: Practitioners (ICU medical, nursing, and physiotherapy staff) (N=507). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A decision tree was constructed using binary recursive partitioning to determine the factor that best classified patients suitable for out-of-bed rehabilitation. Descriptive statistics were used to describe practitioner and patient samples as well as patient adverse events associated with out-of-bed rehabilitation and the factors prioritized by ICU practitioners. RESULTS: There were 1520 practitioner decisions representing 472 individual patient decisions. Practitioners classified patients suitable for out-of-bed rehabilitation on 149 occasions and not suitable on 323 occasions. Decision tree analysis showed the presence of an endotracheal tube (ETT) and sedation state were the only discriminative variables that predicted patient suitability for rehabilitation. In contrast, medical staff and nurses reported that ventilator status was the most influential factor in their decision not to provide rehabilitation while physiotherapists ranked sedation most highly. The presence of muscle weakness did not inform the decision to provide rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: These results confirm previous observational reports that the presence of an ETT remains a major obstacle to the provision of rehabilitation for critically ill patients.

This paper describes the implementation of the ICF and its utility in the assessment process and eligibility determination of students for special education. METHODS: A study to evaluate the utility of the ICF was commissioned by the Portuguese Ministry of Education and carried out by an external evaluation team. A document analysis was made of the assessment and eligibility processes of 237 students, selected from a nationally representative sample. RESULTS: The results provided support for the use of the ICF in student assessment and in the multidimensional approach of generating student functioning profiles as the basis for determining eligibility. The use of the ICF contributed to the differentiation of eligible and non eligible students based on their functioning profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the applicability of the ICF framework and classification system for determining eligibility for special education services on the basis of student functioning rather than medical or psychological diagnose.

METHOD: A formal decision-making process was applied. First, national meetings suggested categories to be included in the core set. Thereafter, the members of EUMASS working group for ICF selected a core set based on these suggestions, in a formal voting procedure. RESULTS: From 191 different suggestions for ICF categories given by the national meetings, 20 were selected for the core set. Five were from body functions and 15 from activities and participation. No category from environmental factors was included. CONCLUSION: The EUMASS working group successfully reached consensus on a core set for functional assessments in disability benefit claims. The core set is generic, and should be used by medical doctors. It is intended for evaluation of rights to long term benefits.

METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ageline, AMED and Global Health) were systematically searched for post-2000 publications on discharge readiness of adult inpatients in sub-acute settings. After screening, quantitative and qualitative studies were assessed for bias using the Downs and Black checklist and McMaster critical assessment tool respectively, and narrative analysis conducted. RESULTS: From the 3516 papers identified, 23 were included in the review. Overall quality of articles was rated as adequate. Narrative synthesis identified three main themes: the importance of functional outcomes; confounding factors impact on discharge destination and length of stay and barriers and facilitators to discharge. CONCLUSION: Despite limited literature defining sub-acute patients' discharge-readiness from all stakeholders' perspectives, synthesis of available findings identified major themes for consideration when determining when a patient is ready to leave hospital.

METHODS: A prospective, observational, cohort study was conducted with consecutive ICU patients who had stayed in a mixed, closed-format, university-level ICU for longer than 48 h. RESULTS: Between 3 and 7 days of discharge from the ICU, functional status (as primary outcome), walking ability, muscle strength, and sensory and cognitive functioning were assessed in 69 survivors. The overall functional status was poor (median Barthel Index 6). In their ability to perform basic activities of daily living, 67% percent were severely dependent, 15% were moderately dependent, and 9% were slightly dependent on other people. Independent walking was impossible for 73% of participants, grip strength was reduced for 50%, and 30% had cognitive impairments. Duration of ventilation was associated with functional status after ICU discharge. Reduced grip strength and walking ability were identified as explanatory factors for poorer functional status shortly after discharge from the ICU. CONCLUSION: In the first week after discharge from the ICU, the majority of the patients had substantial functional disabilities in activities of daily living. These disabilities were more severe in patients who experienced ventilation for a longer period of time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study design was used. A multidisciplinary team developed semi-structured interview guides. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using basic text analysis. RESULTS: Participants had limited information about procedures to improve function after spinal cord injury. When discussing their choice to undergo nerve (as compared to traditional tendon) transfer surgery, they describe a desire to avoid post-operative immobilization. Barriers included the pre-operative testing, cost and inconvenience of travel for surgery, and understanding complex health information related to the procedure. While expectations matched descriptions of outcomes among participants and were generally positive, caregivers expressed disappointment. The long time interval for gains in function to be realized and relatively incremental gains achieved were frustrating to all.

We sought to explore how clinicians working in acute stroke units (ASUs) determine which patients to refer to rehabilitation services. METHOD: Qualitative descriptive study. Team meetings were observed and medical records were reviewed over four weeks at two ASUs. Focus groups were conducted with staff from eight ASUs in two states of Australia. RESULTS: Rehabilitation was mentioned in team meetings for 50/64 patients (78%) during the observation period. Rehabilitation referrals were organised for 47 patients (94%) for whom rehabilitation was discussed (74% of the sample); and for no patients when rehabilitation was not discussed. Factors identified that influenced whether referrals were organised included the anticipated discharge destination; severity of stroke; staff expectations of the patient's recovery; and if there was advocacy by families about rehabilitation. Clinicians tended to refer the patients they considered would be accepted by the rehabilitation service. Staff at two ASUs expressed concern that referring all patients with stroke-related deficits to rehabilitation would be unfavourable with rehabilitation providers. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions made by ASU staff regarding who to refer to stroke rehabilitation are often not solely based on patients' rehabilitation requirements. Implications for Rehabilitation Not all patients on acute stroke units (ASUs) who may have benefited from rehabilitation were offered rehabilitation referrals. Criteria for rehabilitation referrals need to be made explicit and discussed openly with consumers, ASU clinicians and rehabilitation specialists.

Holmes_2019_Disandreh,JOUR,A survey of the current practice of intramuscular Botulinum toxin injections for hemiplegic shoulder pain in the UK,"Holmes, Richard J. and Connell, Louise A.",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To describe the current UK practice for the use of intramuscular Botulinum Toxin type A injections to treat hemiplegic shoulder pain. METHOD: A UK-based cross-sectional study using an online survey. Participants (n = 68) were medical and non-medical practitioners recruited via the membership of the British Society for Rehabilitation Medicine and the British Neurotoxin Network. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of respondents would consider Botulinum Toxin type A for hemiplegic shoulder pain (86.8%), though most of these respondents inject for this goal infrequently (83.1%). Pectoralis major was most commonly selected to achieve this goal. Barriers to this intervention included difficulties determining the cause of pain (29.4%), difficulty isolating muscles (27.9%), and a lack of evidence (25%). The doses reported regularly deviated from guidelines and a substantial range in the volumes suggested was observed. Clinicians were mostly reliant on unstandardised measures to assess outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current UK practice of Botulinum Toxin type A injections for hemiplegic shoulder pain associated with spasticity is highly variable. There are large gaps between current practice and available evidence with regards to muscle selection and doses used. A number of areas for further investigation have been identified to progress current understanding of this intervention. Implications for rehabilitation There are wide variations in practice for this complex intervention and clinicians should consider that their individual decision-making could be based on their own beliefs rather than available evidence. Pectoralis major is most commonly injected to treat hemiplegic shoulder pain, but further evaluation is required to address whether it is the most effective. Clinicians most often use a limitation of shoulder abduction and external rotation, flexor patterning of the upper limb, and pain on passive movement to identify when hemiplegic shoulder pain is due to spasticity over other causes. Further research is needed to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from this intervention and at what stage post-stroke its use is most optimal.",2019,10.1080/09638288.2017.1400596,41,6,720-726,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"stroke and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and survey and Treatment Outcome and United Kingdom and Range of Motion, Articular and Stroke Rehabilitation/*methods and *Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/etiology and *Shoulder Pain/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology and Botulinum toxin and Botulinum Toxins, Type A/*administration & dosage and Hemiplegia/*complications and hemiplegic shoulder pain and Neuromuscular Agents/administration & dosage and post-stroke shoulder pain and spasticity",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Finestone_2007_Arofphmeanre,JOUR,"Refusal to eat, capacity, and ethics in stroke patients: a report of 3 cases","Finestone, Hillel M. and Blackmer, Jeff",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"Patients have the right to make decisions about their health care, including refusing a particular treatment or a life-sustaining activity such as eating. However, patients must be able to understand and appreciate the consequences of their actions. Brain injury caused by a stroke has the potential to affect people's capacity to understand and appreciate their particular medical condition or its consequences. The purpose of this report was to describe the unique medical and ethical challenges presented by 3 rehabilitating stroke patients who refused to eat. Two patients had left-hemisphere strokes, with resultant aphasia. The third patient had a right-brain stroke and was able to state his position verbally but denied many of the consequences of his stroke. The refusal to eat and, therefore, possible impending death forced the attending physiatrist and rehabilitation team members to reevaluate the issue of capacity in the stroke patient.

The objective of this study was to identify what is currently known about determinants that influence the implementation of home-based stroke rehabilitation (HBSR) in clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review of determinants of HBSR was conducted, using a framework for innovation (including determinants related to the innovation, the user, the organization, and the socio-political context). Reviews, meta-analyses, and qualitative studies were included. Studies were selected if they concerned: home-based rehabilitation of stroke patient's (motor) function, changes in in-person service delivery (> 24 h to 12 months post-stroke) and determinants of implementation. RESULTS: A total of 88 studies were identified, of which 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. Identified determinants of implementation of HBSR were: intervention effectiveness, the exact nature of the medical condition, satisfaction with services, coordination of services, inter-professional collaborations, availability of appropriate training equipment, and costs. However, none of the studies had the primary aim to identify determinants of implementation. CONCLUSION: A more complete and detailed overview of existing determinants of HBSR is needed to assist professionals and organizations in decision-making on HBSR implementation and development of suitable strategies for implementation. Implications for Rehabilitation Committed professionals and a smooth transfer to the home-environment are essential elements for home-based rehabilitation or early supported discharge. The determinants related to the client include age, needs, stability and severity of the stroke as well as the living conditions. Clients and care givers should be involved in the recovery process including the decision for early discharge and home-based rehabilitation. It is necessary that essential therapy equipment be provided and that the travel times and costs of therapists are reimbursed.",2014,10.3109/09638288.2014.885091,36,24,2019-2030,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,stroke and Humans and Patient Discharge and Treatment Outcome and implementation and Activities of Daily Living and Interdisciplinary Communication and Barriers and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and determinants and Home Care Services/*organization & administration and *Stroke Rehabilitation and home-based,NA,NA,2014///,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pedersen_2017_Disandreh,JOUR,Referral decision support in patients with subacute brain injury: evaluation of the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale - Extended,"Pedersen, Asger R. and Nielsen, Jorgen F. and Jensen, Jim and Maribo, Thomas",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: To test if the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale Extended (RCS-E) can be used as decision support for patient referral to primary rehabilitation as either complex specialized services (CSS) or district specialist services (DSS). METHOD: Two independent expert teams analyzed medical records on 299 consecutive patients admitted for CSS or DSS rehabilitation. One team provided a golden standard for the patient referrals, and the other team provided RCS-E scores. Models for predicting referrals from RCS-E scores were developed on data for 149 patients and tested on the remaining 150 patients. RESULTS: The optimal RCS-E sum score threshold for referral prediction was 11, predicting the golden standard for patient referral with sensitivity 88%, specificity 78% and correct classification rate 81%. Improved referral prediction performance was achieved by using RCS-E item-wise score thresholds (sensitivity 81%, specificity 89%, correct classification rate 87%). The RCS-E sum score range for patients referred CSS and DSS by the item-wise model was, respectively, 0-12 and 2-22 suggesting strong non-linear interaction of the RCS-E items. CONCLUSIONS: We found excellent referral decision support in the RCS-E and the item specific threshold model, when patients with acquired brain injury are to be referred to CSS or DSS as their primary rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Efficient rehabilitation after acquired brain injury requires rehabilitation settings that meet patient needs. Validated tools for referral decision support make the process more transparent. Patient rehabilitation complexity can be stratified by the RCS-E with high sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of positive test.

DESIGN: We used EHRs from the Research Patient Data Repository, which contains EHRs from a large Massachusetts health care delivery system. This analysis was part of a larger study assessing the effects of disability on diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We applied NLP text extraction software to longitudinal EHRs of colorectal cancer patients to identify persons who use a wheelchair (our indicator of mobility disability for this analysis). We manually reviewed the clinical notes identified by NLP using directed content analysis to identify true cases using wheelchairs, duration or chronicity of use, and documentation quality. SETTING: EHRs from large health care delivery system PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=14,877) 21-75 years old who were newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmation of patients' chronic wheelchair use in NLP-flagged notes; quality of disability documentation. RESULTS: We identified 14,877 patients with colorectal cancer with 303,182 associated clinical notes. NLP screening identified 1482 (0.5%) notes that contained 1+ wheelchair-associated keyword. These notes were associated with 420 patients (2.8% of colorectal cancer population). Of the 1482 notes, 286 (19.3%, representing 105 patients, 0.7% of the total) contained documentation of reason for wheelchair use and duration. Directed content analysis identified 3 themes concerning disability documentation: (1) wheelchair keywords used in specific EHR contexts; (2) reason for wheelchair not clearly stated; and (3) duration of wheelchair use not consistently documented. CONCLUSIONS: NLP offers an option to screen for patients with chronic mobility disability in much less time than required by manual chart review. Nonetheless, manual chart review must confirm that flagged patients have chronic mobility disability (are not false positives).

Kristensen_2016_Disandreh,JOUR,Research-based evidence in stroke rehabilitation: an investigation of its implementation by physiotherapists and occupational therapists,"Kristensen, Hanne Kaae and Ytterberg, Charlotte and Jones, Dorrie Lee and Lund, Hans",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: Stroke rehabilitation is a multidimensional process that is designed to facilitate restoration of and/or adaptation to loss of functioning. The use of research-based evidence in informed decision-making is insufficient. Occupational therapy and physiotherapy constitute important contributions to rehabilitation. The study aim was to investigate characteristics of the implementation of research-based evidence in stroke rehabilitation by occupational therapists and physiotherapists, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a conceptual framework. METHOD: A prospective cohort study, including all service levels within stroke rehabilitation. Consecutive patients with stroke admitted to a university hospital between May and December 2012 were enrolled by 13 therapists. Documentation of daily practice was collected from medical records. Analysis compared the therapists' documentation with the national clinical guidelines for physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the rehabilitation of adults with brain injury. RESULTS: The study included 131 patients. The therapists' praxis was seen to be in agreement with the majority of the national clinical guidelines. However, joint goal-setting and evaluation using standardized measures were seldom documented. CONCLUSIONS: Although the therapists recognize evidence-based practice as a framework for achieving quality in rehabilitation, findings suggest that they do not employ research-based evidence to the fullest extent. Implications for Rehabilitation In order to individualize the rehabilitation offered, more attention and focus on involving and giving words to patients' expectations, perceptions, experiences, and perspectives is needed. With the intention of enabling meaningful participation the health professionals need to pay more attention to the importance of environmental factors. Both guidelines and clinical practice should consider all components of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health when formulating, and implementing, recommendations in rehabilitation praxis in order to aim for rehabilitation that is based both on evidence and a holistic approach.",2016,10.3109/09638288.2016.1138550,38,26,2564-2574,eng,1464-5165 0963-8288,"stroke and Denmark and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and Severity of Illness Index and Evidence-Based Practice and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Stroke/*therapy and Stroke Rehabilitation/*methods and knowledge translation and Translational Research, Biomedical and Evidence-based practice and ICF and occupational therapists and Occupational Therapists and Occupational Therapy/*standards and Physical Therapists and Physical Therapy Modalities/*standards and physiotherapists",NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dunleavy_2007_Disandreh,JOUR,Physical therapy education and provision in Cambodia: a framework for choice of systems for development projects,"Dunleavy, Kim",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: Rehabilitation agencies, policy makers and donors are faced with the choice of the level of rehabilitation provider to promote in developing countries. This is particularly the case after conflict when new systems are considered and the need for rehabilitation becomes a priority. The complete decimation of medical services in Cambodia highlights the effects of both social change and development agency impact on the establishment of rehabilitation services. This paper discusses the factors that led to the development of four types of physical therapy provider levels in Cambodia with the goal of providing a framework for these decisions. METHODS: Case study analysis utilizing interviews, site analysis and literature review. RESULTS: There are four levels of physical therapy provider systems that were initiated at different stages of the rebuilding of the country. Rehabilitation workers were trained during the war in refugee camps and afterwards in rehabilitation centers, professional physical therapists were trained in a university programme after the conflict ceased and community follow-up workers and community-based rehabilitation workers were trained to address some of the geographic accessibility issues. Factors that affected the different systems include the post-conflict development agency philosophy, instructor availability and training, financial support, high school education standards, geographic and rural/urban distribution and cost and time for training. The community-based rehabilitation and community follow-up models also address referral systems and social and vocational support. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the different types of provider and the initiating or driving forces that led to development of these systems are discussed in order to provide agencies which are planning to implement training of rehabilitation providers in developing countries with a decision-making framework. A combined system is the optimal approach; however, the choice of which type of provider level to promote will differ according to political stability, stage of development, presence of trained educators, rural vs. urban need, funding agency philosophy and educational standards in the country.",2007,10.1080/09638280701240433,29,11-12,903-920,eng,0963-8288,"Humans and Organizational Case Studies and Models, Organizational and Social Change and Community Health Services/*organization & administration and Cambodia and Physical Therapy Specialty/*education/*organization & administration and Warfare",NA,NA,2007/06/15/30,Disabil Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Fins_2018_Arofphmeanre,JOUR,"Ethical, Palliative, and Policy Considerations in Disorders of Consciousness","Fins, Joseph J. and Bernat, James L.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"This essay complements the scientific and practice scope of the American Academy of Neurology Guideline on Disorders of Consciousness by providing a discussion of the ethical, palliative, and policy aspects of the management of this group of patients. We endorse the renaming of ""permanent"" vegetative state to ""chronic"" vegetative state given the increased frequency of reports of late improvements but suggest that further refinement of this class of patients is necessary to distinguish late recoveries from patients who were misdiagnosed or in cognitive-motor dissociation. Additional nosologic clarity and prognostic refinement is necessary to preclude overestimation of low probability events. We argue that the new descriptor ""unaware wakefulness syndrome"" is no clearer than ""vegetative state"" in expressing the mismatch between apparent behavioral unawareness when patients have covert consciousness or cognitive motor dissociation. We advocate routine universal pain precautions as an important element of neuropalliative care for these patients given the risk of covert consciousness. In medical decision-making, we endorse the use of advance directives and the importance of clear and understandable communication with surrogates. We show the value of incorporating a learning health care system so as to promote therapeutic innovation. We support the Guideline's high standard for rehabilitation for these patients but note that those systems of care are neither widely available nor affordable.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a large-scale medical claims database of all Tokyo residents aged <e2><89><a5>75 years. SETTING: Acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent rehabilitation and were discharged to home (N=31,247; mean age in years <c2><b1> SD, 84.1<c2><b1>5.7) between October 2013 and July 2014. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 30-day PAR. RESULTS: Among the patients, 883 (2.9%) experienced 30-day PAR. A multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation model (with a logit link function and binominal sampling distribution) that adjusted for patient characteristics and clustering within hospitals showed that the discharge services were not significantly associated with 30-day PAR. The odds ratios were 0.962 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.805-1.151) for discharge planning, 1.060 (95% CI, 0.916-1.227) for rehabilitation discharge instruction, and 1.118 (95% CI, 0.817-1.529) for coordination with community care. In contrast, the odds of 30-day PAR among patients with home medical care services were 1.431 times higher than those of patients without these services (P<.001), and the odds of 30-day PAR among patients with a higher number (median or higher) of rehabilitation units were 2.031 times higher than those of patients with a lower number (below median) (P<.001). Also, the odds of 30-day PAR among patients with a higher Hospital Frailty Risk Score (median or higher) were 1.252 times higher than those of patients with a lower score (below median) (P=.001).

Sommer_2017_Disandreh,JOUR,An ICF-CY-based approach to assessing self- and observer-reported functioning in young persons with achondroplasia - development of the pilot version of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale (APLES),"Sommer, Rachel and Blomeke, Janika and Dabs, Michaela and Witt, Stefanie and Bullinger, Monika and Quitmann, Julia",Disability and rehabilitation,"PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common disproportionate short stature which impacts patients' well-being. Little is known about the burden of disease in terms of functioning of patients and few disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures exist. To understand the consequences of achondroplasia, the objective of the study was to develop an achondroplasia-specific PRO tool. METHOD: Focus group discussions including 34 German patients (age 8-18 years) and 21 parents were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. To identify relevant concepts, statements were coded according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: Children & Youth version (ICF-CY). Upon condensation, relevant statements were reformulated as items. RESULTS: 1950 statements related to 125 ICF-CY categories were identified. After condensation and prioritization, 59 items were retained. These were generated based on the ICF-CY domains environmental factors (27 items), activities and participation (18 items), body functions (9 items), and body structures (5 items). CONCLUSIONS: A new instrument, the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale (APLES) to assess burden of disease and functioning from the patients perspective of children and adolescents with achondroplasia has been developed in its pilot version based on the classification of the ICF-CY. Psychometric performance of the APLES is currently being examined. Implications for Rehabilitation Using the ICF-CY within the development of a disease-specific instrument to assess burden of disease and functioning provides guidance for clinicians and researchers in the selection of appropriate instruments complying with ICF categories. Qualitative research based on focus group interviews is an effective method to elicit experiences, beliefs, points of view, understandings, perceptions, impressions, needs and concerns as well as attitudes from the perspective of the individuals on a specific topic such as functioning. Direct assessment of the patient perspective is necessary to thoroughly understand a patient's experience of disease and treatment, the impact on their functioning and relevant health-care needs. Including the perspective of the patient and its family is an important component in the provision of health-care services.

A recently developed framework called the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS) has potential to identify which clinician actions (ie, ingredients) actively improve specific patient functions (ie, targets). However, the RTSS does not provide methodology for standardly identifying specific unique targets or ingredients. Without a method to evaluate the uniqueness of an individual target or ingredient, it is difficult to know whether variations in treatment descriptions are synonymous (ie, different words describing the same treatment) or meaningfully different (eg, different words describing different treatments or variations of the same treatment). A recent project used vocal rehabilitation ingredients and targets to create RTSS-based lists of unique overarching target and ingredient categories with underlying dimensions describing how individual ingredients and targets vary within those categories. The primary purpose of this article is to describe the challenges encountered during the project and the methodology developed to address those challenges. Because the methodology was based on the RTSS's broadly applicable framework, it can be used across all areas of rehabilitation regardless of the discipline (speech-language pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychology, etc) or impairment domain (language, cognition, ambulation, upper extremity training, etc).

DESIGN: Applying recovery preference exploration as a data-collection tool, clinicians imagined recovery from complete disability in each of the 18 activities assessed on the FIM instrument. We hypothesized that recovery-choice pathways would vary among the disciplines because of differences in training and practice focus. We compared each clinician's preference for imagined recovery of the ability to perform each FIM activity relative to the other 17. Item-level preferences were explored by discipline. The mean absolute difference (MAD) in the medians of the 18 FIM recovery preference values between each of the disciplines was used to quantify overall differences. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation unit within a larger tertiary care urban hospital of an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-three clinicians actively providing care to patients in an inpatient rehabilitation setting classified into 5 groups anticipated to have similar types of practices: physicians and medical students (physician group), nurses, occupational and recreational therapists (occupational therapy [OT] group), physical therapists (physical therapy [PT] group), and neuropsychologists and social workers (psychology group). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative recovery preferences in 18 FIM activities. RESULTS: The MAD value between the 2 groups with the least similar recovery values (physician and psychology groups) was 1.78 times larger than the MAD value between the 2 groups with the most similar recovery values (PT and OT groups).

DATA SOURCES: Seven medical databases-Medline, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and AMED-were searched from the earliest known record until March 11, 2014. Search terms encompassed 3 themes: (1) children; (2) spina bifida; and (3) walking. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if participants were children with spina bifida aged 1 to 17 years and if walking was measured. Articles were excluded if the assessment was restricted to kinematic, kinetic, or electromyographic analysis of walking. A total of 1751 abstracts were screened by 2 authors independently, and 109 articles were included in this review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using standardized forms. Extracted data included study and participant characteristics and details about the walking measures used, including psychometric properties. Two authors evaluated the methodological quality of articles using a previously published framework that considers sampling method, study design, and psychometric properties of the measures used. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nineteen walking measures were identified. Ordinal-level rating scales (eg, Hoffer Functional Ambulation Scale) were most commonly used (57% of articles), followed by ratio-level, spatiotemporal measures, such as walking speed (18% of articles). Walking was measured for various reasons relevant to multiple health care disciplines. A machine learning analysis was used to identify patterns in the use of walking measures. The learned classifier predicted whether a spatiotemporal measure was used with 77.1% accuracy. A trend to use spatiotemporal measures in older children and those with lumbar and sacral spinal lesions was identified. Most articles were prospective studies that used samples of convenience and unblinded assessors. Few articles evaluated or considered the psychometric properties of the walking measures used.

The Rehabilitation Medicine Department of the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health with support from the National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research convened a subject matter expert group to review current literature and practice patterns, identify opportunities and gaps regarding cancer rehabilitation and its support of oncology care, and make recommendations for future efforts that promote quality cancer rehabilitation care. The recommendations suggest stronger efforts toward integrating cancer rehabilitation care models into oncology care from the point of diagnosis, incorporating evidence-based rehabilitation clinical assessment tools, and including rehabilitation professionals in shared decision-making in order to provide comprehensive cancer care and maximize the functional capabilities of cancer survivors. These recommendations aim to enable future collaborations among a variety of stakeholders to improve the delivery of high-quality cancer care.",2016,10.1016/j.apmr.2016.05.002,97,11,2006-2015,eng,1532-821X 0003-9993,United States and Morbidity and Recovery of function and Rehabilitation and Humans and Neoplasms and Disability Evaluation and Survivors and Physical Therapy Modalities and Home Care Services/organization & administration and Secondary prevention and Cancer Care Facilities/*organization & administration and Neoplasms/*rehabilitation,NA,NA,2016/11//undefined,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pfoh_2020_Arofphmeanre,JOUR,The Six-Clicks Mobility Measure: A Useful Tool for Predicting Discharge Disposition,"Pfoh, Elizabeth R. and Hamilton, Aaron and Hu, Bo and Stilphen, Mary and Rothberg, Michael B.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive capabilities of 2 measures of functional mobility, the 6-clicks score and the Braden scale mobility score. We also identified the additional predictive value of adding electronic health record data (demographics, laboratory data, and vital signs) to each model. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A large integrated health system. PARTICIPANTS: Patients <e2><89><a5>18 years of age (N=17,022) admitted to the inpatient medical service of one of 8 hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictive measures were patient demographics, laboratory values, vital signs, and functional mobility as measured by the 6-clicks score within the first 48 hours of hospital admission. Our outcome was discharge destination (home vs other). RESULTS: Our final sample included 19,963 records. Patients were discharged alive from 19,698 admissions. The majority were women (n=11,729, 59%) with a mean age of 73 (standard deviation, 15.3) years. Patients' initial 6-clicks score had moderate discrimination for discharge destination (c-statistic of 0.78) and outperformed the Braden score (c-statistic of 0.68). Electronic health record data alone had poor discrimination (c-statistic of 0.66) and added little to the model of 6-clicks alone (adjusted c-statistic increased from 0.78 to 0.80). CONCLUSION: Functional mobility measured via 6-clicks within 48 hours of admission can help identify patients who are likely to go home, facilitating early discharge planning.",2020,10.1016/j.apmr.2020.02.016,101,7,1199-1203,eng,1532-821X 0003-9993,"Rehabilitation and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Cohort Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Length of Stay and Patient Selection and *Patient Discharge and Patient discharge and Exercise Test/*methods and Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data and Hospital planning and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Disability Evaluation and *Mobility Limitation",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bates_2009_Arofphmeanre,JOUR,Factors influencing decisions to admit patients to veterans affairs specialized rehabilitation units after lower-extremity amputation,"Bates, Barbara E. and Kwong, Pui L. and Kurichi, Jibby E. and Bidelspach, Douglas E. and Reker, Dean M. and Maislin, Greg and Xie, Dawei and Stineman, Margaret",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"Bates BE, Kwong PL, Kurichi JE, Bidelspach DE, Reker DM, Maislin G, Xie D, Stineman M. Factors influencing decisions to admit patients to Veterans Affairs specialized rehabilitation units after lower-extremity amputation. OBJECTIVE: To understand patient- and facility-level characteristics that influence decisions to admit veterans to a specialized rehabilitation unit (SRU) after a lower-extremity amputation. DESIGN: Database study. SETTING: All Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). PARTICIPANTS: Veterans with lower-extremity amputation discharged from VAMCs between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2004. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Admission to an SRU. RESULTS: There were a total of 2922 veterans with lower-extremity amputations; 616 patients were admitted to an SRU, whereas 2306 received consultative rehabilitation services only. Patients admitted to an SRU waited longer to have their first rehabilitation assessment after surgery and had middle-range physical and cognitive disabilities. Patients who received consultative rehabilitation services only tended to have greater illness burden. They were more likely to have previous amputation complication, paralysis, or renal failure and either very severe or minimal physical and cognitive disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of veterans with new lower-extremity amputations for admission to an SRU appears clinically reasonable and based on the likelihood of successful outcomes.",2009,10.1016/j.apmr.2009.07.016,90,12,2012-2018,eng,1532-821X 0003-9993,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Weight Loss and Disability Evaluation and *Decision Making and United States/epidemiology and Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data and Hospital Bed Capacity and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology and *Hospitals, Veterans and Renal Insufficiency/epidemiology and Amputation/*rehabilitation and Cognition Disorders/epidemiology and Lower Extremity/*injuries and Paralysis/epidemiology",NA,NA,2009/12//undefined,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

George and Roth, Heidi R. and Spoeri, Susan and Tappan, Rachel and Van Der Laan, Krista",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the use and effect of the Battery of Rehabilitation Assessments and Interventions on evidence-based practice (EBP) over 6 years. DESIGN: Successive independent samples study. SETTING: Large rehabilitation system. PARTICIPANTS: Successive samples of allied health clinicians (N=372) in 2009 (n=136), 2012 (n=115), and 2015 (n=121). INTERVENTIONS: The Battery of Rehabilitation Assessments and Interventions includes 2 components: (1) a process to synthesize, adapt, and make recommendations about the application of evidence; and (2) a process to implement the recommended practices in 3 levels of care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the effect of the project, surveys on EBP perspectives, use, and barriers were conducted before Battery of Rehabilitation Assessments and Interventions implementation and 3 and 6 years after implementation. Questions about effect of the project on clinical practice were included 3 and 6 years postimplementation. RESULTS: Survey data indicate the Battery of Rehabilitation Assessments and Interventions resulted in a significant increase in use of EBPs to make clinical decisions and justify care. As a result of the project, survey participants reported a substantial increase in use of outcome measures in 2012 (74%) and 2015 (91%) and evidence-based interventions in 2012 (62%) and 2015 (82%). In 2012, significant differences (P<e2><89><a4>.01) in effect of the Battery of Rehabilitation Assessments and Interventions on practice were identified between therapists who were directly involved in the project and Interventions compared with uninvolved therapists. In 2015, no significant differences existed between involved and uninvolved therapists.

Yin_2017_Arofphmeanre,JOUR,New and Accurate Predictive Model for the Efficacy of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in Managing Patients With Chronic Plantar Fasciitis,"Yin, Mengchen and Chen, Ni and Huang, Quan and Marla, Anastasia Sulindro and Ma, Junming and Ye, Jie and Mo, Wen",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors for the outcome of a minimum clinically successful therapy and to establish a predictive model of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in managing patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, prospective study. SETTING: Outpatient of local medical center settings. PARTICIPANTS: Patients treated for symptomatic chronic plantar fasciitis between 2014 and 2016 (N=278). INTERVENTIONS: ESWT was performed by the principal authors to treat chronic plantar fasciitis. ESWT was administered in 3 sessions, with an interval of 2 weeks (<c2><b1>4d). In the low-, moderate-, and high-intensity groups, 2400 impulses total of ESWT with an energy flux density of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6mJ/mm(2), respectively (a rate of 8 impulses per second), were applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The independent variables were patient age, sex, body mass index, affected side, duration of symptoms, Roles and Maudsley score, visual analog scale (VAS) score when taking first steps in the morning, edema, bone spurs, and intensity grade of ESWT. A minimal reduction of 50% in the VAS score was considered as minimum clinically successful therapy. The correlations between the achievement of minimum clinically successful therapy and independent variables were analyzed. The statistically significant factors identified were further analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and the predictive model was established. RESULTS: The success rate of ESWT was 66.9%. Univariate analysis found that VAS score when taking first steps in the morning, edema, and the presence of heel spur in radiograph significantly affected the outcome of the treatment. Logistic regression drew the equation: minimum clinically successful therapy=(1+e([.011+42.807*heel spur+.109*edema+5.395*VAS)(score]))(-1).The sensitivity of the predictive factors was 96.77%, 87.63%, and 86.02%, respectively. The specificity of the predictive factors was 45.65%, 42.39%, and 85.87%, respectively. The area under the curve of the predictive factors was .751, .650, and .859, respectively. The Youden index was .4243, .3003, and .7189, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good fitting of the predictive model, with an overall accuracy of 89.6%. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a new and accurate predictive model for the efficacy of ESWT in managing patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. The use of these parameters, in the form of a predictive model for ESWT efficacy, has the potential to improve decision-making in the application of ESWT.",2017,10.1016/j.apmr.2017.05.016,98,12,2371-2377,eng,1532-821X 0003-9993,"Rehabilitation and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Logistic Models and Chronic Disease and Sex Factors and Prospective Studies and Reproducibility of Results and Body Mass Index and Age Factors and *Models, Theoretical and Edema/complications and Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy/*methods and Fasciitis and Fasciitis, Plantar/complications/*rehabilitation and Heel Spur/complications and Hydroxybenzoates and Plantar and Shock Therapy",NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA
