Cell-of-origin (COO) classification of DLBCL is required in routine practice by the World Health Organization classification for biological and therapeutic insights. Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL.",2020,10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001949,4,14,3391-3404,eng,2473-9537 2473-9529,"Humans and *Artificial Intelligence and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and *Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/genetics and B-Lymphocytes and Germinal Center",NA,NA,2020/07/28/,Blood Adv,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used data for children receiving care at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin from 2013 to 2016 to test the accuracy of the 2 algorithms. The algorithm for genotype identification used composite information (blood test results, transcranial Doppler) along with diagnoses codes. Acute pain encounters were identified using diagnoses codes and further refined by using prescription of IV pain medications. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for the algorithms. Predictive values for the algorithm to identify SCD genotype were calculated. For all assessments, the local SCD registry and patients' charts were considered gold standards.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis adequacy of various clinical decision support systems (CDSS) with the aim of increasing the use of explicit criteria for thromboprophylaxis prescription in nine Swiss medical services. METHODS: We randomly assigned medical services to a pocket digital assistant program (PDA), pocket cards (PC) and no CDSS (controls). In centers using an electronic chart, an e-alert system (eAlerts) was developed. After 4 months, we compared post-CDSS with baseline thromboprophylaxis adequacy for the various CDSS and control groups. RESULTS: Overall, 1085 patients were included (395 controls, 196 PC, 168 PDA, 326 eAlerts), 651 pre- and 434 post-CDSS implementation: 472 (43.5%) presented a risk of VTE justifying thromboprophylaxis (31.8% pre, 61.1% post) and 556 (51.2%) received thromboprophylaxis (54.2% pre, 46.8% post).

The ninth iteration of the American Collage of Chest Physicians guidelines (AT9) adopted structural and policy changes that resulted in a greater adherence to GRADE guidance than previous iterations. The most important of these changes include minimizing the impact of financial and intellectual conflict of interest, increasing the rigor of evidence evaluation, acknowledging uncertainty in estimates of typical values and preferences, and awareness of the large variability in values and preferences. One of the consequences of the greater adherence to GRADE methodology is an increase in weak vs. strong recommendations in AT9. The result of the GRADE process highlights the desirability of higher-quality evidence both regarding the outcomes of alternative management strategies and regarding the distribution of values and preferences in patients considering those alternatives.

SUMMARY: Background Among acutely ill hospitalized medical patients, extended-duration thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but some pharmacologic strategies have been associated with greater risks of major bleeding, thereby offsetting the net clinical benefit (NCB). Methods To assess the risk-benefit profile of anticoagulation regimens, a previously described bivariate method that does not assume a linear risk-benefit tradeoff and can accommodate different margins for efficacy and safety was performed to simultaneously assess efficacy (symptomatic VTE) and safety (major bleeding) on the basis of data from four randomized controlled trials of extended-duration (30-46 days) versus standard-duration (6-14 days) thromboprophylaxis among 28 227 patients (EXCLAIM, ADOPT, MAGELLAN and APEX trials). Results Extended thromboprophylaxis with full-dose betrixaban (80 mg once daily) was superior in efficacy and non-inferior in safety to standard-duration enoxaparin, and showed a significantly favorable NCB, with a risk difference of - 0.51% (- 0.89% to - 0.10%) in the bivariate outcome. Extended enoxaparin was superior in efficacy and inferior in safety (bivariate outcome: 0.03% [- 0.37% to 0.43%]), whereas apixaban and rivaroxaban were non-inferior in efficacy and inferior in safety (- 0.20% [- 0.49% to 0.17%] and 0.23% [- 0.16% to 0.69%], respectively).

SUMMARY: Introduction The Khorana score is a validated risk assessment score for estimating the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in outpatients with cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the Khorana score for predicting the development of VTE in cancer patients during hospital admission. Methods We conducted an analysis of consecutive, adult cancer patients hospitalized for medical reasons between January and June 2010 in three academic medical centers. Information on objectively diagnosed, symptomatic VTE during hospitalization, use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (TP) and Khorana score variables at the time of admission was collected. Results A total of 1398 patients were included. Mean age was 62 years, 51.2% were male, and mean BMI was 25.9 kg m(-2) . The most frequent reasons for hospitalization were chemotherapy administration (22.3%), followed by pain control and palliation (21.4%).

The increasing evidence of an associated relevant prothrombotic coagulopathy has resulted in an increasing use of antithrombotic doses higher than usual in COVID-19 patients. Information on the benefit/risk ratio of this approach is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of relevant bleeding complications in association with the antithrombotic strategy and its relationship with the amount of drug. METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 were included in a retrospective analysis. Major bleedings (MB) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) were obtained from patient medical records and were adjudicated by an independent committee. RESULTS: Of the 324 patients who were recruited, 240 had been treated with prophylactic doses and 84 with higher doses of anticoagulants. The rate of the composite endpoint of MB or CRNMB was 6.9 per 100-person/months in patients who had been given prophylactic doses, and 26.4 per 100-person/months in those who had been prescribed higher doses (hazard ratio, 3.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.90-7.97). The corresponding rates for overall mortality were 12.2 and 20.1 per 100-person/months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of relevant bleeding events was high in patients treated with (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. In the latter group, overall mortality did not differ from that of patients treated with standard prophylactic doses and was even higher.

We assessed when restarting anticoagulation was worthwhile based on patient risk of recurrent VTE. When the risk over a one-year period is 17.5%, restarting is cost-effective. However, sensitivity analyses indicate large uncertainty in the estimates. SUMMARY: Background Following at least 3 months of anticoagulation therapy after a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), there is uncertainty about the duration of therapy. Further anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of having a potentially fatal recurrent VTE but at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding, which can also be fatal. Objective An economic evaluation sought to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule for restarting anticoagulation therapy vs. no extension of therapy in patients based on their risk of a further unprovoked VTE. Methods A Markov patient-level simulation model was developed, which adopted a lifetime time horizon with monthly time cycles and was from a UK National Health Service (NHS)/Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. Results Base-case model results suggest that treating patients with a predicted 1 year VTE risk of 17.5% or higher may be cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay up to <c2><a3>20 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the model was highly sensitive to overall parameter uncertainty and caution is warranted in selecting the optimal decision rule on cost-effectiveness grounds. Univariate sensitivity analyses indicate variables such as anticoagulation therapy disutility and mortality risks were very influential in driving model results. Conclusion This represents the first economic model to consider the use of a decision rule for restarting therapy for unprovoked VTE patients. Better data are required to predict long-term bleeding risks during therapy in this patient group.",2017,10.1111/jth.13739,15,8,1591-1600,eng,1538-7836,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Markov Chains and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and United Kingdom and Quality of Life and Computer Simulation and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and Drug Administration Schedule and Recurrence and *Decision Support Techniques and Clinical Decision-Making and *Models, Economic and State Medicine/economics and Hemorrhage/chemically induced and medical economics and cost-benefit analysis and venous thromboembolism and *Drug Costs and deep vein thrombosis and Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*economics and pulmonary embolism and Venous Thromboembolism/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*economics/mortality",NA,NA,2017/08//undefined,J Thromb Haemost,NA,NA,NA,NA

L. and Lane, D. A. and Lip, G. Y. H.",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,"BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) should be tailored individually on the basis of ischemic stroke risk. The objective of this study was to compare the predictive ability of 15 published stratification schemes for stroke risk in actual clinical practice in the UK. METHODS: AF patients aged <e2><89><a5> 18 years in the General Practice Research Database, which contains computerized medical records, were included. The c-statistic was estimated to determine the predictive ability for stroke for each scheme. Outcomes included stroke, hospitalizations for stroke, and death resulting from stroke (as recorded on death certificates). RESULTS: The study cohort included 79,844 AF patients followed for an average of 4 years (average of 2.4 years up to the start of warfarin therapy). All risk schemes had modest discriminatory ability in AF patients, with c-statistics for predicting events ranging from 0.55 to 0.69 for strokes recorded by the general practitioner or in hospital, from 0.56 to 0.69 for stroke hospitalizations, and from 0.56 to 0.78 for death resulting from stroke as reported on death certificates. The proportion of patients assigned to individual risk categories varied widely across the schemes, with the proportion categorized as moderate risk ranging from 12.7% (CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc) to 61.5% (modified CHADS(2)). Low-risk subjects were truly low risk (with annual stroke events < 0.5%) with the modified CHADS(2), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc schemes. CONCLUSION: Current published risk schemes have modest predictive value for stroke. A new scheme (CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc) may discriminate those at truly low risk and minimize classification of subjects as intermediate/moderate risk. This approach would simplify our approach to stroke risk stratification and improve decision-making for thromboprophylaxis in patients with AF.",2011,10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.04085.x,9,1,39-48,eng,1538-7836,"Hospitalization and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Logistic Models and Cohort Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Proportional Hazards Models and Databases as Topic and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and Patient Selection and United Kingdom/epidemiology and Anticoagulants/therapeutic use and *Health Status Indicators and *General Practice/statistics & numerical data and Atrial Fibrillation/*complications/drug therapy/mortality and Stroke/epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control and Warfarin/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2011/01//undefined,J Thromb Haemost,NA,NA,NA,NA

The IGHV SHM status has traditionally been determined by conventional Sanger sequencing. However, NGS has heralded a new era in medical diagnostics and immunogenetic analysis is following this trend. There is indeed a growing demand for shifting practice and using NGS for IGHV gene SHM assessment, although it is debatable whether it is always justifiable, at least taking into account financial considerations for laboratories with limited resources. Nevertheless, as this analysis impacts on treatment decisions, standardization of both technical aspects, and data interpretation becomes essential. Also, the need for establishing new recommendations and providing dedicated education and training on NGS-based immunogenetics is greater than ever before. Here we address potential and challenges of NGS-based immunogenetics in CLL.

Efficace_2017_Bloo,JOUR,Patient-reported outcomes in hematology: is it time to focus more on them in clinical trials and hematology practice?,"Efficace, Fabio and Gaidano, Gianluca and Lo-Coco, Francesco",Blood,"In less than 2 decades, major clinical advances have been made in various areas of hematologic malignancies. Clinicians and patients now frequently face challenging choices regarding various treatments that are often similar in regard to safety or clinical effectiveness; hence, medical decision making has grown in complexity. For example, several novel drugs have been developed as oral agents, introducing an additional challenge in patient management, such as ensuring an optimal adherence to therapy in order to maximize drug effectiveness. This rapidly changing scenario provides a rationale for a more systematic collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in clinical research and routine care. In the former case, PRO may help to better understand overall treatment effectiveness of a new drug being tested. In the latter case, it may aid in making more informed, individualized treatment decisions in daily practice by obtaining more accurate information on the actual symptom burden experienced by the patient. In any case, evaluating PRO requires making several, and often challenging, decisions depending, for example, on the population being studied and the specific setting. Therefore, if PROs are to fulfill their potential of generating clinically meaningful data that robustly inform patient care, special attention should be given to methodological rigor. We outline the value of a more systematic and rigorous implementation of PRO assessment in the current hematology arena, by providing some real world examples of how PRO data have contributed in better understanding the value of new therapies. We also discuss practical considerations in PRO assessment in clinical research.",2017,10.1182/blood-2017-03-737403,130,7,859-866,eng,1528-0020 0006-4971,"Humans and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Clinical Decision-Making and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Hematology and *Clinical Trials as Topic",NA,NA,2017/08/17/,Blood,NA,NA,NA,NA

Splenectomy continues to provide the highest cure rate (60%-70% at 5+ years). Nonetheless, splenectomy is invasive, irreversible, associated with postoperative complications, and its outcome is currently unpredictable, leading some physicians and patients toward postponement and use of alternative approaches. An important predicament is the lack of studies comparing second-line options to splenectomy and to each other. Furthermore, some adults will improve spontaneously within 1-2 years. Rituximab has been given to more than 1 million patients worldwide, is generally well tolerated, and its short-term toxicity is acceptable. In adults with ITP, 40% of patients are complete responders at one year and 20% remain responders at 3-5 years. Newer approaches to using rituximab are under study. TPO-RAs induce platelet counts > 50 000/<ce><bc>L in 60%-90% of adults with ITP, are well-tolerated, and show relatively little short-term toxicity.

Continuous efforts have been made in Japan to investigate the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for infants with KMT2A-r ALL, but improvement in outcome was modest. In the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group MLL-10 trial, infants with ALL were stratified into 3 risk groups (low risk [LR], intermediate risk [IR], and high risk [HR]) according to KMT2A status, age, and presence of central nervous system leukemia. Children's Oncology Group AALL0631 modified chemotherapy with the addition of high-dose cytarabine in early intensification was introduced to KMT2A-r patients, and the option of HSCT was restricted to HR patients only. The role of minimal residual disease (MRD) was also evaluated. Ninety eligible infants were stratified into LR (n = 15), IR (n = 19), or HR (n = 56) risk groups. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for patients with KMT2A-r ALL (IR + HR) was 66.2% (standard error [SE], 5.6%), and for those with germline KMT2A (KMT2A-g) ALL (LR), the 3-year EFS rate was 93.3% (SE, 6.4%).
