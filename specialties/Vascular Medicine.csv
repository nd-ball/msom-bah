Kwon_2018_JoofthAmHeAs,JOUR,An Algorithm Based on Deep Learning for Predicting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Kwon, Joon-Myoung and Lee, Youngnam and Lee, Yeha and Lee, Seungwoo and Park, Jinsik",Journal of the American Heart Association,"BACKGROUND: In-hospital cardiac arrest is a major burden to public health, which affects patient safety. Although traditional track-and-trigger systems are used to predict cardiac arrest early, they have limitations, with low sensitivity and high false-alarm rates. We propose a deep learning-based early warning system that shows higher performance than the existing track-and-trigger systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed patients who were admitted to 2 hospitals from June 2010 to July 2017. A total of 52 131 patients were included. Specifically, a recurrent neural network was trained using data from June 2010 to January 2017. The result was tested using the data from February to July 2017. The primary outcome was cardiac arrest, and the secondary outcome was death without attempted resuscitation. As comparative measures, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the net reclassification index. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity while varying the number of alarms. The deep learning-based early warning system (AUROC: 0.850; AUPRC: 0.044) significantly outperformed a modified early warning score (AUROC: 0.603; AUPRC: 0.003), a random forest algorithm (AUROC: 0.780; AUPRC: 0.014), and logistic regression (AUROC: 0.613; AUPRC: 0.007). Furthermore, the deep learning-based early warning system reduced the number of alarms by 82.2%, 13.5%, and 42.1% compared with the modified early warning system, random forest, and logistic regression, respectively, at the same sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on deep learning had high sensitivity and a low false-alarm rate for detection of patients with cardiac arrest in the multicenter study.",2018,10.1161/JAHA.118.008678,7,13,NA,eng,2047-9980,"deep learning and machine learning and artificial intelligence and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Prognosis and Reproducibility of Results and Predictive Value of Tests and Early Diagnosis and *Decision Support Techniques and *Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted and *Deep Learning and *Inpatients and *Vital Signs and cardiac arrest and Heart Arrest/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/therapy and rapid response system and resuscitation and Resuscitation and Seoul",NA,NA,2018/06/26/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ong_2020_JoofthAmHeAs,JOUR,Claims-Based Algorithms for Identifying Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension: A Comparison of Decision Rules and Machine-Learning Approaches,"Ong, Mei-Sing and Klann, Jeffrey G. and Lin, Kueiyu Joshua and Maron, Bradley A. and Murphy, Shawn N. and Natter, Marc D. and Mandl, Kenneth D.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Real-world healthcare data are an important resource for epidemiologic research. However, accurate identification of patient cohorts-a crucial first step underpinning the validity of research results-remains a challenge. We developed and evaluated claims-based case ascertainment algorithms for pulmonary hypertension (PH), comparing conventional decision rules with state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches. Methods and Results We analyzed an electronic health record-Medicare linked database from two large academic tertiary care hospitals (years 2007-2013). Electronic health record charts were reviewed to form a gold standard cohort of patients with (n=386) and without PH (n=164). Using health encounter data captured in Medicare claims (including patients' demographics, diagnoses, medications, and procedures), we developed and compared 2 approaches for identifying patients with PH: decision rules and machine-learning algorithms using penalized lasso regression, random forest, and gradient boosting machine. The most optimal rule-based algorithm-having <e2><89><a5>3 PH-related healthcare encounters and having undergone right heart catheterization-attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.64 (sensitivity, 0.75; specificity, 0.48). All 3 machine-learning algorithms outperformed the most optimal rule-based algorithm (P<0.001). A model derived from the random forest algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.70), and gradient boosting machine achieved comparable results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.85; sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.70). Penalized lasso regression achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.68). Conclusions Research-grade case identification algorithms for PH can be derived and rigorously validated using machine-learning algorithms. Simple decision rules commonly applied in published literature performed poorly; more complex rule-based algorithms may potentially address the limitation of this approach. PH research using claims data would be considerably strengthened through the use of validated algorithms for cohort ascertainment.",2020,10.1161/JAHA.120.016648,9,19,e016648,eng,2047-9980,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Decision Support Techniques and *Algorithms and *Machine Learning and *Insurance Claim Review and computable phenotype and Hypertension, Pulmonary/*epidemiology and pulmonary hypertension",NA,NA,2020/10/20/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The discussion will serve as the foundation for the American Heart Association's (AHA's) near-term and future strategies in the Big Data area. The concepts evolving from this forum may also inform other fields of medicine and science. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 47 participants representing stakeholders from 7 domains (patients, basic scientists, clinical investigators, population researchers, clinicians and healthcare system administrators, industry, and regulatory authorities) participated in the conference. Presentation topics included updates on data as viewed from conventional medical and nonmedical sources, building and using Big Data repositories, articulation of the goals of data sharing, and principles of responsible data sharing. Facilitated breakout sessions were conducted to examine what each of the 7 stakeholder domains wants from Big Data under ideal circumstances and the possible roles that the AHA might play in meeting their needs. Important areas that are high priorities for further study regarding Big Data include a description of the methodology of how to acquire and analyze findings, validation of the veracity of discoveries from such research, and integration into investigative and clinical care aspects of future cardiovascular and stroke medicine. Potential roles that the AHA might consider include facilitating a standards discussion (eg, tools, methodology, and appropriate data use), providing education (eg, healthcare providers, patients, investigators), and helping build an interoperable digital ecosystem in cardiovascular and stroke science. CONCLUSION: There was a consensus across stakeholder domains that Big Data holds great promise for revolutionizing the way cardiovascular and stroke research is conducted and clinical care is delivered; however, there is a clear need for the creation of a vision of how to use it to achieve the desired goals. Potential roles for the AHA center around facilitating a discussion of standards, providing education, and helping establish a cardiovascular digital ecosystem. This ecosystem should be interoperable and needs to interface with the rapidly growing digital object environment of the modern-day healthcare system.",2015,10.1161/JAHA.115.002810,4,11,NA,eng,2047-9980,"United States and epidemiology and Humans and Diffusion of Innovation and Cooperative Behavior and Forecasting and ethics and mobile health and data and Consensus and American Heart Association and Interdisciplinary Communication and AHA Scientific Statements and *Information Dissemination and *Access to Information and clinical trials and *Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/therapy and *Data Mining/trends and *Databases, Factual/trends and *Stroke/diagnosis/etiology/therapy and Biomedical Research/*organization & administration/trends and Cardiology/*organization & administration/trends and preclinical",NA,NA,2015/11/05/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs.

Kakadiaris_2018_JoofthAmHeAs,JOUR,Machine Learning Outperforms ACC / AHA CVD Risk Calculator in MESA,"Kakadiaris, Ioannis A. and Vrigkas, Michalis and Yen, Albert A. and Kuznetsova, Tatiana and Budoff, Matthew and Naghavi, Morteza",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Studies have demonstrated that the current US guidelines based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator may underestimate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in certain high-risk individuals, therefore missing opportunities for intensive therapy and preventing CVD events. Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning ( ML ) to tackle this problem. Methods and Results We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines ( SVM s) using a 13-year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD-free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC / AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5% 10-year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8% of the 480 ""Hard CVD "" events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71. In contrast, ML Risk Calculator recommended only 11.4% to take statin, and only 14.4% of ""Hard CVD "" events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.95, and AUC 0.92. Similar results were found for prediction of ""All CVD "" events. Conclusions The ML Risk Calculator outperformed the ACC/AHA Risk Calculator by recommending less drug therapy, yet missing fewer events. Additional studies are underway to validate the ML model in other cohorts and to explore its ability in short-term CVD risk prediction.",2018,10.1161/JAHA.118.009476,7,22,e009476,eng,2047-9980,Machine learning and Artificial intelligence and clinical decision support and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Risk Factors and Support Vector Machine and *Machine Learning and Risk Assessment/*methods and atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease prevention and cardiovascular disease risk factors and Cardiovascular Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control and cardiovascular risk and Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use and prediction statistics and statin,NA,NA,2018/11/20/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aim to validate a machine learning algorithm (MethinksLVO) to identify LVO on NCCT. METHODS: Patients with suspected acute stroke who underwent NCCT and computed tomography angiography (CTA) were included. Software detection of LVO (MethinksLVO) on NCCT was tested against the CTA readings of 2 experienced radiologists (NR-CTA). We used a deep learning algorithm to identify clot signs on NCCT. The software image output trained a binary classifier to determine LVO on NCCT. We studied software accuracy when adding National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and time from onset to the model (MethinksLVO+). RESULTS: From 1453 patients, 823 (57%) had LVO by NR-CTA. The area under the curve for the identification of LVO with MethinksLVO was 0.87 (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 71%, positive predictive value: 79%, negative predictive value: 76%) and improved to 0.91 with MethinksLVO+ (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 85%, positive predictive value: 88%, negative predictive value: 79%).

Here, we develop and validate an automated machine learning-based method that evaluates for large vessel occlusion (LVO) and ischemic core volume in patients using a widely available modality, computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Methods- From our prospectively maintained stroke registry and electronic medical record, we identified patients with acute ischemic stroke and stroke mimics with contemporaneous CTA and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with RAPID (IschemaView) post-processing as a part of the emergent stroke workup. A novel convolutional neural network named DeepSymNet was created and trained to identify LVO as well as infarct core from CTA source images, against CTP-RAPID definitions. Model performance was measured using 10-fold cross validation and receiver-operative curve area under the curve (AUC) statistics. Results- Among the 297 included patients, 224 (75%) had acute ischemic stroke of which 179 (60%) had LVO. Mean CTP-RAPID ischemic core volume was 23<c2><b1>42 mL. LVO locations included internal carotid artery (13%), M1 (44%), and M2 (21%). The DeepSymNet algorithm autonomously learned to identify the intracerebral vasculature on CTA and detected LVO with AUC 0.88. The method was also able to determine infarct core as defined by CTP-RAPID from the CTA source images with AUC 0.88 and 0.90 (ischemic core <e2><89><a4>30 mL and <e2><89><a4>50 mL). These findings were maintained in patients presenting in early (0-6 hours) and late (6-24 hours) time windows (AUCs 0.90 and 0.91, ischemic core <e2><89><a4>50 mL). DeepSymNet probabilities from CTA images corresponded with CTP-RAPID ischemic core volumes as a continuous variable with r=0.7 (Pearson correlation, P<0.001). Conclusions- These results demonstrate that the information needed to perform the neuroimaging evaluation for endovascular therapy with comparable accuracy to advanced imaging modalities may be present in CTA, and the ability of machine learning to automate the analysis.",2019,10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.026189,50,11,3093-3100,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"machine learning and stroke and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Acute Disease and *Databases, Factual and *Electronic Health Records and *Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Deep Learning and *Registries and *Computed Tomography Angiography and *Neuroimaging and Brain Ischemia/*diagnostic imaging/therapy and endovascular procedures and magnetic resonance imaging and neuroimaging and Stroke/*diagnostic imaging/therapy",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among its comorbidities, diabetics are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. While HbA1c remains the primary diagnostic for diabetics, its ability to predict long-term, health outcomes across diverse demographics, ethnic groups, and at a personalized level are limited. The purpose of this study was to provide a model for precision medicine through the implementation of machine-learning algorithms using multiple cardiac biomarkers as a means for predicting diabetes mellitus development. METHODS: Right atrial appendages from 50 patients, 30 non-diabetic and 20 type 2 diabetic, were procured from the WVU Ruby Memorial Hospital. Machine-learning was applied to physiological, biochemical, and sequencing data for each patient. Supervised learning implementing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) allowed binary (no diabetes or type 2 diabetes) and multiple classification (no diabetes, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes) of the patient cohort with and without the inclusion of HbA1c levels. Findings were validated through Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models with tenfold cross validation. RESULTS: Total nuclear methylation and hydroxymethylation were highly correlated to diabetic status, with nuclear methylation and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activities achieving superior testing accuracies in the predictive model (~ 84% testing, binary). Mitochondrial DNA SNPs found in the D-Loop region (SNP-73G, -16126C, and -16362C) were highly associated with diabetes mellitus. The CpG island of transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM) revealed CpG24 (chr10:58385262, P = 0.003) and CpG29 (chr10:58385324, P = 0.001) as markers correlating with diabetic progression. When combining the most predictive factors from each set, total nuclear methylation and CpG24 methylation were the best diagnostic measures in both binary and multiple classification sets. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine-learning, we were able to identify novel as well as the most relevant biomarkers associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus by integrating physiological, biochemical, and sequencing datasets.

Hu_2020_JoofthAmHeAs,JOUR,Tree-Based Machine Learning to Identify and Understand Major Determinants for Stroke at the Neighborhood Level,"Hu, Liangyuan and Liu, Bian and Ji, Jiayi and Li, Yan",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Stroke is a major cardiovascular disease that causes significant health and economic burden in the United States. Neighborhood community-based interventions have been shown to be both effective and cost-effective in preventing cardiovascular disease. There is a dearth of robust studies identifying the key determinants of cardiovascular disease and the underlying effect mechanisms at the neighborhood level. We aim to contribute to the evidence base for neighborhood cardiovascular health research. Methods and Results We created a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level by integrating 4 types of potential predictors, including unhealthy behaviors, prevention measures, sociodemographic factors, and environmental measures from multiple data sources. We used 4 tree-based machine learning techniques to identify the most critical neighborhood-level factors in predicting the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke, and compared their predictive performance for variable selection. We further quantified the effects of the identified determinants on stroke prevalence using a Bayesian linear regression model. Of the 5 most important predictors identified by our method, higher prevalence of low physical activity, larger share of older adults, higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black people, and higher ozone levels were associated with higher prevalence of stroke at the neighborhood level. Higher median household income was linked to lower prevalence. The most important interaction term showed an exacerbated adverse effect of aging and low physical activity on the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke. Conclusions Tree-based machine learning provides insights into underlying drivers of neighborhood cardiovascular health by discovering the most important determinants from a wide range of factors in an agnostic, data-driven, and reproducible way. The identified major determinants and the interactive mechanism can be used to prioritize and allocate resources to optimize community-level interventions for stroke prevention.",2020,10.1161/JAHA.120.016745,9,22,e016745,eng,2047-9980,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Exercise and Risk Factors and Socioeconomic Factors and Health Behavior and Prevalence and prevention and Age Factors and *Machine Learning and Stroke/diagnosis/*epidemiology and *Residence Characteristics and cardiovascular health and neighborhood and tree-based machine learning and variable selection,NA,NA,2020/11/17/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Early detection and prevention of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) play important roles in precision cardio-oncology. Methods and Results This retrospective study included 4309 cancer patients between 1997 and 2018 whose laboratory tests and cardiovascular echocardiographic variables were collected from the Cleveland Clinic institutional electronic medical record database (Epic Systems). Among these patients, 1560 (36%) were diagnosed with at least 1 type of CTRCD, and 838 (19%) developed CTRCD after cancer therapy (de novo). We posited that machine learning algorithms can be implemented to predict CTRCDs in cancer patients according to clinically relevant variables. Classification models were trained and evaluated for 6 types of cardiovascular outcomes, including coronary artery disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.821; 95% CI, 0.815-0.826), atrial fibrillation (AUROC, 0.787; 95% CI, 0.782-0.792), heart failure (AUROC, 0.882; 95% CI, 0.878-0.887), stroke (AUROC, 0.660; 95% CI, 0.650-0.670), myocardial infarction (AUROC, 0.807; 95% CI, 0.799-0.816), and de novo CTRCD (AUROC, 0.802; 95% CI, 0.797-0.807). Model generalizability was further confirmed using time-split data. Model inspection revealed several clinically relevant variables significantly associated with CTRCDs, including age, hypertension, glucose levels, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase levels.

Interventions to improve statin persistence and adherence have been developed over the past decade. Methods and Results This was a retrospective cohort study of adults aged <e2><89><a5>21 y with commercial or government health insurance in the MarketScan (Truven Health Analytics) and Medicare databases who initiated statins in 2007-2014 and (1) started treatment after a myocardial infarction (n=201 573), (2) had diabetes mellitus but without coronary heart disease (CHD; n=610 049), or (3) did not have CHD or diabetes mellitus (n=2 244 868). Persistence with (ie, not discontinuing treatment) and high adherence to statin therapy were assessed using pharmacy fills in the year following treatment initiation. In 2007 and 2014, the proportions of patients persistent with statin therapy were 78.1% and 79.1%, respectively, among those initiating treatment following myocardial infarction; 66.5% and 67.3%, respectively, for those with diabetes mellitus but without CHD; and 64.3% and 63.9%, respectively, for those without CHD or diabetes mellitus. Between 2007 and 2014, high adherence to statin therapy increased from 57.9% to 63.8% among patients initiating treatment following myocardial infarction and from 34.9% to 37.6% among those with diabetes mellitus but without CHD (each P(trend)<0.001). Among patients without CHD or diabetes mellitus, high adherence did not improve between 2007 (35.7%) and 2014 (36.8%; P(trend)=0.14).

Zhao_2020_Stro,JOUR,Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Stroke Care and Potential Solutions,"Zhao, Jing and Li, Hang and Kung, David and Fisher, Marc and Shen, Ying and Liu, Renyu",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak became paramount, medical care for other devastating diseases was negatively impacted. In this study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care across China. METHODS: Data from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China consisting of 280 hospitals across China demonstrated a significant drop in the number of cases of thrombolysis and thrombectomy. We designed a survey to investigate the major changes during the COVID-19 outbreak and potential causes of these changes. The survey was distributed to the leaders of stroke centers in these 280 hospitals. RESULTS: From the data of Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China, the total number of thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped 26.7% (P<0.0001) and 25.3% (P<0.0001), respectively, in February 2020 as compared with February 2019. We retrieved 227 valid complete datasets from the 280 stroke centers. Nearly 50% of these hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19. The capacity for stroke care was reduced in the majority of the hospitals. Most of the stroke centers stopped or reduced their efforts in stroke education for the public. Hospital admissions related to stroke dropped <e2><89><88>40%; thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped <e2><89><88>25%, which is similar to the results from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China as compared with the same period in 2019. Many factors contributed to the reduced admissions and prehospital delays; lack of stroke knowledge and proper transportation were significant limiting factors. Patients not coming to the hospital for fear of virus infection was also a likely key factor. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak impacted stroke care significantly in China, including prehospital and in-hospital care, resulting in a significant drop in admissions, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. Although many factors contributed, patients not coming to the hospital was probably the major limiting factor.

We sought to determine whether patient race influences allocation of advanced heart failure therapies. Methods and Results Members of a national heart failure organization were randomized to clinical vignettes that varied by patient race (black or white man) and were blinded to study objectives. Participants (N=422) completed Likert scale surveys rating factors for advanced therapy allocation and think-aloud interviews (n=44). Survey results were analyzed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariable regression to identify factors influencing advanced therapy allocation, including interactions with vignette race and participant demographics. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Surveys revealed no differences in overall racial ratings for advanced therapies. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression selected no interactions between vignette race and clinical factors as important in allocation. However, interactions between participants aged <e2><89><a5>40 years and black vignette negatively influenced heart transplant allocation modestly (-0.58; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.0002), with adherence and social history the most influential factors. Interviews revealed sequential decision making: forming overall impression, identifying urgency, evaluating prior care appropriateness, anticipating challenges, and evaluating trust while making recommendations. Race influenced each step: avoiding discussing race, believing photographs may contribute to racial bias, believing the black man was sicker compared with the white man, developing greater concern for trust and adherence with the black man, and ultimately offering the white man transplantation and the black man ventricular assist device implantation. Conclusions Black race modestly influenced decision making for heart transplant, particularly during conversations.

We hypothesized that this new study design shows that a next-generation mechanical thrombectomy system is superior to intravenous tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) therapy (IVT) alone. Methods- ERASER (Eric Acute Stroke Recanalization) was an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, single-arm (virtual 2-arm) study that evaluated the effectiveness of a new recanalization device together with a specific intermediate catheter (Embolus Retriever with Interlinked Cages/SOFIA, Microvention) in stroke patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusions. The primary end point was the volume of saved tissue. Volume of saved tissue was defined as the difference of actual infarct volume and brain volume predicted to develop infarction using a machine learning model based on data from intravenous tPA therapy patients. Results- Eighty-one patients were enrolled. The median patient age was 71 years (interquartile range, 61-77). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 14 (interquartile range, 12-18). The actual infarct volume was smaller than predicted by the intravenous tPA therapy model, with a median volume of saved tissue of 50 mL (interquartile range, 19-103; P<0.0001). Good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2 at 90 days) was observed in 48 out of 69 (70%). The recanalization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3) was 95%. Conclusions- ERASER is the first mechanical thrombectomy study with a primary end point based on predictive analytics enabling intraindividual virtual comparisons. The next-generation mechanical thrombectomy method resulted in smaller infarcts than predicted after intravenous tPA therapy alone and showed a high rate of good clinical outcome. The novel study design with virtual comparisons is promising for further application and testing in the neurovascular arena. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Pathological studies have associated 75% of coronary artery events with atherosclerotic plaque rupture; it is now known that rupture alone is not enough for obstruction or occlusion of the vessel lumen. Concomitant conditions are required for the clinical manifestation of cardiovascular disease, including prothrombogenic and dysfunctional endothelium, less fibrinolytic capacity to protect it, increased platelet activation, increased adrenergic tone, microcirculation vasoconstriction, and other countless factors that contribute to thrombus formation, causing ischemia or infarction. But in most cases, repair of plaque rupture and re endothelization of the lesion are asymptomatic and silent. Atherosclerotic process is a chronic and progressive immune inflammation. Most of the therapeutic indications include statins, which cause side effects in 10% of patients, with a range varying between 7 and 21%, according to different authors. Many investigators have proved that statin use contribute to the genesis of diabetes, reports vary between 1 and 46%, where marked elevation of blood glucose fasting levels and glycosylated hemoglobin have been observed, be it by increased tissue resistance to insulin or by reduced <ce><b2>-cell insulin secretion.

However, no quantitative methods are available for the selection of the best endovascular strategy or to predict the difficulty of clot removal. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of an endovascular strategy based on radiomic features extracted from the clot on preinterventional, noncontrast computed tomography to identify patients with first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration and to predict the overall number of passages needed with an MTB device for successful recanalization. METHODS: We performed a study including 2 cohorts of patients admitted to our hospital: a retrospective training cohort (n=109) and a prospective validation cohort (n=47). Thrombi were segmented on noncontrast computed tomography, followed by the automatic computation of 1485 thrombus-related radiomic features. After selection of the relevant features, 2 machine learning models were developed on the training cohort to predict (1) first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration and (2) the overall number of passages with MTB devices for successful recanalization. The performance of the models was evaluated on the prospective validation cohort. RESULTS: A small subset of radiomic features (n=9) was predictive of first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration (receiver operating characteristic curve-area under the curve, 0.88). The same subset also predicted the overall number of passages required for successful recanalization (explained variance, 0.70; mean squared error, 0.76; Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.73; P<0.05).

We aimed to model this process with machine learning and predict the long-term clinical outcome of LVO before endovascular treatment and to compare our method with previously developed pretreatment scoring methods. Methods- The derivation cohort included 387 LVO patients, and the external validation cohort included 115 LVO patients with anterior circulation who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. The statistical model with logistic regression without regularization and machine learning algorithms, such as regularized logistic regression, linear support vector machine, and random forest, were used to predict good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days) with standard and multiple pretreatment clinical variables. Five previously reported pretreatment scoring methods (the Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular Therapy score, the Stroke Prognostication Using Age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale index, the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events score, the Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy score, and the Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy 2 score) were compared with these models for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results- The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of random forest, which was the worst among the machine learning algorithms, was significantly higher than those of the standard statistical model and the best model among the previously reported pretreatment scoring methods in the derivation (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.85<c2><b1>0.07 for random forest, 0.78<c2><b1>0.08 for logistic regression without regularization, and 0.77<c2><b1>0.09 for Stroke Prognostication using Age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and validation cohorts (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.87<c2><b1>0.01 for random forest, 0.56<c2><b1>0.07 for logistic regression without regularization, and 0.83<c2><b1>0.00 for Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular Therapy).

However, the models developed for a diabetic population are based on information derived from medical records or laboratory results, which are not typically available to entities like payers or quality of care organizations. The objective of this study is to develop and validate models predicting the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM based on medical insurance claims data. METHODS: Patients with T2DM aged 50 years or older were identified from the Optum<e2><84><a2> Integrated Real World Evidence Electronic Health Records and Claims de-identified database (10/01/2006-09/30/2016). Risk factors were assessed over a 12-month baseline period and cardiovascular events were monitored from the end of the baseline period until end of data availability, continuous enrollment, or death. Risk models were developed using logistic regressions separately for patients with and without prior CVD, and for each outcome: (1) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; i.e., non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, CVD-related death); (2) any MACE, hospitalization for unstable angina, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure; (3) CVD-related death. Models were developed and validated on 70% and 30% of the sample, respectively. Model performance was assessed using C-statistics. RESULTS: A total of 181,619 patients were identified, including 136,544 (75.2%) without prior CVD and 45,075 (24.8%) with a history of CVD. Age, diabetes-related hospitalizations, prior CVD diagnoses and chronic pulmonary disease were the most important predictors across all models. C-statistics ranged from 0.70 to 0.81, indicating that the models performed well. The additional inclusion of risk factors derived from pharmacy claims (e.g., use of antihypertensive, and use of antihyperglycemic) or from medical records and laboratory measures (e.g., hemoglobin A1c, urine albumin to creatinine ratio) only marginally improved the performance of the models.

This study developed a prediction model for time in therapeutic range (TTR) among newly diagnosed AF patients on newly initiated warfarin as a tool to assist decision making between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. METHODS AND RESULTS: This electronic medical record-based, retrospective study included newly diagnosed, nonvalvular AF patients with no recent warfarin exposure receiving primary care services through a large healthcare system in rural Pennsylvania. TTR was estimated as the percentage of time international normalized ratio measurements were between 2.0 and 3.0 during the first year following warfarin initiation. Candidate predictors of TTR were chosen from data elements collected during usual clinical care. A TTR prediction model was developed and temporally validated and its predictive performance was compared with the SAMe-TT(2)R(2) score (sex, age, medical history, treatment, tobacco, race) using R(2) and c-statistics. A total of 7877 newly diagnosed AF patients met study inclusion criteria. Median (interquartile range) TTR within the first year of starting warfarin was 51% (32, 67). Of 85 candidate predictors evaluated, 15 were included in the final validated model with an R(2) of 15.4%. The proposed model showed better predictive performance than the SAMe-TT(2)R(2) score (R(2)=3.0%).

Current guidelines assign a Class Ic recommendation for an HT approach to complex coronary artery disease ( CAD ). However, there remains a paucity of data in regard to hard clinical end points. The aim was to determine characteristics and outcomes in patients with complex CAD following HT discussion. Methods and Results This observational study was conducted at St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK). Case mixture included unprotected left main, 2-vessel (including proximal left anterior descending artery) CAD , 3-vessel CAD , or anatomical and/or clinical equipoise. HT strategy was defined as optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) alone, OMT +percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ), or OMT +coronary artery bypass grafting. From April 2012 to 2013, 51 HT meetings were held and 398 cases were discussed. Patients tended to have multivessel CAD (74.1%), high SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) scores (median, 30; interquartile range, 23-39), and average age 69<c2><b1>11 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis performed to determine variables associated with HT strategy demonstrated decreased likelihood of undergoing PCI compared with OMT in older patients with chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease. The odds of undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting compared with OMT decreased in the presence of cardiogenic shock and left ventricular dysfunction and increased in younger patients with 3-vessel CAD .

Michael",Journal of the American Heart Association,"BACKGROUND: Stigma against the obese is well described in health care and may contribute to disparities in medical decision-making. It is unknown whether similar disparity exists for obese patients in cardiovascular care. We evaluated the association between body mass index (BMI) and prescription of guideline-recommended medications in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from the Veterans Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention from 2007 to 2012, stratifying them by category of BMI. We described rates of prescription for class I guideline recommended medications for each BMI category (normal, overweight, and obese). Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between BMI category and medication prescription. Seventeen thousand thirty-seven patients were identified, with 35.3% having overweight BMI, and 50.8% obese BMI. Obese patients were more likely than normal BMI patients to be prescribed <ce><b2>-blockers (OR 1.34), statins (OR 1.39), or ACE/ARB (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; all significant) when indicated. Overweight patients were more likely than normal BMI patients to be prescribed statins (OR 1.29) and angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR 1.41) when indicated. There was no association between BMI category and prescription of anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Over 85% of patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention in the Veterans Affairs are overweight or obese.

Visual displays can permit individuals to rapidly understand response patterns to therapy. This study sought to evaluate, refine, and improve existing visual aids for stroke fibrinolytic decision-making. METHODS: Existing visual aids were identified by Medline search and querying of national guideline organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and stroke specialists, and were rated on a formal 8-point quality rating scale (0, lowest; 8, highest). Based on available instruments, new visual displays were developed to improve informed decision-making in routine practice. RESULTS: Two existing visual aids were identified, one from an emergency medicine society and one from a pharmaceutical company. Both were comparison visual displays of outcomes with and without treatment; no decision matrix visual aid was found. Both scored 4.0 on the quality scale, showing defects of effect size distortion, privileging less salient outcomes, dissimilar representation by treatment group, and limited stakeholder participation in generation. Revised versions of these graphics were developed with higher quality scores (6.75 and 7.75). In addition, a new decision matrix display with quality score 8.0 was developed that complements the numeric text of a national patient education tool developed jointly by US neurology, emergency medicine, and stroke patient organizations.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We compare the responses of the in vitro human and cynomolgus vascular systems to 4 statins. Although statins exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on the human vasculature, the mechanism of action is difficult to investigate at the tissue level. Using RNA sequencing, we quantified the response to statins and report that most statins significantly increased the expression of genes that promote vascular health while suppressing inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Applying computational pathway analytics, we identified statin-regulated biological themes, independent of cholesterol lowering, that provide mechanisms for off-target effects, including thrombosis, cell cycle regulation, glycogen metabolism, and ethanol degradation.

We sought to estimate the incidence and costs associated with transvenous lead damage following cardiac implantable electronic device replacement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Research Database, we identified health care claims between 2009 and 2013 for lead damage following generator replacement. Patients were identified by claims with a procedure code for cardiac implantable electronic device replacement and then evaluated for 1 year. All follow-up visits for lead damage were identified, and incidence, risk factors, and hospitalization costs were determined. A total of 22 557 patients with pacemakers, 20 632 with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and 2063 with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators met selection criteria. Incidence of lead damage was 0.46% for pacemaker replacement, 1.27% for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator replacement, and 1.94% for cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator replacement procedures (P<0.001). After adjusting for patient characteristics, patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators demonstrated risk of lead damage that was, respectively, double (hazard ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and >2.5 times (hazard ratio 2.58, 95% CI 1.73-3.83) that of patients with pacemakers.

Consequently, subtype classification of ischemic stroke is important for risk stratification and secondary prevention. Because manual classification of ischemic stroke is time-intensive, we assessed the accuracy of automated algorithms for performing cardioembolic stroke subtyping using an electronic health record (EHR) database. METHODS: We adapted TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) features associated with cardioembolic stroke for derivation in the EHR. Using administrative codes and echocardiographic reports within Mass General Brigham Biobank (N=13 079), we iteratively developed EHR-based algorithms to define the TOAST cardioembolic stroke features, revising regular expression algorithms until achieving positive predictive value <e2><89><a5>80%. We compared several machine learning-based statistical algorithms for discriminating cardioembolic stroke using the feature algorithms applied to EHR data from 1598 patients with acute ischemic strokes from the Massachusetts General Hospital Ischemic Stroke Registry (2002-2010) with previously adjudicated TOAST and Causative Classification of Stroke subtypes. RESULTS: Regular expression-based feature extraction algorithms achieved a mean positive predictive value of 95% (range, 88%-100%) across 11 echocardiographic features. Among 1598 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital Ischemic Stroke Registry, 1068 had any cardioembolic stroke feature within predefined time windows in proximity to the stroke event. Cardioembolic stroke tended to occur at an older age, with more TOAST-based comorbidities, and with atrial fibrillation (82.3%). The best model was a random forest with 92.2% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 91.1% (95% CI, 87.5%-93.9%). Atrial fibrillation, age, dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, patent foramen ovale, mitral annulus calcification, and recent myocardial infarction were the most discriminatory features.

It is through this lens that two examples are described in which innovative approaches have been used to dissect the complexities of stroke pathophysiology. The first example focuses on one of the most fundamental genetic factors relevant to the brain and ischemic injury: biological sex. Much might be gained by understanding the details of sex-specific pathobiology, if the field is to develop therapies that work well in patients of both sexes. The second example surrounds brain-spleen cell cycling after stroke which is fundamental to our evolving understanding that stroke is a systemic disease, rather than solely a lesion of the brain. While much work remains, it is now apparent that brain-spleen cell cycling is temporally specific, varies in intensity, and involves cell players that are of much wider lineages than originally believed. In the future, it is likely that innovation will need to turn to ""big data"", particularly if our field is to tackle the daunting questions that most greatly matter to unraveling brain injury.

On the MSU, IAT decision-making steps, such as computed tomography, neurological exam, and tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) treatment are completed before emergency department arrival. We hypothesized that such pre-ED assessment of potential IAT patients on an MSU improves the time from ED arrival to skin puncture time (door-to-puncture-time, DTPT). Methods- BEST-MSU is a prospective comparative effectiveness study of MSU versus standard management by emergency medical services (EMS). We compared ED DTPT among the following groups of MSU and EMS patients: all IAT patients, IAT patients post-tPA, and IAT patients post-tPA meeting thrombolytic adjudication criteria over the first 4 years of the study. Results- From August 2014 to July 2018, a total of 161 patients underwent IAT. Ninety-four patients presented to the ED via the MSU and 67 by EMS. One hundred forty patients received tPA before IAT, 85 in the MSU arm, and 55 in the EMS arm. One hundred twenty-six patients received tPA within thrombolytic adjudication criteria: 76 MSU and 50 EMS. DTPT in minutes was shorter for MSU patients (all IAT MSU versus EMS 89 versus 99, P=0.01; IAT post-tPA MSU versus EMS 93 versus 100, P=0.03; and IAT post-tPA within adjudicated criteria MSU versus EMS 93 versus 99.5, P=0.03). From 2014 to 2018, DTPT decreased at a faster rate for EMS compared with MSU-managed patients, improving by about an hour.

Textbooks of medicine and cardiology as well as guideline documents and position papers describe palpitations as a common symptom of ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, data to support this description are lacking. The aim of our study was to evaluate the symptomatology of sustained monomorphic VT with emphasis on the prevalence of palpitations. Methods and Results Consecutive patients presenting to our center with a first event of a regular sustained monomorphic VT (n=59) or a regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT; n=109) between January 2012 and September 2019 were interviewed regarding their symptoms during the arrhythmic event. We included only patients with a first arrhythmic event to avoid the influence of previous medical encounters on our patients' terminology. As expected, patients with VT were older (age 68.8<c2><b1>13.6 versus 52.6<c2><b1>16.8 years; P<0.001), more often of male sex (94.9% versus 37.6%; P<0.001), had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (37<c2><b1>11% versus 59<c2><b1>2%, P<0.001) and more comorbidities (87.6% versus 40.5%; P<0.001) compared with patients with SVT. Importantly, even though the heart rate upon presentation did not differ between the 2 groups (165<c2><b1>26 beats/min during VT versus 171<c2><b1>32 beats/min during SVT; P=0.16), symptomatology differed significantly; specifically, palpitations were reported in only 8.8% of VT patients, compared with 90.7% of SVT patients (P<0.001).

However, evidence from developing countries in this regard is rather limited, and there is a need to assess the impact of a clinical DSS on managing HTN in primary health care center (PHC) settings. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a clinical DSS among Indian adult hypertensive patients (between 35 and 64 years of age), wherein 16 PHC clusters from a district of Telangana state, India, were randomized to receive either a DSS or a chart-based support (CBS) system. Each intervention arm had 8 PHC clusters, with a mean of 102 hypertensive patients per cluster (n=845 in DSS and 783 in CBS groups). Mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 12 months was the primary endpoint. The mean difference in SBP change from baseline between the DSS and CBS at the 12th month of follow-up, adjusted for age, sex, height, waist, body mass index, alcohol consumption, vegetable intake, pickle intake, and baseline differences in blood pressure, was -6.59 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: -12.18 to -1.42; P=0.021).

However, limited data are available regarding the decision-making and outcomes of patients based on this strategy. Methods and Results One hundred sixty-six high-risk coronary artery disease patients underwent Heart Team evaluation at a single institution between January 2015 and November 2018. We prospectively collected data on demographics, symptoms, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality/Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (STS-PROM/SYNTAX) scores, mode of revascularization, and outcomes. Mean age was 70.0 years; 122 (73.5%) patients were male. Prevalent comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (51.8%), peripheral artery disease (38.6%), atrial fibrillation (27.1%), end-stage renal disease on dialysis (13.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.7%). Eighty-seven (52.4%) patients had New York Heart Association III-IV and 112 (67.5%) had Canadian Cardiovascular Society III-IV symptomatology. Sixty-seven (40.4%) patients had left main and 118 (71.1%) had 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The median STS-PROM was 3.6% (interquartile range 1.9, 8.0) and SYNTAX score was 26 (interquartile range 20, 34). The median number of physicians per Heart Team meeting was 6 (interquartile range 5, 8). Seventy-nine (47.6%) and 49 (29.5%) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively. With increasing STS-PROM (low, intermediate, high operative risk), coronary artery bypass graft was performed less often (47.9%, 18.5%, 15.2%) and optimal medical therapy was recommended more often (11.3%, 18.5%, 30.3%). There were no trends in recommendation for coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, or optimal medical therapy by SYNTAX score tertiles. In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 3.9% and 4.8%, respectively.

We sought to describe a new smartphone freeware application designed to assist Emergency Medical Services professionals with the field assessment and destination triage of patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Review of the application's platform and its development as well as the different variables, assessments, algorithms, and assumptions involved. RESULTS: The FAST-ED (Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination) application is based on a built-in automated decision-making algorithm that relies on (1) a brief series of questions assessing patient's age, anticoagulant usage, time last known normal, motor weakness, gaze deviation, aphasia, and hemineglect; (2) a database of all regional stroke centers according to their capability to provide endovascular treatment; and (3) Global Positioning System technology with real-time traffic information to compute the patient's eligibility for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator or endovascular treatment as well as the distances/transportation times to the different neighboring stroke centers in order to assist Emergency Medical Services professionals with the decision about the most suitable destination for any given patient with acute ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The FAST-ED smartphone application has great potential to improve the triage of patients with acute ischemic stroke, as it seems capable to optimize resources, reduce hospital arrivals times, and maximize the use of both intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular treatment ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.

R. and Vollmuth, Philipp",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study assessed the predictive performance and relative importance of clinical, multimodal imaging, and angiographic characteristics for predicting the clinical outcome of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: A consecutive series of 246 patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular treatment between April 2014 and January 2018 was analyzed. Clinical, conventional imaging (electronic Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, acute ischemic volume, site of vessel occlusion, and collateral score), and advanced imaging characteristics (CT-perfusion with quantification of ischemic penumbra and infarct core volumes) before treatment as well as angiographic (interval groin puncture-recanalization, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score) and postinterventional clinical (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score after 24 hours) and imaging characteristics (electronic Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, final infarction volume after 18-36 hours) were assessed. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days (mRS-90) was used to measure patient outcome (favorable outcome: mRS-90 <e2><89><a4>2 versus unfavorable outcome: mRS-90 >2). Machine-learning with gradient boosting classifiers was used to assess the performance and relative importance of the extracted characteristics for predicting mRS-90. RESULTS: Baseline clinical and conventional imaging characteristics predicted mRS-90 with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.740 (95% CI, 0.733-0.747) and an accuracy of 0.711 (95% CI, 0.705-0.717). Advanced imaging with CT-perfusion did not improved the predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.740-0.755]; accuracy, 0.720 [95% CI, 0.714-0.727]; P=0.150). Further inclusion of angiographic and postinterventional characteristics significantly improved the predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.856 [95% CI, 0.850-0.861]; accuracy, 0.804 [95% CI, 0.799-0.810]; P<0.001). The most important parameters for predicting mRS 90 were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score after 24 hours (importance =100%), premorbid mRS score (importance =44%) and final infarction volume on postinterventional CT after 18 to 36 hours (importance =32%). CONCLUSIONS: Integrative assessment of clinical, multimodal imaging, and angiographic characteristics with machine-learning allowed to accurately predict the clinical outcome following endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Thereby, premorbid mRS was the most important clinical predictor for mRS-90, and the final infarction volume was the most important imaging predictor, while the extent of hemodynamic impairment on CT-perfusion before treatment had limited importance.",2020,10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030287,51,12,3541-3551,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"machine learning and stroke and Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Machine Learning and Aged, 80 and over and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted and Computed Tomography Angiography and *Clinical Decision Rules and thrombectomy and *Thrombectomy and *Endovascular Procedures and angiography and Carotid Artery Thrombosis/diagnostic imaging/surgery and cerebral infarction and Infarction, Anterior Cerebral Artery/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Ischemic Stroke/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*surgery and perfusion imaging and Perfusion Imaging and tomography, spiral computed",NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted 199 semistructured interviews with consecutive ACS patients who were aged 35 to 75 years, competent to provide consent, and English speaking. Questions addressed the factors known to predict prehospital delay, awareness of the campaign, and whether it increased knowledge and influenced actions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between campaign awareness and a 1-hour delay in deciding to seek medical attention (patient delay) and a 2-hour delay in presenting to hospital (prehospital delay). The median age was 62 years (IQR=53 to 68 years), and 68% (n=136) were male. Awareness of the campaign was reported by 127 (64%) patients, with most of these patients stating the campaign (1) increased their understanding of what is a heart attack (63%), (2) increased their awareness of the signs and symptoms of heart attack (68%), and (3) influenced their actions in response to symptoms (43%).

However, the true severity of AS and the management of NF-LG-SAS are controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with NF-LG-SAS compared with moderate AS (MAS) and with high-gradient severe-AS (HG-SAS). Methods and Results A total of 154 patients with NF-LG-SAS, 366 with MAS (aortic valve area between 1.0 and 1.3 cm(2)), and 1055 with HG-SAS were included. On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for covariates of prognostic importance, NF-LG-SAS patients did not exhibit an excess risk of mortality compared with MAS patients under medical management (hazard ratio=1.13 [95% CI, 0.82-1.56]; P=0.45) and under medical and surgical management (hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI, 0.79-1.43]; P=0.70), even after further adjustment for aortic valve replacement (hazard ratio=1.09 [95% CI, 0.81-1.48]; P=0.56). The 6-year cumulative incidence of aortic valve replacement (performed in accordance with guidelines) was comparable between the 2 groups (39<c2><b1>4% for NF-LG-SAS and 35<c2><b1>3% for MAS, P=0.10). After propensity score matching (n=226), NF-LG-SAS and MAS patients also had comparable outcomes under medical (P=0.41) and under medical and surgical management (P=0.52). NF-LG-SAS had better outcomes than HG-SAS patients (adjusted hazard ratio 1.84 [95% CI, 1.18-2.88]; P<0.001). Conclusions This study shows that patients with NF-LG-SAS have a comparable outcome to those with MAS when aortic valve replacement is performed during follow-up according to guidelines, mostly at the stage of HG-SAS.

We compared incident cardiovascular disease risk prediction using past, current, and usual systolic blood pressure alone or in combination. Methods and Results Using data from UK primary care linked electronic health records, we applied a landmark cohort study design and identified 80 964 people, aged 50 years (derivation cohort=64 772; validation cohort=16 192), who, at study entry, had recorded blood pressure, no prior cardiovascular disease, and no previous antihypertensive or lipid-lowering prescriptions. We used systolic blood pressure recorded up to 10 years before baseline to estimate past systolic blood pressure (mean, time-weighted mean, and variability) and usual systolic blood pressure (correcting current values for past time-dependent blood pressure fluctuations) and examined their prospective relation with incident cardiovascular disease (first hospitalization for or death from coronary heart disease or stroke/transient ischemic attack). We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and applied Bayesian analysis within a machine learning framework in model development and validation. Predictive performance of models was assessed using discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration metrics. We found that elevated past, current, and usual systolic blood pressure values were separately and independently associated with increased incident cardiovascular disease risk. When used alone, the hazard ratio (95% credible interval) per 20-mm Hg increase in current systolic blood pressure was 1.22 (1.18-1.30), but associations were stronger for past systolic blood pressure (mean and time-weighted mean) and usual systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio ranging from 1.39-1.45). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for a model that included current systolic blood pressure, sex, smoking, deprivation, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile was 0.747 (95% credible interval, 0.722-0.811). The addition of past systolic blood pressure mean, time-weighted mean, or variability to this model increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% credible interval) to 0.750 (0.727-0.811), 0.750 (0.726-0.811), and 0.748 (0.723-0.811), respectively, with all models showing good calibration. Similar small improvements in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were observed when testing models on the validation cohort, in sex-stratified analyses, or by using different landmark ages (40 or 60 years).

V. and Fiehler, Jens and Gralla, Jan and Fischer, Urs",Stroke,"In patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, achieving complete (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 3) rather than incomplete successful reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b) is associated with better functional outcome. Despite technical improvements, incomplete reperfusion remains the final angiographic result in 40% of patients according to recent trials. As most incomplete reperfusions are caused by distal vessel occlusions, they are potentially amenable to rescue strategies. While observational data suggest a net benefit of up to 20% in functional independence of incomplete versus complete reperfusions, the net benefit of secondary improvement from Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 reperfusion might differ due to lengthier procedures and delayed reperfusion. Current strategies to tackle distal vessel occlusions consist of distal (microcatheter) aspiration, small adjustable stent retrievers, and administration of intra-arterial thrombolytics. While there are promising reports evaluating those techniques, all available studies show relevant limitations in terms of selection bias, single-center design, or nonconsecutive patient inclusion. Besides an assessment of risks associated with rescue maneuvers, we advocate that the decision-making process should also include a consideration of potential outcomes if complete reperfusion would successfully be achieved. These include (1) a futile angiographic improvement (hypoperfused territory is already infarcted), (2) an unnecessary angiographic improvement (the patient would not have developed infarction if no rescue maneuver was performed), and (3) a successful rescue maneuver with clinical benefit. Currently there is paucity of data on how these scenarios can be predicted and the decision whether to treat or to stop in a patient with incomplete reperfusion involves many unknowns.

We sought to evaluate different specifications of this algorithm within a region. METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation environment to model patients with suspected stroke transported according to algorithm specifications, which varied by stroke severity screen and permissible additional transport time for routing patients to ESCs. We simulated King County, Washington, and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, distributing patients geographically into census tracts. Transport time to the nearest hospital and ESC was estimated using traffic-based travel times. We assessed undertriage, overtriage, transport time, and the number-needed-to-route, defined as the number of patients enduring additional transport to route one large vessel occlusion patient to an ESC. RESULTS: Undertriage was higher and overtriage was lower in King County compared with Mecklenburg County for each specification. Overtriage variation was primarily driven by screen (eg, 13%-55% in Mecklenburg County and 10%-40% in King County). Transportation time specifications beyond 20 minutes increased overtriage and decreased undertriage in King County but not Mecklenburg County. A low- versus high-specificity screen routed 3.7* more patients to ESCs. Emergency medical services spent nearly twice the time routing patients to ESCs in King County compared with Mecklenburg County.

Stroke patients are often unable to participate in decision making, highlighting the need for advance care planning ( ACP ) in poststroke care. We sought to better understand experiences and perceptions around stroke risk and ACP in our stroke clinic. Methods and Results Clinic patients completed the Planning After Stroke Survival survey assessing (1) advance directive ( AD ) documentation and ACP conversations, (2) factors associated with ADs and ACP , (3) perceptions of stroke risk, and (4) ACP needs. We used a physician survey and the electronic medical record to assess clinical and demographic information. We collected 219 surveys (78% response rate). Forty-five percent reported having completed ADs , although the correlation between patient report and EMS documentation of ADs was low. Most patients (73%) had discussed ACP , and 58% desired additional conversation.

However, the limited uniform standards for registries may create substantial variability in registry implementation and utility to regulators. We surveyed the current landscape of US cardiovascular device registries and chart the extent of inconsistency in goals, administration, enrollment procedures, and approach to data access. Methods and Results A systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines identified studies (1995-2017) referencing cardiovascular device registries with a US-based institution. Registries were then evaluated by reviewing associated articles and websites. Extracted data included device type, primary scientific aim(s), funding, stewardship (eg, administration of registry procedures), enrollment procedures, informed consent process, and mechanisms to access data for research. The 138 cardiovascular device registries in the cohort covered devices addressing interventional cardiology (65.9%), arrhythmias (15.2%), heart failure (10.1%), and valvular disease (10.1%). While the majority (55.8%) were industry-funded, stewardship was predominantly overseen by academic centers (74.0%). Most registry participation was voluntary (77.5%), but a substantial minority (19.7%) were required as a condition of device implantation. Informed consent requirements varied widely, with written consent required in only 55.1% of registries. Registry data were primarily accessible only to stewards (84.1%), with 13.8% providing pathways for external applications. Conclusions The majority of cardiovascular device registries were funded privately under the auspices of academic institutions, which set the rules for data access. The substantial variation between cardiovascular device registries suggests a role for regulators to further strengthen guidelines to improve quality, consistency, and ethical standards.",2019,10.1161/JAHA.119.012756,8,11,e012756,eng,2047-9980,"Humans and Risk Factors and Access to Information and systematic review and Patient Safety and Patient Selection and Informed Consent and Research Support as Topic and *Product Surveillance, Postmarketing and registry and Prosthesis Design and *Consumer Product Safety/legislation & jurisprudence and *Registries/ethics and *Research Design/legislation & jurisprudence and Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy and post-market surveillance and Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/*instrumentation",NA,NA,2019/06/04/,J Am Heart Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The extent to which 30-day readmissions after PCI are preventable is unknown yet essential to minimizing their occurrence. METHODS AND RESULTS: PCI patients readmitted to hospital at which PCI was performed within 30 days of discharge at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital were identified, and their medical records were independently reviewed by 2 physicians. Each reviewer used an ordinal scale (0, not; 1, possibly; 2, probably; and 3, definitely preventable) to rate clinical preventability, and a total sum score <e2><89><a5>2 was considered preventable. Characteristics of preventable and unpreventable readmissions were compared, and predictors of clinical preventability were assessed by using multivariate logistic regression. Of 9288 PCIs performed, 9081 (97.8%) patients survived to initial hospital discharge and 1007 (11.1%) were readmitted to the index hospital within 30 days. After excluding repeat readmissions, 893 readmissions were reviewed. Fair agreement between physician reviewers was observed (weighted <ce><ba> statistic 0.44 [95% CI 0.39 to 0.49]). After aggregation of scores, 380 (42.6%) readmissions were deemed preventable and 513 (57.4%) were deemed not preventable. Common causes of preventable readmissions included staged PCI without new symptoms (14.7%), vascular/bleeding complications of PCI (10.0%), and congestive heart failure (9.7%).

We aim to comprehensively compare sex-stratified associations between measures of LV remodeling and increasing LV mass in the general population. Methods and Results Participants were prospectively recruited in the National Heart Center Singapore Biobank to examine health and cardiovascular risk factors in the general population. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in all individuals. Participants with established cardiovascular diseases and abnormal cardiovascular magnetic resonance scan results were excluded. Global and regional measures of LV remodeling (geometry, function, interstitial volumes, and wall stress) were performed using conventional image analysis and novel 3-dimensional machine learning phenotyping. Sex-stratified analyses were performed in 1005 participants (57% males; 53<c2><b1>13 years). Age and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors were well-matched in both sexes (P>0.05 for all). Progressive increase in LV mass was associated with increased concentricity in either sex, but to a greater extent in females. Compared with males, females had higher wall stress (mean difference: 170 mm Hg, P<0.0001) despite smaller LV mass (42.4<c2><b1>8.2 versus 55.6<c2><b1>14.2 g/m(2), P<0.0001), lower blood pressures (P<0.0001), and higher LV ejection fraction (61.9<c2><b1>5.9% versus 58.6<c2><b1>6.4%, P<0.0001).

Specific cell types in these cardiovascular tissues become activated following the exposure to systemic stimuli including circulating lipoproteins or inflammatory mediators. This activation induces multiple cascades of events where changes in cell phenotypes and activation of certain receptors may trigger multiple pathways and specific alterations to the transcriptome. Modifications to the transcriptome and proteome can give rise to pathological cell phenotypes and trigger mechanisms that exacerbate inflammation, proliferation, calcification, and recruitment of resident or distant cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that each cell type involved in vascular and valvular diseases is heterogeneous. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a transforming medical research tool that enables the profiling of the unique fingerprints at single-cell levels. Its applications have allowed the construction of cell atlases including the mammalian heart and tissue vasculature and the discovery of new cell types implicated in cardiovascular disease. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel resident cell populations that become activated during disease and has allowed tracing the transition of healthy cells into pathological phenotypes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing has permitted the characterization of heterogeneous cell subpopulations with unique genetic profiles in healthy and pathological cardiovascular tissues.

We investigated the effect of thrombophilia test acquisition on venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcomes. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients over a 15-year period (September 2001 and May 2016) with first diagnosis of VTE in a single academic medical center. Participants were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and medication history. Participants with thrombophilia testing were matched to control participants without thrombophilia testing using a propensity model. Primary outcomes included recurrent VTE, anticoagulant use 12 months after the index VTE event, bleeding-related hospitalization, and death. From 3590 unique patients who met the inclusion criteria, 747 participants with VTE who underwent thrombophilia testing were matched to a control participant without testing. Tested participants were more likely to have a recurrent event (46.1% versus 28.5%; P<0.001) and an anticoagulant prescription 12 months from the index event (53.9% versus 37.1%; P<0.001) but had no significant difference in bleeding-related hospitalization (11.4% versus 11.8%; P=0.81) compared with untested participants. An abnormal thrombophilia test result, per se, did not predict recurrent VTE (47.8% versus 44.1%; P=0.13), longer duration anticoagulation (53.2% versus 54.8%; P=0.51), bleeding (11.5% versus 11.3%; P=0.70), or mortality (12.2% versus 16.1%; P=0.18) compared with participants who had normal test results.

We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a decision-making rule based on the ultrasound imaging assessment of plaque echolucency in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Methods and Results We used a decision-analytic model to project lifetime quality-adjusted life years and costs for 5 stroke prevention strategies: (1) medical therapy only; (2) revascularization if both plaque echolucency and stenosis progression to >90% are present; (3) revascularization only if plaque echolucency is present; (4) revascularization only if stenosis progression >90% is present; or (5) either plaque echolucency or stenosis progression is present. Risks of clinical events, costs, and quality-of-life values were estimated based on published sources and the analysis was conducted from a healthcare system perspective for asymptomatic patients with 70% to 89% carotid stenosis at presentation. Patients who did not undergo revascularization had the highest stroke events (17.6%) and lowest life-years (8.45), while those who underwent revascularization on the basis of either presence of plaque echolucency on ultrasound or progression of carotid stenosis had the lowest stroke events (12.0%) and longest life-years (14.41). The either plaque echolucency or progression-based revascularization group had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $110 000/quality-adjusted life years compared with the plaque echolucency-based strategy, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29 000/quality-adjusted life years compared with the joint echolucency and progression-based strategy.

There are few prospective studies assessing the clinical course and end-of-life circumstances for these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively followed 51 patients with ICDs for up to 18 months to longitudinally assess in terms of (1) advance care planning, (2) health status, (3) healthcare utilization, and (4) end-of-life circumstances through quarterly phone interviews and electronic medical record review. The mean age was 71.1<c2><b1>8.3, 74.5% were men, and 19.6% were non-white. Congestive heart failure was predominant (82.4%), as was chronic kidney disease (92%). At baseline, a total of 12% of subjects met criteria for major depression, and 78.4% met criteria for mild cognitive impairment. From this initial study cohort, 76% survived to 18 months and completed all follow-up interviews, 18% died, and 19% withdrew or were lost to follow-up. Though living will completion and healthcare proxy assignment were common (cumulative outcome at 18 months 88% and 98%, respectively), discussions of prognosis were uncommon (baseline, 9.8%; by 18 months, 22.7%), as were conversations regarding ICD deactivation (baseline, 15.7%; by 18 months, 25.5%). Five decedents with available data received shocks in the days immediately prior to death, including 3 of whom ultimately had their ICDs deactivated prior to death. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of prospective enrollment and follow-up of older, vulnerable ICD patients.

Relationships between cardiometabolic biomarkers and sitting time are unexplored in older women, as are possible ethnic differences. Methods and Results Ethnic differences in sitting behavior and associations with cardiometabolic risk were explored in overweight/obese postmenopausal women (n=518; mean<c2><b1>SD age 63<c2><b1>6 years; mean body mass index 31.4<c2><b1>4.8 kg/m(2)). Accelerometer data were processed using validated machine-learned algorithms to measure total daily sitting time and mean sitting bout duration (an indicator of sitting behavior pattern). Multivariable linear regression was used to compare sitting among Hispanic women (n=102) and non-Hispanic women (n=416) and tested associations with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. Hispanic women sat, on average, 50.3 minutes less/day than non-Hispanic women (P<0.001) and had shorter (3.6 minutes less, P=0.02) mean sitting bout duration. Among all women, longer total sitting time was deleteriously associated with fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations, insulin resistance, body mass index and waist circumference; longer mean sitting bout duration was deleteriously associated with fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance, body mass index and waist circumference. Exploratory interaction analysis showed that the association between mean sitting bout duration and fasting glucose concentration was significantly stronger among Hispanic women than non-Hispanic women (P-interaction=0.03). Conclusions Ethnic differences in 2 objectively measured parameters of sitting behavior, as well as detrimental associations between parameters and cardiometabolic biomarkers were observed in overweight/obese older women.

Our objective was to determine the impact of cardiac surgery (CS) and antibiotics ( IE - CS ) compared with medical treatment with antibiotics only ( IE - AB x) on 1-year mortality in patients developing IE after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Methods and Results Patients developing IE after transcatheter aortic valve replacement were included in this retrospective analysis. All-cause 1-year mortality was the primary end point. A total of 20 patients underwent IE - CS compared with 44 patients treated by IE - AB x. In this unmatched cohort, patients treated by IE - AB x were older ( P=0.006), had a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score ( P=0.029), and more often had severe chronic kidney disease ( P=0.037). One-year mortality was not different between groups ( IE -CS versus IE-ABx, 65% versus 68.2%; P=0.802). The rate of any complication during treatment was higher in the IE - CS group ( P=0.024). In a matched cohort, baseline characteristics were not significantly different. All-cause 1-year mortality was not different between groups ( IE -CS versus IE-ABx, 65% versus 75%; P=0.490). A Cox regression analysis revealed any indication for surgery (hazard ratio, 6.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-21.41; P=0.004), sepsis on admission (hazard ratio, 4.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-8.24; P<0.001), and mitral regurgitation <e2><89><a5>2 (hazard ratio, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-6.37) as factors associated with 1-year mortality. Conclusions In patients developing IE after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, mortality was predicted by the severity of IE and concomitant mitral regurgitation.

N. and Holdt, Lesca M.",Journal of the American Heart Association,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision making in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) relies completely on diameter. At this point, improved decision tools remain an unmet medical need. Our goal was to identify changes at the molecular level specifically leading up to AAA rupture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic wall tissue specimens were collected during open elective (eAAA; n=31) or emergency repair of ruptured AAA (rAAA; n=17), and gene expression was investigated using microarrays. Identified candidate genes were validated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in an independent sample set (eAAA: n=46; rAAA: n=18). Two gene sets were identified, 1 set containing 5 genes linked to terminal progression, that is, positively associated with progression of larger AAA, and with rupture (HILPDA, ANGPTL4, LOX, SRPX2, FCGBP), and a second set containing 5 genes exclusively upregulated in rAAA (ADAMTS9, STC1, GFPT2, GAL3ST4, CCL4L1). Genes in both sets essentially associated with processes related to impaired tissue remodeling, such as angiogenesis and adipogenesis. In gene expression experiments we were able to show that upregulated gene expression for identified candidate genes is unique for AAA. Functionally, the selected upregulated factors converge at processes coordinated by the canonical HIF-1<ce><b1> signaling pathway and are highly expressed in fibroblasts but not inflammatory cells of the aneurysmatic wall.

The trial intended to enroll 900 subjects to ensure adequate statistical power to detect an absolute 10% difference in the percentage of subjects with good outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. In April 2012, after 656 subjects were randomized, further enrollment was terminated by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke based on the prespecified criterion for futility using conditional power<20%. METHODS: Conditional power was defined as the likelihood of finding statistical significance at the end of the study, given the accumulated data to date and with the assumption that a minimum hypothesized difference of 10% truly exists between the 2 groups. The evolution of study data leading to futility determination is described, including the interaction between the unblinded study statisticians and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board in the complex deliberation of analysis results. RESULTS: The futility boundary was crossed at the trial's fourth interim analysis. At this point, based on the conditional power criteria, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended termination of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Even in spite of prespecified interim analysis boundaries, interim looks at data pose challenges in interpretation and decision making, underscoring the importance of objective stopping criteria.

We aimed to determine changes in rates, causes, and associated factors for hospital presentations among long-term survivors of stroke. METHODS: Person-level data from the AuSCR (Australian Stroke Clinical Registry) during 2009 to 2013 were linked with state-based health department emergency department and hospital admission data. The study cohort included adults with first-ever stroke who survived the first 6 months after discharge from hospital. Annualized rates of hospital presentations (nonadmitted emergency department or admission)/person/year were calculated for 1 to 12 months prior, and 7 to 12 months (inclusive) after hospitalization. Multilevel, negative binomial regression was used to identify associated factors after adjustment for prestroke hospital presentations and stratification for perceived impairment status. Perceived impairments to health were defined according to the subscales and visual analog health status scores on the 5-Dimension European Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: There were 7183 adults with acute stroke, 7-month survivors (median age 72 years; 56% male; 81% ischemic, and 42% with impairment at 90-180 days) from 39 hospitals included in this landmark analysis. Annualized presentations/person increased from 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91) to 1.25 (95% CI, 1.22-1.29) between the prestroke and poststroke periods, with greater rate increases in those with than without perceived impairment (55% versus 26%). Higher presentation rates were most strongly associated with older age (<e2><89><a5>85 versus 65 years, incidence rate ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.27-1.82]) and greater comorbidity score (incidence rate ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.10]), whereas reduced rates were associated with greater social advantage (incidence rate ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.84]).

METHODS: Prehospital, hospital, and Department of Health leadership were invited (n=157). Participants provided goals/concerns and developed recommendations for prehospital triage and interfacility transport, rating each using a 3-level impact (A [high], B, and C [low]) and implementation feasibility (1 [high], 2, and 3 [low]) scale. Six weeks later, participants finalized recommendations. RESULTS: Seventy-one stakeholders (45% of invitees) attended. Six themes around goals/concerns emerged: (1) emergency medical services capacity, (2) validated prehospital screening tools, (3) facility capability, (4) triage/transport guidelines, (5) data capture/feedback tools, and (6) facility competition. In response, high-impact (level A) prehospital recommendations, stratified by implementation feasibility, were (1) use of online medical control for triage (6%); (2) regional transportation strategy (31%), standardized emergency medical services checklists (18%), quality metrics (14%), standardized prehospital screening tools (13%), and feedback for performance improvement (7%); and (3) smartphone application algorithm for screening/decision-making (6%) and ambulance-based telemedicine (6%). Level A interfacility transfer recommendations were (1) standardized transfer process (32%)/timing goals (16%)/regionalized systems (11%), performance metrics (11%), image sharing capabilities (7%); (2) provider education (9%) and stroke toolbox (5%); and (3) interfacility telemedicine (7%) and feedback (2%).

The Recognition Of Stroke In the Emergency Room (ROSIER) tool has been shown superior to the FAST in identifying strokes in emergency departments but has not previously been tested in the ambulance setting. We investigated whether ROSIER use by ambulance clinicians can improve stroke recognition. METHODS: Ambulance clinicians used the ROSIER in place of the FAST to assess patients with suspected stroke. As the ROSIER includes all FAST elements, we calculated a FAST score from the ROSIER to enable comparisons between the two tools. Ambulance clinicians' provisional stroke diagnoses using the ROSIER and calculated FAST were compared with stroke consultants' diagnosis. We used stepwise logistic regression to compare the contribution of individual ROSIER and FAST items and patient demographics to the prediction of consultants' diagnoses. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of strokes and 78% of nonstrokes identified by ambulance clinicians using the ROSIER were subsequently confirmed by a stroke consultant. There was no difference in the proportion of strokes correctly detected by the ROSIER or FAST with both displaying excellent levels of sensitivity. The ROSIER detected marginally more nonstroke cases than the FAST, but both demonstrated poor specificity. Facial weakness, arm weakness, seizure activity, age, and sex predicted consultants' diagnosis of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The ROSIER was not better than the FAST for prehospital recognition of stroke.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective cohort new-user study using electronic medical records from 744 Canadian primary care clinicians. Potentially inappropriate DOAC prescribing was defined as prescribing lower or higher doses than those recommended by guidelines for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Of the 6658 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were prescribed a DOAC (mean age: 74.8; 55% male), 626 (9.4%) had a CHADS(2) score of 0, and 168 (2.5%) had a CHADS-VASc score of 0. Of the DOAC prescriptions, 527 (7.7%) were deemed potentially inappropriate: 496 (7.2%) were potentially underdosed, and 31 (0.5%) were prescribed a dose that was higher than recommended. Patients were more likely to be prescribed lower-than-recommended doses if they were female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.5]), had multiple comorbidities (aOR: 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8])-particularly heart failure (aOR: 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2-2.0]) or dementia (aOR: 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8])-or if they were also taking aspirin (aOR: 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.1]) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aOR: 1.2 [95% CI, 1.02-1.5]). Potentially inappropriate DOAC dosing was more common in rural practices (aOR: 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7-2.6]) or smaller practices (aOR: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6-2.4] for practices smaller than median).

Andrew and Sidney, Stephen and Pham, Trinh N. and Bernstein, Allan L. and Johnston, S. Claiborne",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: One important criterion for hospitalizing patients after transient ischemic attack (TIA) is the short-term risk of stroke. Before publication of prediction rules for stroke after TIA, physician judgment was required to make a decision about hospitalization. We sought to identify factors associated with the decision to admit patients with TIA from the emergency department (ED) and to see whether those at highest risk of stroke were selected for admission. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with TIA in the ED of 16 hospitals in the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Plan over a 1-year period before publication of prediction rules were included (n=1707). Risk of subsequent stroke was stratified according to a validated prediction rule (ABCD(2) score), and the decision to admit was correlated with these risk scores. Factors associated with admission in univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 243 patients with TIA (14%) were admitted. Admission weakly correlated with the ABCD(2) score (rank biserial R(2)=0.036; 10.0% at low 2-day risk of stroke admitted versus 20.3% at high risk). Seven variables were independently associated with a decision to admit after TIA: prior TIA, speech impairment, weakness, gait disturbance, history of atrial fibrillation, symptoms on arrival to ED, and use of ticlopidine. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with TIA, the decision to admit was weakly correlated with risk of subsequent stroke as measured by the ABCD(2) score, and several risk factors for stroke were not important for the decision to admit.

The aim of this study was to determine among ambulance-transported stroke patients factors associated with stroke recognition and factors associated with a call for ambulance assistance within 1 hour from symptom onset. METHODS: For 6 months in 2004, all ambulance-transported stroke or transient ischemic attack patients arriving from a geographically defined region in Melbourne (Australia) to 1 of 3 hospital emergency departments were assessed. Tapes of the call for ambulance assistance were analyzed and the patient and the caller were interviewed. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Stroke was reported as the problem in 44% of ambulance calls. Unprompted stroke recognition was independently associated with facial droop (P=0.015) and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (P<0.001). More than half of the calls for ambulance assistance were made within 1 hour from symptom onset and only 43% of these callers spontaneously identified the problem as ""stroke."" Factors independently associated with a call within 1 hour were: speech problems (P=0.009), caller family history of stroke (P=0.017), and the patient was not alone at symptom onset (P=0.018).

Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score.

METHODS: Patients were evaluated simultaneously by at least 2 vascular neurology. Agreement was determined using kappa (<ce><ba>) and intraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: In 60 patients, agreement was substantial for tissue-type plasminogen activator (<ce><ba>=0.75 [95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.92]) and IAT (<ce><ba>=0.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.96]), with no difference between fellow-fellow versus fellow-faculty.

Kleindorfer_2007_Stro,JOUR,Designing a message for public education regarding stroke: does FAST capture enough stroke?,"Kleindorfer, Dawn O. and Miller, Rosie and Moomaw, Charles J. and Alwell, Kathleen and Broderick, Joseph P. and Khoury, Jane and Woo, Daniel and Flaherty, Matthew L. and Zakaria, Tarek and Kissela, Brett M.",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown poor public knowledge of stroke warning signs. The current public education message adopted by the American Heart Association lists 5 stroke warning signs (""suddens""). Another message called FAST (face, arm, speech, time) could be easier to remember, but it does not contain as many stroke symptoms. We sought to assess the percentage of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients identified by both public awareness messages by examining presenting symptoms of all stroke/TIA patients from a large, biracial population in 1999. METHODS: Cases of stroke who presented to an emergency department or were directly admitted were ascertained at all local hospitals by screening of ICD-9 codes 430 to 436, and prospective screening of emergency department admission logs, in 1999. Study nurses abstracted initial presenting symptoms from the medical record. All-cause 30-day case-fatality was calculated. RESULTS: During 1999, 3498 stroke/TIA patients (17% black, 56% female) presented to an emergency department. Of these events, 11.1% had presenting symptoms not included in FAST, whereas 0.1% had presenting symptoms not included in the suddens. The FAST message performed much better for ischemic stroke and TIA than for hemorrhage, missing 8.9% of the ischemic strokes and 8.2% of the TIAs, versus 30.6% of intracerebral hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Case-fatality in patients missed by FAST was similar to patients with FAST symptoms (9.0% versus 11.6%, P=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Within our population, we found that the FAST message identified 88.9% of stroke/TIA patients. The FAST message performed better for ischemic stroke and TIA than for hemorrhagic stroke.

We estimated eligibility for completed, ongoing, and planned clinical trials in an unselected cohort of patients with ICH. METHODS: Large clinical ICH trials were identified using trial registration databases. Each trial's inclusion criteria were applied to a consecutive group of patients with ICH from the prospective hospital-based Lund Stroke Register. Survival status was obtained from the National Census Office and 90-day poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale <e2><89><a5>4) from the Swedish Stroke Register or medical files. RESULTS: Among 253 patients with ICH, estimated eligibility proportions ranged between 2% and 36% for the 11 identified clinical trials.

Pilot survey for minor and rapidly improving stroke,"Balucani, Clotilde and Bianchi, Riccardo and Feldmann, Edward and Weedon, Jeremy and Kolychev, Dmitri and Levine, Steven R.",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Minor strokes and rapidly improving stroke symptoms are frequent exclusions for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. We explored factors influencing tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment decision for minor strokes/rapidly improving stroke symptoms. METHODS: A pilot survey, including 110 case scenarios, was completed by 17 clinicians from 2 academic medical centers. Respondents were asked whether they would treat each case with tissue-type plasminogen activator at 60 minutes after emergency department admission. Cases varied by (1) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at treatment decision time, (2) symptom pattern over time (improvement or worsening and then improving), (3) type of neurological deficit (3 main domains: motor, visual/sensory/ataxia, and language/neglect), and (4) age/occupation (4 profiles). Logistic regression was used to predict probability of omission (pO). A binomial regression model was used to predict probability of treatment decision. RESULTS: Predicted probability of treatment decision was affected by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (P<0.001) and age/occupation profiles (P<0.001) but not by symptom patterns (P=0.334). There were significant, albeit modest, main effects on probability of treatment decision for neurological domains. Responses were most likely omitted (P=0.027) for cases improvement pattern and language/neglect domain (pO=0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.89) and with visual/sensory/ataxia domain (pO=0.74; confidence interval, 0.37-0.93) when compared with improvement pattern and motor domain (pO=0.17; confidence interval, 0.06-0.42) and to any worsening and then improving patterns (0.37<pO<0.56). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot survey provides the first quantitative evidence that National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score is not the only determinant of treatment decision. A National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 2 is the potential equipoise point, with the least consensus on treatment decision. These preliminary findings require validation in larger population surveys.",2015,10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008290,46,3,874-876,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"stroke and Humans and Regression Analysis and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Time Factors and Decision Making and Pilot Projects and Probability and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Severity of Illness Index and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Stroke/*drug therapy and *Stroke Rehabilitation and Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*therapeutic use and Emergency Medical Services/methods and tissue-type plasminogen activator and Neurology/methods/standards",NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA
Amarenco_2009_Stro,JOUR,Does ABCD2 score below 4 allow more time to evaluate patients with a transient ischemic attack?,"Amarenco, Pierre and Labreuche, Julien and Lavallee, Philippa C. and Meseguer, Elena and Cabrejo, Lucie and Slaoui, Tarik and Guidoux, Celine and Olivot, Jean-Marc and Abboud, Halim and Lapergue, Bertrand and Klein, Isabelle F. and Mazighi, Mikael and Touboul, Pierre-Jean",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients with a transient ischemic attack and ABCD(2) score > or =4 and those with >2 transient ischemic attacks within 1 week be admitted for urgent complete etiologic evaluation within 24 hours and that those with an ABCD(2) score <4 be evaluated less urgently within 1 week. METHODS: Using data from 1176 patients with a definite or possible transient ischemic attack or minor stroke included in the SOS-TIA registry (January 2003 to June 2007), we studied the usefulness of the conventional ABCD(2) score cutoff as well as the NICE criteria for urgent admission to a stroke unit defined as presence of symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis > or =50%, symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis > or =50%, or major cardiac source of embolism. RESULTS: Among 697 patients with an ABCD(2) score <4, 20% required immediate consideration for emergency treatment (eg, symptomatic internal carotid stenosis > or =50% in 9.1% of patients, symptomatic intracranial stenosis in 5.0%, atrial fibrillation in 5.9%, other major cardiac source of embolism in 2.1%) in comparison to 31.6% of 497 patients with an ABCD(2) score > or =4. The sensitivity and specificity of ABCD(2) score > or =4 or NICE criteria for discriminating between patients requiring admission or not were <62% with low positive predictive values (<30%) and high negative predictive values (> or =80%). CONCLUSIONS: One in 5 patients with an ABCD(2) score <4 had high-risk disease requiring urgent treatment decision-making. When triaging on an ABCD(2) score, we recommend adding systematic carotid ultrasound (or a default angiographic CT scan) and electrocardiography within 24 hours before postponing complete transient ischemic attack evaluation.",2009,10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.552042,40,9,3091-3095,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Aged, 80 and over and Registries and Diagnosis, Differential and Stroke/*diagnosis and Emergency Medical Services/*methods and Carotid Stenosis/diagnosis and Embolism/diagnosis and Intracranial Arterial Diseases/diagnosis",NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA
Alberts_2020_Stro,JOUR,Risks of Stroke and Mortality in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Treated With Rivaroxaban and Warfarin,"Alberts, Mark and Chen, Yen-Wen and Lin, Jennifer H. and Kogan, Emily and Twyman, Kathryn and Milentijevic, Dejan",Stroke,"Background and Purpose- Oral anticoagulation therapy is standard of care for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke. This study compared rivaroxaban and warfarin for stroke and all-cause mortality risk reduction in a real-world setting. Methods- This retrospective cohort study (2011-2017) included de-identified patients from the Optum Clinformatics Database who started treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin within 30 days following initial diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Before nonvalvular atrial fibrillation diagnosis, patients had 6 months of continuous health plan enrollment and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score <e2><89><a5>2. Stroke severity was determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, imputed based on machine learning algorithms. Stroke and all-cause mortality risks were compared by treatment using Cox proportional hazard regression, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance cohorts for baseline risk factors. Stratified analysis by treatment duration was also performed. Results- During a mean follow-up of 27 months, 175 (1.33/100 patient-years [PY]) rivaroxaban-treated and 536 (1.66/100 PY) warfarin-treated patients developed stroke. The inverse probability of treatment weighting model showed that rivaroxaban reduced stroke risk by 19% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]). Analysis by stroke severity revealed risk reductions by rivaroxaban of 48% for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16-42; HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33-0.82]) and 19% for minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 1 to <5; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.96]), but no difference for moderate stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 5 to <16; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.78-1.10]). A total of 41 (0.31/100 PY) rivaroxaban-treated and 147 (0.44/100 PY) warfarin-treated patients died poststroke, 12 (0.09/100 PY) and 67 (0.20/100 PY) of whom died within 30 days, representing mortality risk reductions by rivaroxaban of 24% (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.95]) poststroke and 59% (HR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]) within 30 days. Conclusions- After the initial diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin had significant risk reduction for stroke, especially severe stroke, and all-cause mortality after a stroke. Findings from this observational study may help inform anticoagulant choice for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.",2020,10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.025554,51,2,549-555,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"stroke and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and atrial fibrillation and Proportional Hazards Models and mortality and warfarin and *Rivaroxaban/adverse effects/therapeutic use and *Warfarin/adverse effects/therapeutic use and Anticoagulants/adverse effects/therapeutic use and Atrial Fibrillation/complications/*drug therapy/*mortality and Factor Xa Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use and rivaroxaban and Stroke/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA
Helms_2009_Stro,JOUR,First trimester stroke prophylaxis in pregnant women with a history of stroke,"Helms, Ann K. and Drogan, Oksana and Kittner, Steven J.",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current recommendations for stroke prevention during early pregnancy in women with a prior stroke history are based on limited evidence. In view of the uncertainty involved in balancing the fetal risk of medication against the maternal risk of recurrent stroke, a substantial variation in clinical decision making was anticipated. Thus, a survey was performed to describe the current practices of U.S. neurologists with a particular interest in stroke with regards to treatment of such patients. METHODS: A survey was sent to 384 actively practicing U.S. members of the American Academy of Neurology Stroke and Vascular Neurology section asking what antithrombotic, if any, they would use during first trimester pregnancy in women with a prior history of stroke, either unrelated or related to a previous pregnancy. RESULTS: 230 practitioners responded. Some form of antithrombotic therapy was selected by 75% of practitioners for women with a history of prior stroke not related to pregnancy and by 88% of practitioners for women with a history of prior stroke related to pregnancy. Aspirin and low molecular weight heparin were chosen by 51% and 7%, respectively, for stroke unrelated to pregnancy and by 41% and 25%, respectively, for stroke related to pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Most practitioners agree that women with a history of stroke should receive prophylaxis during the first trimester. However, much disagreement exists regarding which drug(s) to use. A national registry would be the most practical method of obtaining maternal and fetal outcome data to guide practice in this setting.",2009,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.536425,40,4,1158-1161,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"Humans and Female and Surveys and Questionnaires and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and Health Care Surveys and Medical History Taking and Anticoagulants/therapeutic use and Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use and Aspirin/therapeutic use and Fibrinolytic Agents/*therapeutic use and Pregnancy Trimester, First and Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use and Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*epidemiology/*prevention & control and Stroke/*epidemiology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Woodward, Mark and Zoungas, Sophia and Kengne, Andre Pascal and van der Graaf, Yolanda and Glasziou, Paul and Hamet, Pavel and MacMahon, Stephen and Poulter, Neil and Grobbee, Diederick E. and Chalmers, John","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Blood pressure-lowering treatment reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, but the effect varies between individuals. We sought to identify which patients benefit most from such treatment in a large clinical trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) participants (n=11 140), we estimated the individual patient 5-year absolute risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with and without treatment by perindopril-indapamide (4/1.25 mg). The difference between treated and untreated risk is the estimated individual patient's absolute risk reduction (ARR). Predictions were based on a Cox proportional hazards model inclusive of demographic and clinical characteristics together with the observed relative treatment effect. The group-level effect of selectively treating patients with an estimated ARR above a range of decision thresholds was compared with treating everyone or those with a blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg using net benefit analysis. In ADVANCE, there was wide variation in treatment effects across individual patients. According to the algorithm, 43% of patients had a large predicted 5-year ARR of <e2><89><a5>1% (number-needed-to-treat [NNT5] <e2><89><a4>100) and 40% had an intermediate predicted ARR of 0.5% to 1% (NNT5=100-`200). The proportion of patients with a small ARR of <e2><89><a4>0.5% (NNT5<e2><89><a5>200) was 17%. Provided that one is prepared to treat at most 200 patients for 5 years to prevent 1 adverse outcome, prediction-based treatment yielded the highest net benefit. In conclusion, a multivariable treatment algorithm can identify those individuals who benefit most from blood pressure-lowering therapy in terms of ARR of major adverse cardiovascular events and may be used to guide treatment decisions in individual patients with diabetes.

We developed and validated the Paramedic Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale in a large, prospective, randomized trial. Methods- In the prehospital FAST-MAG (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium) randomized trial conducted from 2005 to 2013, EMS providers were asked to complete the PGIC Scale (5-point Likert scale values: 1-much improved, 2-mildly improved, 3-unchanged, 4-mildly worsened, 5-much worsened) for neurological symptom change during transport for consecutive patients transported by ambulance within 2 hours of onset. We analyzed PGIC concurrent validity (compared with change in Glasgow Coma Scale, Los Angeles Motor Scale), convergent validity (compared with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale severity measure performed in the emergency department), and predictive validity (of neurological deterioration after hospital arrival and of final 90-day functional outcome). We used PGIC to characterize differential prehospital course among stroke subtypes. Results- Paramedics completed the PGIC in 1691 of 1700 subjects (99.5%), among whom 635 (37.5%) had neurological deficit evolution (32% improvement, 5.5% worsening) during a median prehospital care period of 33 (IQR, 27-39) minutes. Improvement was associated with diagnosis of cerebral ischemia rather than intracranial hemorrhage, milder stroke deficits on emergency department arrival, and more frequent nondisabled and independent 3-month outcomes. Conversely, worsening on the PGIC was associated with intracranial hemorrhage, more severe neurological deficits on emergency department arrival, more frequent treatment with thrombolytic therapy, and poor disability outcome at 3 months. Conclusions- The PGIC scale is a simple, validated measure of prehospital patient course that has the potential to provide information useful to emergency department decision-making.

Fang_2012_Stro,JOUR,Thirty-day mortality after ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation on and off anticoagulants,"Fang, Margaret C. and Go, Alan S. and Chang, Yuchiao and Borowsky, Leila H. and Pomernacki, Niela K. and Udaltsova, Natalia and Singer, Daniel E.",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prescribing warfarin for atrial fibrillation depends in large part on the expected reduction in ischemic stroke risk versus the expected increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, the anticoagulation decision also depends on the relative severity of such events. We assessed the impact of anticoagulation on 30-day mortality from ischemic stroke versus ICH in a large community-based cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We followed 13,559 patients with atrial fibrillation enrolled in an integrated healthcare delivery system for a median 6 years. Incident ischemic strokes and ICHs were identified from computerized databases and validated through medical record review. The association of warfarin and international normalized ratio at presentation with 30-day mortality was modeled using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for clinical factors. RESULTS: We identified 1025 incident ischemic strokes and 299 ICHs during follow-up. Compared with no antithrombotic therapy, warfarin was associated with reduced Rankin score and lower 30-day mortality from ischemic stroke (adjusted OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.91) but a higher mortality from ICH (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.88-2.98). Therapeutic international normalized ratios (2-3) were associated with an especially low ischemic stroke mortality (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.70), whereas international normalized ratios>3 increased the odds of dying of ICH by 2.66-fold (95% CI, 1.21-5.86). CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin reduces 30-day mortality from ischemic stroke but increases ICH-related mortality. Both effects on event severity as well as on event rates need to be incorporated into rational decision-making about anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.",2012,10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.630731,43,7,1795-1799,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Time Factors and Cohort Studies and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Follow-Up Studies and Survival Rate/trends and Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use and Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy/*mortality and Brain Ischemia/drug therapy/*mortality and Intracranial Hemorrhages/drug therapy/*mortality and Stroke/drug therapy/*mortality",NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mandava_2009_Stro,JOUR,A method to determine stroke trial success using multidimensional pooled control functions,"Mandava, Pitchaiah and Kent, Thomas A.",Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many early phase trials in stroke have not been subsequently confirmed. Randomization balance in baseline factors that influence outcome are difficult to achieve and may be partly responsible for misleading early results. We hypothesized that comparison with an outcome function derived from a large number of pooled control arms would mitigate these randomization problems and provide a reliable predictor for decision-making before proceeding to later phase trials. We developed such a model and added a novel feature of generation of multidimensional 95% prediction surfaces by which individual studies could be compared. We performed a proof-of-principle study with published clinical trials, determining whether our method correctly identified known outcomes. METHODS: The control arms from all randomized, controlled trials for acute stroke with >or=10 subjects, including baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, age, and 3-month outcomes published between 1994 and May 2008, were identified. A Matlab program (PPREDICTS) was written to generate outcome functions based on these parameters. Published treatment trials were compared with these 95% intervals to determine whether it successfully identified positive and negative trials. RESULTS: Models of mortality and functional outcome were successfully generated (mortality: R(2)=0.69; functional outcome, modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2: R(2)=0.81; both P<0.0001). The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator trial and 3 studies yet to be subjected to Phase III study had modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 outcomes above the 95% prediction interval. Sixteen treatment arm outcomes fell within prediction surface bounds. This group included 2 major trials, Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment and Abciximab Emergent Stroke Treatment Trial, that initially appeared promising but went on to negative Phase III results. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle analysis confirmed all positive and negative clinical stroke trial results and identified some promising therapies. The use of a pooled standard treatment group function combined with statistical bounds may improve selection of early studies for further study. This method may be applicable to any condition in which baseline factors influence outcome and at any stage of the development process.",2009,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.532820,40,5,1803-1810,eng,1524-4628 0039-2499,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Algorithms and Databases, Factual and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and Treatment Outcome and Models, Statistical and Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic and Emergency Medical Services and *Data Interpretation, Statistical and Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods and *Research Design and Stroke/mortality/*therapy",NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,Stroke,NA,NA,NA,NA
