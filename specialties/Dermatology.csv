Du.Harpur_2020_ThBrjoofde,JOUR,What is AI? Applications of artificial intelligence to dermatology,"Du-Harpur, X. and Watt, F. M. and Luscombe, N. M. and Lynch, M. D.",The British journal of dermatology,"In the past, the skills required to make an accurate dermatological diagnosis have required exposure to thousands of patients over many years. However, in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made enormous advances, particularly in the area of image classification. This has led computer scientists to apply these techniques to develop algorithms that are able to recognize skin lesions, particularly melanoma. Since 2017, there have been numerous studies assessing the accuracy of algorithms, with some reporting that the accuracy matches or surpasses that of a dermatologist. While the principles underlying these methods are relatively straightforward, it can be challenging for the practising dermatologist to make sense of a plethora of unfamiliar terms in this domain. Here we explain the concepts of AI, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, and explore the principles of how these tasks are accomplished. We critically evaluate the studies that have assessed the efficacy of these methods and discuss limitations and potential ethical issues. The burden of skin cancer is growing within the Western world, with major implications for both population skin health and the provision of dermatology services. AI has the potential to assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions and may have particular value at the interface between primary and secondary care. The emerging technology represents an exciting opportunity for dermatologists, who are the individuals best informed to explore the utility of this powerful novel diagnostic tool, and facilitate its safe and ethical implementation within healthcare systems.",2020,10.1111/bjd.18880,183,3,423-430,eng,1365-2133 0007-0963,"Humans and Algorithms and Machine Learning and *Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks, Computer and *Dermatology",NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Br J Dermatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decision making can be especially difficult in patients with extensive atypical nevi. Recognizing that the primary screening modality for melanoma is subjective examination, studies have shown a tendency toward overbiopsy. Even low-risk routine surgical procedures are associated with morbidity, mounting health care costs, and patient anxiety. Recent advancements in noninvasive diagnostic modalities have helped improve diagnostic accuracy, especially when managing melanocytic lesions of uncertain diagnosis. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have also shown exciting potential in changing the landscape of melanoma detection.

Biomonitoring can be used to obtain information on the internal dose of pollutants. The concentration of biomarkers in body fluids is highly variable over time due to differential elimination kinetics of chemicals, whereas they accumulate in hair. Hair analysis thus provides information on cumulative exposure over a longer period of time, and so can be used for assessing chronic exposure to pollutants. Studies on hair samples collected from 204 women living in two cities in China with different levels of pollution demonstrated that hair damage and the skin microbiome are biomarkers of a polluted city and long-term exposure to pollution and UV can increase signs of facial ageing.

However, the high cost of biologics limits access to these medications for the majority of patients worldwide. In recent years, the introduction of biosimilars for inflammatory diseases has become a fast evolving field. The future use of biosimilars offers the potential for decreased cost and increased access to biologics for patients with psoriasis. For approval of biosimilars, different regulatory agencies use highly variable methods for definition, production, approval, marketing and postmarketing surveillance. Due to potential interchangeability between biologics and biosimilars, traceability and pharmacovigilance are required to collect accurate data about adverse events in patients with psoriasis; spontaneous reporting, registries and use of 'big data' should facilitate this process on a global basis. The current article describes biosimilar regulatory guidelines and examples of biosimilar uptake in clinical practice in several countries around the world.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the extent of comorbidities in psoriasis patients by use of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database. METHODS: MarketScan, comprising commercial claims representative of a large US-insured population, had 1.22 million patients with <e2><89><a5>1 claim with a psoriasis diagnosis between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014.

Wang_2019_JAMAderm,JOUR,Assessment of Deep Learning Using Nonimaging Information and Sequential Medical Records to Develop a Prediction Model for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer,"Wang, Hsiao-Han and Wang, Yu-Hsiang and Liang, Chia-Wei and Li, Yu-Chuan",JAMA dermatology,"IMPORTANCE: A prediction model for new-onset nonmelanoma skin cancer could enhance prevention measures, but few patient data-driven tools exist for more accurate prediction. OBJECTIVE: To use machine learning to develop a prediction model for incident nonmelanoma skin cancer based on large-scale, multidimensional, nonimaging medical information. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a database comprising 2 million randomly sampled patients from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013. A total of 1829 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer as their first diagnosed cancer and 7665 random controls without cancer were included in the analysis. A convolutional neural network, a deep learning approach, was used to develop a risk prediction model. This risk prediction model used 3-year clinical diagnostic information, medical records, and temporal-sequential information to predict the skin cancer risk of a given patient within the next year. Stepwise feature selection was also performed to investigate important and determining factors of the model. Statistical analysis was performed from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of the models. RESULTS: A total of 1829 patients (923 women [50.5%] and 906 men [49.5%]; mean [SD] age, 65.3 [15.7] years) with nonmelanoma skin cancer and 7665 random controls without cancer (3951 women [51.5%] and 3714 men [48.4%]; mean [SD] age, 47.5 [17.3] years) were included in the analysis. The 1-year incident nonmelanoma skin cancer risk prediction model using sequential diagnostic information and drug prescription information as a time-incorporated feature matrix could attain an AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91), with a mean (SD) sensitivity of 83.1% (3.5%) and mean (SD) specificity of 82.3% (4.1%).

Tan_2019_JAMAderm,JOUR,Trends in Private Equity Acquisition of Dermatology Practices in the United States,"Tan, Sally and Seiger, Kira and Renehan, Peter and Mostaghimi, Arash",JAMA dermatology,"IMPORTANCE: Private equity (PE) firms invest in dermatology management groups (DMGs), which are physician practice management firms that operate multiple clinics and often acquire smaller, physician-owned practices. Consolidation of dermatology practices as a result of PE investment may be associated with changes in practice management in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To describe the scope of PE-backed dermatology practice acquisitions geographically over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study examined acquisitions of dermatology practices by PE-backed DMGs in the United States. Acquisition and investment data through May 31, 2018, were compiled using information from 5 financial databases. Transaction data were supplemented with publicly available information from 2 additional financial databases, 2 financial news outlets, and press releases from DMGs. All dermatology practices acquired by PE-backed DMGs were included. Acquisitions were verified to be dermatology practices that provided medical, surgical, and/or cosmetic clinical care. Private equity financing data were included when available. The addresses of clinics associated with acquired practices were mapped using spatial analytics software. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number and location of PE practice acquisitions over time were measured based on the date of deal closure, the geographic footprint of each DMG's acquisition, and the financing of each DMG. RESULTS: Seventeen PE-backed DMGs acquired 184 practices between May 1, 2012, and May 22, 2018. These acquired practices accounted for an estimated 381 dermatology clinics as of mid-2018 (assessment period from May 1 to August 31). The total number of PE-owned dermatology clinics in the United States was substantially larger because these data did not reflect DMGs that opened new clinics (organic growth); acquisitions data represented only the ownership transfer of existing practices from physician to PE-backed DMG. Practice acquisitions increased each year, from 5 in 2012 to 59 in 2017. An additional 34 acquisitions took place from January 1 to May 31, 2018. The number of financing rounds to sustain transactions mirrored the aforementioned trends in practice acquisitions. Clinics associated with acquired practices spanned at least 30 states, with 138 of 381 clinics (36%) located in Texas and Florida.

In dermatology, researchers are evaluating the potential for direct-to-patient and clinician decision-support AI tools to classify skin lesions. Although AI is poised to change how patients engage in health care, patient perspectives remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To explore how patients conceptualize AI and perceive the use of AI for skin cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study using a grounded theory approach to semistructured interview analysis was conducted in general dermatology clinics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and melanoma clinics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Forty-eight patients were enrolled. Each interview was independently coded by 2 researchers with interrater reliability measurement; reconciled codes were used to assess code frequency. The study was conducted from May 6 to July 8, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Artificial intelligence concept, perceived benefits and risks of AI, strengths and weaknesses of AI, AI implementation, response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making, and recommendation for or against AI. RESULTS: Of 48 patients enrolled, 26 participants (54%) were women; mean (SD) age was 53.3 (21.7) years. Sixteen patients (33%) had a history of melanoma, 16 patients (33%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer only, and 16 patients (33%) had no history of skin cancer. Twenty-four patients were interviewed about a direct-to-patient AI tool and 24 patients were interviewed about a clinician decision-support AI tool. Interrater reliability ratings for the 2 coding teams were <ce><ba> = 0.94 and <ce><ba> = 0.89. Patients primarily conceptualized AI in terms of cognition. Increased diagnostic speed (29 participants [60%]) and health care access (29 [60%]) were the most commonly perceived benefits of AI for skin cancer screening; increased patient anxiety was the most commonly perceived risk (19 [40%]). Patients perceived both more accurate diagnosis (33 [69%]) and less accurate diagnosis (41 [85%]) to be the greatest strength and weakness of AI, respectively. The dominant theme that emerged was the importance of symbiosis between humans and AI (45 [94%]). Seeking biopsy was the most common response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making (32 [67%]). Overall, 36 patients (75%) would recommend AI to family members and friends.

OBJECTIVE: To correlate disease-associated allele frequencies with expected and reported prevalence of clinical disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a recessive, cancer-prone, neurocutaneous disorder, was used as a model for this study. From January 1, 2017, to May 4, 2018, the Human Gene Mutation Database and a cohort of patients at the National Institutes of Health were searched and screened to identify reported mutations associated with XP. The clinical phenotype of these patients was confirmed from reports in the literature and National Institutes of Health medical records. The genetically predicted prevalence of disease based on frequency of known pathogenic mutations was compared with the prevalence of patients clinically diagnosed with phenotypic XP. Exome sequencing of more than 200<e2><80><af>000 alleles from the Genome Aggregation Database, the National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics database of healthy controls, and an Inova Hospital Study database was used to investigate the frequencies of these mutations in the general population. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Listing of all reported mutations associated with XP, their frequencies in 3 large exome sequence databases, determination of the number of patients in the United States with XP using modeling equations, and comparison of the observed and reported numbers of patients with XP with specific mutations. RESULTS: A total of 156 pathogenic missense and nonsense mutations associated with XP were identified in the National Institutes of Health cohort and the Human Gene Mutation Database. The Genome Aggregation Database provided frequency data for 65 of these mutations, with a total allele frequency of 1.13%. The XPF (ERCC4) mutation, p.P379S, had an allele frequency of 0.4%, and the XPC mutation, p.P334H, had an allele frequency of 0.3%. With the Hardy-Weinberg equation, it was determined that there should be more than 8000 patients who are homozygous for these mutations in the United States. In contrast, only 3 patients with XP were reported as having the XPF mutation, and 1 patient was reported as having the XPC mutation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings from this study suggest that clinicians should approach large genomic databases with caution when trying to correlate the clinical implications of genetic variants with the prevalence of disease risk. Unsuspected mutations in known genes with a predisposition for skin cancer may be responsible for some of the high frequency of skin cancers in the general population.",2019,10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.4473,155,1,72-78,eng,2168-6084 2168-6068,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Prevalence and Phenotype and Genotype and DNA Mutational Analysis and Gene Frequency and *Mutation and United States/epidemiology and *Big Data and DNA Repair/*genetics and Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A Protein/*genetics and Xeroderma Pigmentosum/epidemiology/*genetics,NA,NA,2019/01/01/,JAMA Dermatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

C.",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning algorithms achieve expert-level accuracy in skin lesion classification based on clinical images. However, it is not yet shown whether these algorithms could have high accuracy when embedded in a smartphone app, where image quality is lower and there is high variability in image taking scenarios by users. In the past, these applications were criticized due to lack of accuracy. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the newest version of a smartphone application (SA) for risk assessment of skin lesions. METHODS: This SA uses a machine learning algorithm to compute a risk rating. The algorithm is trained on 131 873 images taken by 31 449 users in multiple countries between January 2016 and August 2018 and rated for risk by dermatologists. To evaluate the sensitivity of the algorithm, we use 285 histopathologically validated skin cancer cases (including 138 malignant melanomas), from two previously published clinical studies (195 cases) and from the SA user database (90 cases). We calculate the specificity on a separate set from the SA user database containing 6000 clinically validated benign cases. RESULTS: The algorithm scored a 95.1% (95% CI, 91.9-97.3%) sensitivity in detecting (pre)malignant conditions (93% for malignant melanoma and 97% for keratinocyte carcinomas and precursors). This level of sensitivity was achieved with a 78.3% (95% CI, 77.2-79.3%) specificity. CONCLUSIONS: This SA provides a high sensitivity to detect skin cancer; however, there is still room for improvement in terms of specificity.

Garg_2016_JAMAderm,JOUR,Factors Associated With Point-of-Care Treatment Decisions for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,"Garg, Amit and Besen, Justin and Legler, Aaron and Lam, Christina S.",JAMA dermatology,"IMPORTANCE: Studies evaluating factors associated with disease severity in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are limited, and the existing data are controversial. It is also unclear whether severity assessed by HS scoring methods correlate with partnered decision-making on treatment strategies, and thus the clinical relevance of these severity assessments is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess factors associated with disease severity as measured by point-of-care decisions on receipt or escalation of treatment for HS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The retrospective cohort comprised 437 patients with HS ages 18 to 64 years at enrollment with at least 5 monitoring periods of 3 months' duration. The study was performed at an academic medical center. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receipt of treatment and treatment escalation. RESULTS: The average monitoring time of patients with HS was 4.2 person-years. The frequency of patients with HS with no treatment decreased over the monitoring period, while the frequency for receipt of treatment increased. Care by a dermatologist (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% CI, 5.2-8.6) provided the strongest predictor of having received treatment for HS, and it was also associated with increased odds of escalating treatment (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.4-3.7). Tobacco smoking was associated with treatment escalation (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7) over time, whereas obesity was not associated with treatment or escalation. The likelihood of receiving (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8) or escalating treatment (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4) was increased between ages 18 and 39 years.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance and potential clinical utility of a 174-multiclass AI algorithm in a real-life telemedicine setting. METHODS: Prospective, diagnostic accuracy study including consecutive patients who submitted images for teledermatology evaluation. The treating dermatologist chose a single image to upload to a web application during teleconsultation. A follow-up reader study including nine healthcare providers (3 dermatologists, 3 dermatology residents and 3 general practitioners) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 340 cases from 281 patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of patients was 33.7 (17.5) years; 63% (n = 177) were female. Exposure to the AI algorithm results was considered useful in 11.8% of visits (n = 40) and the teledermatologist correctly modified the real-time diagnosis in 0.6% (n = 2) of cases.

M. and Salek, M. S. and Basra, M. K. A. and Finlay, A. Y.",The British journal of dermatology,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision making in dermatology is a complex process and might be influenced by a wide range of nonclinical factors. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the role of nonclinical influences, beyond diagnosis and severity, on clinical decision making in dermatology. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 46 clinicians working in departments of dermatology of nine different hospitals in Wales. Interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed and their contents analysed. RESULTS: Nonclinical factors influencing patient management decisions in dermatology that were identified related to patients, clinicians and practice characteristics. Patient-related factors included place of residence, socioeconomic circumstances, education and intelligence, ethnicity, age, treatment adherence, expectations from treatment, quality of life, concerns and worries, difficult patients, and family members or friends. Clinician-related factors included time constraints in clinic, clinicians' personal circumstances, relationship with colleagues, and relationship with pharmaceutical companies. Practice-related factors included working in private practice, cost of treatment to the National Health Service (NHS), prescribing bureaucracy, and availability of treatment service in the work place. There was a difference between the consultants' views and those of the other clinicians over the impact of pharmaceutical companies on clinicians' prescribing and the awareness of treatment costs to the NHS. Most of the factors identified could potentially influence the clinicians' decision-making process subconsciously. Some clinicians highlighted that these factors are untaught in the medical curriculum, and are usually ignored in clinical guidelines, and therefore represent a challenge to the practice of evidence-based medicine.

Dermatologists based in outpatient settings can find it challenging to determine the urgency with which they need to evaluate inpatients when consultations are requested. Teledermatology may provide a valuable mechanism for dermatologists to triage inpatient consultations and increase efficiency, thereby expanding access to specialized care for hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a store-and-forward teledermatology system is reliable for the initial triage of inpatient dermatology consultations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 50 consenting adult patients, hospitalized for any indication, for whom an inpatient dermatology consultation was requested between September 1, 2012, and April 31, 2013, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, an academic medical center. The participants were evaluated separately by both an in-person dermatologist and 2 independent teledermatologists. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were the initial triage and decision to biopsy concordance between in-person and teledermatology evaluations. RESULTS: Triage decisions were as follows: if the in-person dermatologist recommended the patient be seen the same day, the teledermatologist agreed in 90% of the consultations. If the in-person dermatologist recommended a biopsy, the teledermatologist agreed in 95% of cases on average. When the teledermatologist did not choose the same course of action, there was substantial diagnostic agreement between the teledermatologist and the in-person dermatologist. The Kendall <cf><84> rank correlation coefficients for initial triage concordance between the in-person dermatologist and teledermatologists were 0.41 and 0.48.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the impact of a PI CME activity on physician practice patterns for patients with psoriasis, which was developed, implemented, and evaluated by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), in part to assist dermatologists in fulfilling Part IV of their Maintenance of Certification requirements. METHODS: In this PI CME activity, participants: (1) self-audited patient charts, which met inclusion criteria in stage A, and reflected on their results, benchmarked against peers; (2) reviewed educational materials in stage B and developed an improvement plan; and (3) self-audited a different set of patient charts following the plan's implementation. Aggregate stage A and C data were analyzed using <cf><87>(2) tests. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant improvement in the advisement of patients with psoriasis regarding their increased risk for cardiovascular disease, to contact their primary care provider for cardiovascular risk assessment, and in shared decision making regarding the treatment plan. We also found an overall statistically significant improvement in history taking per the guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the mean cost per patient of surveillance in a high-risk clinic from the health service and societal perspectives. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a bottom-up microcosting method to measure resource use in a consecutive sample of 102 patients treated in a high-risk hospital-based clinic in Australia during a 12-month period. EXPOSURE: Surveillance and treatment of melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All surveillance and treatment procedures were identified through direct observation, review of medical records, and interviews with staff and were valued using scheduled fees from the Australian government. Societal costs included transportation and loss of productivity. RESULTS: The mean number of clinic visits per year was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.5-2.8) for surveillance and 3.8 (95% CI, 3.4-4.1) for patients requiring surgical excisions. The mean annual cost per patient to the health system was A $882 (95% CI, A $783-$982) (US $599 [95% CI, US $532-$665]); the cost discounted across 20 years was A $11,546 (95% CI, A $10,263-$12,829) (US $7839 [95% CI, US $6969-$8710]). The mean annual societal cost per patient (excluding health system costs) was A $972 (95% CI, A $899-$1045) (US $660 [95% CI, US $611-$710]); the cost discounted across 20 years was A $12,721 (95% CI, A $12,554-$14,463) (US $8637 [95% CI, US $8523-$9820]). Diagnosis of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer and frequent excisions for benign lesions in a relatively small number of patients was responsible for positively skewed health system costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Microcosting techniques provide an accurate cost estimate for the provision of a specialized service. The high societal cost reflects the time that patients are willing to invest to attend the high-risk clinic.

E. and Draelos, Z. and Dreno, B. and Jansen, T. and Layton, A. and Picardo, M.",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,"BACKGROUND: The absence of specific histological or serological markers, the gaps in understanding the aetiology and pathophysiology of rosacea, and the broad diversity in its clinical manifestations has made it difficult to reach international consensus on therapy guidelines. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to highlight the global diversity in current thinking about rosacea pathophysiology, classification and medical features, under particular consideration of the relevance of the findings to optimization of therapy. METHODS: The article presents findings, proposals and conclusions reached by the ROSacea International Expert group (ROSIE), comprising European and US rosacea experts. RESULTS: New findings on pathogenesis provide a rationale for the development of novel therapies. Thus, recent findings suggest a central role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin and its activator kallikrein-5 by eliciting an exacerbated response of the innate immune system. Cathelicidin/kallikrein-5 also provide a rationale for the effect of tetracyclines and azelaic acid against rosacea. Clinically, the ROSIE group emphasized the need for a comprehensive therapy strategy - the triad of rosacea care - that integrates patient education including psychological and social aspects, skin care with dermo-cosmetics as well as drug- and physical therapies. Classification of rosacea into stages or subgroups, with or without progression, remained controversial. However, the ROSIE group proposed that therapy decision making should be in accordance with a treatment algorithm based on the signs and symptoms of rosacea rather than on a prior classification. CONCLUSION: The ROSIE group reviewed rosacea pathophysiology and medical features and the impact on patients and treatment options. The group suggested a rational, evidence-based approach to treatment for the various symptoms of the condition. In daily practice this approach might be more easily handled than prior subtype classification, in particular since patients often may show clinical features of more than one subtype at the same time.",2011,10.1111/j.1468-3083.2010.03751.x,25,2,188-200,eng,1468-3083 0926-9959,Humans and Patient Education as Topic and *Algorithms and *International Cooperation and *Rosacea/classification/physiopathology/therapy and Cosmetics and Dicarboxylic Acids/therapeutic use and Tetracycline/therapeutic use,NA,NA,2011/02//undefined,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Preference-based HRQoL values or health utilities required for medical and financial decision-making are not yet available directly from pemphigus patients. OBJECTIVE: To obtain health utility values for current health and hypothetical health states from the perspective of pemphigus patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was carried out with pemphigus patients. Disease severity was rated by Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS). Patients were asked to evaluate their current health as well as three common hypothetical pemphigus health states [uncontrolled pemphigus vulgaris (PV), uncontrolled pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and controlled PV/PF] by using composite time trade-off (cTTO). Multiple regression was applied to explore determinants of utility values. RESULTS: Responses of 108 patients (64.8% women, mean age 57.4 years) were analysed. Mean ABSIS score was 11.6. The mean utility values for the hypothetical uncontrolled PV, uncontrolled PF and controlled PV/PF health states were 0.41, 0.52 and 0.66 with cTTO. The mean cTTO scores for current health were higher compared with the hypothetical health states (0.76; P < 0.001). Patients with higher ABSIS, worse pain intensity scores and those having a caregiver reported lower utility values for current health (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In pemphigus, HRQoL impairment expressed in utility values seems to be considerable, especially in comparison with other chronic dermatological conditions (e.g. psoriasis, atopic eczema, chronic hand eczema). These health utilities inform physicians, policymakers and funders about the overall extent of health loss in pemphigus and provide evidence to guide medical decisions and cost-effectiveness analyses of treatment strategies.

M. and Emery, J. and Walter, F. M.",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,"BACKGROUND: Melanoma accounts for 90% of skin cancer mortality and typically presents in primary care, where it can be challenging to distinguish from benign lesions. Dermoscopy is a tool for skin visualization that is routinely used for melanoma diagnosis in secondary care. However, the role of dermoscopy in primary care remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine views on, and use of, dermoscopy by dermatology-interested general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: An online questionnaire was emailed to the UK Primary Care Dermatology Society members in February 2018, and responses collected over the following 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 205 responses were analysed. Most respondents were GPs (94%), aged over 50 (53%), had a postgraduate dermatological qualification (67%) and used dermoscopy regularly when reviewing pigmented skin lesions (97%). Dermoscopy use was commoner amongst GPs who had worked longer in primary care and had experience of secondary care dermatology. Most had undertaken training in dermoscopy (91%), although one-fifth (20%) had not updated their training in over 5 years. Most of those who had received only 1 day of face-to-face training reported feeling confident using a dermatoscope. Few respondents (11%) reported access to teledermatology or teledermoscopy for urgent or routine referrals. CONCLUSIONS: UK GPs with a special interest in dermatology are routinely using dermoscopy in the primary care setting. More research is needed to establish optimal approaches to training and updating GP dermoscopy skills. When dermoscopy has been shown to be safe, effective, acceptable and cost-effective in this setting, more GPs may also be able to gain and maintain the skills to implement dermoscopy into routine primary care. Technological advances, including incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms to guide GPs, could also contribute to widening use of dermoscopy among GPs.",2019,10.1111/jdv.15614,33,9,1706-1712,eng,1468-3083 0926-9959,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and United Kingdom and *Primary Health Care and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Melanoma/*diagnosis and *Dermoscopy and General Practitioners/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Nijsten, T. and Wakkee, M.",The British journal of dermatology,"BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of actinic keratosis (AK) is causing a large burden on healthcare systems. The current management of patients with AK seems to vary within and between primary and secondary care; however, an in-depth understanding of healthcare providers' management of AK is currently lacking. OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the management of AK by exploring the underlying motives of current practices among general practitioners (GPs) and dermatologists in the Netherlands. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted consisting of semistructured individual interviews with 22 GPs and 18 dermatologists focusing on the underlying motives regarding AK management. A predefined topic list was used. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed by two researchers drawing on elements of grounded theory. RESULTS: GPs reported conducting limited proactive clinical assessments of cutaneous photodamage due to a perceived lack of value, varying in their method of diagnosing AK. They mainly applied cryotherapy or referred to secondary care due to lack of experience, varying in their applications and providing mostly patient-driven follow-up care. They also reported a great need for guidelines due to a lack of knowledge of AK management. Dermatologists indicated pursuing proactive clinical assessments of cutaneous photodamage and the goal of providing guideline-driven AK care. However, patient preferences still largely influence both treatment choices and follow-up regimens. Furthermore, dermatologists reported the need to improve AK and skin cancer management in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: For AK care to become more standardized and uniform in Dutch primary care, the implementation of guidelines and (continuing) education are needed to address the commonly reported barriers of lack of value, experience and knowledge among GPs.

METHODS: Surveys were systematically developed and distributed to 3 study populations: dermatology providers, residents, and patients. RESULTS: Response rates were over 95% in all 3 populations. Dermatology providers and residents consistently underestimated the costs of commonly recommended dermatologic medications but accurately predicted the cost of common dermatologic procedures. Dermatology patients preferred to know the cost of procedures and medications, even when covered by insurance. In this population, the costs of dermatologic medications frequently interfered with patients' ability to properly adhere to prescribed regimens. LIMITATIONS: The surveyed population was limited to the northwestern United States and findings may not be generalizable.

There is little information about the types of MLCDs affected and the long-term consequences. OBJECTIVES: The aims were to identify the MLCDs influenced by chronic disease, to define 'MLCD' and to suggest support strategies for patients taking MLCDs. METHODS: Adult dermatology patients explained how their chronic disease had influenced MLCDs in individual interviews. Adult patients from other medical specialities gave similar information by postal survey. NVivo8 software was used for qualitative analysis of data. Themes were categorized through a coding-recoding iterative process. RESULTS: There were 308 evaluable responses (male 55.2%; mean age = 51.8 years, mean disease duration = 19 years) from the 365 (55.7%) responses to the 655 patient invitations. These were used to generate themes to conceptualize 'MLCDs'. The most frequently reported MLCDs in the dermatology interviews concerned career choice (66%), job (58%), choice of clothing (54%), relationships (52%), education (44%), stopping swimming (34%), moving abroad (32%), not socializing (34%), wearing make-up (22%) and having children (22%). In the postal survey early retirement (40.6%), impact on job (29.4%), having children (24.8%), career choice (22.4%) and relationships (15.5%) were most commonly reported. The number of MLCDs reported by individuals was inversely related to age. Forty-one affected MLCD themes were grouped into 18 MLCD categories.

Unlike traditional pairwise meta-analysis, which allows for a comparison between two interventions by pooling head-to-head data, network meta-analysis (NMA) allows for the simultaneous comparison of more than two interventions and for comparisons to be made between interventions that have not been directly compared in a randomized controlled trial. Given these advantages, NMAs are being published in the medical literature with increasing frequency. However, there are important assumptions that researchers and knowledge users (e.g., patients, clinicians, and policy makers) must consider when conducting and evaluating an NMA: network connectivity, homogeneity, transitivity, and consistency. There are also multiple NMA outputs that researchers and knowledge users should familiarize themselves with in order to understand NMA results (e.g., network plots, mean ranks).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare risks of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications between diabetic patients with and without psoriasis. METHODS: Adults with 2 or more diabetes diagnoses selected from MarketScan databases (Truven Health Analytics Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) (2000-2006) were classified into 2 cohorts: 2 or more psoriasis diagnoses and without psoriasis diagnosis. Patients with psoriasis were matched using propensity score, and exactly matched using age, sex, and diabetes characteristics with patients without psoriasis. Outcomes were compared between cohorts using Cox regression models. RESULTS: In all, 6164 diabetic patients with psoriasis (27% moderate to severe) were matched to 6164 diabetic patients without psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis were significantly more likely to develop microvascular events than patients without psoriasis overall (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, P < .001) and by psoriasis severity (mild: HR 1.13, P = .004; moderate to severe: HR 1.16, P = .038). Risk of macrovascular events was higher for patients without psoriasis overall (HR 1.13, P = .001) and those with mild psoriasis (HR 1.15, P = .003), but not for moderate to severe cases (HR 1.10, P = .210).

OBJECTIVE: Primary aim was to measure experts' accuracy in RCM-based management decisions. Secondary aim was to identify melanoma-specific RCM features. METHODS: The study enrolled patients <e2><89><a5>18 years that underwent biopsy of skin lesions clinically suspected to be melanoma. One hundred lesions imaged by RCM were randomly selected from 439 lesions prospectively collected at four pigmented lesion clinics. The study data set included 23 melanomas, three basal cell and two squamous cell carcinomas, 11 indeterminate melanocytic lesions and 61 benign lesions including 50 nevi. Three expert RCM evaluators were blinded to clinical or dermoscopic images, and to the final histopathological diagnosis. Evaluators independently issued a binary RCM-based management decision, 'biopsy' vs. 'observation'; these decisions were scored against histopathological diagnosis, with 'biopsy' as the correct management decision for malignant and indeterminate lesions. A subset analysis of 23 melanomas and 50 nevi with unequivocal histopathological diagnosis was performed to identify melanoma-specific RCM features. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 74%, 67% and 70% for reader 1, 46%, 84% and 69% for reader 2, and 72%, 46% and 56% for reader 3, respectively. The overall kappa for management decisions was 0.34. Readers had unanimous agreement on management for 50 of the 100 lesions.

In 2014, the Agricultural Social Insurance Mutual Benefit Fund (MSA) offered its customers who work in agriculture and live in rural areas with reduced access to dermatologists the ability to participate in a 1-day teledermoscopic (TDS) screening event. OBJECTIVE: This study's aim was to assess the feasibility of real-time mobile TDS triage of a large number of agricultural workers by trained medical officers and occupational physicians. METHODS: Fifteen TDS screening centres were located in different areas of France. Individuals older than 18 years who worked in agriculture and lived in rural area near a TDS screening centre were invited to participate in a 1-day screening event and were examined by an MSA physician. In cases of suspicious skin lesions, clinical and dermoscopic images were obtained and transferred immediately to four dermatologists who were simultaneously present at the tele-platform for diagnosis and decision-making. Low-quality images were retaken. RESULTS: Two-hundred eighty-nine patients underwent skin cancer screening. Among 199 patients (69%), 390 suspicious lesions were identified and generated 412 pictures. All lesions were analysed by dermatologists. For 105 patients (53%), no follow-up was required.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of omalizumab on CSU patients' HRQoL, measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) in three phase III studies ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL. METHODS: A post hoc analysis examined changes in DLQI scores, distribution of patients across DLQI bands and the proportion reaching minimal clinically important difference (MCID) following omalizumab vs. placebo. RESULTS: Omalizumab 300 mg significantly improved total DLQI scores vs. placebo, with a mean decrease from baseline to week 12 of -10.3 vs. -6.1 (P < 0.0001) in ASTERIA I, -10.2 vs. -6.1 (P = 0.0004) in ASTERIA II and -9.7 vs. -5.1 (P < 0.0001) in GLACIAL. A significant shift from high disease impact on life at baseline towards less impact at week 12 was seen with omalizumab 300 mg vs. placebo (P < 0.001; all studies).

Eight of the 10 questions of the DLQI offer a 'not relevant' response (NRR) option that is scored as the item had no impact on patients' life at all. OBJECTIVE: To explore the occurrence of NRRs on the DLQI in psoriasis patients and to examine the effect of several socio-demographic and clinical factors on giving NRRs. METHODS: Data were obtained from two cross-sectional surveys among psoriasis patients at two academic dermatology clinics in Hungary. Health-related quality of life was measured by employing DLQI and EQ-5D-3L, while disease severity was graded by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the predictors of providing NRRs. RESULTS: Mean age of the 428 patients was 49 years, and 65% were males. Mean PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D-3L index scores were 8.4 <c2><b1> 9.5, 6.8 <c2><b1> 7.4 and 0.74 <c2><b1> 0.28, respectively. Overall, 38.8% of the patients had at least one NRR: 19.6% (one), 11.5% (two), 5.1% (three) and 2.6% (more than three). Most NRRs occurred in sport, sexual difficulties and working/studying items of the DLQI (28.4%, 16.4% and 14.0%, respectively).

RESULTS: The comorbidities associated with psoriasis with the highest relative risk were nonmelanoma skin cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, with relative risks of 7.5, 6.12, and 3.61, respectively; the attributable risk for these 3 conditions were 0.64, 0.05, and 0.17 per 1000 person-years, respectively. To attribute 1 event of these conditions to psoriasis would require seeing 1551; 20,135; and 5823 patients, respectively.

M.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,"Little is known about the drug survival of second-line biologic therapies for psoriasis in routine clinical practice. We assessed drug survival of second-line biologic therapies and estimated the risk of recurrent discontinuation due to adverse events or ineffectiveness in patients with psoriasis who had failed a first biologic therapy and switched to a second in a large, multicenter pharmacovigilance registry (n = 1,239; adalimumab, n = 538; etanercept, n = 104; ustekinumab, n = 597). The overall drug survival rate in the first year after switching was 77% (95% confidence interval = 74-79%), falling to 58% (55-61%) in the third year. Female sex, multiple comorbidities, concomitant therapy with cyclosporine, and a high Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at switching to the second-line biologic therapy were predictors of overall discontinuation (multivariable Cox proportional hazard model). Compared to adalimumab, patients receiving etanercept were more likely to discontinue therapy (hazard ratio = 1.87, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-2.83), whereas patients receiving ustekinumab were more likely to persist (hazard ratio = 0.46; 95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.64). Discontinuation of the first biologic therapy because of adverse events was associated with an increased rate of second drug discontinuation because of adverse events (hazard ratio = 2.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.50-4.32). In conclusion, drug survival rates differed among biologic therapies and decreased over time; second-line discontinuation because of adverse events was more common among those who discontinued first-line treatment for this reason.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) could provide assistance. OBJECTIVES: To collect and prioritize items related to frail older adults with NMSC for integration into CPGs and to assess the current extent of this integration. METHODS: Items were collected and prioritized by a multidisciplinary working group (29 members) using a modified Delphi procedure and a five-point Likert scale. To assess current integration of these items in CPGs, a systematic review was subsequently performed by two independent reviewers using five medical databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, SUMsearch and Trip Database), websites of guideline developers/databases, and (inter)national dermatological societies. RESULTS: Prioritization of a final 13-item list showed that 'limited life expectancy' (4<c2><b7>5 <c2><b1> 0<c2><b7>9) and 'treatment goals other than cure' (4<c2><b7>4 <c2><b1> 0<c2><b7>7) were most desired to be integrated into CPGs; both were included in six (46%) of the CPGs found (n = 13). Attention to 'tumour characteristics' and 'comorbidities' were included in CPGs most often (100% and 77%, respectively).

There is a paucity of studies examining longitudinal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess mortality, days spent in the hospital, and amputations in patients with calciphylaxis. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted in 145 patients diagnosed with calciphylaxis at an urban tertiary care hospital from January 2006 to December 2018. RESULTS: Six-month mortality was 37.2%, and 1-year mortality was 44.1%. Patients with nephrogenic calciphylaxis had worse survival than those with nonnephrogenic calciphylaxis (P = .007). This difference in survival disappeared when limiting mortality to deaths due to calciphylaxis. Age (P = .003) and end-stage renal disease (P = .01) were risk factors associated with 1-year mortality. Diabetes mellitus was associated with greater total hospitalization days (coefficient, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.4); bedside debridement was associated with fewer hospitalization days (coefficient, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a trained DCNN-based algorithm in classifying benign and malignant lip diseases. METHODS: A training set of 1629 images (743 malignant, 886 benign) was used with Inception-Resnet-V2. Performance was evaluated using another set of 344 images and 281 images from other hospitals. Classifications by 44 participants (six board-certified dermatologists, 12 dermatology residents, nine medical doctors not specialized in dermatology and 17 medical students) were used for comparison. RESULTS: The outcomes based on the area under curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0<c2><b7>827 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0<c2><b7>782-0<c2><b7>873], 0<c2><b7>755 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>673-0<c2><b7>827) and 0<c2><b7>803 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>752-0<c2><b7>855), respectively, for the set of 344 images; and 0<c2><b7>774 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>699-0<c2><b7>849), 0<c2><b7>702 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>579-0<c2><b7>808) and 0<c2><b7>759 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>701-0<c2><b7>813), respectively, for the set of 281 images. The DCNN was equivalent to the dermatologists and superior to the nondermatologists in classifying malignancy. After referencing the DCNN result, the mean <c2><b1> SD Youden index increased significantly for nondermatologists, from 0<c2><b7>201 <c2><b1> 0<c2><b7>156 to 0<c2><b7>322 <c2><b1> 0<c2><b7>141 (P < 0<c2><b7>001). CONCLUSIONS: DCNNs can classify lip diseases at a level similar to dermatologists. This will help unskilled physicians discriminate between benign and malignant lip diseases. What's already known about this topic? Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can classify malignant and benign skin diseases at a level equivalent to dermatologists. The lips are a unique feature in terms of histology and morphology. Previous studies of DCNNs have not investigated tumours on specific locations. What does this study add? This study shows that DCNNs can distinguish rare malignant and benign lip disorders at the same rate as dermatologists. DCNNs can help nondermatologists to distinguish malignant lip diseases. What are the clinical implications of this work? DCNNs can distinguish malignant and benign skin diseases even at specific locations such as the lips, as well as board-certified dermatologists. Malignant lip diseases are rare and difficult for less trained doctors to differentiate them from benign lesions. This study shows that in dermatology, DCNN can help improve decision-making processes for rare skin diseases in specific areas of the body.",2020,10.1111/bjd.18459,182,6,1388-1394,eng,1365-2133 0007-0963,"Humans and Neural Networks, Computer and *Lip Diseases and *Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis and Dermatologists and Skin",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Br J Dermatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We searched for all biopsy specimens that were performed because of clinical suspicion of melanoma in 2013. Characteristics of the patient, lesion, and clinician performing the biopsy, and the final pathology diagnosis were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 2643 biopsy specimens from 2213 patients submitted by 43 providers were included. Melanoma was diagnosed in 165 cases (positive predictive value 6.4%, 95% confidence interval 5.5%-7.4%). Older age (P < .001), male gender (P = .045), and nontrunk location (P < .001) were predictors of higher probability of melanoma detection.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the impact of comorbidities on patients' preferences for psoriasis treatments. METHODS: A computer-based conjoint analysis experiment was conducted to analyze preferences of patients with psoriasis (N = 163) for treatment outcome attributes (probability, magnitude and duration of benefit; probability, severity and reversibility of side effects) and process attributes (treatment location, frequency, duration, delivery method, individual cost). The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of variance, post hoc test, and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the participants included (58.9% males, mean age 49.3 yrs), 27% suffered from psoriatic arthritis, 13.5% from cardiovascular disease, 8% from diabetes, and 12.9% from depression. Preferences for treatment attributes varied significantly depending on comorbidities. Participants with psoriatic arthritis cared most about the probability of benefit (<ce><b2> 0.166; P = .037), whereas those participants with cardiovascular disease were highly concerned about the probability of side effects (<ce><b2> 0.179; P = .046).

In contrast, diffuse angiokeratomas should alert the physician to a possible diagnosis of Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by <ce><b1>-galactosidase deficiency. Glycosphingolipids accumulate in cells throughout the body resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Difficulties are encountered when trying to interpret the significance of angiokeratomas because they may also occur in other lysosomal storage disorders and rarely in an isolated manner in Fabry disease. We present an algorithm for the classification of angiokeratomas which might prove useful for the diagnosis and management of Fabry disease. Assessment of the clinical features and location of the lesions, personal and family history, skin biopsy, dermoscopy and electron microscopy imaging are sequential steps in the diagnostic process. Assessing the deficiency of <ce><b1>-galactosidase enzyme activity is essential to confirm the diagnosis in males, while mutation analysis is always needed in females. Potentially this algorithm can change the current approach to patients when Fabry disease is suspected, thus improving the diagnostic strategy and management of this disorder. It remains to be decided whether the use of an algorithm might reduce the number of genetic consultations.
