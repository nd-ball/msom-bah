Sudore_2017_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Defining Advance Care Planning for Adults: A Consensus Definition From a Multidisciplinary Delphi Panel,"Sudore, Rebecca L. and Lum, Hillary D. and You, John J. and Hanson, Laura C. and Meier, Diane E. and Pantilat, Steven Z. and Matlock, Daniel D. and Rietjens, Judith A. C. and Korfage, Ida J. and Ritchie, Christine S. and Kutner, Jean S. and Teno, Joan M. and Thomas, Judy and McMahan, Ryan D. and Heyland, Daren K.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Despite increasing interest in advance care planning (ACP) and previous ACP descriptions, a consensus definition does not yet exist to guide clinical, research, and policy initiatives. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a consensus definition of ACP for adults. METHODS: We convened a Delphi panel of multidisciplinary, international ACP experts consisting of 52 clinicians, researchers, and policy leaders from four countries and a patient/surrogate advisory committee. We conducted 10 rounds using a modified Delphi method and qualitatively analyzed panelists' input. Panelists identified several themes lacking consensus and iteratively discussed and developed a final consensus definition. RESULTS: Panelists identified several tensions concerning ACP concepts such as whether the definition should focus on conversations vs. written advance directives; patients' values vs. treatment preferences; current shared decision making vs. future medical decisions; and who should be included in the process. The panel achieved a final consensus one-sentence definition and accompanying goals statement: ""Advance care planning is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care. The goal of advance care planning is to help ensure that people receive medical care that is consistent with their values, goals and preferences during serious and chronic illness."" The panel also described strategies to best support adults in ACP.

Hanson_2019_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Triggered Palliative Care for Late-Stage Dementia: A Pilot Randomized Trial,"Hanson, Laura C. and Kistler, Christine E. and Lavin, Kyle and Gabriel, Stacey L. and Ernecoff, Natalie C. and Lin, Feng-Chang and Sachs, Greg A. and Mitchell, Susan L.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Persons with late-stage dementia have limited access to palliative care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test dementia-specific specialty palliative care triggered by hospitalization. METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 62 dyads of persons with late-stage dementia and family decision-makers on admission to hospital. Intervention dyads received dementia-specific specialty palliative care consultation plus postacute transitional care. Control dyads received usual care and educational information. The primary outcome was 60-day hospital or emergency department visits. Secondary patient- and family-centered outcomes were patient comfort, family distress, palliative care domains addressed in the treatment plan, and access to hospice or community-based palliative care. Secondary decision-making outcomes were discussion of prognosis, goals of care, completion of Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), and treatment decisions. RESULTS: Of 137 eligible dyads, 62 (45%) were enrolled. The intervention proved feasible, with protocol completion ranging from 77% (family two-week call) to 93% (initial consultation). Hospital and emergency department visits did not differ (intervention vs. control, 0.68 vs. 0.53 transfers per 60 days, P = 0.415). Intervention patients had more palliative care domains addressed and were more likely to receive hospice (25% vs. 3%, P < 0.019). Intervention families were more likely to discuss prognosis (90% vs. 3%, P < 0.001) and goals of care (90% vs. 25%, P < 0.001) and to have a MOST at 60-day follow-up (79% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). More intervention families made decisions to avoid rehospitalization (13% vs. 0%, P = 0.033).

Understanding which characteristics predict clinically important outcomes can help prioritize attention to scalable measure development. OBJECTIVES: To understand whether audibly recognizable expressions of distressing emotion during palliative care serious illness conversations are associated with ratings of patient experience or six-month enrollment in hospice. METHODS: We audiorecorded initial palliative care consultations involving 231 hospitalized people with advanced cancer at two large academic medical centers. We coded conversations for expressions of fear, anger, and sadness. We examined the distribution of these expressions and their association with pre/post ratings of feeling heard and understood and six-month hospice enrollment after the consultation. RESULTS: Nearly six in 10 conversations included at least one audible expression of distressing emotion (59%; 137 of 231). Among conversations with such an expression, fear was the most prevalent (72%; 98 of 137) followed by sadness (50%; 69 of 137) and anger (45%; 62 of 137). Anger expression was associated with more disease-focused end-of-life treatment preferences, pre/post consultation improvement in feeling heard and understood and lower six-month hospice enrollment. Fear was strongly associated with preconsultation patient ratings of shorter survival expectations. Sadness did not exhibit strong association with patient descriptors or outcomes. CONCLUSION: Fear, anger, and sadness are commonly expressed in hospital-based palliative care consultations with people who have advanced cancer. Anger is an epidemiologically useful predictor of important clinical outcomes.",2021,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.017,61,2,246-253.e1,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Emotions and Communication and Humans and decision making and emotion and Fear and Anger and *Palliative Care and palliative care and *Sadness and fear and sadness and serious illness conversations,NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Taghavi_2021_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Workforce Planning for Community-Based Palliative Care Specialist Teams Using Operations Research,"Taghavi, Majid and Johnston, Grace and Urquhart, Robin and Henderson, David and Tschupruk, Cheryl and Tupala, Beth",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Many countries have aging populations. Thus, the need for palliative care will increase. However, the methods to estimate optimal staffing for specialist palliative care teams are rudimentary as yet. OBJECTIVES: To develop a population-need workforce planning model for community-based palliative care specialist teams and to apply the model to forecast the staff needed to care for all patients with terminal illness, organ failure, and frailty during the next 20 years, with and without the expansion of primary palliative care. METHODS: We used operations research (linear programming) to model the problem. We used the framework of the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians and the Nova Scotia palliative care strategy to apply the model. RESULTS: To meet the palliative care needs for persons dying across Nova Scotia in 2019, the model generated an estimate of 70.8 nurses, 23.6 physicians, and 11.9 social workers, a total of 106.3 staff. Thereby, the model indicated that a 64% increase in specialist palliative care staff was needed immediately, and a further 13.1% increase would be needed during the next 20 years. Trained primary palliative care providers currently meet 3.7% of need, and with their expansion are expected to meet 20.3% by 2038. CONCLUSION: Historical, current, and projected data can be used with operations research to forecast staffing levels for specialist palliative care teams under various scenarios.

Waldrop_2020_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Managing Death in the Field: Prehospital End-of-Life Care,"Waldrop, Deborah P. and Waldrop, Michael R. and McGinley, Jacqueline M. and Crowley, Charlotte R. and Clemency, Brian",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Historically, the focus of prehospital care has been life-saving treatment. In the absence of a nonhospital do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, prehospital providers have been compelled to begin and continue resuscitation unless or until it was certain that the situation was futile; they have faced conflict when caregivers objected. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to explore prehospital providers' perspectives on how legally binding documents (nonhospital DNR order/medical orders for life-sustaining treatment) informed end-of-life decision making and care. METHODS: This exploratory study used mixed methods in a sequential nondominant two-stage convergent quantitative and qualitative design. Phase I involved the collection of survey data. Phase II involved in-person semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 239 participants, and 50 follow-up interviews were conducted. Survey data suggested that 73.7% felt confident when there was a DNR order and they did not initiate resuscitation, and 58.2% felt confident working through family disagreement when cardiopulmonary resuscitation was requested but there was a DNR; 66.1% felt confident explaining the dying process when death was imminent, and 55.7% felt comfortable telling a family that a patient was dying. Four themes emerged: changing standards of care; eliminating false hope; transitioning care from patient to family; and transferring care after death. CONCLUSION: Prehospital providers provide support and care when they tell families that someone has died. Being able to comfort and be present with acute grief on scene is an important and evolving role for prehospital providers who manage death in the field.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.004,60,4,709-716.e2,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Decision Making and decision making and *Emergency Medical Services and *Terminal Care and Resuscitation Orders and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Prehospital end-of-life care and termination of resuscitation,NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bruinsma_2012_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,The experiences of relatives with the practice of palliative sedation: a systematic review,"Bruinsma, Sophie M. and Rietjens, Judith A. C. and Seymour, Jane E. and Anquinet, Livia and van der Heide, Agnes",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Guidelines about palliative sedation typically include recommendations to protect the well-being of relatives. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the experiences of relatives with the practice of palliative sedation. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for empirical studies on relatives' experiences with palliative sedation. We investigated relatives' involvement in the decision-making and sedation processes, whether they received adequate information and support, and relatives' emotions. RESULTS: Of the 564 studies identified, 39 were included. The studies (30 quantitative, six qualitative, and three mixed methods) were conducted in 16 countries; three studies were based on relatives' reports, 26 on physicians' and nurses' proxy reports, seven on medical records, and three combined different sources. The 39 studies yielded a combined total of 8791 respondents or studied cases. Caregivers involved relatives in the decision making in 69%-100% of all cases (19 quantitative studies), and in 60%-100% of all cases, relatives were reported to have received adequate information (five quantitative studies). Only two quantitative studies reported on relatives' involvement in the provision of sedation. Despite the fact that the majority of relatives were reported to be comfortable with the use of palliative sedation (seven quantitative studies, four qualitative studies), several studies found that relatives were distressed by the use of sedation (five quantitative studies, five qualitative studies). No studies reported specifically about the support provided to the relatives. CONCLUSION: Relatives' experiences with palliative sedation are mainly studied from the perspective of proxies, mostly professional caregivers.

Bickel_2020_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,An Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness,"Bickel, Kathleen E. and Levy, Cari and MacPhee, Edward R. and Brenner, Keri and Temel, Jennifer S. and Arch, Joanna J. and Greer, Joseph A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that palliative care improves the quality of life of individuals with serious medical illness. Research also suggests that in patients with advanced cancer, palliative care's focus on symptom management, coping with illness, goals of care, and treatment decisions may be associated with improved patient quality of life in part by increasing patients' use of active (vs. passive) and approach-oriented (vs. avoidant) coping strategies. However, without a framework outlining the process that individuals with serious medical illness and their loved ones undergo, it is challenging to discern exactly where, how, and why palliative care may affect the serious medical illness experience. To address this gap, we propose a clinically applicable framework, derived from existing theory and research in the social and behavioral sciences. This framework, called the Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness, describes how patients and their loved ones cognitively and emotionally process the various events that may occur as they navigate serious medical illness and the end of life. The framework also describes how individuals and their loved ones use that event processing to determine next steps, while considering the impact of their surrounding external environment, their individual social roles, and their connections on this decision making.

Cleeland_2010_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Assessing the Symptoms of Cancer Using Patient-Reported Outcomes (ASCPRO): searching for standards,"Cleeland, Charles S. and Sloan, Jeff A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2006 draft guidance on ""Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims"" has engendered wide discussion about patient-reported outcome (PRO) domains that should be endpoints in clinical trials. Reducing the severity and impact of symptoms is a natural intervention endpoint for cancer, a condition associated with considerable symptom burden. Because symptoms are best described by patients who have them, including PROs as measures of treatment effectiveness or the differences among treatments provides essential information about the efficacy and toxicity of a treatment and its effects on function. The FDA guidance provides a framework for addressing such issues as clinical significance, study design, and statistical methods as they relate to applications for labeling claims; however, no set of recommended approaches for assessing specific symptoms by patient report in clinical trials exists, other than for pain. Accordingly, an interdisciplinary workgroup, Assessing the Symptoms of Cancer using Patient-Reported Outcomes (ASCPRO), has been formed to generate evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of patient-reported cancer-related symptoms and the use of that information to facilitate clinical research and decision making. ASCPRO is among the first working groups to focus primarily on nonpain symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, depression, cognitive impairment, and shortness of breath. ASCPRO members are stakeholders in optimal symptom assessment, including patient advocates, academics, clinicians, those who pay for symptom control and monitor quality of care, and those who produce products that palliate cancer-related symptoms but that may also engender treatment-related symptoms.",2010,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.05.025,39,6,1077-1085,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,United States and Humans and Treatment Outcome and Terminology as Topic and Quality of Life and Cost of Illness and Guidelines as Topic and United States Food and Drug Administration and Endpoint Determination and *Patients and Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards and Neoplasms/*diagnosis/psychology,NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jimenez_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Overview of Systematic Reviews of Advance Care Planning: Summary of Evidence and Global Lessons,"Jimenez, Geronimo and Tan, Woan Shin and Virk, Amrit K. and Low, Chan Kee and Car, Josip and Ho, Andy Hau Yan",Journal of pain and symptom management,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) involves important decision making about future medical needs. The high-volume and disparate nature of ACP research makes it difficult to grasp the evidence and derive clear policy lessons for policymakers and clinicians. AIM: The aim of this study was to synthesize ACP research evidence and identify relevant contextual elements, program features, implementation principles, and impacted outcomes to inform policy and practice. DESIGN: An overview of systematic reviews using the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions was performed. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Reviews) tool. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, Global Health, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for ACP-related research from inception of each database to April 2017. Searches were supplemented with gray literature and manual searches. Eighty systematic reviews, covering over 1660 original articles, were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Legislations, institutional policies, and cultural factors influence ACP development. Positive perceptions toward ACP do not necessarily translate into more end-of-life conversations. Many factors related to patients' and providers' attitudes, and perceptions toward life and mortality influence ACP implementation, decision making, and completion. Limited, low-quality evidence points to several ACP benefits, such as improved end-of-life communication, documentation of care preferences, dying in preferred place, and health care savings. Recurring features that make ACP programs effective include repeated and interactive discussion sessions, decision aids, and interventions targeting multiple stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence highlights several elements that influence the ACP process and provides a variety of features that could support successful, effective, and sustainable ACP implementation. However, this evidence is compartmentalized and limited. Further studies evaluating ACP as a unified program and assessing the impact of ACP for different populations, settings, and contexts are needed to develop programs that are able to unleash ACP's full potential.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.05.016,56,3,436-459.e25,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Internationality and *Advance Care Planning and Systematic Reviews as Topic and palliative care and Advance care planning and end-of-life care and overview and Palliative Care/methods and systematic reviews and Terminal Care/methods,NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Brown_2019_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Pediatric Perioperative DNR Orders: A Case Series in a Children's Hospital,"Brown, Sydney E. S. and Antiel, Ryan M. and Blinman, Thane A. and Shaw, Susanna and Neuman, Mark D. and Feudtner, Chris",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are common among children receiving palliative care, who may nevertheless benefit from surgery and other procedures. Although anesthesia, surgery, and pediatric guidelines recommend systematic reconsideration of DNR orders in the perioperative period, data regarding how clinicians evaluate and manage DNR orders in the perioperative period are limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate perioperative management of DNR orders at a tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records for all children with DNR orders in place within 30 days of surgery at a tertiary care pediatric hospital from February 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017. Using standardized case report forms, we abstracted the following from physician notes: 1) patient/family wishes with respect to the DNR, 2) whether preoperative DNR orders were continued, modified, or suspended during the perioperative period, and 3) whether life-threatening events occurred in the perioperative period. Based on data from these reports, we created a process flow diagram regarding DNR order decision-making in the perioperative period. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients aged six days to 17 years had a DNR order in place within 30 days of 29 procedures. No documented systematic reconsideration took place for 41% of procedures. DNR orders were modified for two (7%) procedures and suspended for 15 (51%). Three children (13%) suffered life-threatening events. We identified four time points in the perioperative period where systematic reconsideration should be documented in the medical record, and identified recommended personnel involved and important discussion points at each time point.

However, little research has explored the patient perspective of decision making and advanced care planning during an emergency surgery episode. OBJECTIVES: We sought to better understand older patients' lived experience making decisions to undergo emergency general surgery (EGS) and perceptions of perioperative advance care planning (ACP). METHODS: Adults aged 65 and older who underwent one of seven common EGS procedures with lengths of stay more than five days at three Boston-area hospitals were included. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted three months postdischarge. Transcripts were reviewed and coded independently by surgeons and palliative care physicians to identify themes. RESULTS: About 31 patients were interviewed. Patients viewed the decision for surgery as a choice of life over death and valued prolonging life. They felt there was no choice but to proceed with surgery but reported that participation in decision making was limited because of severe symptoms, time constraints, and confused thinking. Despite recently surviving a life-threatening illness, patients had not reconsidered their wishes for the future and preferred to avoid future ACP. CONCLUSION: Older patients who survived a life-threatening illness and EGS report receiving goal-concordant care in the moment that relieved symptoms and prolonged life but had not considered future care.

Median age at the time of hospitalization was three months, and the median duration of hospitalization was 23 days; 8% of patients had two to five hospitalizations in which they received vasopressors. There were 176 total patients who died while receiving vasopressors; most (93%) died during their first hospitalization. The most common diagnosis was sepsis (34%), followed by congenital heart disease (17%). Dopamine was the most commonly prescribed first-line vasopressor (70%), and hydrocortisone was the most commonly prescribed second-line vasopressor (49%) for all pediatric patients. The incidence of mortality rose sequentially with escalating vasopressor support, increasing from under 10% with the first vasopressor to 48% at the maximum number of agents. The odds of death almost doubled with the addition of each new vasopressor. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of vasopressor therapy for pediatric patients, regardless of diagnosis, is associated with in-hospital mortality; vasopressor escalation should trigger intensive palliative care supports.",2021,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.09.016,61,4,763-769,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Child and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Hospital Mortality and decision making and pediatrics and Counseling and *Intensive Care Units and *Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use and hospital mortality and hydrocortisone and Vasopressors,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dzotsenidze_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Impact of Ambiguous and Restrictive Regulations on Opioid-Prescribing Practice in Georgia,"Dzotsenidze, Pati and Lekashvili, Tamar and Chikhladze, Nino and Jorbenadze, Maka and Abesadze, Ioseb and Kordzaia, Dimitri",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Chronic pain management with opioids in incurable patients remains a challenge of modern medicine regardless of the evidence-based effectiveness of opioids and recommendations of authorities such as the World Health Organization and International Narcotics Control Board. Many countries, including Georgia, maintain overly restrictive regulations that contribute to inadequate pain management. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to pain management in Georgia caused by legislation, administrative issues, and physicians' lack of knowledge and understanding of legislative aspects governing opioid use, and their impact on opioid-prescribing practice. METHODS: We conducted a survey among 550 primary health care physicians. In total, 302 physicians completed the questionnaire. Overall, 289 questionnaires were analyzed statistically with SPSS version 20 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). RESULTS: We found that 38% of the physicians avoid prescribing opioids and only one-third of the physicians make an independent decision to treat the patients with opioids. About one-third of the physicians know the updated liberalized legislation and even fewer follow it. Those who apply more liberal legislation and have better medical practice are investigated three to five times more by legal authorities for prescribing morphine to incurable patients than those who do not. CONCLUSION: Ambiguous legislation negatively influences opioid-prescribing practice. Most of the physicians believe that the legislation is restrictive. Physicians who have better medical and legal knowledge and understanding are controlled and investigated more because of their opioid-prescribing practice. Physicians who are concerned that they might be investigated are less inclined to prescribe opioids or use liberalized regulations.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.03.018,56,1,63-71,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care and Aged and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Legislation and Aged, 80 and over and Physicians, Primary Care and Georgia and Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use and Clinical Decision-Making and physicians and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*legislation & jurisprudence and Drug and Narcotic Control/*legislation & jurisprudence and Georgia (Republic) and investigation and opioid prescribing and Pain/drug therapy and restriction",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data are lacking on the long-term prognosis after surviving mechanical ventilation to inform shared decision making in serious illness conversations. OBJECTIVES: Describe the long-term prognosis of older adults who survive emergency mechanical ventilation to inform shared decision making. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from a single-center intensive care unit in an academic, urban, and tertiary care medical center. We included adults aged 75 years and older consecutively admitted with mechanical ventilation between 2008 and 2012 in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring of Intensive Care III database. We excluded patients who were electively admitted. Our primary outcome was the long-term prognosis after leaving the hospital stratified by discharge location. Our secondary outcome was the frequency of documented serious illness conversations within 48 hours of hospitalization recommended by the National Quality Forum. RESULTS: We identified 415 patients (454 hospital admissions) consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit. The median age was 82.6 years, 54.0% were female, 78.2% were white, non-Hispanic, and in-hospital mortality rate was 36.6%. Among the survivors, the median survival after hospital discharge was 163.5 days (interquartile range 37.5-476.8). Only 49.1% of patients had documented serious illness conversations within 48 hours of hospitalization. About 63.4% of patients (59 of 93) who were discharged to long-term acute care hospitals died by six months.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between dimensions of religion and spirituality and medical treatment decisions made by surrogates. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled patient/surrogate dyads from three hospitals in one metropolitan area. Eligible patients were 65 years or older and admitted to the medicine or medical intensive care services. Baseline surveys between hospital days 2 and 10 assessed seven dimensions of religion and spirituality. Chart reviews of the electronic medical record and regional health information exchange six months after enrollment identified the use of life-sustaining treatments and hospice for patients who died. RESULTS: There were 291 patient/surrogate dyads. When adjusting for other religious dimensions, demographic, and illness factors, only surrogates' belief in miracles was significantly associated with a lower surrogate preference for do-not-resuscitate status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.39; 95% CI 0.19, 0.78). Among patients who died, higher surrogate intrinsic religiosity was associated with lower patient receipt of life-sustaining treatments within the last 30 days (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45, 0.97). Belief in miracles (aOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10, 0.96) and higher intrinsic religiosity (aOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.53, 0.93) were associated with lower hospice utilization. CONCLUSION: Few religious variables are associated with end-of-life preferences or treatment. Belief in miracles and intrinsic religiosity may affect treatment and should be identified and explored with surrogates by trained chaplains or other clinicians with appropriate training.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.09.006,59,2,261-269,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Death and decision making and religion and Religion and *Decision Making and *Hospice Care and end of life and proxy and Spirituality and surrogate,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) has been used to improve clinical skills among resident physicians and may provide a novel way to improve hospitalists' CSD skills. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to develop and evaluate a CSD SBML intervention for hospitalists. METHODS: Twenty hospitalists were randomized to control vs. a CSD SBML intervention. Hospitalists conducted a baseline standardized patient encounter (pretest) that was scored using a 19-item CSD checklist and controls completed a repeat standardized patient encounter six months later (post-test). Intervention group hospitalists received at least one two-hour training session featuring deliberate practice and feedback and were expected to meet a minimum passing score (MPS) on the post-test of 84% set by an expert panel. RESULTS: Only two of the 20 hospitalists met the MPS at pretest. Seventy percentage of intervention hospitalists achieved the MPS after a single training session. Post-test median checklist scores were higher for intervention hospitalists compared with controls (16.5 vs. 12.0, P = 0.0001). Intervention hospitalists were significantly more likely to ask about previous experiences with end-of-life decision making (70% vs. 20%, P = 0.03), explore values/goals (100% vs. 50%, P = 0.01), ask permission to make a recommendation regarding code status (60% vs. 0%, P = 0.003), and align recommendations with patient values/goals (90% vs. 40%, P = 0.02) than controls.

Ideally, this occurs when patients are clinically stable, and with opportunities for iteration as the clinical situation unfolds. OBJECTIVES: Testing feasibility and acceptability in busy outpatient oncology clinics of a novel program of systematic, oncology nurse-led values discussions with all new cancer patients. METHODS: Within an institutional initiative integrating primary and specialist palliative care from diagnosis for all cancer patients, oncology nurses were trained to use specific questions and an empathic communication framework to discuss health-related values during outpatient clinic visits. Nurses summarized discussions on a template for patient verification, oncologist review, and electronic medical record documentation. Summaries were reviewed with the patient at least quarterly. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated in three clinics for patients with hematologic or gastrointestinal malignancies. RESULTS: Oncology nurses conducted 177 total discussions with 67 newly diagnosed cancer patients (17 with hematologic and 50 with gastrointestinal malignancies) over two years. No patient declined participation. Discussions averaged eight minutes, and all patients verified values summaries. Clinic patient volume was maintained. Of 31 patients surveyed, 30 (97%) reported feeling comfortable with the process, considered it helpful, and would recommend it to others. Clinicians strongly endorsed the values discussion process. CONCLUSION: Nurse-led discussions of patient values soon after diagnosis are feasible and acceptable in busy oncology clinics.

OBJECTIVES: To describe and identify factors associated with level of care preferences among proxies of nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: NH residents with advanced dementia and their proxies (N = 402 dyads) were recruited from 62 Boston-area facilities as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial. At baseline, all proxies were asked to select which level of care they felt the resident should receive: intensive, basic, or comfort care. Multivariable logistic regression identified resident and proxy factors associated with a preference for comfort care (vs. basic or intensive medical care). RESULTS: Proxy level of care preferences were: comfort, 62.2%; basic, 31.1%; and intensive medical care, 6.5%. In multivariable analyses, proxy perception that the resident had less than six months to live was most strongly associated with a preference for comfort-focused care (adjusted odds ratio 12.25, 95% CI 4.04-37.08). Additional factors significantly associated with a preference for comfort care included older resident age, worse resident cognitive impairment, and the proxy having been asked about goals of care preferences by a NH health care provider (adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.07, 2.74). CONCLUSION: Most proxies select comfort as the preferred level of care for NH residents with advanced dementia.

There have been very few comparative trials in this area, and consequently there is very little clinical evidence upon which therapy can be rationally based. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the discussion and decision-making process that was undertaken by the Clinical Protocol Subcommittee during the development of a proposed clinical trial of best medical care versus surgical or endoscopic treatment for MBO. The development of the proposed clinical trials followed an orderly process. The first step taken was a discussion of a specific definition for MBO. Once agreed upon, this definition helped identify inclusion and exclusion criteria for the proposed trial. This was followed by an extensive literature review, which helped define both surgical and endoscopic approaches to MBO as well as what constituted best medical care. An extensive discussion was then undertaken concerning the best outcome measure of success for medical, surgical, and endoscopic interventions. All of the above steps culminated in two proposed protocols, one for MBO of the small intestine distal to the ligament of Treitz and a second for colonic obstructions. The small intestinal trial is designed to compare surgical intervention versus best medical care, whereas the colonic trial seeks to compare surgery with endoscopically-placed intraluminal stents coupled with best medical care.",2007,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.04.011,34,1 Suppl,59-S49,eng,0885-3924,Humans and Algorithms and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods and Palliative Care/*methods and Intestinal Neoplasms/complications/*therapy and Intestinal Obstruction/etiology/*therapy,NA,NA,2007/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a paucity of literature on these issues in Pakistani dialysis patients, who differ from Western patients in culture, religion, and available health care services. OBJECTIVES: To study informed dialysis decision-making and EoL attitudes and beliefs in Pakistani patients receiving dialysis. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to collect 522 surveys (90% response rate) from patients in seven different dialysis units in Pakistan. We used an existing dialysis survey tool, translated into Urdu, and backtranslated to English. A facilitator distributed the survey, explained questions, and orally administered it to patients unable to read. RESULTS: Less than one-fourth of the respondents (23%) felt informed about their medical condition, and 45% were hopeful that their condition would improve in the future. More than half (54%) wished to know their prognosis, and 80% reported having no prognostic discussion. Almost 63% deemed EoL planning important, but only 5% recalled discussing EoL decisions with a doctor during the last 12 months. Nearly 62% of the patients regretted their decision to start dialysis. Patients' self-reported knowledge of hospice (5%) and palliative care (7.9%) services was very limited, yet 46% preferred a treatment plan focused on comfort and symptom management rather than life extension. CONCLUSION: Pakistani patients reported a need for better informed dialysis decision making and EoL care and better access to palliative care services. These findings underscore the need for palliative care training of Pakistani physicians and in other developing countries to help address communication and EoL needs of their dialysis patients.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.009,60,2,336-345,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Decision Making and Canada and shared decision making and *Terminal Care and *Renal Dialysis and end-of-life care and dialysis decision making and ESKD and Pakistan and Palliative care in Pakistan,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

We created the Web-based application, PalliCOVID (https://pallicovid.app/), in April 2020 to provide all clinicians with convenient access to palliative care resources and support. PalliCOVID features evidence-based clinical guidelines, educational content, and institutional protocols related to palliative care for COVID-19 patients. It is a publicly available resource accessible from any mobile device or desktop computer that provides clinicians with access to palliative care guidance across a variety of care settings, including the emergency department, hospital ward, intensive care unit, and primary care practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate usage patterns of PalliCOVID to understand user behavior in relation to this palliative care content platform during the period of the local peak of COVID-19 infection in Massachusetts. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed deidentified usage data collected by Google Analytics from the first day of PalliCOVID's launch on April 7, 2020, until May 1, 2020, the time period that encompassed the local peak of the COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. User access data were collected and summarized by using Google Analytics software that had been integrated into the PalliCOVID Web application. RESULTS: A total of 2042 users accessed PalliCOVID and viewed 4637 pages from April 7 to May 1, 2020. Users spent an average of 2 minutes and 6 seconds per session. Eighty-one percent of users were first-time visitors, while the remaining 19% were return visitors. Most users accessed PalliCOVID from the United States (87%), with a large proportion of users coming from Boston and the surrounding cities (32% of overall users). CONCLUSIONS: PalliCOVID is one example of a scalable digital health solution that can bring palliative care resources to frontline clinicians. Analysis of PalliCOVID usage patterns has the potential to inform the improvement of the platform to better meet the needs of its user base and guide future dissemination strategies. The quantitative data presented here, although informative about user behavior, should be supplemented with future qualitative research to further define the impact of this tool and extend our ability to deliver clinical care that is compassionate, rational, and well-aligned with patients' values and goals.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.07.016,60,4,e20-e27,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and Humans and mobile health and Pandemics and *Internet and coronavirus and *Telemedicine and *Information Dissemination and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology and *Betacoronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic and *Palliative Care and digital health and palliative care and Google Analytics and progressive web application",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Riva_2011_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,The influence of anchoring on pain judgment,"Riva, Paolo and Rusconi, Patrice and Montali, Lorenzo and Cherubini, Paolo",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Research on decision making suggests that a wide range of spontaneous processes may influence medical judgment. OBJECTIVES: We considered an easily accessible strategy, anchoring and insufficient adjustment, which might contribute to health care professionals' miscalibration of patients' pain. METHODS: A sample (n=423) of physicians, nurses, medical students, and nursing students participated in a computerized task that showed 16 vignettes featuring fictitious patients reporting headache. In the experimental condition, participants were asked to evaluate the severity of the patient's pain before and after knowing the patient's rating. In the control condition, participants were shown all information about the patient at the same time and were required to make judgments in a single stage. RESULTS: When participants could express an initial impression before knowing the patient's rating, they fully anchored to their initial impressions in almost half of the responses. Moreover, even among those who revised their initial impression, the extent of the revision was often insufficient. Greater anchoring was associated with patients' ratings that were higher than the participants' initial impression. Finally, we provided evidence that anchoring increased pain miscalibration. We discuss our findings in terms of their contribution to the understanding of the cognitive processes involved in pain assessment. CONCLUSION: When estimating patients' pain intensity, observers are driven by anchoring, a rule of thumb that might have pernicious consequences in terms of unwarranted overreliance on initial impressions and insufficient revision in light of relevant disconfirming evidence.

Smith_2016_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Hearing Loss in Hospice and Palliative Care: A National Survey of Providers,"Smith, Alexander K. and Ritchie, Christine S. and Wallhagen, Margaret L.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Age-related hearing loss can impair patient-provider communication about symptom management, goals of care, and end-of-life decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether hospice and palliative care providers screen for or received training about hearing loss, believe it impacts patient care, and use strategies to optimize communication. METHODS: This was a national survey of hospice and palliative care providers conducted via email and social media. Survey questions were pilot tested with multidisciplinary providers in San Francisco. RESULTS: Of 510 responses (55% age 50+ years, 65% female, 64% in practice 5+ years, 57% practiced hospital-based palliative care, 45% hospice), 315 were physicians, 50 nurses, 48 nurse practitioners, 58 social workers, and 39 chaplains. Ninety-one percent reported that hearing loss has some or great impact on the quality of care for older adults. Eighty-eight percent recalled a situation where hearing loss created a communication problem with a patient and 56% a communication problem with a caregiver. Eighty-seven percent of physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners reported not screening for hearing loss. Although 61% felt comfortable with their communication skills for patients with hearing loss, only 21% reported having received formal training in its management, 31% were unfamiliar with resources for patients with hearing loss, and 38% had never heard of a pocket talker amplification device.

Religious and cultural beliefs predominantly influence patients' lives, especially during the dying process. Therefore, palliative care clinicians should have at least a basic understanding of major world religions. Islam is a major world religion with 1.7 billion followers. At our institution, a needs assessment showed a lack of knowledge with Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES: To improve knowledge of clinically relevant Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. METHODS: After consultation with a Muslim chaplain, we identified key topics and created a 10-question pretest. The pretest was administered, followed by a one-hour educational intervention with a Muslim chaplain. Next, a post-test (identical to the pretest) was administered. RESULTS: Eleven palliative care clinicians participated in this study. The average score on the pretest was 6.0 <c2><b1> 1.2 (mean + SD) (maximum 10). After the educational intervention, the average score improved to 9.6 <c2><b1> 0.7 (95% CI 2.7-4.4; P < 0.001). Qualitative feedback was positive as participants reported a better understanding of how Islam influences patients' end-of-life decisions. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, a one-hour educational intervention improved knowledge of Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. We present a framework for this intervention, which can be easily replicated. We also provide key teaching points on Islam and end-of-life care. Additional research is necessary to determine the clinical effects of this intervention over time and in practice.

Nelson_2015_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Parents' Experiences of Pediatric Palliative Transports: A Qualitative Case Series,"Nelson, Harriett and Mott, Sandra and Kleinman, Monica E. and Goldstein, Richard D.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Pediatric palliative transports, the practice of transporting critically ill children home for end-of-life care including extubation, are an option for children requiring high levels of medical support at end of life. Little is known about the experience from the perspective of the children and families. OBJECTIVES: To understand parents' perspectives on the experience of pediatric palliative transports. METHODS: Open-ended interviews were conducted using a qualitative descriptive design. Each parent was asked to reflect on the process of bringing their child home to die. Conventional content analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Nine parents participated. The decision to transport the child home was a process motivated by promises to the child or a conviction that it was the right thing to do. The parents were gratified by the attention to safety and detail involved, but the actual transport home was stressful to them. The arrival home was typically recounted as a celebration. Being home provided time with the child in the context of their family and contributed to their lives. Memories of the experience brought comfort and a sense of fulfillment.

Identifying, clarifying, and prioritizing patients' goals are conceptually fundamental to the process of patient-centeredness and are the main reasons for PC referral. However, very little is empirically known about the content or process of goal expression in the natural setting of PC. OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency, types, and determinants of goal expression in PC consultations. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional direct observational study of 72 audiorecorded PC consultations with hospitalized patients (and families) referred for PC goals of care clarification or end-of-life decision making. We coded digital audio files using reliable methods and linked conversation codes to clinical record and brief clinician interview data. RESULTS: Goal expressions occurred frequently in PC consultations and addressed both length-of-life and quality-of-life domains.

Although symptoms are critically important to quality of life and often herald clinical status changes, computational methods to assess the trajectory of symptoms over time are woefully underdeveloped. OBJECTIVES: To create machine learning algorithms capable of extracting patient-reported symptoms from free-text electronic health record notes. METHODS: The data set included 103,564 sentences obtained from the electronic clinical notes of 2695 breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy at two academic cancer centers between May 1996 and May 2015. We manually annotated 10,000 sentences and trained a conditional random field model to predict words indicating an active symptom (positive label), absence of a symptom (negative label), or no symptom at all (neutral label). Sentences labeled by human coder were divided into training, validation, and test data sets. Final model performance was determined on 20% test data unused in model development or tuning. RESULTS: The final model achieved precision of 0.82, 0.86, and 0.99 and recall of 0.56, 0.69, and 1.00 for positive, negative, and neutral symptom labels, respectively. The most common positive symptoms were pain, fatigue, and nausea. Machine-based labeling of 103,564 sentences took two minutes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a nationally representative survey of clergy beliefs and practices. METHODS: A mailed survey to a nationally representative sample of clergy completed in March 2015 with 1005 of 1665 responding (60% response rate). The primary predictor variable was clergy religious values about end-of-life medical decisions, which measured belief in miracles, the sanctity of life, trust in divine control, and redemptive suffering. Outcome variables included clergy-congregant end-of-life medical conversations and congregant receipt of hospice and intensive care unit (ICU) care in the final week of life. RESULTS: Most U.S. clergy are Christian (98%) and affirm religious values despite a congregant's terminal diagnosis. Endorsement included God performing a miracle (86%), pursuing treatment because of the sanctity of life (54%), postponement of medical decisions because God is in control (28%), and enduring painful treatment because of redemptive suffering (27%). Life-prolonging religious values in end-of-life medical decisions were associated with fewer clergy-congregant conversations about considering hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.58; 95% CI 0.42-0.80), P < 0.0001), stopping treatment (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.84, P = 0.003), and forgoing future treatment (AOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.71, P < 0.001) but not associated with congregant receipt of hospice or ICU care. Clergy with lower medical knowledge were less likely to have certain end-of-life conversations. The absence of a clergy-congregant hospice discussion was associated with less hospice (AOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29-0.66, P < 0.001) and more ICU care (AOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14-2.50, P < 0.01) in the final week of life.

Less is known about the role of worry in decision making regarding future care. OBJECTIVES: To explore relationships between patients' worry about dying and their illness understanding, treatment preferences, and advance care planning (ACP). METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a primary palliative care intervention trial. All participants had metastatic solid tumors. Using patients' response to I worry about dying from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Palliative Care survey instrument, univariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations with illness understanding, treatment preferences, and ACP. RESULTS: Of 672 patients, 47% reported worrying about dying not at all, whereas 9.7% worried quite a bit or very much. In regression analysis, compared with patients who reported not worrying about dying, those who reported high levels of worry were more likely to describe themselves as terminally ill (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.10-3.54; P = 0.021) and prefer life-extending therapy over symptom-focused care (AOR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.30-5.22; P = 0.007). They were less likely to have completed an advance directive (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.25-0.94; P = 0.032). The same relationships were seen using patients' response to I feel scared about my future from the Herth Hope Index. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced cancer who worry about dying are more likely to identify as terminally ill and desire life-extending treatment and are less likely to engage in ACP.

These patients are often observed to repeatedly contract aspiration pneumonia, resulting in prolonged hospital stays. To help prevent aspiration pneumonia, enteral nutrition is often provided. Although this method helps avoid pneumonia, patients need to give up eating by mouth. Because oral intake of food is closely related to patient quality of life, abandoning eating results in a strong internal conflict. This report describes the case of a cancer patient who experienced repeated aspiration pneumonias after neck surgery. The patient required enteral nutrition to avoid repeated bouts of pneumonia.

The ADs alone may be insufficient to prepare diverse patients and surrogates for complex medical decisions. OBJECTIVES: To understand what steps best prepare patients and surrogates for decision making. METHODS: We conducted 13 English/Spanish focus groups with participants from a Veterans Affairs and county hospital and the community. Seven groups included patients (n=38), aged <e2><89><a5>65 years, who reported making serious medical decisions. Six separate groups included surrogates (n=31), aged <e2><89><a5>18 years, who made decisions for others. Semistructured focus groups asked what activities best prepared the participants for decision making. Two investigators independently coded data and performed thematic content analysis. Disputes were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: The mean<c2><b1>SD patient age was 78<c2><b1>8 years, and 61% were nonwhite. The mean<c2><b1>SD surrogate age was 57<c2><b1>10 years, and 91% were nonwhite. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching themes about how to best prepare for decision making: 1) identify values based on past experiences and quality of life, 2) choose surrogates wisely and verify that they understand their role, 3) decide whether to grant leeway in surrogate decision making, and 4) inform other family and friends of one's wishes to prevent conflict. CONCLUSION: Beyond ADs, patients and surrogates recommend several additional steps to prepare for medical decision making including using past experiences to identify values, verifying that the surrogate understands their role, deciding whether to grant surrogates leeway, and informing other family and friends of one's wishes.

OBJECTIVES: This article reports on a process of adapting research evidence for use in a clinical decision support system that provided individualized symptom management recommendations to clinicians at the point of care. METHODS: Using a modified ADAPTE process, panels of local experts adapted national guidelines and integrated research evidence to create computable algorithms with explicit recommendations for management of the most common symptoms (pain, fatigue, dyspnea, depression, and anxiety) associated with lung cancer. RESULTS: Small multidisciplinary groups and a consensus panel, using a nominal group technique, modified and subsequently approved computable algorithms for fatigue, dyspnea, moderate pain, severe pain, depression, and anxiety. The approved algorithms represented the consensus of multidisciplinary clinicians on pharmacological and behavioral interventions tailored to the patient's age, comorbidities, laboratory values, current medications, and patient-reported symptom severity. Algorithms also were reconciled with one another to enable simultaneous management of several symptoms. CONCLUSION: A modified ADAPTE process and nominal group technique enabled the development and approval of locally adapted computable algorithms for individualized symptom management in patients with lung cancer.

Investigators identified and reconciled their interpretations by returning to the transcripts to assure that conclusions reflected participants' sentiments. RESULTS: Five themes pertaining to religious beliefs and practices emerged. Two themes were related to decision making: their faith-based beliefs and the meaning that emerges from these beliefs; two described how their coping is impacted: the participants' religious practices and their perceived support from the church community; and one described the participants' spiritual distress.

The optimal processes constituting effective management of symptom clusters remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the attitudes and strategies of clinicians in managing multiple co-occurring symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.

Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and adapted grounded theory. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty in decision making (inadequacy of scientific evidence, relying on experiential knowledge, and pressure to optimize care); attunement to patient and family (sensitivity to multiple cues, prioritizing individual preferences, addressing psychosocial and physical interactions, and opening Pandora's box); deciphering cause to guide intervention (disaggregating symptoms and interactions, flexibility in assessment, and curtailing investigative intrusiveness); balancing complexities in medical management (trading off side effects, minimizing mismatched goals, and urgency in resolving severe symptoms); fostering hope and empowerment (allaying fear of the unknown, encouraging meaning making, championing patient empowerment, and truth telling); and depending on multidisciplinary expertise (maximizing knowledge exchange, sharing management responsibility, contending with hierarchical tensions, and isolation and discontinuity of care).

Symptom burden may help to predict response, but this information is buried in free-text clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) may identify symptoms recorded in the electronic health record and thereby enable this information to inform clinical decisions about the appropriateness of CRT. OBJECTIVES: To develop, train, and test a deep NLP model that identifies documented symptoms in patients with CHF receiving CRT. METHODS: We identified a random sample of clinical notes from a cohort of patients with CHF who later received CRT. Investigators labeled documented symptoms as present, absent, and context dependent (pathologic depending on the clinical situation). The algorithm was trained on 80% and fine-tuned parameters on 10% of the notes. We tested the model on the remaining 10%. We compared the model's performance to investigators' annotations using accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score (a combined measure of precision and recall). RESULTS: Investigators annotated 154 notes (352,157 words) and identified 1340 present, 1300 absent, and 221 context-dependent symptoms. In the test set of 15 notes (35,467 words), the model's accuracy was 99.4% and recall was 66.8%. Precision was 77.6%, and overall F1 score was 71.8. F1 scores for present (70.8) and absent (74.7) symptoms were higher than that for context-dependent symptoms (48.3).

METHODS: One hundred thirty-four (n=134) chronic pain patients were asked to monitor their pain, mood, activity interference, medication use, and pain location on either a paper or electronic diary immediately before each monthly clinic visit for 10 months. Patients and their treating physicians in the electronic diary group (n=67) were able to observe changes in their ratings whereas patients using the paper diaries (n=67) had no feedback about their data entry. RESULTS: Most participants believed that completing pain diaries was beneficial; yet, only 23% of patients in the experimental condition felt that the data from the electronic diaries improved their care and less than 15% believed that their doctor made a change in their treatment based on the summary diary information. CONCLUSION: In general, treating physicians were positive about the use of electronic diaries, although they admitted that they did not regularly incorporate the summary data in their treatment decision making because either they forgot or they were too busy.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the association between patients' use of life-sustaining procedures at the end of life and depressive symptoms in their surviving spouses. METHODS: We used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal survey of U.S. residents, linked to Medicare claims data. We included married Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who died between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1258) and their surviving spouses. The use of life-sustaining procedures (i.e., intubation/mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube insertion, enteral/parenteral nutrition, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in the last month of life was measured via claims data. Using propensity score matching, we compared change in depressive symptoms of surviving spouses. RESULTS: Eighteen percent of decedents underwent one or more life-sustaining procedures in the last month of life. Those whose spouses underwent life-sustaining procedures had a 0.32-point increase in depressive symptoms after death (scale range = 0-8) and a greater likelihood of clinically significant depression (odds ratio = 1.51) compared with a matched sample of spouses of those who did not have procedures (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Surviving spouses of those who undergo intensive life-sustaining procedures at the end of life experience a greater magnitude of increase in depressive symptoms than those whose spouses do not undergo such procedures.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine how patient age, patient disposition, and physician religiousness affect physician recommendations in the context of advanced illness. METHODS: A survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of U.S. physicians, which included three vignettes depicting advanced illness scenarios: 1) cancer, 2) heart failure, and 3) dementia with acute infection. One vignette included experimental variables to test how patient age and patient disposition affected physician recommendations. After each vignette, physicians indicated their likelihood to recommend disease-directed medical care vs. hospice care. RESULTS: Among eligible physicians (n = 1878), 62% (n = 1156) responded. Patient age and stated patient disposition toward treatment did not significantly affect physician recommendations. Compared with religious physicians, physicians who reported that religious importance was ""not applicable"" were less likely to recommend chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66) and more likely to recommend hospice (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15-3.16) for a patient with cancer. Compared with physicians who ever attended religious services, physicians who never attended were less likely to recommend left ventricular assist device placement for a patient with congestive heart failure (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92). In addition, Asian ethnicity was independently associated with recommending chemotherapy (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.61) and being less likely to recommend hospice (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.91) for the patient with cancer; and it was associated with recommending antibiotics for the patient with dementia and pneumonia (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08-2.50).

Porter Jr and Teno, Joan M. and Widera, Eric",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Overuse or misuse of tests and treatments exposes patients to potential harm. The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely(R) campaign is a multiyear effort to encourage physician leadership in reducing harmful or inappropriate resource utilization. Via the campaign, medical societies are asked to identify five tests or procedures commonly used in their field, the routine use of which in specific clinical scenarios should be questioned by both physicians and patients based on the evidence that the test or procedure is ineffective or even harmful. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) was invited, and it agreed to participate in the campaign. The AAHPM Choosing Wisely Task Force, with input from the AAHPM membership, developed the following five recommendations: 1) Don't recommend percutaneous feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia; instead, offer oral-assisted feeding; 2) Don't delay palliative care for a patient with serious illness who has physical, psychological, social, or spiritual distress because they are pursuing disease-directed treatment; 3) Don't leave an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator activated when it is inconsistent with the patient/family goals of care; 4) Don't recommend more than a single fraction of palliative radiation for an uncomplicated painful bone metastasis; and 5) Don't use topical lorazepam (Ativan(R)), diphenhydramine (Benadryl(R)), and haloperidol (Haldol(R)) (ABH) gel for nausea.

OBJECTIVES: To explore emotion using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and a self-report questionnaire to better understand the relationship between these two measures of emotion in a pediatric care context. METHODS: Sixty-nine parents of 47 children who were participants in the Decision Making in Pediatric Palliative Care Study at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia took part in this study. Parents completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and a semistructured interview about their children and experience with medical decision making. The transcribed interviews were analyzed with the LIWC program, which yields scores for positive and negative emotional expression. The association between LIWC and PANAS scores was evaluated using multivariate linear regression to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: Parents who used more positive words when speaking about the illnesses of their children and the experience of medical decision making were more likely to report lower levels of positive affect on the PANAS: increase in the standard deviation of positive emotional expression was associated with an unadjusted 7.4% decrease in the self-reported positive affect (P = 0.015) and an adjusted 7.0% decrease in the self-reported positive affect (P = 0.057) after modeling for potential confounders. Increase in the standard deviation of negative emotional expression was associated with an adjusted 9.4% increase in the self-reported negative affect (P = 0.036).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a short-term prognostic prediction method that included such objective factors as medical history, vital signs, and blood tests for use with patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Medical records gathered at the admission of patients with advanced cancer to the hospice palliative care unit at a tertiary hospital in Taiwan were reviewed retrospectively. The records included demographics, history of cancer treatments, performance status, vital signs, and biological parameters, Multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used for model development. RESULTS: The Objective Palliative Prognostic Score was determined by using six objective predictors identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictors include heart rate >120/min, white blood cells >11,000/mm(3), platelets <130,000/mm(3), serum creatinine level >1.3 mg/dL, serum potassium level >5 mg/dL, and no history of chemotherapy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve used to predict seven-day survival was 82.0% (95% confidence interval 75.2%-88.8%). If any three predictors of the six were reached, death within seven days was predicted with 68.8% sensitivity, 86.0% specificity, 55.9% positive predictive value, and 91.4% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The Objective Palliative Prognostic Score consists of six objective predictors for the estimation of seven-day survival among patients with advanced cancer and showed a relatively high accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe experiences and challenges faced by pediatric oncologists and intensivists and how the oncologist-intensivist relationship impacts communication and initiation of goals of care discussions (GCDs). METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 10 physicians, including pediatric oncology and intensive care attendings and fellows. RESULTS: We identified key themes (three barriers and four facilitators) to having GCDs with families of oncology patients who have received intensive care. Barriers included challenges to communication within teams because of hierarchy and between teams due to incomplete sharing of information and confusion about who should initiate GCDs; provider experiences of internal conflict about how to engage parents in decision-making and about the ""right thing to do"" for patients; and lack of education and training in communication. Facilitators included team preparation for family meetings; skills for partnering with families; the presence of palliative care specialists; and informal education in communication and willingness for further training in communication. Notably, the education theme was identified as both a barrier and resource. CONCLUSION: We identified barriers to communication with families both within and between teams and for individual physicians.

We describe a case in which the medical team and a patient and family are considering a second palliative biliary stent despite the patient's limited life expectancy. We review available evidence to inform the decision, focusing on the specific question of whether the benefits of palliative biliary stents in patients with advanced cancer outweigh the risks. We then apply the evidence to the issue of how the primary and/or palliative care team and the interventionist communicate with patients and their families about the risks and benefits of palliative procedures. Review of the evidence found several prospective case series without control groups that measured patient-centered outcomes. Studies had high attrition rates, results for improvements in symptoms and quality of life were mixed, and rates of complications and short-term mortality were high. In conclusion, the limited evidence does not support that the benefits of palliative biliary stents in this population outweigh the risks.

There are no guidelines for selecting patients whose survival and quality of life may be enhanced by such treatments or for communication with patients and caregivers about possible treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe caregivers' perspectives on decision making for the use of intensive treatments for patients with advanced CF lung disease. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 caregivers of 36 patients who died of CF about treatment preference discussions and solicited recommendations for improving discussions. RESULTS: Twenty (56%) patients received intensive treatments during the last week of life. Twenty-two (61%) caregivers reported ever having discussed intensive treatment preferences with a physician, and 17 (77%) of these discussions were initiated during an acute illness. Only 14 (39%) of all patients participated. Caregivers expressed less certainty about consistency of treatments with patient preferences when patients did not participate. Twenty-nine (81%) caregivers endorsed first discussing treatment preferences during a period of medical stability.

Advance care planning (ACP) can help to make this vulnerable period better for patients, caregivers, and providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether older age predicted the presence of certain forms of retrievable ACP documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) in a large sample of hospice-referred patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical-record data on 3595 patients referred to hospice between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. EHR documentation of an ACP note in the problem list, presence of a scanned advance directive, and the presence of a verified do-not-resuscitate order were the outcome measures. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of age, education, race, gender, cancer diagnosis, dementia diagnosis, palliative encounter, and death on the outcome variables. RESULTS: Our results suggest that when we control for prognosis, patients over age 70 years may experience gaps in ACP communication. We found that as patients age, the odds of having documentation of a conversation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; P < 0.001) or scanned advance directive decreased (OR = 0.63; P < 0.001), while the odds of having a verified do-not-resuscitate order increased (OR = 1.42; P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of advance directives and proxy opinions on doctors' decisions. METHODS: We mailed to all the generalists and internists in French-speaking Switzerland (N = 1962) three vignettes describing difficult decisions involving incapacitated patients. In each case, the advance directive requested that further care be withheld. One vignette tested the impact of a written advance directive vs. a proxy. Another compared the impact of a handwritten directive vs. a formalized document. The third vignette compared the impact of a family member vs. a doctor as a proxy. Each vignette was prepared in three or four versions, including a control version in which no directive or proxy was present. Vignettes were randomly allocated to respondents. We used logistic regression to predict the decision to forgo a medical intervention. RESULTS: Compared with the control condition, the odds of forgoing a medical intervention were increased by the written advance directive (odds ratio [OR] 7.3; P < 0.001), the proxy (OR 7.9; P < 0.001), and the combination of the two (OR 35.7; P < 0.001). The handwritten directive had the same impact (OR 13.3) as the formalized directive (OR 13.8). The effect of proxy opinion was slightly stronger when provided by a doctor (OR 11.3) rather than by family (OR 7.8).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand Australian general practitioner (GP) clinical decision making relating to a patient's ""need for ACP"" and the likelihood of initiating ACP. METHODS: An experimental vignette study pseudorandomly manipulated factors thought to influence decision making regarding ACP. Patient-level factors included gender, age, type of disease, medical severity, openness to ACP, doctor-patient relationship, and family support. An accompanying demographic survey assessed health professional-level factors, including gender, years of experience, place of training, place of practice, caseload of patients with ACP, direct personal experience in ACP, and self-reported attitudes toward ACP. Seventy GPs were recruited, and each completed six unique vignettes, providing ratings of patient need for ACP, importance of initiating ACP in the coming months, and likelihood of initiating ACP at the next consultation. RESULTS: Older patients, with malignant or cardiovascular disease, severe clinical presentations, good doctor-patient relationship, female gender, and poor family support were more likely to receive prompt ACP. Positive GP attitudes toward ACP were associated with greater likelihood of initiating ACP promptly. CONCLUSION: Patients with presentations suggesting higher mortality risk were identified as being in need of ACP; however, the likelihood of initiating ACP was sensitive to GP attitudes and psychosocial aspects of the doctor-patient interaction.

Randall and Engelberg, Ruth A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer often face complex, preference-sensitive decisions. How clinicians and patients engage in shared decision-making during goals-of-care discussions is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore decision-making by patients and clinicians during inpatient goals-of-care discussions. METHODS: This is a qualitative study of audio-recorded goals-of-care discussions between hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and their clinicians. Grounded theory was used to analyze transcripts. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in goals-of-care discussions with 51 unique clinicians. Nearly half of patients (n = 30) were female and their mean age was 60.1 years (SD = 12.7). A palliative care attending or fellow was present in 58 of the 62 discussions. Decisions centered on three topics: 1) disease-modifying treatments; 2) hospice; and 3) code status. Clinicians' approach to decision-making included the following stages: ""information exchange,"" ""deliberation,"" ""making a patient-centered recommendation,"" and ""wrap-up: decisional status."" Successful completion of each stage varied by the type of decision. When discussing code status, clinicians missed opportunities to engage patients in information exchange and to wrap up decisional status. By contrast, clinicians discussing disease-modifying treatments and hospice failed to integrate patient preferences. Clinicians also missed opportunities to make patient-centered recommendations when discussing treatment decisions. CONCLUSION: Clinicians missed opportunities to facilitate shared decision-making regarding goals of care, and these missed opportunities differed by type of decision being discussed. Opportunities for clinician communication training include engagement in collaborative deliberation with patients and making patient-centered recommendations in situations of high medical uncertainty.",2019,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.05.002,58,2,216-223,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Decision-making and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Qualitative Research and cancer and *Decision Making and *Hospitalization and *Patient Care Planning and palliative care and *Neoplasms,NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Fu, Chin-Hua",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: A better time-to-death (TTD) prediction can facilitate decision-making processes related to plans for providing effective end-of-life care for patients in hospice wards. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of cardiovascular autonomic functions with TTD in patients with terminal hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted with 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma recruited from the hospice ward of a regional hospital in Chiayi county, Taiwan. Serum creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum albumin were measured on the admission day. Cardiovascular autonomic functions were evaluated by frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) on admission. RESULTS: TTD was significantly associated with total spectrum power (TP) (r=0.55, P=0.001) and high frequency (HF power) (r=0.44, P=0.010) of HRV measurement. The accuracy of within-one-week TTD prediction was 67% for TP and HF power. The accuracy of within-two-week TTD prediction was 82% for TP and 73% for HF. In addition, TTD of the patients was also significantly associated with serum creatinine (r=-0.42, P=0.015), serum albumin (r=-0.46, P=0.007), and BUN (r=-0.44, P=0.010).

OBJECTIVES: In a mixed-method prospective cohort of parental dyads of children with serious illness, to describe the major problems and hopes perceived for their child, examine the degree of concordance between parents, and assess whether prevalence and concordance change over time. METHODS: Eighty-four parents (42 dyads) of seriously ill children reported the major problems and hopes for their children at baseline. Thirty-two parents (16 dyads) answered the same questions at 24 months. Problems and hopes were classified into nine domains. Observed concordance was calculated between parents on each domain. Data for parents of 11 children who died are reported separately. RESULTS: The most common major problem and hope domains at baseline were physical body, quality of life, future health and well-being, and medical care. Parental dyads demonstrated a moderately high percentage of concordance (69%) regarding reported problem domains and a slightly lower percentage of concordance on hopes (61%), with higher concordance for more common domains. Domain prevalence and concordance changed considerably at 24 months. Parents of children who later died showed markedly different patterns of domain prevalence and more extreme patterns of concordance.

Yet, no study to date has examined whether end-of-life practices are associated with measures of religiosity and spirituality. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between general measures of patient religiosity and spirituality and patients' preferences for care at the end of life. METHODS: We examined data from the University of Chicago Hospitalist Study, which gathers sociodemographic and clinical information from all consenting general internal medicine patients at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Primary outcomes were whether the patient had an advance directive, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, a durable power of attorney for health care, and an informally designated decision maker. Primary predictors were religious attendance, intrinsic religiosity, and self-rated spirituality. RESULTS: The sample population (n=8308) was predominantly African American (73%) and female (60%). In this population, 1.5% had advance directives and 10.4% had DNR orders. Half (51%) of the patients had specified a decision maker. White patients were more likely than African American patients to have an advance directive (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-4.0) and a DNR order (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.9). Patients reporting high intrinsic religiosity were more likely to have specified a decision maker than those reporting low intrinsic religiosity (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.6). The same was true for those with high compared with low spirituality (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.5). Religious characteristics were not significantly associated with having an advance directive or DNR order.

S. and Zenoni, Maria A. and Kerns, Robert D. and Pearlman, Robert A. and Asch, Steven M. and Becker, William C. and Lorenz, Karl A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Signature informed consent (SIC) is a part of a Veterans Health Administration ethics initiative for patient education and shared decision making with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). Historically, patients with cancer-related pain receiving LTOT are exempt from this process. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to understand patients' and providers' perspectives on using SIC for LTOT in patients with cancer-related pain. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 20 opioid prescribers and 20 patients who were prescribed opioids at two large academically affiliated Veterans Health Administration Medical Centers. We used a combination of deductive and inductive approaches in content analysis to produce emergent themes. RESULTS: Potential advantages of SIC are that it can clarify and help patients comprehend LTOT risks and benefits, provide clear upfront boundaries and expectations, and involve the patient in shared decision making. Potential disadvantages of SIC include time delay to treatment, discouragement from recommended opioid use, and impaired trust in the patient-provider relationship. Providers and patients have misconceptions about the definition of SIC. Providers and patients question if SIC for LTOT is really informed consent. Providers and patients advocate for strategies to improve comprehension of SIC content. Providers had divergent perspectives on exemptions from SIC. Oncologists want SIC for LTOT to be tailored for patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: Provider and patient interviews highlight various aspects about the advantages and disadvantages of requiring SIC for LTOT in cancer-related pain.

Maciejewski_2013_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Emotional numbness modifies the effect of end-of-life discussions on end-of-life care,"Maciejewski, Paul K. and Prigerson, Holly G.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Overall, end-of-life (EOL) discussions are unrelated to psychological distress and associated with lower rates of aggressive care near death. Nevertheless, patients who report that they feel emotionally numb about their illness might encounter difficulties cognitively processing an EOL discussion. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that emotional numbness would modify the effect of EOL discussions on the receipt of less aggressive EOL care. METHODS: Data were derived from structured interviews with 290 participants in the federally-funded Coping with Cancer Study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with advanced cancer followed-up till their death. Patients' reports of EOL discussions with their physician and emotional numbness were assessed at a median of 4.6 months before their death. Information about aggressive EOL care (i.e., ventilation, resuscitation in the last week of life, death in the intensive care unit) was obtained from postmortem caregiver interviews and medical charts. Main and interactive effects of EOL discussions and emotional numbness on aggressive EOL care, adjusting for potential confounds, were evaluated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The likelihood of aggressive EOL care associated with having EOL discussions increased by a factor of nine (adjusted odds ratio=9.02, 95% CI 1.37, 59.6, P=0.022) for every unit increase in a patient's emotional numbness score. CONCLUSION: Emotional numbness diminishes a patient's capacity to benefit from EOL discussions.

While these children often receive palliative care services, little is known about parental preparedness for their child's end of life (EOL). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate aspects important to preparedness at EOL among bereaved parents of children with CCCs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, parents of children who received care at Boston Children's Hospital and died between 2006 and 2015 completed 21 open-response items querying communication, decision-making, and EOL experiences as part of the Survey of Caring for Children with CCCs. Additional demographic data were extracted from the child's medical record. An iterative multistage thematic analysis of responses was utilized to identify key contexts, conditions, and themes pertaining to preparedness. RESULTS: One hundred ten of 114 parents responded to open-ended items; 63% (n = 69) had children with congenital or central nervous system progressive primary conditions for a median of 7.5 years (IQR 0.8-18.1) before death. Seventy-one percent (n = 78/110) had palliative care involvement and 65% (n = 69/106) completed advance care planning. Parents described preparedness as a complex concept that extended beyond ""readiness"" for their child's death. Three domains emerged that contributed to parents' lack of preparedness: 1) chronic illness experiences; 2) pretense of preparedness; and 3) circumstances and emotions surrounding their child's death. CONCLUSIONS: Most bereaved parents of children with CCCs described feeling unprepared for their child's EOL, despite palliative care and advance care planning, suggesting preparedness is a nuanced concept beyond ""readiness.""

RESULTS: Participants (n = 68) were primarily Caucasian (94%), females (68%), with mean age of 51.3 years (SD 0.7). Seventeen games were analyzed. Four primary themes emerged during game conversations: 1) the importance of people, relationships, and the roles played during end-of-life decision making, 2) values, beliefs, and preferences related to end-of-life care and the dying period, 3) considerations about preparing for the aftermath of one's death, and 4) the relevance of stories or experiences for informing one's own end-of-life preferences.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore EPs' attitudes about intubating critically ill, terminal cancer patients. METHODS: Fifty EPs at three emergency departments (one university based, one community, and one Health Maintenance Organization) in Southern California participated in an anonymous survey that presented a hypothetical case of an end-stage lung cancer patient in pending respiratory failure. Fourteen questions along a five-point Likert scale asked EPs about prognosis and factors that influence their decision to intubate or not. RESULTS: A convenience sampling of 50 EPs yielded a 100% survey response rate. Ninety-four percent believed intubation would not provide an overall survival benefit. If the family insisted, 26% would intubate the patient even with a do-not-intubate (DNI) status. Ninety-four percent would postpone intubation if palliative consultation were available in the ED. Sixty-eight percent believed that a discussion about goals of care was more time consuming than intubation. Only 16% believed they had sufficient training in palliative care. Although 29% who felt they had inadequate palliative care training would intubate the patient with a DNI, only 13% of EPs with self-perceived adequate palliative care training would intubate that patient. CONCLUSION: EPs vary in their attitudes about intubating dying cancer patients when families demanded it, even when they believed it was nonbeneficial and against the patient's wishes.

Hebert_2009_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Preparing family caregivers for death and bereavement. Insights from caregivers of terminally ill patients,"Hebert, Randy S. and Schulz, Richard and Copeland, Valire C. and Arnold, Robert M.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Many family caregivers are unprepared for the death of their loved one and may suffer from worse mental health as a result. We therefore sought to determine the factors that family caregivers believe are important to preparing for death and bereavement. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with 33 family caregivers (bereaved or current) of terminally ill patients. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Life experiences such as the duration of caregiving/illness, advance care planning, previous experiences with caregiving or death, and medical sophistication all impacted preparedness, or the degree to which a caregiver is ready for the death and bereavement. Regardless of life experiences, however, all caregivers reported medical, practical, psychosocial, and religious/spiritual uncertainty. Because uncertainty was multidimensional, caregivers often needed more than prognostic information in order to prepare. Communication was the primary mechanism used to manage uncertainty. Good communication included clear, reliable information, combined with relationship-centered care from health care providers. Finally, preparedness had cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. To prepare, some caregivers needed information tailored to their uncertainty (cognitive), others needed to ""mentally"" or ""emotionally"" prepare (affective), and still others had important tasks to complete (behavioral). In order to better prepare family caregivers for the death of a loved one, health care providers must develop a trusting relationship with caregivers, provide them with reliable information tailored to their uncertainty, and allow time for caregivers to process the information and complete important tasks.",2009,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.12.010,37,1,12-3,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pennsylvania and Interviews as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and *Artificial Intelligence and Caregivers/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology and Terminally Ill/*psychology and *Attitude to Death and Spirituality and Palliative Care/*psychology and *Bereavement",NA,NA,2009/01//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

LIS patients may live for years with preserved quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function, but with severe disability. However, medical providers and family often underestimate the patient's QoL, and choose less aggressive care. Prompt assessment of decisionality in LIS patients is challenging, but it must be done to allow these patients to participate in their care. We present the case of a 54-year-old man with LIS. The medical team recommended comfort measures, but the family advocated involving the patient in goals of care discussions.

Malia_2011_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,What influences patients' decisions on artificial hydration at the end of life? A Q-methodology study,"Malia, Catherine and Bennett, Michael I.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Artificial hydration (AH) is used to palliate patients with reduced fluid intake at the end of life but is a controversial practice. Patients' involvement in decision making varies, and little is known about patients' understanding of the benefits and burdens of AH. OBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that patients consider most important when making decisions regarding AH at the end of life. METHODS: Interview study using Q-sort methodology conducted with 20 patients with advanced diseases recruited from inpatient and outpatient palliative care services. RESULTS: Several domains appear to influence a decision about AH: the patient's understanding of AH, their philosophical position on end-of-life care, the process of discussion, and who makes the final decision. Patients generally based their decision on whether AH would improve quality of life, although prolonging life was important for some. Hydration was not considered a burden, and many would want a trial of AH in the event that they could no longer drink. Patients wanted to be guided by medical opinion, although some wanted to make the decision on their own. All patients welcomed the opportunity to discuss AH. CONCLUSION: Patients view AH as an important issue and are keen to be involved in decision making.

Current understanding of people who would be involved in advance care planning (ACP) is crucial to disseminate it systematically. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate awareness and attitudes toward ACP in South Korea. METHODS: A multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted, a survey regarding ACP among four groups that would have different positions and experiences: 1001 cancer patients, 1006 family caregivers, 928 physicians, and 1241 members of the general public. RESULTS: A total of 15% of the general population, 33% of the patients and caregivers, and 61% of the physicians had knowledge of advance directives. More than 64% of the general population, above 72% of the patients and caregivers, and 97% of the physicians were willing to do so when the disease status was aggravated or terminal. The possibility for changing the plan, uncertainty as to whether directives would actually be followed, and psychological discomfort were common reasons for not wanting to engage in ACP. Routine recommendations for a specific medical condition, heightened accessibility, and health insurance support were common factors that could help facilitate ACP. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that strategies for promoting ACP should reflect different perspectives among the general public, patients, family caregivers, and physicians.

Green_2015_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Advance Care Planning Does Not Adversely Affect Hope or Anxiety Among Patients With Advanced Cancer,"Green, Michael J. and Schubart, Jane R. and Whitehead, Megan M. and Farace, Elana and Lehman, Erik and Levi, Benjamin H.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Many physicians avoid advance care planning (ACP) discussions because they worry such conversations will lead to psychological distress. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether engaging in ACP using online planning tools adversely affects hope, hopelessness, or anxiety among patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer and an estimated survival of two years or less (Intervention group) and a Control group were recruited at a tertiary care academic medical center (2007-2012) to engage in ACP using an online decision aid (""Making Your Wishes Known""). Pre/post and between-group comparisons were made, including hope (Herth Hope Index), hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale), and anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included ACP knowledge, self-determination, and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 200 individuals completed the study. After engaging in ACP, there was no decline in hope or increase in hopelessness in either the Control or Intervention group. Anxiety was likewise unchanged in the Control group but decreased slightly in the Intervention group. Knowledge of ACP (% correct answers) increased in both the groups, but more so in the Intervention group (13% increase vs. 4%; P<0.01). Self-determination increased slightly in both groups, and satisfaction with the ACP process was greater (P<0.01) in the Intervention than Control group.

Waldrop_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,"The Nexus Between the Documentation of End-of-Life Wishes and Awareness of Dying: A Model for Research, Education and Care","Waldrop, Deborah P. and McGinley, Jacqueline M. and Clemency, Brian",Journal of pain and symptom management,"The convergence of medical treatment that can extend life with written medical orders that make it possible to refuse such treatment brings the differential dynamics of contemporary end-of-life decision making into sharp focus. Communication between families and clinicians can be confusing, uncertain, and pressured when death is imminent. These situations create distress that ultimately influences the end-of-life experience for people who are dying and those who care for them. This article presents the analysis of the decisional dynamics that emerge from the intersection of the patient-family-provider awareness that death is near with the presence or absence of documentation of expressed wishes for end-of-life care. A heuristic analysis was conducted with data from three studies about urgent decision making at the end of life. Original study data included 395 surveys, in-depth interviews with 91 prehospital (paramedics and emergency medical technicians), and content analysis of 100 Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment forms that led to the development of an overarching conceptual model of decision making. Four decisional contexts emerged from the intersection of awareness of dying and documentation of wishes: 1) Aware Documented, 2) Aware Undocumented, 3) Unaware Documented, and 4) Unaware Undocumented. This generalizable model, which is agnostic of setting, can help clinicians more astutely recognize the clinical situation when death is imminent, assess patients and caregivers, and intervene to help focus conversation and direct decision making. The model can also inform research, education, and care for people in some of the most vulnerable moments of life.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.09.010,55,2,522-529,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and conceptual model and Stress, Psychological and Interviews as Topic and Models, Psychological and Heuristics and *Decision Making and *Documentation and *Awareness and Family/psychology and *Death and Caregivers/psychology and *Advance Directives/psychology and *Terminal Care/psychology and Emergency Medical Technicians/psychology and End-of-life decision making and existential crisis and Existentialism",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of FAmily-CEntered (FACE) ACP in increasing ACP and advance directive documentation in the medical record. METHODS: Longitudinal, two-arm, randomized controlled trial with intent-to-treat design recruited from five hospital-based outpatient HIV clinics in Washington, DC. Adults living with HIV and their surrogate decision-makers (N = 233 dyads) were randomized to either an intensive facilitated two-session FACE ACP (Next Steps: Respecting Choices goals of care conversation and Five Wishes advance directive) or healthy living control (conversations about developmental/relationship history and nutrition). RESULTS: Patients (n = 223) mean age: 51 years, 56% male, 86% African-American. One hundred ninety-nine dyads participated in the intervention. At baseline, only 13% of patients had an advance directive. Three months after intervention, this increased to 59% for the FACE ACP group versus 17% in the control group (P < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that family factors might influence clinician decision making in these circumstances. METHODS: We presented vignettes concerning difficult EOL decision making, randomized for religious objection to therapy withdrawal and perceived level of family involvement, to clinicians working in three Children's Hospital intensive care units. Additionally, attitudes about EOL care were assessed. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four respondents completed the questionnaire, for an overall response rate of 54%. Respondents receiving the ""involved family"" vignette were more likely to agree to continue medical care indefinitely (P<0.0005). Respondents were marginally more likely to pursue a court-appointed guardian for those patients whose families had nonreligious objections to withdrawal (P=0.05). Respondents who thought that a fear of being sued affected decisions were less likely to pursue unilateral withdrawal (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI=0.6-0.9). Those who felt personal distress as a result of difficult EOL decision making, thought they often provided ""futile"" care, or those who felt EOL care was effectively addressed at the institution were less likely to want to defer to the parents' wishes (range of odds ratios 0.7-1). CONCLUSION: In this randomized vignette study, we have shown that family factors, particularly how involved a family seems to be in a child's life, affect what clinicians think is ethically appropriate in challenging EOL cases. Knowledge of how a family's degree of involvement may affect clinicians should be helpful to the clinical ethics consultants and offer some degree of insight to the clinicians themselves.",2013,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.005,45,5,832-840,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude to Health and Religion and *Decision Making and United States/epidemiology and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/*statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/*statistics & numerical data and *Family Characteristics and Advance Care Planning/*statistics & numerical data and Legal Guardians/statistics & numerical data and Pediatrics/*statistics & numerical data and Terminally Ill/statistics & numerical data and Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between depression and health care utilization at EOL among older adults (ages >=67) diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 2009 to 2011. METHODS: Using the SEER-Medicare database, we fit multivariable logistic regression models to explore the association of depression with duration of hospice stay plus high-intensity care, for example inpatient admissions, in-hospital death, emergency department visits, and chemotherapy at EOL. We used a regression model to evaluate hospice enrollment, accounting for the competing risk of death. RESULTS: Among 13,827 subjects, pre-cancer depression was associated with hospice enrollment (sub-hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.28), 90 + hospice days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.58), and lower odds of most utilization; we found no association with EOL chemotherapy. Diagnosis-time depression was associated with hospice enrollment (SHR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29) but not high-intensity utilization. Post-diagnosis depression was associated with lower hospice enrollment (SHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.85) and higher odds of ICU admission (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37). CONCLUSION: EOL healthcare utilization varied by timing of depression diagnosis. Those with pre-cancer depression had lower odds of high-intensity healthcare, were more likely to utilize hospice, and have longer hospice stays. Regular depression screening and treatment may help patients optimize decision-making for EOL care.

Surgical patients are persistently less likely to receive palliative care than their medical counterparts for reasons that are not clear. OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize surgeon-specific determinants of palliative care in seriously ill and dying patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature focused on surgery and palliative care within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid Medline databases from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2016 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative studies with primary data evaluating surgeons' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors or experiences in care for seriously ill and dying patients were selected for full review by at least two study team members based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted based on a predetermined instrument and compared across studies using thematic analysis in a meta-synthesis of qualitative and quantitative findings. RESULTS: A total of 2589 abstracts were identified and screened, and 35 articles (26 quantitative and nine qualitative) fulfilled criteria for full review. Among these, 17 articles explored practice and attitudes of surgeons regarding palliative and end-of-life care, 11 articles assessed training in palliative care, five characterized surgical decision making, one described behaviors of surgeons caring for seriously ill and dying patients, and one explicitly identified barriers to use of palliative care. Four major themes across studies affected receipt of palliative care for surgical patients: 1) surgeons' experience and knowledge, 2) surgeons' attitudes, 3) surgeons' preferences and decision making for treatment, and 4) perceived barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Among the articles reviewed, surgeons overall demonstrated insight into the benefits of palliative care but reported limited knowledge and comfort as well as a multitude of challenges to introducing palliative care to their patients. These findings indicate a need for wider implementation of strategies that allow optimal integration of palliative care with surgical decision making.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.11.031,55,4,1196-1215.e5,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,United States and Humans and Palliative care and surgery and mixed methods and systematic review and *Palliative Care/methods/psychology and *Surgeons and meta-synthesis and surgeon,NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied end-of-life decision-making practices for cancer patients who died in each of these settings and assessed the impact of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP), a template for care in the dying phase. Physicians and relatives of 311 deceased cancer patients completed questionnaires. The LCP was introduced halfway through the study period. During the last three months of life, patients who died in hospital received anticancer therapy and medication to relieve symptoms more often than those in both other settings. During the last three days of life, patients who died in the hospital or nursing home received more medication than those who died at home. The LCP reduced the extent to which physicians used medication that might have hastened death. Relatives of patients who died in the hospital tended to be least positive about the patient's and their own participation in the decision making. We conclude that cancer patients who die in the hospital are more intensively treated during the last phase of life than those who die elsewhere.

More difficult still are the decisions regarding what interventions are and are not indicated during these trying times. Occasionally, families of children who are nearing the end of life disagree with the assessment of the medical team regarding these interventions. In rare cases, the medical team can be moved to enact a do not attempt resuscitation order against the wishes of the patient's parents. This article presents one such illustrative case and discusses the ethical issues relevant to such challenging clinical scenarios. The authors posit that such a unilateral do not attempt resuscitation order is only appropriate in very limited circumstances in pediatric care. Instead, focus should be placed on open discussion between parents and members of the clinical team, shared decision making, and maintenance of the clinician-parent relationship while simultaneously supporting members of the clinical team who express discomfort with parental decisions.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to identify support network factors that affect the likelihood of naming a decision-maker and of talking to family/friends and doctors about ACP among vulnerable PLHIV. METHODS: PLHIV were recruited from a large urban HIV clinic. A social support network inventory was used to calculate number of persons available for various types of support. Characteristics of network members were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between social network factors and ACP discussion, adjusting for age, sex, education, and total number of network members. RESULTS: The sample (N = 370) was mostly African American (95%), male (56%), and 48% had less than a high school education. Almost half the sample (48%) had talked to their family/friends or doctor about ACP, and 34% had named a medical decision-maker. Adjusted analysis revealed that talking about ACP with family/friends was associated with female sex and a larger closer support network who provided health information and physical assistance. Talking to doctors about ACP was associated with larger support networks who provided physical assistance but lower numbers from whom emotional support was received.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify available patient decision aids (PtDAs) relating information about hospice care and compare that information with the informational needs expressed by real-world health care consumers. METHODS: First, the research team conducted an environmental scan of available PtDAs that included hospice as a treatment option and met six basic criteria defined by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. Second, laypersons conducted an organic Web search for information regarding hospice, followed by a semi-structured interview eliciting perceptions of the available information. The setting was the University of Colorado Health Care System. Participants included 20 laypersons aged 18 years or older. RESULTS: The environmental scan identified 7PtDAs that included hospice. No PtDAs were designed primarily around hospice; rather, hospice was referenced under the umbrella of another treatment option. The layperson search identified information distinct from the scan; no participant accessed any of the above 7PtDAs. Many participants found the available online material confusing and biased, while failing to provide clear information on cost and lacking desired patient and caregiver testimonials.

Advance practice providers such as physician assistants (PAs) are increasingly providing care in the hospital setting and are often called to communicate with patients and families. A first step to improving PA communication is to better understand PAs' current experiences in their daily practices. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore roles PAs serve in communicating with terminally ill patients/families; PAs' attitudes and opinions about communication roles; and perceived barriers and facilitators of communication with patients/families in the hospital setting. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with PAs practicing on adult medical services at three acute care hospitals of an academic medical center in Bronx, New York. An open-ended question guide was used. An inductive thematic analysis strategy was used to examine the data from transcribed audiotapes of focus group sessions to identify emergent concepts and themes. RESULTS: The overarching theme that emerged was being stuck in the middle. PAs experienced ambiguity around their roles and responsibilities in communications between the medical team as well as patients and families; gaps in knowledge and skills; and organizational or structural deficits in the patient care systems that placed them in uncomfortable situations. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at improving PA communication with terminally ill patients and their families should target institutional structures, systems, and culture around roles and responsibilities in addition to skill and knowledge gaps to be most effective.",2017,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.03.011,54,1,27-34,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Patient Care Team and Decision Making and Palliative care and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and health communication and *Professional-Patient Relations and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Communication and *Family/psychology and *Terminally Ill/psychology and hospital medicine and Physician Assistants/*psychology and Professional Role/psychology,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three hundred and seventy-four consecutive patients with terminal cancers admitted to a palliative care unit were enrolled. Two instruments, the good-death scale and the audit scale for good-death services, were used in the study. Mean age of the 374 patients was 65.45 +/- 14.77 years. The total good-death score in the home-death group (n=307) was significantly higher than that in the hospital-death group (n=67), both at the time of admission (t= -5.741, P<0.001) and prior to death (t= -3.027, P<0.01). However, the score of item ""degree of physical comfort"" assessed prior to death in the home-death group was lower than that in the hospital-death group (P=0.185). As to the audit scale for good-death services, each subscale score and total scores in the home-death group were significantly higher than that in the hospital-death group, with the exception of the subscale ""continuity of social support"" (4.72 vs. 4.61, P=0.132). Bereavement support (odds ratio=1.01, 95% confidence interval=0.62-1.39; multiple regression), alleviation of anxiety (0.81, 0.46-1.15), decision-making participation (0.61, 0.26-0.95), fulfillment of last wish (0.45, 0.08-0.82), and survival time (0.00, 0.00-0.01) were independent correlates of the good-death score (35.8% of explained variance). However, the place of death was not in the model. The study conclusively suggests the necessity for palliative home care to strengthen the competence of physical care. Moreover, earlier incorporation of palliative care into anticancer therapies can lead to better death preparation and good-death services, and thus be helpful to achieve a good death.",2007,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.01.004,34,5,497-504,eng,0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Taiwan and *Attitude to Death and Neoplasms/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand the relationships among these care processes, we analyzed baseline interview data from veterans enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a palliative care intervention. Participants were 400 inpatient veterans admitted with a physician-estimated risk of one-year mortality more than 25%; 260 (65%) had cancer as the primary diagnosis. Patients who believed that they had a life-limiting illness (89% of sample) reported that their provider had communicated this to them more frequently than those who did not share that belief (78% vs. 22%, P<0.001). Over half (53%) of the participants reported discussing their care preferences with their providers and 66% reported such discussions with their family; 35% had a living will. In multivariate analysis, greater functional impairment was associated with patients having discussed their care preferences with providers (P<0.05), whereas patient understanding of prognosis (P<0.05), better quality of life (P<0.01), and not being African American (P<0.05) were associated with patients having discussed their care preferences with family; higher education (P<0.001), and not being African American (P<0.01) were associated with having a living will. Patients with poor understanding of prognosis are less likely to discuss care preferences with family members, suggesting the importance of provider communication with patients regarding prognosis.

Decision control preferences (DCPs) may profoundly affect advance care planning (ACP) and communication. OBJECTIVES: To determine the DCPs of diverse, older adults and whether DCPs are associated with participant characteristics, ACP, and communication satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 146 participants were recruited from clinics and senior centers in San Francisco. We assessed DCPs using the control preferences scale: doctor makes all decisions (low), shares with doctor (medium), makes own decisions (high). We assessed associations between DCPs and demographics; prior advance directives; ability to make in-the-moment goals of care decisions; self-efficacy, readiness, and prior asked questions; and satisfaction with patient-doctor communication (on a five-point Likert scale), using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean age was 71 <c2><b1> 10 years, 53% were non-white, 47% completed an advance directive, and 70% made goals of care decisions. Of the sample, 18% had low DCPs, 33% medium, and 49% high.

CONCLUSION: Nearly one-fifth of diverse, older adults want doctors to make their medical decisions. Older age and lower readiness to ask questions were the only demographic variables significantly associated with low DCPs.

We previously developed and validated the values questions for Person-Centered Oncologic Care and Choices (P-COCC), a novel ACP intervention combining a patient values interview with an informational care goals video. OBJECTIVES: To pilot-study acceptability and, using randomization, explore potential utility of P-COCC. METHODS: Eligibility included patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer cared for at a comprehensive cancer center. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to P-COCC vs. video alone vs. usual care, respectively. Validated assessments of well-being and decisional conflict were completed. Participants in the P-COCC arm also completed three Likert scales (was the intervention helpful, comfortable, and recommended to others); a positive score of at least 1 of 3 indicated acceptability. RESULTS: Patients were screened from 9/2014 to 11/2016; 151 were consented and randomized, 99 whom completed study measures (most common attrition reason: disease progression or death). The primary aim was met: Among 33 participants, P-COCC was acceptable to 32 (97%, 95% CI: 0.84-0.99, P < 0.001). Mean distress scores (0-10) increased (0.43) in the P-COCC arm but decreased in the video-alone (-0.04) and usual-care (-0.21) arms (P = 0.03 and 0.04, P-COCC vs. video-alone and usual-care arms, respectively). There were no significant pre-post change scores on other measures of well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress) or intergroup differences in decisional conflict.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the attitudes and perceptions of patients with life-limiting illnesses, informal caregivers, doctors, nurses, and medical social workers regarding ACP in a multicultural family centric community. METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study, using focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. We used purposive sampling techniques to recruit 61 adults (15 doctors, 13 nurses, 5 medical social workers, 15 patients, and 13 caregivers) from multiple health care settings across the country. RESULTS: The participants are genuinely anxious about the implementation of ACP. They had positive and negative expectations of ACP. Many were confused about the legal framework for health care decision-making and expected ACP to be of limited value because family members, rather than the patient, were usually the key decision makers. CONCLUSION: A nuanced approach to ACP that considers the family network is required in multicultural family centric communities.

There have been few nationwide studies of ACP, especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ACP in two European countries and identify the associated factors. METHODS: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken in 2007 via representative nationwide Sentinel Networks of general practitioners (GPs) in Belgium and The Netherlands using similar standardized procedures. All GPs reported on each non-suddenly deceased patient in their practice. Our main outcome measure was whether or not ACP, that is, an agreement for medical treatment and/or medical decisions in the last phase of life in the case of the patient losing competence, was present. RESULTS: Among 1072 non-sudden deaths, ACP was done with 34% of patients and most often related to the forgoing of potential life-prolonging treatments in general (24%). In 8% of cases, ACP was made in consultation with the patient and in writing. In 23% of cases, care was planned with the patient's family only. Multivariate analysis revealed that ACP was more often made with patients if they were capable of decision making during the last three days of life (odds ratio [OR] 3.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-6.1), received treatment aimed at palliation in the last week (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.6-4.2), had contact with a GP in the last week (OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.7-4.1), died of cancer (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1-2.0), or died at home (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.5-3.0).

Prior research has demonstrated high surrogate stress, and that despite standards promoting substituted judgment, most patients do not want their surrogates to make pure substituted judgments for them. It is not known how best to help loved ones fulfill the surrogate role. OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of an intervention to help surrogate decision makers. METHODS: One hundred sixty-six patients (41% with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 59% with gastrointestinal cancers) and their surrogates at two university medical centers were randomized to an intensive nurse-directed discussion of the end-of-life decision control preferences of the patient (TAILORED) or a discussion of nutrition (CONTROL); 163 completed baseline interviews and underwent the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve patients died during follow-up and 137 dyads completed the study. Post-intervention, using all available data, TAILORED patients and surrogates became more likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making, that is, a balance of their own wishes and what the surrogate thinks best (adjusted odds compared with baseline for patients = 1.78, P = 0.04; adjusted odds for surrogates = 2.05, P = 0.03). CONTROL patients became 40% less likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making (P = 0.08), and CONTROL surrogates did not change significantly from baseline (adjusted odds = 1.44, P = 0.28).

How this affects doctors' decision making is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the influence of contradictory instructions on doctors' decisions. METHODS: All the generalists and internists in French-speaking Switzerland were mailed the questionnaire. Respondents (43.5%) evaluated three vignettes that described medical decisions for incapacitated patients. Each vignette was produced in four versions: one with an advance directive, one with a proxy opinion, one with both, and one with neither (control). In the first vignette, the directive and proxy agreed on the recommendation to forgo a medical intervention; in the second, the advance directive opposed, but the proxy favored the intervention; and in the third, the roles were reversed. Each doctor received one version of each vignette, attributed at random. The outcome variables were the doctor's decision to forgo the medical intervention and the rating of the decision as difficult. RESULTS: Written advance directives and proxy opinions significantly influenced doctors' decision making. When both were available and concordant, they reinforced each other (odds ratio [OR] of forgoing intervention 35.7, P < 0.001 compared with no instruction). When the directive and proxy disagreed, the resulting effect was to forgo the intervention (ORs 2.1 and 2.2 for the two discordant vignettes, both P < 0.001). Discordance between instructions was associated with increased odds of doctors rating the decision as difficult (both ORs 2.0, P <e2><89><a4> 0.001).

Despite the prohibition, some physicians say they have used drugs to intentionally end a patient's life. OBJECTIVES: To provide some empirical grounding for the ongoing debate. METHODS: Using data from the End-of-Life in France survey (a representative sample of 15,000 deaths that occurred in December 2009, questionnaires completed anonymously by the physicians who had certified the deaths), we selected all the cases where the physician had used one or more drugs to intentionally end a patient's life and compared the decisions and decision-making process with the conditions imposed by the French law for decisions to withhold or withdraw life-supporting treatments and by the Belgian law on euthanasia. RESULTS: Of the 36 cases analyzed, four situations seemed to be deliberate acts after explicit requests from the patients, and only two seemed to fulfill the eligibility and due care conditions of the Belgian euthanasia law. Decisions made without any discussion with patients were quite common, and we observed inadequate labeling, frequent signs of ambivalence (artificial feeding and hydration not withdrawn, types of drug used), and little interprofessional consultation. Where the patient had requested euthanasia, the emotional burden on the physician was heavy. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the pressing need for a clarification of the concepts involved among health professionals, patients, and society at large, and better training and support for physicians.",2015,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.02.021,50,2,208-215,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and End of life and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and France and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data and *Euthanasia, Active/methods/psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Physicians/psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Suicide, Assisted/psychology/statistics & numerical data and physician-assisted deaths",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to clarify the level of the family's achievement of maintaining hope and preparing for death and the professional's behavior related to their evaluations. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymous, nationwide survey was conducted involving 663 bereaved families of cancer patients who had been admitted to 100 palliative care units throughout Japan. RESULTS: A total of 454 family members returned the questionnaire (effective response rate, 68%). Overall, 73% of families reported that they could both maintain hope and prepare for the patient's death. The independent determinants of the family's agreement in reference to the professional's behavior are pacing the explanation with the family's preparation; coordinating patient and family discussions about priorities while the patient was in better condition; willingness to discuss alternative medicine; maximizing efforts to maintain the patient's physical strength (e.g., meals, rehabilitation); discussing specific, achievable goals; and not saying ""I can no longer do anything for the patient."" CONCLUSION: About 20% of family members reported that they could neither ""maintain hope nor prepare for death."" A recommended care strategy for medical professionals could include 1) discussing achievable goals and preparing for the future and pacing explanation with the family's preparation, 2) willingness to discuss alternative medicine, 3) maximizing efforts to maintain the patient's physical strength, and 4) avoid saying they could do nothing further for the patient.",2013,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.014,45,5,848-858,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Decision Making and Prevalence and Adaptation, Psychological and Survival Rate and Japan/epidemiology and Family/*psychology and *Attitude to Death and *Bereavement and Terminal Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Hope and Neoplasms/mortality/nursing/*psychology and Nurses/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Physicians/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To operationalize this paradigm, we created an easy-to-use ACP website (prepareforyourcare.org) based on a theoretical framework of behavior change and pilot-tested its efficacy to engage older adults in ACP. METHODS: At baseline and 1 week after viewing the PREPARE website, we assessed behavior change in ACP by using a validated survey that includes Process Measures (knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and readiness, 5-point Likert scales) and Action Measures (yes/no whether an ACP behavior was completed). We also assigned participants into behavior change stages (i.e., precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance) and determined the percentage of participants who moved from precontemplation at baseline to higher stages at 1 week. We also assessed PREPARE ease-of-use (10-point scale, 10 being the easiest). Changes were assessed with Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 68.4 years (SD 6.6), and 65% were nonwhite. Behavior Change Process Measures average Likert scores increased from 3.1 (0.9) to 3.7 (0.7), P < 0.001. Action Measures did not change significantly. However, precontemplation significantly decreased for most actions (e.g., talking to doctor about desired medical care, 61% to 35%, P < 0.003), with a mean decrease of 21% (range, 16%-33%). PREPARE was rated a nine of ten (<c2><b1>1.9) for ease-of-use. CONCLUSION: A new, patient-centered ACP website that focuses on preparing patients for communication and decision making significantly improves engagement in the process of ACP and behavior change.

Respect for patient autonomy requires physicians to involve their patients in this decision making. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the involvement of advanced lung cancer patients and their families in ELD making and compare their actual involvement with their previously stated preferences for involvement. METHODS: Patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer were recruited by physicians in 13 hospitals and regularly interviewed between diagnosis and death. When the patient died, the specialist and general practitioner were asked to fill in a questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients who died within 18 months of diagnosis were studied. An ELD was made in 52 cases (61%). According to the treating physician, half of the competent patients were not involved in the ELD making, one-quarter shared the decision with the physician, and one-quarter made the decision themselves. In the incompetent patients, family was involved in half of cases. Half of the competent patients were involved less than they had previously preferred, and 7% were more involved. Almost all of the incompetent patients had previously stated that they wanted their family involved in case of incompetence, but half did not achieve this. CONCLUSION: In half of the cases, advanced lung cancer patients-or their families in cases of incompetence-were not involved in ELD making, despite the wishes of most of them.

Waldrop_2015_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,"""We Are Strangers Walking Into Their Life-Changing Event"": How Prehospital Providers Manage Emergency Calls at the End of Life","Waldrop, Deborah P. and Clemency, Brian and Lindstrom, Heather A. and Clemency Cordes, Colleen",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Emergency 911 calls are often made when the end stage of an advanced illness is accompanied by alarming symptoms and substantial anxiety for family caregivers, particularly when an approaching death is not anticipated. How prehospital providers (paramedics and emergency medical technicians) manage emergency calls near death influences how and where people will die, if their end-of-life choices are upheld and how appropriately health care resources are used. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe how prehospital providers assess and manage end-of-life emergency calls. METHODS: In-depth and in-person interviews were conducted with 43 prehospital providers. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and entered into ATLAS.ti for data management and coding. Qualitative data analysis involved systematic and axial coding to identify and describe emergent themes. RESULTS: Four themes illustrate the nature and dynamics of emergency end-of-life calls: 1) multifocal assessment (e.g., of the patient, family, and environment), 2) family responses (e.g., emotional, behavioral), 3) conflicts (e.g., missing do-not-resuscitate order, patient-family conflicts), and 4) management of the dying process (e.g., family witnessed resuscitation or asking family to leave, decisions about hospital transport). After a rapid comprehensive multifocal assessment, family responses and the existence of conflicts mediate decision making about possible interventions. CONCLUSION: The importance of managing symptom crises and stress responses that accompany the dying process is particularly germane to quality care at life's end. The results suggest the importance of increasing prehospital providers' abilities to uphold advance directives and patients' end-of-life wishes while managing family emotions near death.",2015,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.03.001,50,3,328-334,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Death and Stress, Psychological and Environment and Interviews as Topic and emergency medical services and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Autonomy and Emergency Medical Services/*methods and Family/psychology and advance care planning and terminal care and End-of-life decision making and Conflict, Psychological and emergency medical technicians and Emergency Medical Technicians/*psychology and Resuscitation Orders/psychology and Terminal Care/*methods/*psychology",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

This case study and commentary puts forth a situation in which a palliative care consultation team encountered a patient with an advance directive that instructed her proxy decision maker to consider estate tax implications when making end-of-life decisions. Following presentation of the case, the authors focus on two ethical issues: 1) the appropriateness of considering patients' financial goals and values in medical decision making and 2) whether certain kinds of patient values should be considered more or less relevant than others as reasons for expressed treatment preferences.

The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and to palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients who may have limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits. We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform decision making of patients and families in collaboration with their health care practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions.",2012,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.002,44,2,301-306,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Male and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Quality of Life and Catheterization and Palliative Care/*methods and *Drainage/adverse effects and Adenocarcinoma/complications/surgery and Dyspnea/etiology/therapy and Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/surgery and Pleural Effusion, Malignant/etiology/psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Often, palliative care teams are tasked with weaving through opinions, emotions, and goals in search for an amenable solution. Occasionally, these situations get challenging. We present the case of an elderly Chinese Singaporean with metastatic cancer, whose family and physicians had conflicting goals of care. The former was adamant on treating the patient's disease with an untested drug, whereas the latter aimed to treat his symptoms with more conventional medication. Drug-drug interactions prevented treatment with both. Beginning with a discussion of the patient's best interest, we delve into the Singaporean context to show how culture affects medical decision making. Confucianism and filial piety are the values on which this family's workings were based. In an analysis of what this entails, we attempt to explain the significant and assertive family involvement in the decision-making process and their insistence on using novel medications, having exhausted conventional interventions. Within this mix were Western influences, too. Through the Internet, family members have become more informed and empowered in decision making, wresting the traditional paternalistic role of physicians in favor of ""patient autonomy.""

Research questions about this discrepancy have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care. METHODS: A data mining algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from 116 deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via a retrospective clinical chart review. RESULTS: Dependencies of disease and treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of 13%. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal home care. The family's preference for the last place of care has a high impact on the place of death of 51%, while the influence of the patient's preference is low, at 14%. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of death of 17%. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the probability of home deaths by 24%. CONCLUSION: Concerning death at home, open communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient preference for home care to be respected, the family's decision for the last place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish to die at home are suggested.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00664-4,19,1,160,eng,1472-684X,"Communication and Cancer and Hospitalization and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Machine Learning and Probability and Patient Satisfaction and Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and Aged, 80 and over and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Models, Statistical and Home Care Services and Terminally Ill/*psychology and *Attitude to Death and Bayesian networks and End-of-life care and Terminal Care/*methods/*psychology and Bayesian classifiers and Credal networks and Family caregivers and Neoplasms/*mortality/*psychology and Palliative home care and Patient preference and Place of death and Switzerland/epidemiology",NA,NA,2020/10/15/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Taylor_2017_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Clinical decision making in the recognition of dying: a qualitative interview study,"Taylor, Paul and Dowding, Dawn and Johnson, Miriam",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Recognising dying is an essential clinical skill for general and palliative care professionals alike. Despite the high importance, both identification and good clinical care of the dying patient remains extremely difficult and often controversial in clinical practice. This study aimed to answer the question: ""What factors influence medical and nursing staff when recognising dying in end-stage cancer and heart failure patients?"" METHODS: This study used a descriptive approach to decision-making theory. Participants were purposively sampled for profession (doctor or nurse), specialty (cardiology or oncology) and grade (senior vs junior). Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with NHS medical and nursing staff in an NHS Trust which contained cancer and cardiology tertiary referral centres. An interview schedule was designed, based on decision-making literature. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and analysed using thematic framework. Data were managed with Atlas.ti. RESULTS: Saturation was achieved with 19 participants (7 seniors; 8 intermediate level staff; 4 juniors). There were 11 oncologists (6 doctors, 5 nurses) and 8 cardiologists (3 doctors, 5 nurses). Six themes were generated: information used; decision processes; modifying factors; implementation; reflecting on decisions and related decisions. The decision process described was time-dependent, ongoing and iterative, and relies heavily on intuition. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the need to recognise the strengths and weaknesses of expertise and intuition as part of the decision process, and of placing the recognition of dying in a time-dependent context.

Many parents say religion and spirituality (R&S) influence their decisions, but the mechanism and outcomes of this influence are unknown. Health care providers (HCPs) often feel unprepared to discuss R&S with parents or address conflicts between R&S beliefs and clinical recommendations. Our study sought to illuminate the influence of R&S on parental decision-making and explore how HCPs interact with parents for whom R&S are important. METHODS: A longitudinal, qualitative, descriptive design was used to (1) identify R&S factors affecting parental decision-making, (2) observe changes in R&S themes over time, and (3) learn about HCP perspectives on parental R&S. The study sample included 16 cases featuring children with complex life-threatening conditions. The length of study for each case varied, ranging in duration from 8 to 531 days (median = 380, mean = 324, SD = 174). Data from each case included medical records and sets of interviews conducted at least monthly with mothers (n = 16), fathers (n = 12), and HCPs (n = 108). Thematic analysis was performed on 363 narrative interviews to identify R&S themes and content related to decision-making. RESULTS: Parents from 13 cases reported R&S directly influenced decision-making. Most HCPs were unaware of this influence. Fifteen R&S themes appeared in parent and HCP transcripts. Themes most often associated with decision-making were Hope & Faith, God is in Control, Miracles, and Prayer. Despite instability in the child's condition, these themes remained consistently relevant across the trajectory of illness. R&S influenced decisions about treatment initiation, procedures, and life-sustaining therapy, but the variance in effect of R&S on parents' choices ultimately depended upon other medical & non-medical factors. CONCLUSIONS: Parents consider R&S fundamental to decision-making, but apply R&S concepts in vague ways, suggesting R&S impact how decisions are made more than what decisions are made. Lack of clarity in parental expressions of R&S does not necessarily indicate insincerity or underestimation of the seriousness of the child's prognosis; R&S can be applied to decision-making in both functional and dysfunctional ways.

White_2017_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Comparing doctors' legal compliance across three Australian states for decisions whether to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment: does different law lead to different decisions?,"White, Ben P. and Willmott, Lindy and Cartwright, Colleen and Parker, Malcolm and Williams, Gail and Davis, Juliet",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Law purports to regulate end-of-life care but its role in decision-making by doctors is not clear. This paper, which is part of a three-year study into the role of law in medical practice at the end of life, investigates whether law affects doctors' decision-making. In particular, it considers whether the fact that the law differs across Australia's three largest states - New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Queensland - leads to doctors making different decisions about withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment from adults who lack capacity. METHODS: A cross-sectional postal survey of the seven specialties most likely to be involved in end-of-life care in the acute setting was conducted between 18 July 2012 and 31 January 2013. The sample comprised all medical specialists in emergency medicine, geriatric medicine, intensive care, medical oncology, palliative medicine, renal medicine and respiratory medicine on the AMPCo Direct database in those three Australian states. The survey measured medical specialists' level of legal compliance, and reasons for their decisions, concerning the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine predictors of legal compliance. Linear regression was used to examine associations between the decision about life-sustaining treatment and the relevance of factors involved in making these decisions, as well as state differences in these associations. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (867/2702). A majority of respondents in each state said that they would provide treatment in a hypothetical scenario, despite an advance directive refusing it: 72% in NSW and Queensland; 63% in Victoria. After applying differences in state law, 72% of Queensland doctors answered in accordance with local law, compared with 37% in Victoria and 28% in NSW (p < 0.001). Doctors reported broadly the same decision-making approach despite differences in local law. CONCLUSIONS: Law appears to play a limited role in medical decision-making at the end of life with doctors prioritising patient-related clinical and ethical considerations. Different legal frameworks in the three states examined did not lead to different decisions about providing treatment. More education is needed about law and its role in this area, particularly where law is inconsistent with traditional practice.",2017,10.1186/s12904-017-0249-1,16,1,63,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Advance directives and New South Wales and Victoria and *Decision Making and Queensland and Compliance with law and End-of-life decision-making and Medical law and Palliative Care/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards and Physicians/*legislation & jurisprudence/*standards and Withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and Withholding Treatment/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2017/11/28/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, studies about the desirability and difficulties of integrating relatives in the decision-making process are rare in oncology. This qualitative study explores the family role in decisions to limit treatment near the end of life from the professionals' point of view. METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with oncologists (n = 12) and nurses (n = 6) working at the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the University Hospital in Munich, Germany. The data were analyzed using a descriptive qualitative methodology and discussed from a medical ethics perspective. RESULTS: Four major themes played a central role in the perception of the medical staff in regard to family members. (1) Family impact on patients' treatment preferences. (2) Strong family wish for further treatment. (3) Emotional distress of the family related to the involvement in end-of-life decision-making. (4) Importance of knowing family structures. CONCLUSIONS: The important role of the family members in patients' disease process is recognized by oncologists and oncology nurses. However, this does not seem to lead to an early involvement of the family members. Developing and establishing a systematic assessment of family members' needs and wishes in order to provide a specific-tailored support should become a priority for interdisciplinary clinical research in the near future.",2018,10.1186/s12904-018-0288-2,17,1,29,eng,1472-684X,"Communication and Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Perception and Palliative care and Qualitative research and Caregivers and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Adaptation, Psychological and Germany and Nurses/psychology and Physicians/psychology and *Decision Making and Medical ethics and Health Personnel/*psychology and Neoplasms/*psychology and Palliative Care/*psychology and End-of-life decisions and Family members and Medical oncology and Stress, Psychological/complications/etiology/psychology",NA,NA,2018/02/17/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

The extent such decisions are perspective-related is also not well documented. METHODS: We explored the relative importance of 28 surrogate decision-making factors to 120 Middle-Eastern (ME) and 120 East-Asian (EA) women from three perspectives, norm-perception (N), preference as patient (P), and preference as surrogate decision-maker (S). Each respondent force-ranked (one to nine) 28 opinion-items according to each perspective. Items' ranks were analyzed by averaging-analysis and Q-methodology. RESULTS: Respondents' mean (SD) age was 33.2 (7.9) years; all ME were Muslims, 83% of EA were Christians. ""Trying everything possible to save patient,"" ""Improving patient health,"" ""Patient pain and suffering,"" and/or ""What is in the best interests of patient"" were the three most-important items, whereas ""Effect of caring for patient on all patients in society,"" ""Effect of caring for patient on patients with same disease,"" and/or ""Cost to society from caring for patient"" were among the three least-important items, in each ME and EA perspectives. P-perspective assigned higher mean ranks to family and surrogate's needs and burdens-related items, and lower mean rank to ""Fear of loss"" than S-perspective (p<0.001). ME assigned higher mean ranks to ""Medical facts"" and ""Surrogate own wishes for patient"" and lower mean rank to ""Family needs"" in all perspectives (p<0.001). Q-methodology identified models that were relatively patient's preference-, patient's religious/spiritual beliefs-, or emotion-dependent (all perspectives); medical facts-dependent (N- and S-perspectives), financial needs-dependent (P- and S-perspectives), and family needs-dependent (P-perspective). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Patient's health was more important than patient's preference to ME and EA women; society interest was least important. 2) Family and surrogate's needs/ burdens were more important, whereas fear of loss was less important to respondents as patients than as surrogate decision-makers. 3) Family needs were more important to EA than ME respondents, the opposite was true for medical facts and surrogate's wishes for patient. 4) Q-methodology models that relatively emphasized various surrogate decision-making factors overlapped the ME and EA women' three perspectives.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00643-9,19,1,137,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Q-methodology and East Asian and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Proxy/*psychology and Patient preference and And surrogate decision-maker preference and Asians/ethnology/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Averaging-analysis and Family Relations/ethnology/psychology and Middle eastern and Norm perception and Surrogate medical decision-making,NA,NA,2020/09/01/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Murphy_2020_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Nothing to lose: a grounded theory study of patients' and healthcare professionals' perspectives of being involved in the consent process for oncology trials with non-curative intent,"Murphy, Mary and McCaughan, Eilis and Carson, Matthew A. and Donovan, Monica and Wilson, Richard H. and Fitzsimons, Donna",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Clinical cancer research trials may offer little or no direct clinical benefit to participants where a cure is no longer possible. As such, the decision-making and consent process for patient participation is often challenging. AIM: To gain understanding of how patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation, from the perspective of both the patient and healthcare professionals involved. METHODS: In-depth, face to face interviews using a grounded theory approach. This study was conducted in a regional Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom. Of the 36 interviews, 16 were conducted with patients with cancer that had non-curative intent and 18 with healthcare professionals involved in the consent process. RESULTS: 'Nothing to lose' was identified as the core category that underpinned all other data within the study. This highlighted the desperation articulated by participants, who asserted trial participation was the 'only hope in the room'. The decision regarding participation was taken within a 'trusting relationship' that was important to both patients and professionals. Both were united in their 'fight against cancer'. These two categories are critical in understanding the decision-making/consent process and are supported by other themes presented in the theoretical model. CONCLUSION: This study presents an important insight into the complex and ethically contentious situation of consent in clinical trials that have non-curative intent. It confirms that patients with limited options trust their doctor and frequently hold unrealistic hopes for personal benefit. It highlights a need for further research to develop a more robust and context appropriate consent process.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00661-7,19,1,166,eng,1472-684X,Decision-making and Cancer and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and United Kingdom and Clinical trial and Qualitative Research and Grounded theory and Grounded Theory and Neoplasms and Consent and Interviews as Topic/methods and Health Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Informed Consent/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Medical Oncology/instrumentation/methods and Patients/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Research/standards/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2020/10/30/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most importantly, the framework of informed consent determines that physicians have the duty to provide detailed information about available therapeutic options and that patients have the right to refuse measures that contradict their personal values. However, when it comes to end-of-life decision-making a number of differences exist in the more specific regulations of individual countries. These differences and how they might nevertheless impact patient's choices will be addressed in the current debate. MAIN TEXT: In this article we show how the legal and medical frameworks of Germany, Poland and Sweden differ with regard to end-of-life decisions for patients with a fatal progressive disease. Taking Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as an example, we systematically compare clinical guidelines and healthcare law, pointing out the country-specific differences most relevant for existential decision-making. A fictional case report discusses the implications of these differences for a patient with ALS living in either of the three countries. Patients with ALS in Germany, Poland and Sweden are confronted with a similar spectrum of treatment options. However, the analysis of the normative frameworks shows that the conditions for making existential decisions differ considerably in Germany, Poland and Sweden. Specifically, these differences concern (1) the legal status of advance directives, (2) the conditions under which life-sustaining therapies are started or withheld, and (3) the legal regulations on assisted dying. CONCLUSION: According to the presented data, regulations of terminating life-sustaining treatments and the framework of ""informed consent"" are quite differently understood and implemented in the legal setting of the three countries. It is possible, and even likely, that these differences in the legal and medical frameworks have a considerable influence on existential decisions of patients with ALS.",2017,10.1186/s12904-017-0252-6,16,1,80,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Palliative care and Sweden and Germany and Poland and *Decision Making and Withholding Treatment/*legislation & jurisprudence and Shared decision-making and Advance directive and Advance Directives/legislation & jurisprudence and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/complications/psychology and Existentialism/*psychology and Terminal Care/legislation & jurisprudence/methods and Therapeutic treatment,NA,NA,2017/12/28/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bridges_2018_BMCpalcar,JOUR,A review of paper-based advance care planning aids,"Bridges, John F. P. and Lynch, Thomas and Schuster, Anne L. R. and Crossnohere, Norah L. and Smith, Katherine Clegg and Aslakson, Rebecca A.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) aids can help prepare patients, family members, and physicians for in-the-moment medical decision-making. We wished to describe the content and approach of paper-based ACP aids in order to characterize existing aids and inform the development of a new ACP aid. METHODS: Paper-based ACP aids were identified through an environmental scan and screened for eligibility. ACP conceptual frameworks and data were gathered via stakeholder engagement and used to inform the coding framework that two investigators used to independently code each aid. A directed content analysis was conducted on these eligible aids. Aids were categorized through a deliberative process with an investigator abstracting general information for each aid. RESULTS: Fifteen aids met the eligibility criteria. They ranged in length from 6 to 78 pages with the average aid written at an eighth-grade reading level. The content analysis revealed that many aids encouraged choosing a surrogate decision maker and informed users about legal medical documents. Fewer than half of the aids facilitated patient clarification of values regarding quality of life issues. The authors identified and termed the following three categories of aids: informative; semi-action oriented; and action-oriented. It was often unclear whether patients contributed to the development or testing of the ACP aids reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Most existing paper-based ACP aids address legal matters such as completing an advance directive. Only a minority elicited patient values and it was unclear whether any were developed in partnership with patients. Future development of ACP aids should account for patient preferences with a goal of supporting in-the-moment medical decision-making.",2018,10.1186/s12904-018-0298-0,17,1,54,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Decision aid and *Decision Making and Patient-centered care and Advance care planning and *Pamphlets and Advance Care Planning/*standards and Advance Directives/trends and Patient decision-making and Patient Preference/psychology and Patient-Centered Care/methods/*standards and Terminal Care/methods/standards,NA,NA,2018/03/27/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pennec_2012_BMCpalcar,JOUR,End-of-life medical decisions in France: a death certificate follow-up survey 5 years after the 2005 act of parliament on patients' rights and end of life,"Pennec, Sophie and Monnier, Alain and Pontone, Silvia and Aubry, Regis",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: The ""Patients' Rights and End of Life Care"" Act came into force in France in 2005. It allows withholding/withdrawal of life-support treatment, and intensified use of medications that may hasten death through a double effect, as long as hastening death is not the purpose of the decision. It also specifies the requirements of the decision-making process. This study assesses the situation by examining the frequency of end-of-life decisions by patients' and physicians' characteristics, and describes the decision-making processes. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective study of a random sample of adult patients who died in December 2009. Questionnaires were mailed to the physicians who certified/attended these deaths. Cases were weighted to adjust for response rate bias. Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions were performed for each decision. RESULTS: Of all deaths, 16.9% were sudden deaths with no information about end of life, 12.2% followed a decision to do everything possible to prolong life, and 47.7% followed at least one medical decision that may certainly or probably hasten death: withholding (14.6%) or withdrawal (4.2%) of treatments, intensified use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines (28.1%), use of medications to deliberately hasten death (i.e. not legally authorized) (0.8%), at the patient's request (0.2%) or not (0.6%). All other variables held constant, cause of death, patient's age, doctor's age and specialty, and place of death, influenced the frequencies of decisions. When a decision was made, 20% of the persons concerned were considered to be competent. The decision was discussed with the patient if competent in 40% (everything done) to 86% (intensification of alleviation of symptoms) of cases. Legal requirements regarding decision-making for incompetent patients were frequently not complied with. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that end-of-life medical decisions are common in France. Most are in compliance with the 2005 law (similar to some other European countries). Nonetheless, the study revealed cases where not all legal obligations were met or where the decision was totally illegal. There is still a lot to be done through medical education and population awareness-raising to ensure that the decision-making process is compatible with current legislation, the physician's duty of care and the patient's rights.",2012,10.1186/1472-684X-11-25,11,NA,25,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2012/12/03/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

A. and Lolkema, Martijn P. and Gort, Eelke H. and Pulleman, Saskia M. and Oomen-de Hoop, Esther and Hasselaar, Jeroen and van der Rijt, Carin C. D.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer for whom standard systemic treatment is no longer available may be offered participation in early phase clinical trials. In the decision making process, both medical-technical information and patient values and preferences are important. Since patients report decisional conflict after deciding on participation in these trials, improving the decision making process is essential. We aim to develop and evaluate an Online Value Clarification Tool (OnVaCT) to assist patients in clarifying their values around this end-of-life decision. This improved sharing of values is hypothesized to support medical oncologists in tailoring their information to individual patients' needs and, consequently, to support patients in taking decisions in line with their values and reduce decisional conflict. METHODS: In the first part, patients' values and preferences and medical oncologists' views hereupon will be explored in interviews and focus groups to build a first prototype OnVaCT using digital communication (serious gaming). Next, we will test feasibility during think aloud sessions, to deliver a ready-to-implement OnVaCT. In the second part, the OnVaCT, with accompanied training module, will be evaluated in a pre-test (12-18 months before implementation) post-test (12-18 months after implementation) study in three major Dutch cancer centres. We will include 276 patients (> 18 years) with advanced cancer for whom standard systemic therapy is no longer available, and who are referred for participation in early phase clinical trials. The first consultation will be recorded to analyse patient-physician communication regarding the discussion of patients' values and the decision making process. Three weeks afterwards, decisional conflict will be measured. DISCUSSION: This project aims to support the discussion of patient values when considering participation in early phase clinical trials. By including patients before their first appointment with the medical oncologist and recording that consultation, we are able to link decisional conflict to the decision making process, e.g. the communication during consultation. The study faces challenges such as timely including patients within the short period between referral and first consultation. Furthermore, with new treatments being developed rapidly, molecular stratification may affect the patient populations included in the pre-test and post-test periods.

Hill_2014_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Regoaling: a conceptual model of how parents of children with serious illness change medical care goals,"Hill, Douglas L. and Miller, Victoria and Walter, Jennifer K. and Carroll, Karen W. and Morrison, Wynne E. and Munson, David A. and Kang, Tammy I. and Hinds, Pamela S. and Feudtner, Chris",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Parents of seriously ill children participate in making difficult medical decisions for their child. In some cases, parents face situations where their initial goals, such as curing the condition, may have become exceedingly unlikely. While some parents continue to pursue these goals, others relinquish their initial goals and generate new goals such as maintaining the child's quality of life. We call this process of transitioning from one set of goals to another regoaling. DISCUSSION: Regoaling involves factors that either promote or inhibit the regoaling process, including disengagement from goals, reengagement in new goals, positive and negative affect, and hopeful thinking. We examine these factors in the context of parental decision making for a seriously ill child, presenting a dynamic conceptual model of regoaling. This model highlights four research questions that will be empirically tested in an ongoing longitudinal study of medical decision making among parents of children with serious illness. Additionally, we consider potential clinical implications of regoaling for the practice of pediatric palliative care. SUMMARY: The psychosocial model of regoaling by parents of children with a serious illness predicts that parents who experience both positive and negative affect and hopeful patterns of thought will be more likely to relinquish one set of goals and pursue a new set of goals. A greater understanding of how parents undergo this transition may enable clinicians to better support them through this difficult process.",2014,10.1186/1472-684X-13-9,13,1,9,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2014/03/13/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has focused on communication barriers rather than seeking solutions. Our aim was to identify strategies for effective communication and decision-making about goals of care for medical interventions in serious illness, from the perspectives of hospital-based healthcare providers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey composed of closed- and open-ended questions about goals of care communication and decision-making was administered to healthcare providers in 13 centres in six Canadian provinces. We analyzed a portion of the open-ended survey questions, specifically (1) suggestions for overcoming barriers encountered in discussing goals of care, and (2) currently effective practices. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze responses to the open-ended questions. RESULTS: Of the 1,256 respondents to the larger survey, 468 responded to the open-ended questions (37%), including 272 of 512 nurses (53%), 153 of 484 internal medicine trainees (32%), and 43 of 260 attending physicians (17%). Responses to each of the two questions were similar, generating a common set of themes and subthemes. Effective strategies and ideas for improving communication and decision-making about goals of care clustered under five themes: patient and family factors, communication between healthcare providers and patients, interprofessional collaboration, education, and resources. Subthemes highlighted core elements of shared decision-making.

Lotz_2016_Pallmedi,JOUR,Medical indication regarding life-sustaining treatment for children: Focus groups with clinicians,"Lotz, Julia Desiree and Jox, Ralf J. and Meurer, Christine and Borasio, Gian Domenico and Fuhrer, Monika",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about medical indication are a relevant problem in pediatrics. Difficulties arise from the high prognostic uncertainty, the decisional incapacity of many children, the importance of the family, and conflicts with parents. The objectivity of judgments about medical indication has been questioned. Yet, little is known about the factors pediatricians actually include in their decisions. AIM: Our aims were to investigate which factors pediatricians apply in deciding about medical indication, and how they manage conflicts with parents. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative focus group study with experienced pediatricians. The transcripts were subjected to qualitative content analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted three focus groups with pediatricians from different specialties caring for severely ill children/adolescents. They discussed life-sustaining treatment in two case scenarios that varied according to diagnosis, age, and gender. RESULTS: The decisions about medical indication were based on considerations relating to the individual patient, to the family, and to other patients. Individual patient factors included clinical aspects and benefit-burden considerations. Physicians' individual views and feelings influenced their decision-making. Different factors were applied or weighed differently in the two cases. In case of conflict with parents, physicians preferred solutions aimed at establishing consensus. CONCLUSION: The pediatricians defined medical indication on a case-by-case basis and were influenced by emotional reasoning. In contrast to prevailing ethico-legal principles, they included the interests of other persons in their decisions. Decision-making strategies should incorporate explicit discussions of social aspects and physicians' feelings to improve the transparency of the decision-making process and reduce bias.",2016,10.1177/0269216316628422,30,10,960-970,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,decision-making and Humans and Adolescent and Child and Decision Making and pediatrics and Qualitative Research and *Parents and terminal care and life support care and *Focus Groups and *Withholding Treatment and medical futility and Withholding/withdrawing treatment,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

To improve end-of-life care for this population, it is necessary to understand their medical and end-of-life decision-making preferences. AIM: (1) To examine adolescent/young adult decision-making involvement specific to heart transplant listing, and (2) to characterize their preferences specific to medical and end-of-life decision making. DESIGN: This cross-sectional research study utilized survey methods. Data were collected from October 2016 to March 2018.

RESULTS: Consistent with their preferences, the majority of adolescent/young adult participants (82%) perceived a high level of involvement in the decision to be listed for transplant. Patient involvement in this decision was primarily by way of seeking advice or information from their parents and being asked to express their opinion from parents. Despite a preference among patients to discuss their prognosis and be involved in end-of-life decision making if seriously ill, only 42% of patients had discussed their end-of-life wishes with anyone. Few parents recounted having such discussions. Preferences regarding the timing and nature of end-of-life decision-making discussions varied. CONCLUSIONS: Although young people are involved in the decision to pursue heart transplantation, little attention is paid to involving them in discussions regarding end-of-life decision making in a manner that is consistent with individual preferences.",2020,10.1177/0269216319874689,34,3,272-280,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and Cross-Sectional Studies and Pilot Projects and decision making and *Decision Making and *Patient Participation and *Terminal Care and *Advance Care Planning and *Heart Transplantation and advance care planning and heart transplantation,NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Roeline W. and Payne, Sheila A. and Seymour, Jane and Pleschberger, Sabine and Deschepper, Reginald and Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Older patients often experience sub-standard communication in the palliative phase of illness. Due to the importance of good communication in patient-centred end-of-life care, it is essential to understand the factors which influence older patients' communication with physicians. This study examines older patients' attitudes towards, and experiences of, patient-physician end-of-life (EoL) communication in three European countries. METHODS: A secondary analysis of interviews from British, Dutch and Belgian patients over the age of 60 with a progressive terminal illness was conducted. Cross-cutting themes were identified using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Themes from 30 interviews (Male n = 20, Median age 78.5) included: confidence and trust; disclosure and awareness; and participation in decision-making. Confidence and trust were reinforced by physicians' availability, time and genuine attention and hindered by misdiagnoses and poor communication style. Most participants preferred full disclosure, though some remained deliberately ill-informed to avoid distress. Patients expressed a variety of preferences for and experiences of involvement in medical EoL decision-making and a few complained that information was only provided about the physician's preferred treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of experiences and attitudes regarding disclosure and participation in decision-making were reported from each country, suggesting that communication preferences are highly individual. It is important that physicians are sensitive to this diversity and avoid stereotyping. In regard to communication style, physicians are advised to provide clear explanations, avoid jargon, and continually check understanding. Both the 'informed' and the 'shared' patient-physician decision-making models assume patients make rational choices based on a clear understanding of treatment options. This idealized situation was often not reflected in patients' experiences.",2012,10.1186/1472-684X-11-24,11,NA,24,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2012/11/27/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mo_2012_Pallmedi,JOUR,Is patient autonomy a critical determinant of quality of life in Korea? End-of-life decision making from the perspective of the patient,"Mo, Ha Na and Shin, Dong Wook and Woo, Jae Ha and Choi, Jin Young and Kang, Jina and Baik, Young Ji and Huh, Yu Rae and Won, Joo Hee and Park, Myung Hee and Cho, Sang Hee",Palliative medicine,"PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the current practice of the involvement in decision making from the perspectives of terminal cancer patients, and to explore its possible associations with quality of life and quality of death in Korea. METHODS: A multi-center, cross-sectional survey was performed on 93 terminal cancer patients. The questionnaire solicited their opinions regarding participation in treatment decision making, as well as quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for Palliative Care) and quality of death (Good Death Inventory-Patient Version). RESULTS: A total of 78.5% of the patients had awareness of their terminal status, while 21.5% did not; 42.4% stated that they knew their condition and shared the decision-making responsibility with the medical staff and their family, while 21.7% made decisions on their own, and 35.9% left the decision-making responsibility to others. Patients who were aware of their illness and who actively participated in the decision making did not score higher than others on outcome measures of quality of life and quality of death. Moreover, the former even showed lower scores in some domains, including the 'physical and psychological comfort' (4.99 versus 5.61, p = 0.03), 'environmental comfort' (5.51 versus 6.04, p = 0.08), and 'emotional functioning' (55.70 versus 71.01, p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: in Korea, patient autonomy is not a universally accepted value from the perspectives of terminal cancer patients, nor is patient involvement in decision making always conducive to high quality of life or quality of death.

AIM: To assess the effectiveness of an online training resource designed to enhance medical students' ability to recognise dying. DESIGN: Online multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial (NCT03360812). The training resource for the intervention group was developed from a group of expert palliative care doctors' weightings of various signs/symptoms to recognise dying. The control group received no training. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were senior UK medical students. They reviewed 92 patient summaries and provided a probability of death within 72 hours (0% certain survival - 100% certain death) pre, post, and 2 weeks after the training. Primary outcome: (1) Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) score between participants' and the experts' scores, immediately post intervention. Secondary outcomes: (2) weight attributed to each factor, (3) learning effect and (4) level of expertise (Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau (CWS)). RESULTS: Out of 168 participants, 135 completed the trial (80%); 66 received the intervention (49%). After using the training resource, the intervention group had better agreement with the experts in their survival estimates (<ce><b4>(MAD) = -3.43, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.34, p = <0.001) and weighting of clinical factors.

Professional guidelines emphasize that the decision to initiate continuous sedation should be made in accordance with the wishes of the dying person and be preceded by their consent. AIM: To describe the decision-making process preceding continuous sedation until death with particular attention to the involvement of the person who is dying. DESIGN: Qualitative case studies using interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Interviews with 26 physicians, 30 nurses and 24 relatives caring for 24 patients with cancer who received continuous sedation until death in Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. RESULTS: We distinguished four stages of decision-making: initiation, information exchange, deliberation and the decision to start continuous sedation until death. There was wide variation in the role the patient had in the decision-making process. At one end of the spectrum (mostly in the United Kingdom), the physician discussed the possible use of sedation with the patient, but took the decision themselves. At the other end (mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands), the patient initiated the conversation and the physician's role was largely limited to evaluating if and when the medical criteria were met. CONCLUSION: Decision-making about continuous sedation until death goes through four stages and the involvement of the patient in the decision-making varies. Acknowledging the potential sensitivity of raising the issue of end-of-life sedation, we recommend building into clinical practice regular opportunities to discuss the goals and preferences of the person who is dying for their future medical treatment and care.",2018,10.1177/0269216318770342,32,7,1198-1207,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and qualitative research and United Kingdom and Patient participation and patient-centred care and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Netherlands and Belgium and *Decision Making and Patient Participation/*psychology and Neoplasms/*therapy and Family/psychology and Conscious Sedation/*psychology and continuous sedation until death and Palliative Care/*methods/psychology and palliative sedation and Terminal Care/*methods/psychology",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

They also felt more confident and motivated to widely apply ethical reflections and reasonings in their daily practice. CONCLUSION: The participants appreciated the innovative structure of the training, especially regarding the integration of the theoretical-interactive and practical parts. However, they recommended increasing the number of concrete occasions for ethical supervision and practical application of what they learned during the programme. The training programme also has some potential practical implications: the development of advanced ethical skills within a hospital-based PC team may improve the quality of life of the patients and their families.

In care institutions, caregivers and family are concerned by treatment decision-making for an acute life threatening complication occurring in Alzheimer patients at the end of life. How should the best treatment pathway be decided: to treat or not to treat? Which arguments are used for decision-making? These are mainly ethical questions which are currently difficult to express and investigate. METHODS/DESIGN: Cross sectional multicentre study of clinical cases involving 67 health centres (university hospitals, general hospitals, local hospitals and homes for the elderly) in the east of France. The method was based on the ""card sorting"" technique, with a set of 36 cards, each labelled with a different item relating to arguments for treatment decision-making. For each clinical case, medical staff and carers expressed in a meeting the pieces of information which they believed had been taken into account in the decision. Each participant received a card game, selected fewer than ten and ranked them according to the importance they attached to each one. All selected cards were then put on the table anonymously for participants, respecting the order of importance of the cards in each pile. Lastly, all games were photographed together in order to analyse occurrence and order frequencies. The cards were then classified on the table by frequency to open the discussion. Discussion time, which was conducted by the head carer of the department, concerned the clinical situation of the patient based on the shared responses. DISCUSSION: During team meetings, the ""card sorting"" method was quickly adopted by professionals as a tool to assist with discussion beyond the context of the study. The participants were not compelled to mention their feelings in relation to a case, and it is significant that the anonymity which we tried to maintain so that each person felt ""listened to"" without value judgement was very often discarded by the individuals themselves.",2011,10.1186/1472-684X-10-4,10,NA,4,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2011/03/03/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such decisions must often be made in complex, clinical situations. AIM: To explore the content of medical records of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer with specific emphasis on doctors' notes about decisions on palliative systemic treatment. DESIGN: Medical record review (2009-2012) of 147 cancer patients containing 276 notes about palliative systemic treatment. We described the proportion of notes/medical records containing pre-specified items relevant to palliative systemic treatment. We selected patients using the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry. SETTING: Hospital based. RESULTS: About 75% of all notes reported doctors' considerations to start/continue palliative systemic treatment, including information about the prognosis (47%), possible survival gain (22%), patients' wish for palliative systemic treatment (33%), impact on quality of life (8%), and patient's age (3%). Comorbidity (82%), smoking status (78%) and drinking behaviour (63%) were more often documented than patients' performance status (16%). Conversations with the patient/family about palliative systemic treatment were reported in 49% of all notes. Response measurements and dose adaptations were documented in 75% and 71% of patients who received palliative systemic treatment respectively. CONCLUSION: Medical records provide insight into the decision-making process about palliative systemic treatment. The content and detail of doctors' notes, however, widely varies especially concerning their palliative systemic treatment considerations.

However, evidence on sedation practices by physician specialty is scarce. AIMS: To compare and contrast physician-reported practices on continuous deep sedation until death between general practitioners and medical specialists. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: A secondary analysis drawing upon data from a large-scale, population-based, retrospective survey among physicians in Flanders, Belgium in 2007. Symptom prevalence and characteristics of sedation (drugs used, artificial nutrition and hydration administered, intentions, and decision-making) were measured. RESULTS: Response rate was 58.4%. The frequency of continuous deep sedation until death among all deaths was 11.3% for general practitioners and 18.4% for medical specialists. General practitioners reported significantly higher rates of severity and mean intensity of pain, delirium, dyspnea, and nausea in the last 24 h of life for sedated patients and a higher number of severe symptoms than medical specialists. No differences were found between groups in the drugs used, except in propofol, reported only by medical specialists (in 15.8% of all cases). Artificial nutrition and hydration was withheld or withdrawn in 97.2% of general practitioner and 36.2% of medical specialist cases. Explicit life-shortening intentions were reported by both groups (for 3%-4% of all cases). Continuous deep sedation until death was initiated without consent or request of either the patient or the family in 27.9% (medical specialists) and 4.7% (general practitioners) of the cases reported. CONCLUSION: Considerable variation, often largely deviating from professional guidelines, was observed in physician-reported performance and decision-making, highlighting the importance of providing clearer guidance on the specific needs of the context in which continuous deep sedation until death is to be performed.",2014,10.1177/0269216314530768,28,6,491-500,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,decision-making and clinical practice and end-of-life care and general practitioners and Continuous deep sedation until death and medical specialists,NA,NA,2014/06//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a scarcity of robust data from Germany. Therefore, in this paper, we report results of a survey among German physicians with a focus on frequencies, aspects of decision making and determinants of limiting treatment with expected or intended shortening of life. METHODS: Postal survey among a random sample of physicians working in the area of five German state chambers of physicians using a modified version of the questionnaire of the EURELD Consortium. Information requested referred to the patients who died most recently within the last 12 months. Logistic regression was performed to analyse associations between characteristics of physicians and patients regarding limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening of life. RESULTS: As reported elsewhere, 734 physicians responded (response rate 36.9%) and of these, 174 (43.2%) reported a withholding and 144 (35.7%) a withdrawal of treatment. Eighty one physicians estimated that there was at least some shortening of life as a consequence. In 25.9% of these cases hastening death had been discussed with the patient at the time or immediately prior to this action. Types of treatment most frequently limited was artificial nutrition (n = 35). Bivariate analysis indicates that limitation of treatment with possible or intended shortening of life for patients aged > 75 years is performed significantly more often (p = 0.007, OR 1.848). There was significantly less limitation of treatment in patients who died from cancer compared to patients with other causes of death (p = 0.01, OR 0.486). There was no significant statistical association with physicians' religion, palliative care qualification or frequencies of limiting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to recent research from other European countries, limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening of life is frequently performed amongst the investigated sample. The role of clinical and non-medical aspects possibly relevant for physicians' decision about withholding or withdrawal of treatment with possible or intended shortening of life and reasons for non-involvement of patients should be explored in more detail by means of mixed method and interdisciplinary empirical-ethical analysis.",2017,10.1186/s12904-016-0176-6,16,1,3,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Life Expectancy and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude of Health Personnel and Germany and Ethics, Medical and *Patient Participation and Medical ethics and Survey and End-of-life care and Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Withholding Treatment/ethics/statistics & numerical data and Cross-sectional study and Limiting treatment and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/ethics/statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/ethics/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2017/01/17/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Francke, Anneke L. and Hertogh, Cees M. P. M.",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making in the acute phase after a severe stroke is complex and may involve life-and-death decisions. Apart from the medical condition and prognosis, quality of life and the deliberation of palliative care should be part of the decision-making process. Relatives play an important role by informing physicians about the patient's values and preferences. However, little is known about how the patients' relatives experience the decision-making process. AIM: To elicit the perspective of relatives of severe stroke patients with regard to the decision-making process in the acute phase in order to understand how they participate in treatment decisions. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative interview approach guided by the principles of grounded theory. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: Relatives of severe stroke patients (n = 15) were interviewed about their experiences in the decision-making process in the acute phase. RESULTS: Four categories reflecting relatives' experiences were identified: (1) making decisions under time pressure, (2) the feeling of 'who am I' to decide, (3) reluctance in saying 'let her die' and (4) coping with unexpected changes. Following the treatment proposal of the physician was found to be the prevailing tendency of relatives in the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the latent world of experiences of relatives that influence the decision-making process may help physicians and other health-care providers to better involve relatives in decision-making and enhance the care, including palliative care, for patients with severe stroke in line with their values and preferences.

Riedl_2020_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Development and testing of an informative guide about palliative care for family caregivers of people with advanced dementia,"Riedl, Lina and Bertok, Manuela and Hartmann, Julia and Fischer, Julia and Rossmeier, Carola and Dinkel, Andreas and Ortner, Marion and Diehl-Schmid, Janine",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Since people with advanced dementia are usually not able to make complex decisions, it is usually the family caregivers, as proxies, who have to decide on treatments and their termination. However, these decisions are difficult for the caregivers to make, as they are often inadequately informed and cannot properly assess the consequences; moreover, they are concerned about harming the sick person. We aimed to first develop an informative booklet about palliative care issues for caregivers of people with advanced dementia. Secondly, we aimed to investigate a change in family caregivers' knowledge regarding palliative care issues and caregivers' involvement in medical and care decisions before and after studying this booklet. METHODS: A first version of the booklet was drafted by an experienced psychiatrist and palliative care specialist based on existing booklets and guidelines; necessary cultural adaptions were taken into consideration. A nominal group process was conducted to develop the informative guide. In order to investigate the acceptance of the booklet and the possibility to implement it, 38 patient-caregiver dyads were recruited, and caregivers were interviewed both before receiving the booklet and after 3 months of receiving the booklet. RESULTS: Experts from various disciplines collaborated on a German booklet for family caregivers of people with advanced dementia as an information aid regarding issues of palliative care. The subsequent test showed that all caregivers had experienced a personal benefit from the booklet. Caregivers had a significant gain of knowledge after provision of the booklet. A large proportion of caregivers who had not previously considered and/or discussed medical topics reported that they had done so within 3 months after obtaining the booklet, or planned to do so in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: The caregivers valued the comprehensible, concise and well-structured information guide on palliative care issues in advanced dementia. They agreed it increases knowledge and prompts decision making and therefore should be developed in many languages and disseminated among family caregivers of people with dementia.

All consultants (N = 119), nurse key workers (N = 36) and specialist registrars (N = 44) working in an acute hospital in the north-east of England were asked to complete a postal questionnaire. In all, 65% of consultants, 67% of nurse key workers and 41% of specialist registrars responded. Results showed that consultants' religion and belief systems differed from those of nurses and the population they served. Consultants and nurses had statistically significant differences in their attitudes to common end of life decisions with consultants more likely to continue hydration and not withdraw treatment. Nurses were more sympathetic to the idea of physician-assisted suicide for unbearable suffering. This study shows the variability in belief system and attitudes to end of life decision making both within and between clinical groups.

Ajayi_2019_Joofpame,JOUR,Feasibility and Effectiveness of a Mnemonic Approach to Teach Residents How to Assess Goals of Care,"Ajayi, Toluwalase A. and Shaw, David and Edmonds, Kyle P.",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: Shared decision making is a collaborative process that allows patients, or their surrogates, and clinicians to make health care decisions together. There is an imperative to teach young physicians early in their training the importance of engaging in a shared decision-making process to define overall goals of care (GOC). The PERSON mnemonic proposes a structured format that allows providers to evaluate GOC across the spectrum of serious illnesses, outside of breaking bad news or end-of-life planning. Objectives: This study evaluated the utility of the PERSON mnemonic in training residents to have GOC with their patients, and investigated if these skills translated to the bedside with real patient encounters. Methods: First-year residents were divided into groups to participate in an in-depth education session. A pre-/postbaseline survey was administered immediately after the education intervention and approximately seven months later to assess retention and utility. Results: Thirty first-year residents were eligible for this study; 30 attended the educational sessions and completed the immediate baseline pre-/postsurvey and the seven-month follow-up survey, resulting in 100% retention rate throughout study. Residents found sustained utility in the mnemonic. It was significantly successful in increasing the knowledge and confidence level in exploring GOC. Patient-centered outcomes could not be analyzed due to low response rates and limited granularity of hospital-level data. Conclusion: The PERSON mnemonic is a feasible and useful format for teaching residents how to have a GOC discussion.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2018.0509,22,6,696-701,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"communication and Curriculum and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires and Feasibility Studies and Patient Participation/*psychology and Students, Medical/*psychology and Clinical Competence/*standards and *Decision Making, Shared and medical education and goals of care and palliative and serious illness and Patient Care Planning/*standards and graduate medical education and Education, Medical, Graduate/*organization & administration and Internship and Residency/*standards",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Radionova_2020_BMCpalcar,JOUR,The views of physicians and nurses on the potentials of an electronic assessment system for recognizing the needs of patients in palliative care,"Radionova, Natalia and Becker, Gerhild and Mayer-Steinacker, Regine and Gencer, Deniz and Rieger, Monika A. and Preiser, Christine",BMC palliative care,"OBJECTIVES: Patients in oncological and palliative care (PC) often have complex needs, which require a comprehensive treatment approach. The assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been shown to improve identification of patient needs and foster adjustment of treatment. This study explores occupational routines, attitudes and expectations of physicians and nurses with regards to a planned electronic assessment system of PROs. METHODS: Ten physicians and nine nurses from various PC settings in Southern Germany were interviewed. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The interviewees were sceptical about the quality of data generated through a patient self-assessment system. They criticised the rigidity of the electronic assessment questionnaire, which the interviewees noted may not fit the profile of all palliative patients. They feared the loss of personal contact between medical staff and patients and favoured in-person conversation and on-site observations on site over the potential system. Interviewees saw potential in being able to discover unseen needs from some patients. Interviewees evaluated the system positively in the case that the system served to broadly orient care plans without affecting or reducing the patient-caregiver relationship. CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of the results touch upon the symbolic acceptance of the suggested system, which stands for an increasing standardisation and technisation of medicine where interpersonal contact and the professional expertise are marginalized. The study results can provide insight for processes and communication in the run-up to and during the implementation of electronic assessment systems.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00554-9,19,1,45,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Germany and user acceptance and Interviews as Topic/methods and Machine Learning/*standards and Health Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Electronic symptom assessment and Needs Assessment/*standards/trends and Nurses/psychology/statistics & numerical data and Palliative Care/*methods/standards/trends and Physicians/psychology/statistics & numerical data and qualitative research. and symptoms & symptom management,NA,NA,2020/04/04/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vitale_2019_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Medical staff opposition to a deep and continuous palliative sedation request under Claeys-Leonetti law,"Vitale, Claire and de Nonneville, Alexandre and Fichaux, Marie and Salas, Sebastien",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: For the year 2018, the French government plans a revision of bioethics laws, including certainly the recent Claeys-Leonetti law introducing the right to deep and continuous sedation at the request of palliative patients and prohibiting euthanasia for end-of-life patients. Because there is no published data on medical staff opposition to a deep and continuous palliative sedation request under Claeys-Leonetti law, we believe this report may give insight into physicians' decision making, into the role of criteria for prudent practice, and thus contribute to the bioethical debate. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 70-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal region, who categorically refused any treatment since one year and asked for deep and continuous palliative sedation until death after attempting suicide. The patient's request was examined and denied by palliative multidisciplinary board, in accordance with by the French Oncology Coordination Centre guidelines. This situation did not fulfil the criteria requested by Claeys-Leonetti law. CONCLUSIONS: As highlighted by the present case-report, patient's expectation regarding palliative sedation can be ambivalent with properly so called euthanasia or assisted suicide. This ambivalent perception was part of the controversy surrounding the parliamentary debate, which is still relevant. This case report supports that deep and continuous sedation under Claeys-Leonetti law need to meet specific criteria defined by the law and documented in the medical files as a safeguard against inappropriate practice. In fact, one of the shortcomings of the current arrangements of Claeys-Leonetti law is a lack of objective medical-based criteria. So it is necessary that scientific peer-reviews papers be published quickly in order to deepen the bioethical debate on the end of life.",2019,10.1186/s12904-018-0384-3,18,1,2,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Male and Aged and Palliative care and France and Physicians/psychology and End-of-life and Bioethics/*trends and Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications and Claeys-Leonetti and Deep Sedation/methods/*standards and Medical staff opposition and Palliative Care/*legislation & jurisprudence/methods and Sedation",NA,NA,2019/01/08/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hov_2020_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Negotiating the turning point in the transition from curative to palliative treatment: a linguistic analysis of medical records of dying patients,"Hov, Laila and Synnes, Oddgeir and Aarseth, Guri",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Many deaths in Norway occur in medical wards organized to provide curative treatment. Still, medical departments are obliged to meet the needs of patients at the end of life. Here, we analyse the electronic patient record regarding documentation of the transition from curative to palliative care (i.e. the 'turning point'). Considering the consequences of these decisions for patients, they have received surprisingly little attention from researchers. This study aims to investigate how the patient record denotes reasons for the shift from curative treatment to palliation and how texts involve voices of the patient and their families. METHODS: The study comprised excerpts from electronic patient records retrieved from medical wards in three urban hospitals in Norway. We executed a retrospective analysis of anonymized extracts from 16 electronic patient records, searching for documentation on the transition from curative to palliative care. RESULTS: In the development of the turning point, the texts usually shift from statements about the patient's clinical status and technical findings to displaying uncertainty and openness to negotiation with different textual voices. This shift may represent a need to align or harmonize the attitudes of colleagues, family, and patient towards the turning-point decision. The patient's voice is mostly absent or reported only briefly when, in their notes, nurses gave an account of the patient's opinion. None of the physicians' notes provided a detailed account of patient attitudes, wishes, and experiences. CONCLUSION: In this article, we have analysed textual representations of patient transitions from curative to end-of-life care. The 'reality' behind the text has not been our concern. As the only documentation left, the patient record is an adequate basis for considering how patients are estimated and cared for in their last days of life.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00602-4,19,1,91,eng,1472-684X,Medical records and Hospitals and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Decision Making and Palliative care and Norway and Attitude of Health Personnel and Dying patients and Linguistic analysis and Linguistics/methods and Terminal Care/*methods/trends and Transitional Care/*classification,NA,NA,2020/06/26/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: the aim of our study was to identify issues and considerations in end-of-life decision making, and needs for more evidence among palliative care experts, across countries and professions. PARTICIPANTS: 90 palliative care experts from nine countries participated in a modified Delphi study. Participants were asked to identify important issues and considerations in end-of-life decision making and to rate the need for more evidence. RESULTS: experts mentioned 219 issues in end-of-life decision making related to the medical domain, 122 issues related to the patient wishes and 92 related to relatives' wishes, regardless of profession or country (p > 0.05). In accordance, more than 90% of the experts rated the comfort and wishes of the patient and the potential futility of treatment as important considerations in end-of-life decision making, although some variation was present. When asked about issues that are in need of more evidence, 87% mentioned appropriate indications for using sedatives and effects of artificial hydration at the end of life. A total of 83% mentioned adequate communication approaches.

Martins.Pereira_2018_Joofpame,JOUR,End-of-Life Decision Making in Palliative Care and Recommendations of the Council of Europe: Qualitative Secondary Analysis of Interviews and Observation Field Notes,"Martins Pereira, Sandra and Fradique, Emilia and Hernandez-Marrero, Pablo",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: End-of-life decisions (ELDs) are embedded in clinical, sociocultural, political, economic, and ethical concerns. In 2014, the Council of Europe (CoE) through its Committee on Bioethics launched the ""Guide on the decision-making process regarding medical treatment in end-of-life situations,"" aiming at improving decision-making processes and empowering professionals in making ELDs. OBJECTIVE: To analyze if end-of-life decision making in palliative care (PC) is consistent with this Guide and to identify if disputed/controversial issues are part of current ELDs. DESIGN: Qualitative secondary analysis. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Four qualitative datasets, including 44 interviews and 9 team observation field notes from previous studies with PC teams/professionals in Portugal. MEASUREMENTS: An analysis grid based on the abovementioned guide was created considering three dimensions: ethical and legal frameworks, decision-making process, and disputed/controversial issues. RESULTS: The majority of the professionals considered the ethical principle of autonomy paramount in end-of-life decision making. Justice and beneficence/nonmaleficence were also valued. Although not mentioned in the Guide, the professionals also considered other ethical principles when making ELDs, namely, responsibility, integrity, and dignity. Most of the interviewees and field notes referred to the collective interprofessional dimension of the decision-making process. Palliative sedation and the wish to hasten death were the most mentioned disputed/controversial issues. The nature, limitations, and benefits of qualitative secondary analysis are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life decision-making processes made by Portuguese PC teams seem to be consistent with the guidelines of the CoE. Further research is needed about disputed/controversial issues and the actual use, effectiveness, and impact of ethical guidelines for end-of-life decision making on professionals' empowerment and for all parties involved.",2018,10.1089/jpm.2017.0403,21,5,604-615,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and ethics and decision making and Attitude of Health Personnel and Ethics, Medical and Portugal and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Decision Making/*ethics and Health Personnel/*psychology and palliative care and advance directives and end of life and palliative sedation and ethical principles and qualitative secondary analysis and ethical guidelines and Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing/*ethics/*standards and Terminal Care/*ethics/*standards and wish to hasten death",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We explored medical record documentation about patients who received inappropriate critical care and those who received appropriate critical care to examine factors associated with the provision of inappropriate treatment. DESIGN: Medical records were abstracted from 123 patients who were assessed as receiving inappropriate treatment and 66 patients who were assessed as receiving appropriate treatment but died within six months of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used mixed methods combining qualitative analysis of medical record documentation with multivariable analysis to examine the relationship between patient and communication factors and the receipt of inappropriate treatment, and present these within a conceptual model. SETTING: One academic health system. RESULTS: Medical records revealed 21 themes pertaining to prognosis and factors influencing treatment aggressiveness. Four themes were independently associated with patients receiving inappropriate treatment according to physicians. When decision making was not guided by physicians (odds ratio [OR] 3.76, confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21-11.70) or was delayed by patient/family (OR 4.52, 95% CI 1.69-12.04), patients were more likely to receive inappropriate treatment. Documented communication about goals of care (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.84) and patient's preferences driving decision making (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.27) were associated with lower odds of receiving inappropriate treatment.

METHODS: A 15-year retrospective study of children who died after life-support limitation was initiated in a pediatric intensive care unit. Patients were divided into two groups, pre- and post-palliative care unit development. Epidemiological and clinical data, the decision-making process, and the approach were analyzed. Data was obtained from patient medical records. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five patients were included. The main reason for admission was respiratory failure (86/175). A previous pathology was present in 152 patients (61/152 were neurological issues). The medical team and family participated together in the decision-making in 145 cases (82.8%). The family made the request in 10 cases (9 vs. 1, p = 0.019). Withdrawal was the main life-support limitation (113/175), followed by withholding life-sustaining treatments (37/175). Withdrawal was more frequent in the post-palliative group (57.4% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.031). In absolute numbers, respiratory support was the main type of support withdrawn. CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of life-support limitation was the unfavourable evolution of the underlying pathology. Families were involved in the decision-making process in a high percentage of the cases. The development of the Palliative Care Unit changed life-support limitation in our unit, with differences detected in the type of patient and in the strategy used.

A qualitative descriptive study,"Weibull, Anna and Olesen, Frede and Neergaard, Mette Asbjoern",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Spouses' involvement in palliative care is often a prerequisite for home death, but it is unclear whether active involvement of the spouse, e.g. administering and being in charge of oral or subcutaneous medication or taking care of the patient's personal hygiene, could be harmful or have negative effects on the spouse's experience of the palliative course of disease. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of bereaved spouses' active involvement in medical and physical care on their experience of the palliative course of disease. METHODS: The study was a qualitative, descriptive study based on semi-structured individual interviews with seven bereaved spouses. RESULTS: Four main categories were found: Degree of involvement, Positive and Negative impact and Prerequisites. The prerequisites found for a positive outcome were Safety (24-hour back-up), Confidence (Professionals' confidence in the spouses' abilities) and Dialog (Spouses' influence on decision-making and being asked). CONCLUSION: The results from this study identified important issues whenever spouses take an active part in medical treatment and physical care of critically ill patients in palliative care. The results question the previous research that active involvement of family care givers could be harmful and add preconditions to a positive outcome.

AIM: To describe decision-making processes that influence transitions in care when approaching the end of life. DESIGN: Qualitative study using field observations and longitudinal semi-structured interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Field observations were undertaken in three sites: a residential care home, a medical assessment unit and a general medical unit in New Zealand. The Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool was used to identify participants with advanced and progressive illness. Patients and family members were interviewed on recruitment and 3-4 months later. Four weeks of fieldwork were conducted in each site. A total of 40 interviews were conducted: 29 initial interviews and 11 follow-up interviews. Thematic analysis was undertaken. FINDINGS: Managing risk was an important factor that influenced transitions in care. Patients and health care staff held different perspectives on how such risks were managed. At home, patients tolerated increasing risk and used specific support measures to manage often escalating health and social problems. In contrast, decisions about discharge in hospital were driven by hospital staff who were risk-adverse. Availability of community and carer services supported risk management while a perceived need for early discharge decision making in hospital and making 'safe' discharge options informed hospital discharge decisions. CONCLUSION: While managing risk is an important factor during care transitions, patients should be able to make choices on how to live with risk at the end of life.

Design: Prospective Cohort Study. Setting/Subjects: For older patients receiving HMC from four different primary care clinics in Japan from January 2016 to June 2017, we studied the family member with the main potential for surrogate decision making. Measurements: At the baseline, surrogates filled out a baseline questionnaire on their characteristics and decision readiness, while the attending doctors provided information about the patients' characteristics. Patient-and-surrogate pairs were tracked for up to six months after the baseline or for three months in the case of death, hospitalization, or admittance to a nursing home. After this tracking, surrogates filled out a follow-up questionnaire on their decision-making experiences, including decisional conflict. Results: Of the original 159 patient-and-surrogate pairs, 121 (76.1%) responded to the follow-up questionnaire. During the follow-up period, 32 patients (26.4% of the patients followed up) died and 69 (57.0%) experienced decision making. Among surrogates who made decisions, the mean score of decisional conflict was 36.2 (standard deviation 14.7), and 43.5% were above the threshold relating to decision delay. Anticipatory guidance and discussion on the patient's care goals at the beginning of HMC were the two variables significantly associated with less decisional conflict of surrogates.

Bekkema_2015_BMCpalcar,JOUR,"'From activating towards caring': shifts in care approaches at the end of life of people with intellectual disabilities; a qualitative study of the perspectives of relatives, care-staff and physicians","Bekkema, Nienke and de Veer, Anke J. E. and Hertogh, Cees M. P. M. and Francke, Anneke L.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Professionals and relatives increasingly have to deal with people with intellectual disabilities (ID) who are in need of end-of-life care. This is a specific type of care that may require a different approach to the focus on participation that currently characterizes the care for people with ID. This paper describes the shifts in care approaches and attitudes that relatives and professionals perceive as the death of a person with ID approaches, as well as the values underlying these shifts. METHODS: A qualitative design was used to reconstruct the cases of twelve recently deceased people with ID. Relatives and professionals who were closest to the person at the end of their life were interviewed. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data were analyzed inductively, using elements of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five shifts were found: 1) adapting to a new strategy of comforting care, taking over tasks and symptom relief, 2) interweaving of emotional and professional involvement, 3) stronger reliance on the joint interpretation of signals expressing distress and pain, 4) magnified feeling of responsibility in medical decisions, 5) intensified caring relationship between 'two families': relatives and care staff. Six relational values were behind these shifts: 'being there' for the person with ID, 'being responsive' to the person's needs, 'reflection' on their own emotions and caring relationships, 'attentiveness' to the ID person's wishes and expressions of distress, 'responsibility' for taking joint decisions in the best interests of the person, and 'openness to cooperation and sharing' the care with others. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life care for people with ID involves curtailing expectations of participation and skill acquirement, and an increase in teamwork featuring intensified comforting care, symptom management and medical decision making. Three caring relationships need to be fostered: the relationship with the person with ID, relationships among professionals and the relationship between relatives and professionals. ID care services should invest particularly in the emotional support and expertise level of care staff, and in the collaboration between relatives and professionals.",2015,10.1186/s12904-015-0030-2,14,NA,33,eng,1472-684X,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cooperative Behavior and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Physicians/*psychology and Caregivers/*psychology and Family/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology and Empathy and Professional-Family Relations and Intellectual Disability/*psychology and Stress, Psychological/psychology",NA,NA,2015/07/25/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aims were to develop and obtain face and content validity for a self-administered questionnaire on end-of-life care provision and medical decision-making for use in population-based surveys. METHODS: Modelled on validated questionnaires from research in developed countries, our questionnaire was adapted to the cultural sensitivity and medico-legal context of Trinidad and Tobago. Two sets of semi-structured face-to-face cognitive interviews were done with a sample of physicians, sampling was purposive. Phase 1 assessed interpretation of the questions, terminology and content of the questionnaire. Phase 2 was tested on a heterogeneous group of physicians to identify and fix problematic questions or recurring issues. Adjustments were made incrementally and re-tested in successive interviews. RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed nationwide. Adaptations to questionnaires used in developed countries included: addition of a definition of palliative care, change of sensitive words like expedited to influenced, adjustments to question formulations, follow-up questions and answer options on medications used were added, the sequence, title and layout were changed and instructions for completion were included at the beginning of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: A new instrument for assessing and documenting end-of-life care and circumstances of dying in a small, resource-poor Caribbean country was developed and validated, and can be readily used as a mortality follow-back instrument.

Though current research indicates that healthcare professionals' involvement in such decisions is associated with emotional stress, little is known about sedation-related emotional burden. This study aims to systematically review the evidence on the impact of the inpatient practice of continuous deep sedation until death on healthcare professionals' emotional well-being. METHODS: A systematic review of literature published between January 1990 and October 2016 was performed following a predefined protocol. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched using search terms within ""end-of-life care"", ""sedation"", and ""emotional well-being"". Dissertations and reference lists were screened by hand. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We abstracted measures of psychological outcomes, which were related to the practice of continuous deep sedation until death, including emotional well-being, stress and exhaustion. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of evidence. RESULTS: Three studies remained out of 528 publications identified. A total of 3'900 healthcare professionals (82% nurses, 18% physicians) from Japan (n = 3384) and the Netherlands (n = 16) were included. The prevalence of sedation-related burden in nurses varied from 11 to 26%, depending on outcome measure. Physicians showed medium levels of emotional exhaustion and low levels of depersonalization. Common clinical concerns contributing to professionals' burden were diagnosing refractory symptoms and sedation in the context of possibly life-shortening decisions. Non-clinical challenges included conflicting wishes between patients and families, disagreements within the care team, and insufficient professionals' skills and coping. Due to the limited results and heterogeneity in outcome measure, the GRADE ratings for the quality of evidence were low. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not suggest that practicing continuous deep sedation is generally associated with lower emotional well-being of healthcare professionals. Higher emotional burden seems more likely when professionals struggled with clinical and ethical justifications for continuous deep sedation. This appeared to be in part a function of clinical experience. Further research is needed to strengthen this evidence, as it is likely that additional studies will change the current evidence base.",2017,10.1186/s12904-017-0205-0,16,1,30,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Decision Making and Well-being and Netherlands and Ethics, Medical and Stress and Health Personnel/*psychology and *Death and End-of-life care and Inpatients/psychology and Terminal care and Sedation and Physician and Deep Sedation/ethics/*psychology and Nurse and Patient Care/methods/*psychology and Stress, Psychological/*etiology/psychology",NA,NA,2017/05/08/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sterpu_2019_BMCpalcar,JOUR,A comparative study on decision and documentation of refraining from resuscitation in two medical home care units in Sweden,"Sterpu, Bogdan and Lindman, Pia and Bjorkhem-Bergman, Linda",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: A decision to refrain from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the case of cardiac arrest is recommended in terminally ill patients to avoid unnecessary suffering at time of death. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of decisions and documentation of ""do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation"" (DNACPR) in two Medical Home Care Units in Stockholm. Unit A had written guidelines about how to document CPR-decisions in the medical records, including a requirement for a decision to be taken (CPR: yes/no) while Unit B had no such requirement. METHOD: The medical records for all patients in palliative phase of their disease at the two Units were reviewed. Data was collected on documentation of decisions about CPR (yes/no), DNACPR-decisions and documentation regarding whether the patient or next-of-kin had been informed about the DNACPR-decision. RESULTS: In the two Units, 316 and 219 patients in palliative phase were identified. In Unit A 100% of the patients had a CPR-decision (yes/no) compared to 79% in Unit B (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in DNACPR-decisions between the two Units, 43 and 37%. Documentation about informing the patient regarding the decision was significantly higher in Unit A, 53% compared to 14% at Unit B (p < 0.001). Documentation about informing the next-of-kin was also significantly higher at Unit A; 42% compared to 6% at Unit B (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Less than 50% of patients in palliative phase had a decision of DNACPR in two Medical Home Care Units in Stockholm.

METHOD: This study used data from the cross-sectional Health Interview Study (HIS) 2008 that collected data from a representative sample (N = 9651) of the Belgian population. RESULTS: Of all respondents, 4.4 % had spoken to their physician about their wishes regarding medical treatment at the end of life, while 1.8 % had an advance directive on euthanasia. Factors positively associated with discussions regarding wishes for medical treatment at the end of life were being female, being older in age, having poorer health status and having more GP contacts. People older than 55 years and living in Flanders or Brussels were more likely than the youngest age categories to have an advance directive on euthanasia. CONCLUSION: Younger people, men, people living in the Walloon region of Belgium, people without a longstanding illness, chronic condition or disability and people with few GP contacts could represent a target group for education regarding advance care planning.

The tension between autonomy and paternalism is both an ethical and practical issue. Autonomy is the current gold standard approach to patient communication and has grown to the point that patient preference dictates care, even when their choices are not possible or are medically nonbeneficial. Furthermore, we have observed a trend among physicians to avoid making difficult medical decisions by hiding behind a shield of patient autonomy. Paternalism, characterized as the antithesis of autonomy, is widely dismissed as having any role in medicine. We disagree and believe that paternalism still has an important role in medical decision making.",2014,10.1089/jpm.2013.0408,17,4,415-420,eng,1557-7740,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and *Communication and *Decision Making and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Personal Autonomy and Patient Preference/*psychology and Islam and Palliative Care/*psychology and *Paternalism and Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/therapy and Liver Diseases/therapy",NA,NA,2014/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: The aim of this study is to explore how end-of-life care goals and decision-making are communicated in a geriatric inpatient rehabilitation setting. DESIGN: The design is a qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured individual and group interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted in a 154-bed facility in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, providing geriatric inpatient rehabilitation for older patients; medical, nursing and allied health clinicians, who had cared for an inpatient who died, were recruited. DATA COLLECTION: Participants were interviewed using a conversational approach, guided by an 'aide memoire'. RESULTS: A total of 19 clinicians participated in this study, with 12 interviewed individually and the remaining 7 clinicians participating in group interviews. The typical patient was described as older, frail and with complex needs. Clinicians described the challenge of identifying patients who were deteriorating towards death, with some relying on others to inform them. How patient deterioration and decision-making was communicated among the team varied. Communication with the patient/family about dying was expected but did not always occur, nor was it always documented. Some clinicians relied on documentation, such as commencement of a dying care pathway to indicate when a patient was dying. CONCLUSION: Clinicians reported difficulties recognising patient deterioration towards death. Uncertainty and inconsistent communication among clinicians about patient deterioration negatively impacted team understanding, decision-making, and patient and family communication. Further education for all members of the multidisciplinary team focusing on how to recognise and communicate impending death will aid multidisciplinary teams to provide quality end-of-life care when required.",2018,10.1177/0269216318790353,32,10,1615-1623,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,decision-making and Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Australia and rehabilitation and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Communication and *Decision Making and *Professional-Patient Relations and palliative care and end-of-life care and Terminal Care/*standards and Critical Pathways/organization & administration and geriatric and older person,NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Xafis_2015_BMCpalcar,JOUR,What information do parents need when facing end-of-life decisions for their child? A meta-synthesis of parental feedback,"Xafis, Vicki and Wilkinson, Dominic and Sullivan, Jane",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: The information needs of parents facing end-of-life decisions for their child are complex due to the wide-ranging dimensions within which such significant events unfold. While parents acknowledge that healthcare professionals are their main source of information, they also turn to a variety of additional sources of written information in an attempt to source facts, discover solutions, and find hope. Much has been written about the needs of parents faced with end-of-life decisions for their child but little is known about the written information needs such parents have. Research in the adult intensive care context has shown that written resources impact positively on the understanding of medical facts, including diagnoses and prognoses, communication between families and healthcare professionals, and the emotional wellbeing of families after their relative's death. METHODS: A meta-synthesis of predominantly empirical research pertaining to features which assist or impede parental end-of-life decisions was undertaken to provide insight and guidance in our development of written resources (short print and online comprehensive version) for parents. RESULTS: The most prominently cited needs in the literature related to numerous aspects of information provision; the quantity, quality, delivery, and timing of information and its provision impacted not only on parents' ability to make end-of-life decisions but also on their emotional wellbeing. The meta-synthesis supports the value of written materials, as these provide guidance for both parents and healthcare professionals in pertinent content areas.

However, little is known about physician communication practices in the decision making for unstable critically ill patients with known end-stage disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe communication practices of physicians making treatment decisions for unstable critically ill patients with end-stage cancer, using the framework of shared decision-making. DESIGN: Analysis of audiotaped encounters between physicians and a standardized patient, in a high-fidelity simulation scenario, to identify best practice communication behaviors. The simulation depicted a 78-year-old man with metastatic gastric cancer, life-threatening hypoxia, and stable preferences to avoid intensive care unit (ICU) admission and intubation. Blinded coders assessed the encounters for verbal communication behaviors associated with handling emotions and discussion of end-of-life goals. We calculated a score for skill at handling emotions (0-6) and at discussing end of life goals (0-16). SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven hospital-based physicians. RESULTS: Independent variables included physician demographics and communication behaviors. We used treatment decisions (ICU admission and initiation of palliation) as a proxy for accurate identification of patient preferences. Eight physicians admitted the patient to the ICU, and 16 initiated palliation. Physicians varied, but on average demonstrated low skill at handling emotions (mean, 0.7) and moderate skill at discussing end-of-life goals (mean, 7.4).

J. and van Delden, J. J. M. and van der Heide, A.",Palliative medicine,"Although guidelines restrict the use of continuous deep sedation to patients with refractory physical symptoms and a short life-expectancy, its use is not always restricted to these conditions. A focus group study of physicians was conducted to gain more insight in the arguments for and against the use of continuous deep sedation in several clinical situations. Arguments in favour of continuous deep sedation for patients with a longer life-expectancy were that the overall clinical situation is more relevant than life-expectancy alone, and that patients' wishes should be followed. Continuous deep sedation for patients with predominantly emotional/existential suffering was considered appropriate when physicians empathize with the suffering. Further, some physicians indicated that they may consider the use of sedation in the context of a euthanasia request. Arguments were that the option of continuous deep sedation is a better alternative; it may comfort some patients when their thoughts about potential future suffering become unbearable. Further, some considered continuous deep sedation as less burdening or a bother to perform. We conclude that physicians' decision-making about continuous deep sedation is characterized by balancing the interests of patients with their own feelings. Accordingly, the reasons for its use are not unambiguous and need further debate.",2009,10.1177/0269216309104074,23,5,410-417,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Humans and Female and Male and Life Expectancy and Physician's Role and Focus Groups and Ethics, Medical and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Decision Making/ethics and *Terminal Care and *Stress, Psychological and Euthanasia and *Deep Sedation",NA,NA,2009/07//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Empirical data on end-of-life decisions made by Austrian physicians barely exists. This study is the first in Austria aimed at finding out how physicians generally approach and make end-of-life therapy decisions. METHODS: The European end-of-life decisions (EURELD) questionnaire, translated and adapted by Schildmann et al., was used to conduct this cross-sectional postal survey. Questions on palliative care training, legal issues, and use of and satisfaction with palliative care were added. All Austrian specialists in hematology and oncology, a representative sample of doctors specialized in internal medicine, and a sample of general practitioners, were invited to participate in this anonymous postal survey. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-eight questionnaires (response rate: 10.4%) were evaluated. 88.3% of participants had treated a patient who had died in the previous 12 months. 23% of respondents had an additional qualification in palliative medicine. The cause of death in 53.1% of patients was cancer, and 44.8% died at home. In 86.3% of cases, pain relief and / or symptom relief had been intensified. Further treatment had been withheld by 60.0%, and an existing treatment discontinued by 49.1% of respondents. In 5 cases, the respondents had prescribed, provided or administered a drug which had resulted in death. 51.3% of physicians said they would never carry out physician-assisted suicide (PAS), while 30.3% could imagine doing so under certain conditions. 38.5% of respondents supported the current prohibition of PAS, 23.9% opposed it, and 33.2% were undecided. 52.4% of physicians felt the legal situation with respect to measures to end life prematurely was ambiguous. An additional qualification in palliative medicine had no influence on measures taken, or attitudes towards PAS. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of doctors perform symptom control in terminally ill patients. PAS is frequently requested but rarely carried out. Attending physicians felt the legal situation was ambiguous. Physicians should therefore receive training in current legislation relating to end-of-life choices and medical decisions. The data collected in this survey will help political decision-makers provide the necessary legal framework for end-of-life medical care.",2020,10.1186/s12904-019-0509-3,19,1,4,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Palliative care and Quantitative research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Austria and *Decision Making and End-of-life decisions and Physician-assisted suicide and Physicians/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology and Psychometrics/instrumentation/methods and Suicide, Assisted/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/legislation & jurisprudence/methods/*trends",NA,NA,2020/01/04/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines elaboration and preference construction. AIM: To examine the values, appraisals and preferences that patients express, as well as the oncologists' communicative behaviour that facilitates these expressions in consultations on palliative chemotherapy. DESIGN: Verbatim transcripts of audio-recorded consultations ( n = 60) were analysed in MAXqda10 software. Two independent coders identified and categorised patients' preference-related utterances and oncologists' utterances, preceding and following such expressions. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Cancer patients ( n = 41) with a median life expectancy <1 year and oncologists ( n = 13) meeting with them in either initial or evaluative follow-up consultations. RESULTS: Most frequent were patients' expressions of treatment preferences (65% of consultations), often the simple wish to have treatment. Expressions of underlying values (48%) and appraisals of treatment aspects (50%) were less common. Most preference-related utterances concerned single statements (59%); in 51% of the consultations, true dialogue was observed. Preference-related utterances were least common in follow-up consultations concerning stable disease or response. Preference-related fragments were patient-initiated (42%), oncologist-facilitated (28%) or oncologist-invited (30%). Oncologist responses likely to trigger more preference-related talk were showing empathy, checking and probe questioning. Likely to reduce space were providing information, personally agreeing and neutral responses. CONCLUSION: Elaboration and joint preference construction is not standard practice in consultations on palliative chemotherapy. Oncologists may benefit from realising this and training skills that support this key step of shared decision making. Also, repeated shared decision making throughout the course of palliative chemotherapy should be stimulated.",2017,10.1177/0269216316676010,31,7,625-633,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Decision making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Qualitative Research and patient participation and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Communication and *Decision Making and Drug Therapy/*psychology and Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use and palliative care and Patient Preference/*psychology and Palliative Care/*psychology and medical oncology and Neoplasms/*drug therapy and physician-patient relations",NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, comparing written preferences to actual end-of-life care may not capture consistency of care with preferences. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated four additional types of consistency, using prospective data on written preferences and active clinical decision making by patients and their surrogates. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data was done from a trial of an ACP intervention for patient-surrogate dyads. Forty-five patients died during the trial and comprised the sample for the analysis. Sources of data included patients' preferences in a written goals-of-care tool, medical record reviews, and two-week postbereavement interviews with surrogates to complement medical record reviews. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (53.3%) received care consistent with written preferences and 11 (24.4%) inconsistent with written preferences. The remaining 10 patients (22.2%) died suddenly with no opportunity for treatment decision making. Eleven (24.4%) were able to participate in decision making with their surrogates; of those, 9 (81.8%) received care consistent with their expressed preferences. Twenty-two patients were incapacitated and thus the surrogate made treatment decisions alone; of those, 18 (81.8%) made decisions consistent with the patient's written preference.

The patients were interviewed with a structured questionnaire every 2 months until the fourth interview and every 4 months until the sixth interview. RESULTS: At inclusion, 128 patients were interviewed at least once; 13 were interviewed 6 consecutive times. Sixty-nine percent of patients wanted family members to be involved in medical decision-making and this percentage did not change significantly over time. One third of these patients did not achieve this preference. Ninety-four percent of patients wanted family involvement if they lost competence, 23% of these preferring primary physician control over decision-making, 41% shared physician and family control, and 36% primary family control. This degree of preferred family involvement expressed when competent did not change significantly over time at population level, but did at individual level; almost half the patients changed their minds either way at some point during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with lung cancer wanted family involvement in decision-making, and almost all did so in case of future loss of competence.

Karlsson_2012_Pallmedi,JOUR,Dying cancer patients' own opinions on euthanasia: an expression of autonomy? A qualitative study,"Karlsson, Marit and Milberg, Anna and Strang, Peter",Palliative medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Deliberations on euthanasia are mostly theoretical, and often lack first-hand perspectives of the affected persons. METHOD: Sixty-six patients suffering from cancer in a palliative phase were interviewed about their perspectives of euthanasia in relation to autonomy. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis with no predetermined categories. RESULTS: The informants expressed different positions on euthanasia, ranging from support to opposition, but the majority were undecided due to the complexity of the problem. The informants' perspectives on euthanasia in relation to autonomy focused on decision making, being affected by (1) power and (2) trust. Legalization of euthanasia was perceived as either (a) increasing patient autonomy by patient empowerment, or (b) decreasing patient autonomy by increasing the medical power of the health care staff, which could be frightening. The informants experienced dependence on others, and expressed various levels of trust in others' intentions, ranging from full trust to complete mistrust. CONCLUSIONS: Dying cancer patients perceive that they cannot feel completely independent, which affects true autonomous decision making. Further, when considering legalization of euthanasia, the perspectives of patients fearing the effects of legalization should also be taken into account, not only those of patients opting for it.",2012,10.1177/0269216311404275,26,1,34-42,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Trust and Qualitative Research and Sweden and Aged, 80 and over and *Personal Autonomy and *Palliative Care and Neoplasms/*psychology and Euthanasia/*psychology",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESULTS: Participants reported different interpretations of resuscitation policy and of what do not attempt to resuscitate (DNAR) decisions meant in relation to practical care for patients. This confusion in translating policy into practice contributed to communication difficulties in initiating, documenting and implementing cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions. Participants were aware of how clinical conditions could change and reported uncertainty in determining end stage illness; they expressed fears of potential consequences of DNAR decisions for patients' care. The more disease-centred approach of doctors to patients' management, compared to nurses' more patient-centred approach, contributed to inter-professional conflict within teams. Doctors identified training needs in applying resuscitation policy and ethical principles in ;real life' and nurses identified a need for ongoing professional support, which was perceived as being less available to junior doctors. Personal relationships between staff and patients, cultural reluctance to address sensitive issues and local community expectations of relatives being involved in decisions added to policy implementation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a need for ongoing staff support and training in applying resuscitation policy to decisions for patients with end stage illness in an acute hospital. They support suggestions that reviews of local resuscitation policy and of national guidelines should be undertaken with openness and honesty regarding the goals, opportunities and difficulties involved in trying to deliver good end of life care in local settings.",2007,10.1177/0269216307077817,21,4,305-312,eng,0269-2163,"Communication and Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Nurses and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Ethics, Medical and Medical Futility and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Resuscitation Orders/ethics/*psychology and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Medical Staff, Hospital and Terminal Care/*methods and Hospitals, District and Northern Ireland",NA,NA,2007/06//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objective was to understand hospital staff perceptions of the role of acute care hospital medical doctors in end-of-life treatment intensity. In 11 purposively sampled Pennsylvania hospitals, we completed 108 audiotaped semistructured interviews with key informants involved in decision making or discharge planning. Using grounded theory, we qualitatively analysed transcripts using constant comparison to identify factors affecting end-of-life treatment decisions. A predominant theme identified was that end-of-life treatment intensity depends on the doctor. Communication with patients and families and collaboration with other care team members also were reported to vary, contributing to treatment variation. Informants attributed physician variation to individual beliefs and attitudes regarding the end-of-life (religion and culture, determination of when a patient is dying, quality-of-life determination and fear of failing) and to socialization by and interaction with the healthcare system (training, role perception, experience and response to incentives). When end-of-life treatment depends on the doctor, patient and family preferences may be neglected.

Since that time, palliative care has developed as a specialty and end-of-life communication has evolved. However, five problems in decision-making remain today: the need to discuss underlying health status with patients; the overburdening of patients and families with too many choices; lack of appreciation of the importance of symbolism in end-of-life care; confusion between cultural beliefs and scientific facts; and difficulties with making decisions because of rapid shifts by the medical team from advocating cure to comfort. Each of these issues is described.",2009,10.1089/jpm.2008.0240,12,2,121-125,eng,1557-7740,Culture and Humans and Health Status and Symbolism and Truth Disclosure and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and *Terminal Care,NA,NA,2009/02//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Maiko_2019_Joofpame,JOUR,Spiritual and Religious Coping of Medical Decision Makers for Hospitalized Older Adult Patients,"Maiko, Saneta M. and Ivy, Steven and Watson, Beth Newton and Montz, Kianna and Torke, Alexia M.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill adult patients who face medical decisions often delegate others to make important decisions. Those who are authorized to make such decisions are typically family members, friends, or legally authorized representatives, often referred to as surrogates. Making medical decisions on behalf of others produces emotional distress. Spirituality and/or religion provide significant assistance to cope with this distress. We designed this study to assess the role of surrogates' spirituality and religion (S/R) coping resources during and after making medical decisions on behalf of critically ill patients. The study's aim was to understand the role that S/R resources play in coping with the lived experiences and challenges of being a surrogate. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 46 surrogates by trained interviewers. These were audio-recorded and transcribed by research staff. Three investigators conducted a thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews. The codes from inter-rater findings were analyzed, and comparisons were made to ensure consistency. RESULTS: The majority (67%) of surrogates endorsed belief in God and a personal practice of religion. Five themes emerged in this study. Personal prayer was demonstrated as the most important coping resource among surrogates who were religious. Trusting in God to be in charge or to provide guidance was also commonly expressed. Supportive relationships from family, friends, and coworkers emerged as a coping resource for all surrogates. Religious and nonreligious surrogates endorsed coping strategies such as painting, coloring, silent reflection, music, recreation, and reading. Some surrogates also shared personal experiences that were transformative as they cared for their ill patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that surrogates use several S/R and other resources to cope with stress when making decisions for critically ill adult patients. The coping resources identified in this study may guide professional chaplains and other care providers to design a patient-based and outcome-oriented intervention to reduce surrogate stress, improve communication, increase patient and surrogate satisfaction, and increase surrogate integration in patient care. We recommend ensuring that surrogates have S/R resources actively engaged in making medical decisions. Chaplains should be involved before, during, and after medical decision making to assess and address surrogate stress. An interventional research-design project to assess the effect of spiritual care on surrogate coping before, during, and after medical decision making is also recommended.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2018.0406,22,4,385-392,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and coping and Aged, 80 and over and religion and *Decision Making and Caregivers/*psychology and Family/*psychology and medical decision making and *Adaptation, Psychological and surrogate and spirituality and Critical Illness/*psychology and *Spirituality and spiritual care",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated opinions of Dutch and Australian doctors about the use of ANH in patients with advanced dementia. We interviewed 15 Dutch doctors and 16 Australian doctors who care for patients with advanced dementia. We transcribed and analysed the interviews and held consensus meetings about the interpretation. We found that Dutch and Australian doctors use similar medical considerations when they decide about the use of ANH. In general, they are reluctant to start ANH. Disparities between the Dutch and Australian doctors are related to the process of decision-making: Dutch doctors seem to put more emphasis on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's actual situation, whereas Australian doctors are more inclined to use scientific evidence and advance directives. Furthermore, Dutch doctors take the primary responsibility themselves whereas Australian general practitioners seem to be more inclined to leave the decision to the family.

Enguidanos_2014_Pallmedi,JOUR,Family members' perceptions of inpatient palliative care consult services: a qualitative study,"Enguidanos, Susan and Housen, Patricia and Penido, Marcia and Mejia, Bill and Miller, Julie Anne",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Family members are commonly involved in end-of-life decision making and typically involved in inpatient palliative care consultations. Although much research has documented patient outcomes following inpatient palliative care consultation, little is known about family member perceptions of the consultation. AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine how inpatient palliative care consultations impacted family members' understanding of the patient's condition, knowledge of available care options, and decision-making ability. DESIGN: An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted employing individual interviews among family members of seriously ill patients, recruited purposively. Interviews were conducted in person, at the hospital, or via telephone, using a semistructured protocol. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Family members of seriously ill patients were recruited from a nonprofit, community hospital. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted among 23 family members. Four themes were identified and included: perceived qualities of the inpatient palliative care consultation, family readiness, impact on decision-making process, and focus on comfort and quality of life. While most comments reflected positive aspects of the inpatient palliative care consult, such as improved pain control and communication, and increased access to medical professionals and time to discuss patient conditions, some themes reflected a lack of adequate preparation for the inpatient palliative care consultation and readiness for discussing prognosis. CONCLUSION: Family members report discussion with the inpatient palliative care team results in improved communication and knowledge, which contributes to decision-making ability. However, palliative care consultation may be improved by developing stronger protocols for introducing palliative care and by including the attending physician in the process to preclude conflicting, inconsistent information and recommendations.",2014,10.1177/0269216313491620,28,1,42-48,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Communication and United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and decision making and qualitative research and Palliative care and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Severity of Illness Index and health communication and *Decision Making and Family/*psychology and Chronic Disease/therapy and *Professional-Family Relations and Palliative Care/*methods and Terminal Care/psychology and Conflict, Psychological and family members and Patient Care Team/standards and Referral and Consultation/*standards/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients who suffered from cancer and who had been sedated until their death in Shanghai, China. METHODS: Retrospective medical data of 244 terminally ill cancer patients including 82 sedated patients were collected. Data collected included demographic characteristics, disease-related characteristics and details of the sedation. RESULTS: In sedated cases, patients and/or caregivers gave the consent to start palliative sedation due to unmanageable symptoms. On average, sedation was performed 24.65(<c2><b1>1.78)hours before death. Agitated delirium and dyspnea were the most frequent indications for palliative sedation.

Care services should be based on empirical evidence, be sensitive to the needs of the families concerned, take into account the heterogeneity within the medical field of paediatrics, and fit into the local health care system. We need to better understand the perspectives of parents facing the death of their child in order to guide further development and evaluation of specialised paediatric palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care services. METHODS: Questionnaire survey to assess the EOL care perspectives of a Swiss population-based sample of bereaved parents who had lost a child due to a cardiac, neurological or oncological condition, or during the neonatal period in the years 2011 or 2012. The parental perspective was assessed with a newly developed and tested instrument that was structured according to six evidence-based quality domains. Responses regarding parental experiences and perceived satisfaction are described. Differences between the four diagnostic groups are analysed using a generalized estimation equation to account for the dyadic data structure. RESULTS: Of 307 eligible families, 267 could be contacted and 135 (51%) consented to participate in this questionnaire survey. Our findings show positive parental experiences of their child's EOL care and high perceived satisfaction with the care their child received. Parents of a child with cancer rated their experiences highest in most of the six quality domains and reported the highest satisfaction with care. The lowest scores were mainly reported by parents from the neurology group, with the exception of the shared decision making domain, where parents of neonates reported significantly less positive experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Although positive in general, our study results suggest some areas for improvement.

Panozzo_2020_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Communication of advance care planning decisions: a retrospective cohort study of documents in general practice,"Panozzo, Laura and Harvey, Pam and Adams, Meagan-Jane and O'Connor, Dennis and Ward, Bernadette",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Doctors, particularly general practitioners, play a significant role in assisting patients to create advance care plans. When medically indicated, these documents are important tools to promote congruence between end-of-life care and patient's personal preferences. Despite this, little is known regarding the availability of these documents in hospitals. The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of people who died in hospital without an advance care plan and how many of these had advance care planning (ACP) documents in their general practice records. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patient hospital records with manual linkage to general practice records. The large regional hospital in Victoria, Australia has a catchment population in excess of 300,000 people. The study sample was patients aged 75 years and over who died in the hospital between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017. The hospital records of these patients were examined to identify those which did not have a system alert for ACP documents on the file. Alerted ACP documents were limited to those legislated in the state of Victoria: advance care plan, Enduring Power of Attorney (Medical Treatment) or Enduring Power of Guardianship. Where no ACP document system alert was found in the hospital record, the patient's nominated general practice was consented to participate and the corresponding general practice record was examined. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 406 patients who died in hospital, 76.1% (309) did not have a system alert for any ACP document. Of the 309 hospital records without a system alert, 144 (46.7%) corresponding general practice records were examined. Of these, 14.6% included at least one ACP document, including four advance care plans, that were not available in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Unless ACP documents are consistently communicated from general practice, patient's preferences may be unknown during end-of-life care. It is important that both doctors and patients are supported to use connected electronic health records to ensure that documents are readily available to healthcare staff when they are required.",2020,10.1186/s12904-020-00613-1,19,1,108,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Cohort Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Victoria and *Decision Making, Shared and Advance care planning and Documentation/*statistics & numerical data and Advance Care Planning/*standards/statistics & numerical data and End-of-life care. and General practice. and General Practice/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data and Palliative medicine. and Terminal Care/methods/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/07/14/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Scandrett_2014_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Intervention thresholds: a conceptual frame for advance care planning choices,"Scandrett, Karen G. and Joyce, Brian and Emanuel, Linda",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) provides for decisions in the event of decisional incapacity. Determining ahead of time what a person may want is challenging and limits the utility of ACP. We present empirical evidence for a new approach to ACP: the individual's ""intervention threshold."" The intervention threshold is intuitively understood by clinicians and lay people, but has not been thoroughly described, measured, or analyzed. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods approach to address the concept of the intervention thresholds, we recruited 52 subjects from a population of chronically ill outpatients for structured telephone interviews assessing knowledge, attitudes, and prior ACP activities. Respondents were presented with 11 interventions for each of four medical scenarios. For each scenario, they were asked whether they would accept each intervention. Data was evaluated by descriptive statistics and chi-squared statistics. RESULTS: Complete data were obtained from 52 patients, mean age of 64.5, 34.6% of whom were male. Only 17.3% reported prior ACP discussion with a physician. Rates of accepting and refusing interventions varied by scenario (p < 0.0001) and intervention intensity (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that people display transitions between wanting or not wanting interventions based on scenarios.

If the patient's condition suddenly deteriorates, the emergency contact may be asked to make decisions that should instead fall to a designated surrogate decision-maker. AIMS: To describe a process used to help chronically seriously ill patients identify a surrogate during study enrollment and to describe whether these surrogates were the same as the documented emergency contacts. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study using eligibility assessment and baseline data from an efficacy trial. The parent trial tests the effects of an end-of-life communication intervention on patient and surrogate decision-maker outcomes, and thus, it was important to identify the surrogate. The study recruiter used a short battery of investigator-developed questions to help patients identify a surrogate. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients were 94 self-identified African Americans or Caucasians recruited from 18 outpatient dialysis centers, receiving dialysis for <e2><89><a5>6 months, with Charlson Comorbidity Index of <e2><89><a5>6 or 5 and hospitalized in the last 6 months. RESULTS: When first approached, only three patients had a designated and documented surrogate. The remaining 91 selected a surrogate during the surrogate identification process. Of the 94 surrogates who were named, only 60 (63.8%) were also listed in the medical record as the emergency contact.

This study aimed to identify trends in descriptions of palliative care in cancer CPGs in Japan before and after enactment of the Cancer Control Act. METHODS: Content analysis was used to count the lines in all relevant CPGs. We then compared the number of lines and the proportion of descriptions mentioning palliative care at two time points: the first survey (selection period: February to June 2007) and the second survey (selection period: February to December 2015). Descriptions from the CPGs were independently selected from the Toho University Medical Media Center and Medical Information Network Distribution Service databases, and subsequently reviewed, by two investigators. RESULTS: Descriptions were analyzed for 10 types of cancer. The proportion of descriptions in the first survey (4.4%; 933/21,344 lines) was similar to that in the second survey (4.5%; 1325/29,269 lines).

However, few studies have explored decision-making experiences of minority parents in pediatric oncology. Objective: To determine whether parental decision-making preferences and experiences vary by race/ethnicity. Design: Questionnaire-based cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Three hundred sixty five parents of children with cancer and their oncologists at two academic centers. Measurements: Parents reported on preferred and actual decision-making roles. Associations between race/ethnicity and decision-making outcomes determined by chi-squared test. Results: Most parents preferred shared decision making (235/368, 64%), whereas 23% (84/368) preferred parent-led decision making and 13% (49/368) preferred oncologist-led decision making. Parental decision-making preferences did not differ by race/ethnicity (p = 0.38, chi-squared test).

Matthew and Gramelspacher, Gregory P.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Patients in sub-Saharan Africa commonly experience pain, which often is un-assessed and undertreated. One hindrance to routine pain assessment in these settings is the lack of a single-item pain rating scale validated for the particular context. The goal of this study was to examine the face validity and cultural acceptability of two single-item pain scales, the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), in a population of patients on the medical, surgical, and pediatric wards of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kenya. METHODS: Swahili versions of the NRS and FPS-R were developed by standard translation and back-translation. Cognitive interviews were performed with 15 patients at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. Interview transcripts were analyzed on a question-by-question basis to identify major themes revealed through the cognitive interviewing process and to uncover any significant problems participants encountered with understanding and using the pain scales. RESULTS: Cognitive interview analysis demonstrated that participants had good comprehension of both the NRS and the FPS-R and showed rational decision-making processes in choosing their responses. Participants felt that both scales were easy to use. The FPS-R was preferred almost unanimously to the NRS.

Effective shared decision making in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment requires prognostic understanding, without which patients may receive treatment inconsistent with personal preferences. Objectives: To assess MBC patient and provider perspectives on the role of prognostic information in treatment decision making. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with MBC patients and community oncologists and separate focus groups involving lay navigators, nurses, and academic oncologists. Qualitative analysis utilized a content analysis approach that included a constant comparative method to generate themes. Results: Of 20 interviewed patients with MBC, 30% were African American. Academic oncologists were mostly women (60%), community oncologists were all Caucasian, and nurses were all women and 28% African American. Lay navigators were all African American and predominately women (86%). Five emergent themes were identified. (1) Most patients wanted prognostic information but differed in when they wanted to have this conversation, (2) Emotional distress and discomfort was a critical reason for not discussing prognosis, (3) Religious beliefs shaped preferences for prognostic information, (4) Health care professionals differed on prognostic information delivery timing, and (5) Providers acknowledged that an individualized approach taking into account patient values and preferences would be beneficial. Conclusion: Most MBC patients wanted prognostic information, yet varied in when they wanted this information. Understanding why patients want limited or unrestricted prognostic information can inform oncologists' efforts toward shared decision making.",2020,10.1089/jpm.2019.0457,23,7,937-943,eng,1557-7740,"qualitative analysis and Humans and Female and Decision Making and Prognosis and shared decision making and Decision Making, Shared and prognosis and *Oncologists and *Breast Neoplasms and metastatic breast cancer",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

In June 2016, Medical Assistance in Dying became legal in Canada, sparking intense debate in the palliative care community. AIM: This study aims to explore the experience of frontline palliative care providers about the impact of Medical Assistance in Dying on palliative care practice. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed palliative care physicians and nurses who practiced in settings where patients could access Medical Assistance in Dying for at least 6 months before and after its legalization. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants with diverse personal views and experiences with assisted death. Conceptual saturation was achieved after interviewing 23 palliative care providers (13 physicians and 10 nurses) in Southern Ontario. RESULTS: Themes identified included a new dying experience with assisted death; challenges with symptom control; challenges with communication; impact on palliative care providers personally and on their relationships with patients; and consumption of palliative care resources to support assisted death. CONCLUSION: Medical Assistance in Dying has had a profound impact on palliative care providers and their practice.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the decision readiness of HMC patients and their family surrogates. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING/SUBJECTS: We collected data from dyads, consisting of a HMC patient aged 65 years or older and a family member of the patient, recruited at four Japanese primary care clinics from January 2016 to November 2016. MEASUREMENTS: Surrogates completed a questionnaire on their sociodemographic and health status and their decision readiness. Primary HMC physicians provided information on their patients. RESULTS: A total of 337 dyads were screened, and 159 were included. The mean age of patients and surrogates was 86 and 64 years, respectively, and 29% of patients were cognitively impaired. Only 1.9% of the patients left written advance directives, and 32% were entrusting all decision making to the doctor or their families. Regarding the surrogate's preferred decision-making role, 21.9% of the surrogates preferred doctors to assume decision-making responsibility. A multivariate analysis revealed that no discussion of care goals (odds ratio [OR] 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-8.17) and patients having expressed their wishes verbally, including entrusting decision making to others (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.89), were associated with surrogates' preference for doctors to have decision-making responsibility.

Individual hospital microclimates must exist to perpetuate these practice variations. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a closed-ended survey based upon staff perceptions of informal norms regarding life prolongation, palliation, collaborative decision-making, and patient-doctor familiarity can identify hospital microclimates and to assess whether these norms are related to variation in end-of-life treatment intensity. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective analysis of hospital discharge data at 11 purposively sampled Pennsylvania hospitals linked to a self-administered survey of 139 administrative and clinical staff fielded during site visits in 2004; measurements included year 2000 and 2004 rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), and hemodialysis among terminal hospitalizations at each hospital; survey respondent demographics, role, experience, and perceptions of their hospital's context and norms of end-of-life decision-making and treatment. RESULTS: The purposively sampled hospitals exhibited wide variation in rates of ICU admission (38.2%-84.4%), MV (13.7%-41.4%), and hemodialysis (0%-9.2%) among terminal admissions. All 139 administered surveys were returned for a response rate of 100%. For each of 4 factors created from 19 survey items, staff responses varied more between hospitals than within hospitals (p < or = 0.03). One factor, patient-doctor familiarity, was inversely correlated with terminal ICU admission (p < 0.001) and MV (p = 0.03).

AIM: This qualitative arm of a wider study aimed to explore important issues which health-care professionals associated with decision-making to prescribe or administer anticholinergics at the end of life. DESIGN: After purposive sampling, five focus groups were conducted. Discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. SETTING: Thirty medical and nursing personnel working in inpatient and community settings from two specialist palliative care units in the United Kingdom took part in the study. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of transcripts from audiotapes revealed perceived pressures to prescribe and/or administer anticholinergics from colleagues and carers, and drugs were often prescribed or administered in order to be seen to 'do something', although the benefit in terms of therapeutic response was considered minimal. Familiarity with drug regimens and dosing was often based on personal experience. The monitoring of side effects of anticholinergics at the end of life was recognised as problematic and had little influence on prescribing and administration. There was also an indication that patients and carers in the community were more likely to receive timely verbal preparation and explanation around death rattle than those cared for in an inpatient setting.

Zenz_2015_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Palliative care professionals' willingness to perform euthanasia or physician assisted suicide,"Zenz, Julia and Tryba, Michael and Zenz, Michael",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (PAS) are highly debated upon particularly in the light of medical advancement and an aging society. Little is known about the professionals' willingness to perform these practices particularly among those engaged in the field of palliative care and pain management. Thus a study was performed among those professionals. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was handed out to all participants of a palliative care congress and a pain symposium in 2013. The questionnaire consisted of 8 questions regarding end of life decisions. Proposed patient vignettes were used. RESULTS: A total of 470 eligible questionnaires were returned, 198 by physicians, 272 by nurses. The response rate was 64 %. The majority of professionals were reluctant to perform euthanasia or PAS: 5.3 % of the respondents would be willing to perform euthanasia on a patient with a terminal illness if asked to do so. The reluctance grew in case of a patient with a non-terminal illness. The respondents were more willing to perform PAS than euthanasia. Nurses were more reluctant to take action as opposed to the physicians. The majority of the respondents would attempt to treat the patient's symptoms first before considering life-ending measures. As regards any decision making process the majority would consult with a colleague. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first German study to ask about the willingness of professionals to take action as regards euthanasia and PAS without biased phrasing. As opposed to the general acceptance that is respectively high, the actual willingness to perform life-ending measures is low. The German debate on physician assisted suicide and its possible legalization should also incorporate clarifications regarding the responsibility who should eventually perform these acts.",2015,10.1186/s12904-015-0058-3,14,NA,60,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Germany and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Quality of Life/psychology and Health Personnel/*psychology and Palliative Care/*methods/psychology and Euthanasia/*psychology/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2015/11/14/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Knapp_2014_Joofpame,JOUR,Does decisional conflict differ across race and ethnicity groups? A study of parents whose children have a life-threatening illness,"Knapp, Caprice and Sberna-Hinojosa, Melanie and Baron-Lee, Jacqueline and Curtis, Charlotte and Huang, I.-Chan",Journal of palliative medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Children with life-threatening illnesses and their families may face a myriad of medical decisions in their lifetimes. Oftentimes these complicated medical decisions cause disagreements among patients, families, and providers about what is the best course of action. Although no evidence exists, it is possible that conflict may affect subgroups of the population differently. This study aims to investigate how decisional conflict varies among racial and ethnic subgroups. SAMPLE: Two hundred sixty-six surveys were completed with parents whose children have a life-threatening illness. All children lived in Florida and were enrolled in the Medicaid program. The Decisional Conflict Scale, overall and broken down into its five distinct subscales, was used to assess parental decision-making. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses were conducted on Latino respondents. RESULTS: Our bivariate results suggest that minority parents report less Effective Decision Making (p<0.05) and report less Support in Decision Making (p<0.05) compared to white, non-Hispanic parents. For the subgroup analysis, we found that those who identify as Mexican American and Central/South American report having greater Uncertainty in Choosing Options (p<0.05) and less Values Clarity (p<0.05) as compared to Puerto Rican or Cuban Americans. Results from the multivariate analyses suggest that those whose primary language is not English are associated with greater Uncertainty in Choosing Options (p<0.05). Values Clarity was lower for children who were diagnosed with their life-threatening condition at birth (p<0.05) as compared to children diagnosed at a later time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to describe racial and ethnic differences in decisional conflict of parents of children with life-threatening illnesses. Significant differences exist by race, ethnicity, language spoken, and diagnosis time across several subdomains of decisional conflict. These differences are important to address when creating clinical care plans, engaging in shared decision-making, and creating interventions to alleviate decisional conflict.",2014,10.1089/jpm.2013.0604,17,5,559-567,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,United States and Medicaid and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Child and Logistic Models and Sex Factors and Analysis of Variance and Florida and Age Factors and *Decision Making and Caregivers/*psychology and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and Dissent and Disputes and *Terminally Ill and African Americans/psychology and Ethnicity/*ethnology/psychology and Hispanic or Latino/ethnology/psychology and Whites/psychology,NA,NA,2014/05//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

So far, research has largely neglected the professionals' perspective. AIM: We aimed to investigate the attitudes and needs of health care professionals with regard to pediatric advance care planning. DESIGN: This is a qualitative interview study with experts in pediatric end-of-life care. A qualitative content analysis was performed. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with health care professionals caring for severely ill children/adolescents, from different professions, care settings, and institutions. RESULTS: Perceived problems with pediatric advance care planning relate to professionals' discomfort and uncertainty regarding end-of-life decisions and advance directives. Conflicts may arise between physicians and non-medical care providers because both avoid taking responsibility for treatment limitations according to a minor's advance directive. Nevertheless, pediatric advance care planning is perceived as helpful by providing an action plan for everyone and ensuring that patient/parent wishes are respected. Important requirements for pediatric advance care planning were identified as follows: repeated discussions and shared decision-making with the family, a qualified facilitator who ensures continuity throughout the whole process, multi-professional conferences, as well as professional education on advance care planning. CONCLUSION: Despite a perceived need for pediatric advance care planning, several barriers to its implementation were identified.

A qualitative analysis of 35 written documents,"Trarieux-Signol, S. and Bordessoule, D. and Ceccaldi, J. and Malak, S. and Polomeni, A. and Fargeas, J. B. and Signol, N. and Pauliat, H. and Moreau, S.",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: In France, advance directives are favourably perceived by most of the population, although the drafting rate is low. This ambivalence is challenging because advance directives are meant to promote the autonomy and freedom of choice of patients. The purpose of this study was to analyse the content of advance directives written by patients suffering from malignant haemopathies to better understand how patients put them into practice. These could be relevant as early as the initial diagnosis of haematological malignancies because of the uncertain course of the disease. METHODS: This was a multicentre, qualitative, descriptive study. The advance directives written by patients with malignant haemopathies treated in one of the six French hospital departments were included in the study from 01/06/2008 to 15/04/2016. A thematic analysis of the advance directives was performed by two researchers: a senior haematologist and a research assistant. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 69. Most were women (sex ratio: 0.59), living as a couple (57%), with lymphoid pathologies (66%), who were still alive two years after the instructions were written (63%) and had nominated a health care proxy (88.6%). Free texts (62.9%) were richer in content than pre-defined forms. The advance directives were used in three ways: for a purely legal purpose, to focus on medical treatments or actions, or to communicate a message to the family. Three main themes emerged: (1) refusal of medical treatment (100%), in which patients express refusal of life-sustaining care (97.1%). The actual treatments or the moment when they should be limited or stopped were not always mentioned in detail. (2) A desire for effective pain relief to avoid suffering (57.1%) and (3) messages for their family (34.3%), such as funeral arrangements (17.1%) and messages of love or trust (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who write advance directives are not necessarily at the end of their lives. Their content mainly conveys treatment wishes, although patients also use them to pass on personal messages to their close family. This emerging role of advance directives to communicate messages within the family should be valued, even if it is not their original purpose.",2018,10.1186/s12904-017-0265-1,17,1,10,eng,1472-684X,"Communication and Decision making and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and End of life and Qualitative research and Advance directives and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and France and *Choice Behavior and Family/*psychology and Advance Directives/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology/trends and Ethics of care and Hematology/methods and Patient's will",NA,NA,2018/01/02/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: Determine a parsimonious set of intrapersonal factors associated with family caregivers' confidence in making future medical decisions for their relatives with cancer. Methods: Cross-sectional mail survey. Family caregivers of Medicare beneficiaries with pancreatic, lung, brain, ovarian, head and neck, hematologic, and stage IV cancers from communities of eight U.S. cancer centers. Participants completed validated measures of their social and mental health, self-care behaviors, coping styles, and surrogate decision-making confidence. Using linear modeling, the Bayesian information criterion was used to identify factors associated with decision-making confidence. A bootstrap approach was used to conduct penalized inference on the selected model coefficients. Model fit validation was assessed with a random forest ensemble. Results: Caregivers (n = 294) were on average 65.5 years old, mostly female (72.8%), and care recipients' spouse/partner (60.2%). The parsimonious set of factors associated with low caregiver decision-making confidence included less engagement in spiritual growth self-care, more use of avoidant coping, low emotional social support, and younger care recipient age (in-sample R(2) = 0.22). These factors were also identified by a random forest approach. After overfitting adjustment (shrunken R(2) = 0.09), the strongest associations with low surrogate decision-making confidence were low spiritual growth self-care (adjusted standardized B = 0.17, p = 0.005) and high use of avoidant coping (adjusted standardized B = -0.12, p = 0.049).

End-of-life decision making in the intensive care unit,"Baggs, Judith Gedney and Schmitt, Madeline H. and Prendergast, Thomas J. and Norton, Sally A. and Sellers, Craig R. and Quinn, Jill R. and Press, Nancy",Journal of palliative medicine,"PURPOSE: Traditional expectations of the single attending physician who manages a patient's care do not apply in today's intensive care units (ICUs). Although many physicians and other professionals have adapted to the complexity of multiple attendings, ICU patients and families often expect the traditional, single physician model, particularly at the time of end-of-life decision making (EOLDM). Our purpose was to examine the role of ICU attending physicians in different types of ICUs and the consequences of that role for clinicians, patients, and families in the context of EOLDM. METHODS: Prospective ethnographic study in a university hospital, tertiary care center. We conducted 7 months of observations including 157 interviews in each of four adult critical care units. RESULTS: The term ""attending physician"" was understood by most patients and families to signify an individual accountable person. In practice, ""the attending physician"" was an ICU role, filled by multiple physicians on a rotating basis or by multiple physicians simultaneously. Clinicians noted that management of EOLDM varied in relation to these multiple and shifting attending responsibilities. The attending physician role in this practice context and in the EOLDM process created confusion for families and for some clinicians about who was making patient care decisions and with whom they should confer. CONCLUSIONS: Any intervention to improve the process of EOLDM in ICUs needs to reflect system changes that address clinician and patient/family confusion about EOLDM roles of the various attending physicians encountered in the ICU.",2012,10.1089/jpm.2011.0307,15,1,56-62,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"New York and Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Interviews as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and *Decision Making and *Intensive Care Units and *Medical Staff, Hospital and *Terminal Care",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result of society's increasingly cultural diversity such decision making often involves patients from ethnic minority groups, which might pose extra challenges. Objective: To investigate withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patients from ethnic minority groups and their families during critical care. Design: Ethnographic fieldwork (observations, in-depth interviews and reading patients' medical files). Setting/Subjects: Eighteen patients from ethnic minority groups, their relatives, physicians and nurses were studied in one intensive care unit of a multi-ethnic urban hospital (Belgium). Results: During decision making physicians had a very central role. The contribution of patients and nurses was limited, while families' input was more noticeable. Decision making was hampered by communication difficulties between: (1) staff and relative(s), (2) relatives, and (3) patient and relative(s). Different approaches were used by physicians to overcome difficulties, which often reflected their tendency to control decision making, for example, stressing their central role. At times their approaches reflected their inability to align families' wishes with their own, for example, when making decisions without explicitly informing relatives. Conclusions: Withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatments in a multi-ethnic critic care context has a number of alarming difficulties, such as how to take families' input correctly into account. It is important that decision making happens in a cultural sensitive way and with involvement tailored to patients' and relatives' needs and in close consultation with interprofessional health care workers/other services.",2021,10.1089/jpm.2019.0653,24,3,338-346,eng,1557-7740,communication and Humans and Minority Groups and Decision Making and Intensive Care Units and Critical Care and Withholding Treatment and Belgium and *Terminal Care and *Ethnicity and cultural diversity and intensive care units and withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment,NA,NA,2021/03//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of patients (>80 years), who were admitted to general wards and referred for intensive care, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who received intensive care were compared with those not agreeing to the initiation of intensive care. RESULTS: Among the 125 patients, 45 agreed to receiving intensive care. Baseline characteristics at the time of intensive care unit referral were similar between the intensive care and non-intensive care groups. Only one patient had advance directives before the intensive care unit referral. Lower economic status (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.08-0.94) and cognitive impairment (odds ratio = 0.20, 95% confidence interval = 0.07-0.56) were found associated with a lower likelihood of agreeing to intensive care, while a large number of participants involved in the decision-making process were associated with a higher likelihood of intensive care unit use (odds ratio = 1.82, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-3.09). Mean duration of hospital stay was longer for the intensive care group as compared with the non-intensive care group (28.8 days and 19.8 days, respectively, p = 0.03). However, there was no significant difference in the survival rate. CONCLUSION: The initiation of intensive care in elderly patients was influenced not only by medical conditions but also by the patient's economic status and the number of family members involved in the decision-making process.",2016,10.1177/0269216316634241,30,8,789-799,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Survival Rate and Critical Care/*statistics & numerical data and Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data and Intensive care and terminal care and aged and Health Services for the Aged/*statistics & numerical data and retrospective cohort study",NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jouffre_2018_Joofpame,JOUR,Personalizing Patients' Advance Directives Decreases the Willingness of Intensive Care Unit Residents to Stop Treatment: A Randomized Study,"Jouffre, Stephane and Ghazal, Joanne and Robert, Rene and Reignier, Jean and Albarracin, Dolores",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: While following patients' advance directives (ADs) is legally binding, French physicians in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) perceive them as complicating their decision. Decision making and ICU residents benefit from personalizing the dying process. In France, ADs can include personal information. OBJECTIVE: Whether personalizing ADs affects ICU residents' decisions and perception of the patient. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Sixty-six ICU residents assigned to three experimental groups and presented with a case file for an ICU patient. The files were identical except for the patient's AD, which was manipulated to give three conditions: No Personal Information, Sociodemographic Information, and Agency Information (ability to plan and act upon the world). MEASUREMENTS: Residents evaluated the relevance of the AD, assessed its influence on medical decisions, and decided whether to stop treatment, postpone the decision, or consult the family. Finally, they evaluated the patient with respect to two dimensions of personhood (agency and experience). RESULTS: Residents in all conditions considered the AD to be highly relevant and influential. Residents in both Information conditions perceived the patient as having more capacities for agency and for experience than those in the No Information condition. They were also less likely to stop treatment and more likely to postpone their decision. Consulting the family was not sensitive to the information condition. CONCLUSION: Personalizing ADs of an unknown patient leads ICU residents to be less prone to follow them, but does not affect whether or not they decide to consult the patient's family. Hence, promoting shared decision making by including the incapacitated patients' families in treatment decisions is a major challenge, especially in countries such as France, where ADs are legally binding.",2018,10.1089/jpm.2017.0502,21,8,1157-1160,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Random Allocation and personalization and Socioeconomic Factors and Attitude of Health Personnel and France and *Decision Making and intensive care unit and Physicians/*psychology and *Social Perception and Advance Directives/*psychology and advance directives and Critical Care/*psychology and *Medical History Taking and randomized study and social perception,NA,NA,2018/08//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: To explore pediatric clinicians' experiences with life-sustaining treatments prior to the Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment mandate and to describe clinician and family concerns and preferences regarding pediatric Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. DESIGN: Clinician surveys and clinician and parent focus groups. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Pediatric clinicians and parents from one of Maryland's largest health systems. RESULTS: Of 96 survey respondents, 72% were physicians and 28% were nurse practitioners. A total of 73% of physicians and 34% of nurse practitioners felt able to lead discussions about limiting therapies ""most"" or ""all"" of the time. A total of 75% of physicians and 37% of nurse practitioners led such a discussion in the prior year. A total of 55% of physicians and 96% of nurse practitioners had written no order to limit therapies in the past year. Only for children predicted to die within 30 days did >80% of clinicians agree that limitation discussions were warranted. A total of 100% of parent focus group participants, but 17% of physicians and 33% of nurse practitioners, thought that all pediatric inpatients warranted Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment discussions.

Participants believed that Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment would clarify decision making and increase utilization of palliative care. Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment communication skills training was recommended by all. CONCLUSION: A minority of clinicians, but all parents, support universal pediatric Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment.

Blackhall_2014_Joofpame,JOUR,Development and validation of a collaborative behaviors objective assessment tool for end-of-life communication,"Blackhall, Leslie J. and Erickson, Jeanne and Brashers, Valentina and Owen, John and Thomas, Shannon",Journal of palliative medicine,"CONTEXT: Helping families make end-of-life decisions requires close collaboration between physicians and nurses. However, medical and nursing students have little formal training in how to collaborate in this task, and few instruments are available to measure collaborative behaviors. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this project was to develop and validate observational assessment tools to measure specific interprofessional competencies in medical and nursing students related to end-of-life discussions. DESIGN: A literature search for evidence-based guidelines and competencies and focus groups with an expert panel of nurses and physicians were used to outline best collaborative practice behaviors for nurses and physicians in an end-of-life decision making simulation. The panel used these practice-behavior checklists to rate videotaped student scenarios and then refined the checklists for validity and clarity until the tools had acceptable inter-rater reliability. SETTING: The setting was a workshop teaching end-of-life communication to third-year nursing and medical students. MEASUREMENTS: Inter-rater reliability was measured using percent agreement and kappa; internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: Collaborative behaviors objective assessment tools (CBOATs) for nursing and medical students were developed. For the medical CBOAT we found 85% agreement between raters, with an overall kappa of 0.744 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.806. For the nursing CBOAT there was 81% agreement, with a kappa of 0.686 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.845.

Ke_2020_Joofpame,JOUR,Advance Care Planning to Improve End-of-Life Decision-Making Consistency between Older People and Their Surrogates in Taiwan,"Ke, Li-Shan and Hu, Wen-Yu and Chen, Mei-Jung and Cheng, Hui-Chuan and Lin, Li-Hwa",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: Surrogates often do not accurately predict older people's preferences about end-of-life (EOL) care. Few studies have examined the impact of advance care planning (ACP) on EOL decision-making consistency between older people and their surrogates, and these studies have yielded conflicting results. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of ACP in improving EOL decision-making consistency between older people and their surrogates. Design: The intervention in this pre-post quasi-experimental design included an informative video, a brochure about ACP, and a guided discussion about EOL wishes. Setting: Two geriatric wards in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Subjects: One hundred eight participants, as 54 pairs of older people and their surrogates, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group received an intervention, while the control group received usual care. Measurements: Life-Support Preferences Questionnaire. Results: The intervention did not improve decision-making consistency between older people and their surrogates. This was the first time that most pairs discussed specific EOL decisions, so additional preparation may improve comfort with this topic. This study also found that some older people had difficulty concentrating on the educational brochure or understanding the related terms. Conclusions: Preparation for ACP discussion is needed for older people and their surrogates. Longer-term effects of ACP should be monitored because ACP interventions may have enhanced empathy between older people and their surrogates. Additionally, a culturally sensitive illustrated questionnaire that explains life-support preferences and ACP topics may improve communication between older people and their surrogates.",2020,10.1089/jpm.2019.0277,23,3,325-336,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Aged and Death and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and older people and Taiwan and *Terminal Care and agreement and *Advance Care Planning and end-of-life care and advance care planning and concordance and surrogates and congruence and decision-making consistency,NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clergy are uniquely positioned to help patients consider medical decisions at or near the end of life within a religious/spiritual framework. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine clergy knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) care and beliefs about the role of faith in EOL decision making for patients with serious illness. DESIGN: Key informant interviews, focus groups, and survey. SETTING/SUBJECTS: A purposive sample of 35 active clergy in five U.S. states as part of the National Clergy End-of-Life Project. MEASUREMENT: We assessed participant knowledge of and desire for further education about EOL care. We transcribed interviews and focus groups for the purpose of qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Clergy had poor knowledge of EOL care; 75% desired more EOL training. Qualitative analysis revealed a theological framework for decision making in serious illness that balances seeking life and accepting death. Clergy viewed comfort-focused treatments as consistent with their faith traditions' views of a good death. They employed a moral framework to determine the appropriateness of EOL decisions, which weighs the impact of multiple factors and upholds the importance of God-given free will. They viewed EOL care choices to be the primary prerogative of patients and families. Clergy described ambivalence about and a passive approach to counseling congregants about decision making despite having defined beliefs regarding EOL care.

These patients may benefit from ED-initiated palliative care (PC) consultation. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to track the rate of ED-initiated PC consultation for patients with advanced dementia (AD) after an educational intervention, and to categorize decision making for physicians who chose not to initiate consultation. METHODS: As part of a quality improvement project at a suburban, tertiary care, university-affiliated medical center, emergency physicians (EPs) were taught to identify AD patients and initiate PC consultation. A convenience sample of patients over age 70 was screened for AD by research staff from July 1, 2012 to August 1, 2012 using the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) criteria. A questionnaire was then administered to patients' physicians to inquire about barriers to initiating consultation. Questionnaires and medical records of those who met AD criteria were reviewed to examine patient characteristics, disposition information, and consultation initiation barriers. RESULTS: Patients (N=548) over 70 who visited the ED were approached and 304 completed the screening. Fifty-one of the 304 met criteria for AD. Their average age was 86; 33% were male. Eighteen of the 51 (35%) patients received a PC consultation sometime during their ED or hospital stay. Four of the 18 (22%) consultations were ED initiated. In 23 of 51 (45%) unique cases, physicians responded to the questionnaire. The majority felt that a PC consult was not appropriate for patients based on their knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs.

Objective: To examine spokespersons' perceived preparedness for surrogate decision making after engaging in ACP. Design: Mixed methods experimental design with qualitative thematic analysis and data transformation (creating categorical data from rich qualitative data) of interviews collected during a randomized controlled trial (2012-2017). Setting/Participants: Two tertiary care medical centers (Hershey, PA and Boston, MA). Of 285 dyads (patients with advanced illness and their spokespersons) enrolled in the trial, 200 spokesperson interviews were purposively sampled and 198 included in the analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Interviews with spokespersons (four weeks post-intervention) explored spokespersons' perceived preparedness for surrogate decision making, occurrence of ACP conversations, and spokespersons' intentions regarding future surrogate decisions. Data transformation was used to categorize participants' responses into three categories: Very Prepared, Very Unprepared, or In Between Prepared and Unprepared. Themes and categories were compared across arms. Results: About 72.72% of spokespersons (144/198) reported being Very Prepared and 27.28% (54/198) reported being Very Unprepared or In Between with no differences in preparedness across study arms. Occurrence of post-intervention ACP conversations did not influence perceived preparedness; however, spokespersons who used an ACP decision aid reported more conversations. Four themes emerged to explain spokespersons' perceived preparedness: (1) perceptions about ACP; (2) level of comfort with uncertainty; (3) relational issues; and (4) personal characteristics. Regarding future intentions, it emerged that spokespersons believed their knowledge of patient wishes, as well as other personal, relational, situational, and emotional factors would influence their surrogate decisions. Conclusions: Factors extrinsic to specific ACP interventions influence how prepared spokespersons feel to act as spokespersons. Understanding these factors is important for understanding how to improve concordance between patients' stated end-of-life wishes and surrogate decisions.

Newer therapies, especially immunotherapy, offer the hope of profound and durable responses with more tolerable side effect profiles. Integrating this information into the decision making process is challenging for patients and oncologists. Systemic anticancer treatment within the last thirty days of life is a key quality of care indicator and is one parameter used in the assessment of aggressiveness of care. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of all patients previously treated at Goulburn Valley Health oncology department who died between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2018 was conducted. Information collected related to patient demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and hospital care within the last 30 days of life. These results were presented to the cancer services meeting and a quality improvement intervention program was instituted. A second retrospective review of medical records of all patients who died between 1 July 2018 and 31 December 2018 was conducted in order to measure the effect of this intervention. RESULTS: The initial audit period comprised 440 patients. 120 patients (27%) received treatment within the last 30 days of life. The re-audit period comprised 75 patients. 19 patients (25%) received treatment within the last 30 days of life. Treatment rates of chemotherapy reduced after the intervention in contrast to treatment rates of immunotherapy which increased. A separate analysis calculated the rate of mortality within 30 days of chemotherapy from the total number of patients who received chemotherapy was initially 8% and 2% in the re-audit period. Treatment within the last 30 days of life was associated with higher use of aggressive care such as emergency department presentation, hospitalisation, ICU admission and late hospice referral. Palliative care referral rates improved after the intervention. CONCLUSION: This audit demonstrated that a quality improvement intervention can impact quality of care indicators with reductions in the use of chemotherapy within the last 30 days of life.

Evidenced-based, effective approaches are needed. This study sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an ACP intervention informed by phase 1 findings and assessed the suitability of measures for a phase 3 trial. METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal, mixed methods study with convenience sampling. A skilled facilitator conducted an ACP intervention with stage III/IV cancer patients and invited caregivers. It incorporated the vignette technique and optional completion/integration of ACP documents into electronic medical records (EMR). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently, analysed separately, and the two sets of findings converged. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent consent rate with 30 patients and 26 caregivers completing the intervention. Ninety percent of patient participants had not or probably not written future care plans. Compliance with assessments was high and missing responses to items low. Small- to medium-sized changes were observed on a number of patients and caregiver completed measures, but confidence intervals were typically wide and most included zero. An increase in distress was reported; however, all believed the intervention should be made available. Eleven documents from nine patients were incorporated into EMR. ACP may not be furthered because of intervention inadequacies, busy lives, and reluctance to plan ahead. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 study we demonstrated feasibility of recruitment and acceptability of the ACP intervention and most outcome measures. However, patient/family preferences about when and whether to document ACP components need to be respected. Thus flexibility to accommodate variability in intervention delivery, tailored to individual patient/family preferences, may be required for phase 3 research.",2015,10.1186/s12904-015-0023-1,14,NA,27,eng,1472-684X,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Longitudinal Studies and Motivation and Feasibility Studies and Prospective Studies and Research Design and Family/*psychology and Neoplasms/*psychology and Patient-Centered Care/*organization & administration and Caregivers/psychology and Advance Care Planning/*organization & administration and Terminal Care/*organization & administration,NA,NA,2015/05/16/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to describe language used by physicians when discussing treatment options with a critically and terminally ill elder. METHODS: High-fidelity simulation was used, involving an elder with end-stage cancer and life-threatening hypoxia, followed by a debriefing interview. Subjects were hospitalist, emergency medicine, and critical care physicians from three academic medical centers. Measures were observation of encounters in real time followed by content analysis of simulation and debriefing interview transcripts. During the simulation we identified the first mention (""broaching"") of principal treatment options--intubation and mechanical ventilation (life-sustaining treatment [LST]) and palliation in anticipation of death (palliation)--and used constant comparative methods to identify language used. We identified physician opinions about the use of LST in this clinical context during the debriefing interviews, and compared language used with opinions. RESULTS: Among 114 physician subjects, 106 discussed LST, 86 discussed palliation, and 84 discussed both. We identified five frames: will (decided), must (necessary), should (convention), could (option), and ask (elicitation of preferences). Physicians broached LST differently than palliation (p<0.01), most commonly framing LST as necessary (53%), while framing palliation as optional (49%). Among physicians who framed LST as imperative (will or must), 16 (30%) felt intubation would be inappropriate in this clinical situation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Types and frequencies of end-of-life practices with foreseeable or intended hastening of patients' death. Association between end-of-life practices with hastening of death and predefined characteristics of physicians and patients. RESULTS: Nine hundred and one physicians participated in the study (response rate: 55.8%). There was alleviation of symptoms in 78.1% and limitation of medical treatment with possible life shortening in 69.1% of cases. In 10 cases medication had been administered by the physician (N = 9) or the patient (N = 1) with the intention to hasten death. Patients' best interest and avoidance of possible harm to the patient were reported as reasons for non-involvement of competent patients in decision making. Physicians with added qualification in palliative medicine significantly less frequently reported end-of-life practices with intended hastening of death (p = 0.003).

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to characterize the practice of end-of-life decision making in a Dutch academic medical center and to explore pediatric oncologists' perspectives on decision making. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2010, in a specified period of 2 years, 57 children died of cancer. The attending pediatric oncologists of 48 deceased children were eligible for this study. They were requested to complete a retrospective questionnaire on characteristics of ELDs that may have preceded a child's death. ELDs were defined as decisions concerning administering or forgoing treatment that may unintentionally or intentionally hasten death. RESULTS: In 31 of 48 cases (65%) one or more ELDs were made. In 20 of 31 cases potentially life-prolonging treatments were discontinued or withheld, and in 22 of 31 cases drugs were administered to alleviate pain or other symptoms in potentially life-shortening dosages. Frequently mentioned considerations for making ELDs were no prospects of improvement (n=21;68%) and unbearable suffering without a curative perspective (n=13;42%). ELDs were discussed with parents in all cases, and with the child in 9 of 31 cases. After the child's death, the pediatric oncologist met the parents in all ELD cases and in 11 of 17 non-ELD cases. Pediatric oncologists were satisfied with care around the child's death in 90% of the ELD cases versus 59% of the non-ELD cases. CONCLUSIONS: In two-thirds of cases, ELDs preceded the death of a child with cancer. This is the first study providing insights into the characteristics of ELDs from a pediatric oncologist's point of view.",2015,10.1089/jpm.2015.29000.rbvl,18,8,697-702,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Infant, Newborn and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Pediatrics and *Medical Oncology and Netherlands/epidemiology and *Palliative Care and *Terminally Ill and Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Trarieux.Signol_2014_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Factors associated with the designation of a health care proxy and writing advance directives for patients suffering from haematological malignancies,"Trarieux-Signol, Sophie and Moreau, Stephane and Gourin, Marie-Pierre and Penot, Amelie and Edoux de Lafont, Geoffroy and Preux, Pierre-Marie and Bordessoule, Dominique",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: During the last few decades, patients' rights have been reinforced in many countries by acts of law. Measures now include health care proxies to uphold the doctor-patient relationship and advance directives for end-of-life patients. These could be relevant tools as early as the initial diagnosis of haematological malignancies because of the uncertain disease course. The aim of this research was to assess the factors associated with the designation of a proxy and writing advance directives by patients in a haematology department in France. METHODS: After a specific programme to encourage discussions about end-of-life preferences, we conducted a mixed-methods study comprising retrospective analysis of a random sample of 200 patients' medical records, crossed with a qualitative analysis of the content of advance directives. Statistical analysis was performed by the RKward V 0.6.1 software with 0.05 denoting significance. The study was performed and presented in accordance with the STROBE guidelines. A thematic analysis of the advance directives was performed by two researchers. RESULTS: A total of 197 medical records were evaluable. The mean age of the patients was 66 years (range: 18-91). Nearly 2/3 of them (64.5%) designated a proxy, 6.1% wrote advance directives, and 8.1% and 4.6% expressed a wish to meet a religious representative or a volunteer, respectively. The 2-year survival rate was 78.4% [95%CI: 68.2-90.2]. Patients who wrote advance directives were statistically older (p <0.00025). Patients who wrote an advance directive were more likely to have expressed a wish to meet a religious representative (p <0.001) or a volunteer (p = 0.003). Marital status was a significant factor in appointing a proxy (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify influencing factors for proxies and advance directives in a homogenous population of patients with haematological malignancies. Most patients chose a proxy. However, despite several training programmes for the carers and a care planning programme, few patients wrote advance directives. Our findings suggest that influencing factors are advanced age and a wish to see a religious representative. This study highlights the importance of oral communication about end-of-life issues between carers, patients and their relatives.",2014,10.1186/1472-684X-13-57,13,NA,57,eng,1472-684X,"Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Advance directives and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Haematology and France/epidemiology and Proxy and Spirituality and Proxy/*legislation & jurisprudence and Health communication and Advance Directives/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Terminal Care/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2014///,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kelly and Metzger, Maureen and DeLuca, Jane and Gramling, Robert",Journal of palliative medicine,BACKGROUND: Seriously ill hospitalized patients and their loved ones are frequently faced with complex treatment decisions laden with expressions of emotional distress during palliative care (PC) consultations. Little is known about these emotional expressions or the compassionate responses providers make and how common these are in PC decision-making conversations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the types and frequency of emotional distress that patients and loved ones express and how providers respond to these emotions during PC decision-making consultations with seriously ill hospitalized patients. METHODS: We used a quantitative descriptive approach to analyze 71 audio-recorded inpatient PC decision-making consultations for emotional distress and clinicians' responses to those emotions using reliable and established methods. RESULTS: A total of 69% of conversations contained at least one expression of emotional distress. The per-conversation frequency of expressions of emotional distress ranged from 1 to 10. Anxiety/fear were the most frequently encountered emotions (48.4%) followed by sadness (35.5%) and anger/frustration (16.1%). More than half of the emotions related to the patient's feelings (53.6%) and 41.9% were related to the loved ones' own emotions. The majority of emotions were moderate in intensity (65.8%) followed by strong (20.7%) and mild (13.5%). Clinicians responded to a majority of emotions with a compassionate response (75.7%) followed by those with medical content (21.9%) and very few were ignored (1.3%).

Clinicians often fail to identify such patients, thus trigger tools have been developed to assist in this process. We aimed to evaluate the performance of a identification tool (based on the Gold Standards Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance) to predict death at 12 months in a population of hospitalised patients in South Africa. METHODS: Patients admitted to the acute medical services in two public hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Demographic data were collected from patients and patient notes. Patients were assessed within two days of admission by two trained clinicians who were not the primary care givers, using the identification tool. Outcome mortality data were obtained from patient folders, the hospital electronic patient management system and the Western Cape Provincial death registry which links a unique patient identification number with national death certificate records and system wide electronic records. RESULTS: 822 patients (median age of 52 years), admitted with a variety of medical conditions were assessed during their admission. 22% of the cohort were HIV-infected. 218 patients were identified using the screening tool as being in the last year of their lives. Mortality in this group was 56% at 12 months, compared with 7% for those not meeting any criteria. The specific indicator component of the tool performed best in predicting death in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients, with a sensitivity of 74% (68-81%), specificity of 85% (83-88%), a positive predictive value of 56% (49-63%) and a negative predictive value of 93% (91-95%). The hazard ratio of 12-month mortality for those identified vs not was 11.52 (7.87-16.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification tool is suitable for use in hospitals in low-middle income country setting that have both a high communicable and non-communicable disease burden amongst young patients, the majority under age 60.",2019,10.1186/s12904-019-0487-5,18,1,101,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prospective Studies and Prognosis and Palliative care and Socioeconomic Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Hospitals, Public and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and South Africa/epidemiology and Stroke/epidemiology and Clinical decision-making and Noncommunicable Diseases/*epidemiology and Acute Coronary Syndrome/epidemiology and Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality and HIV Infections/epidemiology and Hospitilization and Palliative Care/*organization & administration/standards and Tuberculosis/epidemiology",NA,NA,2019/11/13/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

To meet the increasing need for PC an end-of-life (EOL) care project has been ongoing in South Western Finland since 2012, and in 2015, a weekday palliative outpatient clinic was established in Turku University Hospital (TUH). The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the project and the PC clinic on the management practices of EOL cancer patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) of TUH from 2013 to 2016. METHODS: The medical records of all cancer patients (ICD-10 codes C00-97) admitted to the ED of TUH between August 1-December 31, in 2013 and 2016, were analyzed: n = 529, n = 432 respectively (2013 and 2016). The analysis focused on those patients in EOL care; n = 77, n = 63, respectively. The late palliative patients were defined by PC decision, thus termination of life-prolonging cancer-specific treatments. The EOL patients were in the imminently dying phase of their illness. The site of referral after an ED visit was also verified together with the documentation on advance care plans (ACP), and the impact of palliative outpatient visits. RESULTS: In 2016, the number of late palliative and EOL patients admitted to the ED has shown a tendency to decrease. The quality of the documentation for treatment goals, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, living wills and connections to primary care providers has improved since 2013. Prior visits to palliative outpatient clinic correlated well with the more comprehensive ACP information: i) DNR order (p = 0.0001); ii) connection to primary care (p = 0.003); iii) documented ICD-10 code Z51.5 (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Even modest investments in resources for PC can induce an objective change in the allocation of health care resources, and improve the ACP for the cancer patients at their EOL.

Seeber_2019_BMCpalcar,JOUR,Advance care planning in progressive neurological diseases: lessons from ALS,"Seeber, Antje A. and Pols, A. Jeannette and Hijdra, Albert and Grupstra, Hepke F. and Willems, Dick L. and de Visser, Marianne",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing awareness of the need for an integrated palliative care approach in chronic progressive neurological diseases. Advance care planning (ACP) is an integral part of this approach. As a systematically organized and ongoing communication process about patients' values, goals and preferences regarding medical care during serious and chronic illness, ACP aims to involve patients in decision-making before they become cognitively and communicatively incapable. However, it remains underutilized in daily neurological practice except for speciality clinics such as ALS centers. Our aim was to study ACP in the tertiary ALS center Amsterdam and to investigate patients' reflections on it. Subsequently we used this knowledge to formulate recommendations for integration of ACP in the care of patients with other chronic progressive neurological diseases. METHODS: Non-participating observations of all appointments of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) with the treating physician, in various stages of disease, during 6 consecutive months, followed by single in-depth interviews, and an inductive analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight Dutch patients participated, varying in age, gender, disease onset and severity of physical decline. ACP started directly when the diagnosis was given, by means of a general outlook on the future with progressive disability and immediate introduction to a customized multidisciplinary team. During follow-up ACP was realized by regular appointments in which monitoring of the patient's status and clear communication strategies formed the basis of tailor-made discussions on treatment options. Patients accepted this policy as careful professional guidance. CONCLUSIONS: ACP is a professional communication process throughout the whole course of progressive disease. It is feasible to integrate ACP into follow-up of patients with ALS and PMA from diagnosis onwards. Supported by recent literature, we argue that such a well-structured approach would also enhance the quality of care and life of patients with other chronic progressive neurological diseases.",2019,10.1186/s12904-019-0433-6,18,1,50,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Quality of life and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Netherlands and Interviews as Topic/methods and Advance care planning and Advance Care Planning/*trends and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/psychology/*therapy and Chronic progressive neurological disease and Muscular Atrophy, Spinal/psychology/*therapy and Supportive and palliative care",NA,NA,2019/06/13/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Roeline W. and Noortgate, Nele Van den and Bilsen, Johan and Mortier, Freddy and Deliens, Luc",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and implementation of institutional end-of-life policies has been comprehensively studied in Flanders, Belgium, a country where euthanasia was legalised in 2002. Developing end-of-life policies in hospitals is a first step towards improving the quality of medical decision-making at the end-of-life. Implementation of policies through quality assessments, communication and the training and education of health care providers is equally important in improving actual end-of-life practice. The aim of the present study is to report on the existence and nature of end-of-life policy implementation activities in Flemish acute hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional mail survey was sent to all acute hospitals (67 main campuses) in Flanders (Belgium). The questionnaire asked about hospital characteristics, the prevalence of policies on five types of end-of-life decisions: euthanasia, palliative sedation, alleviation of symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, do-not-resuscitate decision, and withdrawing or withholding of treatment, the internal and external communication of these policies, training and education on aspects of end-of-life care, and quality assessments of end-of-life care on patient and family level. RESULTS: The response rate was 55%. Results show that in 2007 written policies on most types of end-of-life decisions were widespread in acute hospitals (euthanasia: 97%, do-not-resuscitate decisions: 98%, palliative sedation: 79%). While standard communication of these policies to health care providers was between 71% and 91%, it was much lower to patients and/or family (between 17% and 50%). More than 60% of institutions trained and educated their caregivers in different aspects on end-of-life care. Assessment of the quality of these different aspects at patient and family level occurred in 25% to 61% of these hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Most Flemish acute hospitals have developed a policy on end-of-life practices. However, communication, training and the education of health care providers about these policies is not always provided, and quality assessment tools are used in less than half of the hospitals.",2009,10.1186/1472-684X-8-20,8,NA,20,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2009/12/30/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lueckmann_2009_BMCpalcar,JOUR,"""Good idea but not feasible"" - the views of decision makers and stakeholders towards strategies for better palliative care in Germany: a representative survey","Lueckmann, Sara Lena and Behmann, Mareike and Bisson, Susanne and Schneider, Nils",BMC palliative care,"BACKGROUND: Statements on potential measures to improve palliative care in Germany predominantly reflect the points of view of experts from specialized palliative care organizations. By contrast, relatively little is known about the views of representatives of organizations and institutions that do not explicitly specialize in palliative care, but are involved to a relevant extent in the decision-making and policy-making processes. Therefore, for the first time in Germany, we carried out a representative study of the attitudes of a broad range of different stakeholders acting at the national or state level of the health care system. METHODS: 442 organizations and institutions were included and grouped as follows: patient organizations, nursing organizations, medical associations, specialized palliative care organizations, political institutions, health insurance funds and others. Using a standardized questionnaire, the participants were asked to rate their agreement with the World Health Organization's definition of palliative care (five-point scale: 1 = completely agree, 5 = completely disagree) and to evaluate 18 pre-selected improvement measures with regard to their general meaningfulness and the feasibility of their introduction into the German health care system (two-point scale: 1 = good, 2 = poor). RESULTS: The response rate was 67%. Overall, the acceptance of the aims of palliative care in the WHO definition was strong. However, the level of agreement among health insurance funds' representatives was significantly less than that among representatives of the palliative care organizations. All the improvement measures selected for evaluation were rated significantly higher in respect of their meaningfulness than of their feasibility in Germany. In detail, the meaningfulness of 16 measures was evaluated positively (70-100% participants chose the answer ""good""); for six of these measures feasibility was evaluated negatively (0-30% ""good""), while for the remaining ten measures feasibility was evaluated inconsistently (31-69% ""good""). CONCLUSION: The reason why potentially meaningful improvement measures are considered to be not very feasible in Germany may be the existence of barriers resulting from the high degree of fragmentation of health care provision and responsibilities. In overcoming these barriers and further improving palliative care it may be helpful that the basic understanding of the palliative care approach seems to be quite homogenous among the different groups.",2009,10.1186/1472-684X-8-10,8,NA,10,eng,1472-684X,NA,NA,NA,2009/07/22/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is evidence to suggest that many patients dying within acute hospitals receive no specialist palliative care input. This project aimed to assess care provided to patients dying within a large Australian hospital and to understand senior clinician decision-making around referral to palliative care. METHODS: A multi-methods approach was taken that incorporated a literature review, a retrospective chart-audit using the Liverpool Care Pathway to assess quality of end-of-life care, and semistructured interviews with clinicians. RESULTS: The audit demonstrated wide variation in referral practices from clinical units, with overall only 42% of dying patients referred. A number of deficiencies in the care of dying patients within the hospital were evident; however, referral for palliative care consultation was associated with improvements in availability of appropriate end-of-life medication orders, communication with patients and families, and cessation of futile treatment and interventions. Eight themes emerged from the interviews with clinicians, including uncertainty as to the role of palliative care and a discrepancy between medical and nursing views of the utility and timing for palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate both the need for more frequent and/or earlier referral of dying patients and the need for generalist staff to become more skilled in the delivery of palliative care. It also highlights the need for palliative care clinicians to be educators and advocates within services to enhance care at end-of-life.",2010,10.1089/jpm.2009.0339,13,7,855-860,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Attitude of Health Personnel and Medical Audit and Victoria and Hospital Units and Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data and *Medical Staff, Hospital and Palliative Care/*methods and Terminal Care/*methods",NA,NA,2010/07//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Physicians tend to lack awareness that reviewing the usefulness of medication at the end of patients' lives is important. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the perspectives of patients, informal caregivers, nurses and physicians on the role of nurses in medication management at the end of life. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients in the last phase of their lives, in hospitals, hospices and at home; and with their informal caregivers, nurses and physicians. Data were qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Seventy-six interviews were conducted, with 17 patients, 12 informal caregivers, 15 nurses, 20 (trainee) medical specialists and 12 family physicians. Participants agreed that the role of the nurse in medication management includes: 1) informing, 2) supporting, 3) representing and 4) involving the patient, their informal caregivers and physicians in medication management. Nurses have a particular role in continuity of care and proximity to the patient. They are expected to contribute to a multidimensional assessment and approach, which is important for promoting patients' interest in medication management at the end of life. CONCLUSIONS: We found that nurses can and should play an important role in medication management at the end of life by informing, supporting, representing and involving all relevant parties.

Studies of dying physicians are scarce, but those that exist suggest a potential absence of a coordinating clinician, prolongation of curative treatments, resistance to palliative care input and barriers to discussing psychosocial needs. AIM: The aim was to describe and examine the care provided to physician-patients referred to an Australian palliative care service, and to identify issues faced by the physician-patient and by the treating team. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective case-note audit of the case notes of medical practitioners referred for palliative care and dying between January 2007 and April 2013 was conducted. RESULTS: There was evidence of medically qualified friends or family members initiating referrals and directing treatment decisions. There was some evidence of increased consultant-led decision-making and bypassing of usual referral pathways and systems for providing after-hours advice and calling consultants directly. There also appeared to be some reluctance by junior doctors to make decisions, because of the patient's desire for consultant-level advice only. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the growing body of literature that identifies the potential difficulties associated with caring for medical practitioners.

Cartwright_2016_Pallmedi,JOUR,"Palliative care and other physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practice relating to the law on withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment: Survey results","Cartwright, Colleen Maria and White, Ben P. and Willmott, Lindy and Williams, Gail and Parker, Malcolm Holbrook",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: To effectively care for people who are terminally ill, including those without decision-making capacity, palliative care physicians must know and understand the legal standing of Advance Care Planning in their jurisdiction of practice. This includes the use of advance directives/living wills and substitute decision-makers who can legally consent to or refuse treatment if there is no valid advance directive. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical specialists most often involved in end-of-life care in relation to the law on withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment from adults without decision-making capacity. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: A pre-piloted survey was posted to specialists in palliative, emergency, geriatric, renal and respiratory medicine; intensive care; and medical oncology in three Australian States. Surveys were analysed using SPSS 20 and SAS 9.3. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 32% (867/2702) - 52% from palliative care specialists. Palliative care specialists and geriatricians had significantly more positive attitudes towards the law (<cf><87>42(2) = 94.352; p < 0.001) and higher levels of knowledge about the withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment law (<cf><87>7(2) = 30.033; p < 0.001) than did the other specialists, while still having critical gaps in their knowledge. CONCLUSION: A high level of knowledge of the law is essential to ensure that patients' wishes and decisions, expressed through Advance Care Planning, are respected to the maximum extent possible within the law, thereby according with the principles and philosophy of palliative care. It is also essential to protect health professionals from legal action resulting from unauthorised provision or cessation of treatment.",2016,10.1177/0269216315587996,30,2,171-179,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Australia and Aged, 80 and over and law and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and palliative care and Withholding Treatment/*legislation & jurisprudence and treatment refusal and Life Support Care/*legislation & jurisprudence and Terminal Care/*legislation & jurisprudence and Advance Care Planning/*legislation & jurisprudence and Advance healthcare planning and Palliative Care/*legislation & jurisprudence and withdrawing/withholding life-sustaining treatment",NA,NA,2016/02//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Orentlicher_2016_Joofpame,JOUR,Clinical Criteria for Physician Aid in Dying,"Orentlicher, David and Pope, Thaddeus Mason and Rich, Ben A.",Journal of palliative medicine,"More than 20 years ago, even before voters in Oregon had enacted the first aid in dying (AID) statute in the United States, Timothy Quill and colleagues proposed clinical criteria AID. Their proposal was carefully considered and temperate, but there were little data on the practice of AID at the time. (With AID, a physician writes a prescription for life-ending medication for a terminally ill, mentally capacitated adult.) With the passage of time, a substantial body of data on AID has developed from the states of Oregon and Washington. For more than 17 years, physicians in Oregon have been authorized to provide a prescription for AID. Accordingly, we have updated the clinical criteria of Quill, et al., based on the many years of experience with AID. With more jurisdictions authorizing AID, it is critical that physicians can turn to reliable clinical criteria. As with any medical practice, AID must be provided in a safe and effective manner. Physicians need to know (1) how to respond to a patient's inquiry about AID, (2) how to assess patient decision making capacity, and (3) how to address a range of other issues that may arise. To ensure that physicians have the guidance they need, Compassion & Choices convened the Physician Aid-in-Dying Clinical Criteria Committee, in July 2012, to create clinical criteria for physicians who are willing to provide AID to patients who request it. The committee includes experts in medicine, law, bioethics, hospice, nursing, social work, and pharmacy. Using an iterative consensus process, the Committee drafted the criteria over a one-year period.",2016,10.1089/jpm.2015.0092,19,3,259-262,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Oregon and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Washington and Ethics, Medical and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards and Informed Consent/*standards and Euthanasia, Active/*standards and Prescription Drugs/*standards and Right to Die/*legislation & jurisprudence and Suicide, Assisted/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2016/03//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pontin_2013_Pallmedi,JOUR,Issues in prognostication for hospital specialist palliative care doctors and nurses: a qualitative inquiry,"Pontin, David and Jordan, Nikki",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced life-limiting diseases have high information needs concerning prognosis yet discussions between patients and healthcare professionals are either avoided or inaccurate due to over-optimism. Available prognostic models are problematic. Literature indicates that hospital specialist palliative care professionals are frequently asked to prognosticate, although their experience of prognostication is unknown. Identifying this experience will support the development of prognosis training for hospital specialist palliative care professionals. AIM: To explore hospital specialist palliative care professionals' experience of prognostication. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 'How do specialist palliative care team members prognosticate?'; 'How do they view prognostication?' DESIGN: Qualitative research - focus group interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Three UK hospital specialist palliative care teams. Participants included medical doctors and palliative care nurses. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: member of hospital specialist palliative care team with knowledge and experience of prognostication. Numbers of participants: four hospital specialist palliative medicine consultants, three senior doctors in training, nine clinical nurse specialists. RESULTS: Two major themes: Difficulties of prognostication; Benefits of prognostication. Eleven sub-themes: Difficulties (Non-malignant disease; Communicating uncertainty; Seeking definitive prognosis; Participants' feelings; Confidence in prognostication; Estimating prognosis; Dealing with reaction of prognosis; Prognostic error); Benefits (Patient informed decision-making prioritizing needs and care; Family-prioritizing commitments; Services accessing funding and services planning patient care).

Yuen_2013_Joofpame,JOUR,A brief educational intervention to teach residents shared decision making in the intensive care unit,"Yuen, Jacqueline K. and Mehta, Sonal S. and Roberts, Jordan E. and Cooke, Joseph T. and Reid, M. Carrington",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication is essential for shared decision making with families of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), yet there is limited evidence on effective strategies to teach these skills. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to pilot test an educational intervention to teach internal medicine interns skills in discussing goals of care and treatment decisions with families of critically ill patients using the shared decision making framework. DESIGN: The intervention consisted of a PowerPoint online module followed by a four-hour workshop implemented at a retreat for medicine interns training at an urban, academic medical center. MEASUREMENTS: Participants (N=33) completed post-intervention questionnaires that included self-assessed skills learned, an open-ended question on the most important learning points from the workshop, and retrospective pre- and post-workshop comfort level with ICU communication skills. Participants rated their satisfaction with the workshop. RESULTS: Twenty-nine interns (88%) completed the questionnaires. Important self-assessed communication skills learned reflect key components of shared decision making, which include assessing the family's understanding of the patient's condition (endorsed by 100%) and obtaining an understanding of the patient/family's perspectives, values, and goals (100%). Interns reported significant improvement in their comfort level with ICU communication skills (pre 3.26, post 3.73 on a five-point scale, p=0.004). Overall satisfaction with the intervention was high (mean 4.45 on a five-point scale).

We interviewed treating physicians to describe their expectation of benefit for patients receiving a new feeding tube, and to determine whether expected benefits vary by patient characteristics. METHODS: We recruited treating physicians and surrogate decision-makers for 288 hospitalized patients in a prospective study of new feeding tube decisions. In structured interviews, physicians provided information on patients' diagnosis and whether they expected any of eight potential medical benefits for a specific patient; surrogates provided information about the patients' function, race, age, prior residence, and ability to eat by mouth. RESULTS: We completed interviews with 173 physicians about tube feeding for 280 patients (response rate, 97%). Patients commonly had acute stroke (30%), neurodegenerative disease (16%), or head and neck cancer (22%); 70% were somewhat or severely malnourished. In half or more cases, physicians expected benefits of improved nutrition (93%), hydration (60%), prolonged life (58%), ease providing medication (55%), and less aspiration risk (49%). Physicians endorsed more expected benefits for patients with stroke or those completely unable to eat by mouth (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treating physicians expected multiple medical benefits for a diverse population of patients receiving feeding tubes. Physicians may be unaware of evidence, or expect more optimistic outcomes for their specific patient population.

At the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the trauma-burn surgery and neurosurgery services frequently request consults from the palliative care team for patients with a sudden advanced illness from catastrophic injuries or physiologic insult. OBJECTIVE: We explored surgeons' attitudes and decision-making practices regarding utilization of palliative and supportive care for patients with a sudden advanced illness from traumatic injury or physiologic insult at UAB Hospital, an American College of Surgeons certified level 1 trauma center. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS: We conducted face-to-face, open-ended interviews with nine attending trauma-burn surgeons and neurosurgeons at UAB, utilizing a grounded theory approach to discover salient themes in surgeons' accounts of the palliative care consultative process. Surgeons' descriptions of exemplary cases provided the context for elucidating the larger dynamic involved in assessing patients' situations and identifying the need for palliative and supportive care services. RESULTS: We organized the data using decision-making diagrams, identifying multiple pathways within the larger consultative framework. Although case-based responses exhibited variations in surgeons diagnostic or prognostic criteria, patient's location in the illness/injury trajectory, and surgeon's goals/desired outcomes; a general decision-making pathway emerged.

Dietz_2010_Joofpame,JOUR,Medical errors and patient safety in palliative care: a review of current literature,"Dietz, Isabel and Borasio, Gian Domenico and Schneider, Gerhard and Jox, Ralf J.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the discussion about medical errors and patient safety has gained scientific as well as public attention. Errors in medicine have been proven to be frequent and to carry enormous financial costs and moral consequences. We aimed to review the research on medical errors in palliative care and to screen relevant literature to appreciate the relevance of safety studies to the field. METHODS: We performed a literature search using the database PubMed that cross-matched terms for palliative care with the words ""errors"" and ""patient safety."" Publications were classified according to type of study and kind of error, and empiric research results were extracted and critically assessed. RESULTS: We found 44 articles concerning medical errors in palliative care, most of which were case studies. Of these 44 articles, 16 deal with palliative care errors as a key issue, referring mostly to symptom control (n = 13). Other examples are errors in communication, prognostication, and advance care planning. There are very few empirical studies, which are mostly retrospective observational studies. DISCUSSION: Although patients in palliative care are more vulnerable to errors and their consequences, there is little theoretical or empirical research on the subject. We propose a specific definition for errors in palliative care and analyze the challenges of delineating, identifying and preventing errors in such key areas as prognostication, advance care planning and end-of-life decision-making.",2010,10.1089/jpm.2010.0228,13,12,1469-1474,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Medical Errors/*prevention & control and *Palliative Care and *Safety Management,NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records of those patients who died over a 4-year period (2011-2014) on our Stroke Unit concerning EOLD, focusing on the factors that most probably guided decisions to induce limitation of life-sustaining therapy and subsequently end-of-life-care procedures thereafter. RESULTS: Of all patients treated at our Stroke Unit, 120 (2.71%) died. In 101 (86.3%), a do-not-resuscitate-order (DNRO) was made during early treatment. A decision to withdraw/withhold further life supportive therapy was made in 40 patients (34.2%) after a mean of 5.0 days (range 0-29). Overall patient death occurred after a mean time of 7.0 days (range 1-30) and 2.6 days after therapy restrictions. Disturbance of consciousness at presentation, dysphagia on day 1 and large supratentorial stroke were possible indicators of decisions to therapeutic withdrawing/withholding. Proceedings of EOL care in these patients were heterogeneous; in most cases monitoring (95%), medical procedures (90%), oral medication (88%), parenteral nutrition (98%) and antibiotic therapy (86%) were either not ordered or withdrawn, however IV fluids were continued in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of stroke patients were rated as terminally ill and died in the course of caregiving. Disturbance of consciousness at presentation, dysphagia on day 1 and large supratentorial stroke facilitated decisions to change therapeutic goals thus initiating end-of-life-care. However, there is further need to foster research on this field in order to ameliorate outcome prognostication, to understand the dynamics of EOLD-making procedures and to educate staff to provide high-quality patient-centred palliative care in stroke medicine.",2016,10.1186/s12904-016-0113-8,15,NA,38,eng,1472-684X,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Stroke and Decision Making and Cohort Studies and Palliative care and Advance directives and Aged, 80 and over and Withholding Treatment and *Decision Support Techniques and Advance Directives/psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology and End-of-life decisions and Stroke mortality and Stroke/*mortality/*psychology and Terminally Ill/psychology",NA,NA,2016/04/05/,BMC Palliat Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to fill this gap by identifying 1) organizational and provider practice norms at major US cancer centers, and 2) how these norms influence provider decision making heuristics and patient expectations for EOL care, particularly for minority patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: This is a multi-center, qualitative case study at six National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Centers. We will theoretically sample centers based upon National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed EOL quality metrics and demographics to ensure heterogeneity in EOL intensity and region. A multidisciplinary team of clinician and non-clinician researchers will conduct direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and artifact collection. Participants will include: 1) cancer center and clinical service line administrators; 2) providers from medical, surgical, and radiation oncology; palliative or supportive care; intensive care; hospital medicine; and emergency medicine who see patients with cancer and have high clinical practice volume or high local influence (provider interviews and observations); and 3) adult patients with metastatic solid tumors and whom the provider would not be surprised if they died in the next 12 months and their caregivers (patient and caregiver interviews). Leadership interviews will probe about EOL institutional norms and organization. We will observe inpatient and outpatient care for two weeks. Provider interviews will use vignettes to probe explicit and implicit motivations for treatment choices. Semi-structured interviews with patients near EOL, or their family members and caregivers will explore past, current, and future decisions related to their cancer care. We will import transcribed field notes and interviews into Dedoose software for qualitative data management and analysis, and we will develop and apply a deductive and inductive codebook to the data. DISCUSSION: This study aims to improve our understanding of organizational and provider practice norms pertinent to EOL care in U.S. cancer centers. This research will ultimately be used to inform a provider-oriented intervention to improve EOL care for racial and ethnic minority patients with advanced cancer.

However, these issues remain an unsolved dilemma for nephrologists. Objective: To explore nephrologists' perceptions on the decision-making process about withholding or withdrawing dialysis and palliative care in Korea. Design: A nationwide 25-item questionnaire online survey via e-mail. Setting/Subjects: A total of 369 Korean nephrologists completed the survey. Results: The proportions of respondents who stated that withholding or withdrawing dialysis at EoL is ethically appropriate were 87.3% and 86.2%, respectively. A total of 72.4% respondents thought that withdrawal of dialysis in a maintenance dialysis patient is ethically appropriate. Responses regarding patient features that should be considered to withhold or withdraw dialysis were as follows: dialysis intolerance (84.3%), poor performance status (74.8%), patient's active request (47.2%), age (28.7%), very severe dementia (27.1%), and several comorbidities (16.5%). Among those nephrologists who responded to the question about the minimum age, at which dialysis should be withheld or withdrawn, most specified an age between 80 and 90 years (94.3%). Fifty-eight percent of respondents stated that terminally ill dialysis patients should be allowed to use palliative care facilities. In addition, a number of nephrologists thought that adequate palliative care facilities, specific treatment guidelines, enough time to manage patients, financial support, and adequate medical experts are necessary. Conclusions: Korean nephrologists thought that withholding or withdrawing dialysis at EoL is ethically appropriate, even in maintenance dialysis patients. Therefore, consensus guidelines for palliative care after withholding or withdrawal of dialysis are needed.",2021,10.1089/jpm.2020.0248,24,4,527-535,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Death and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Aged, 80 and over and Withholding Treatment and Renal Dialysis and Republic of Korea and *Palliative Care and palliative care and end of life and dialysis and withdrawal and *Nephrologists and withhold",NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies suggest that 40%-85% of parents decide to continue the pregnancy if given the option of Perinatal Palliative Care. However, structured Perinatal Palliative Care programs are missing in many European countries. In Germany, parents have the right to free psychosocial support from pregnancy counseling services after the prenatal diagnosis of a life-limiting disease. AIM: We aimed to investigate whether German professional pregnancy counselors perceive the need for structured Perinatal Palliative Care and if so, how it should be conceived. DESIGN: This is a qualitative interview study with purposeful sampling. The interviews were analyzed with the coding method of Saldana. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 professionals from three different pregnancy counseling services participated in the study. RESULTS: The main topics raised by the professionals were as follows: (1) counseling and parental support during the decision-making process; (2) fragmented or missing support infrastructure for parents; and (3) challenges, hesitations, and barriers, particularly from the different stakeholders, regarding a Perinatal Palliative Care framework. They highlighted the importance of the integration of Perinatal Palliative Care in existing structures, a multi-professional approach, continuous coordination of care and education for all healthcare providers involved. CONCLUSION: A structured Perinatal Palliative Care program is considered as necessary by the pregnancy counselors.

Wilson_2015_Pallmedi,JOUR,Administering anticipatory medications in end-of-life care: a qualitative study of nursing practice in the community and in nursing homes,"Wilson, Eleanor and Morbey, Hazel and Brown, Jayne and Payne, Sheila and Seale, Clive and Seymour, Jane",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, an approach to improving end-of-life care has been the introduction of 'just in case' or 'anticipatory' medications. Nurses are often responsible for deciding when to use anticipatory medications, but little is known about their experiences. AIM: To examine nurses' decisions, aims and concerns when using anticipatory medications. DESIGN: An ethnographic study in two UK regions, using observations and interviews with nurses working in community and nursing home teams (n = 8). FINDINGS: Observations (n = 83) and interviews (n = 61) with community nurses. Nurses identified four 'conditions' that needed to be established before they implemented anticipatory medications: (1) irreversibility; (2) inability to take oral medication; (3) where the patient was able, they should consent and (4) decision had to be independent of demands or requests from patient's relatives. By using anticipation medications, nurses sought to enable patients to be 'comfortable and settled' by provision of gradual relief of symptoms at the lowest dose possible. They aimed to respond quickly to needs, seeking to avoid hospital admission or medical call-out, while adhering to local prescribing policies. Worries included distinguishing between pain and agitation, balancing risks of under- and over-medication and the possibility of hastening death. CONCLUSION: Nurses take a leading role in the administration of anticipatory medications. Nurses apply consideration and caution to the administration of anticipatory medications but some experience emotional burden.

Broom_2012_Joofpame,JOUR,Specialists' experiences and perspectives on the timing of referral to palliative care: a qualitative study,"Broom, Alex and Kirby, Emma and Good, Phillip and Wootton, Julia and Adams, Jon",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Specialist referral practices regarding palliative care are variable and their decision-making practices regarding timing and communication remains an under-researched issue. More effective referral practices have been shown to enhance patient and carer experiences at the end of life, reduce the burden on pre-palliative care services, and even extend life expectancy in some cases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the logics underpinning the timing of referral to palliative care according to a range of medical specialists in a regional center on the east coast of Australia, in order to facilitate improvements in referral practices. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 20 medical specialists and carried out a thematic analysis of the interview data, utilising the framework analysis approach and NVivo 9 software. Key themes were tested for rigour through inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: The major themes identified within this analysis of the interviews were: a) strategies for preparing for palliative care and the importance of planning timely referrals; b) perception of inter-professional variation and reasons for delayed or difficult referrals; and c) the importance of inter-specialty communication and cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) aims to support staff to provide holistic EOL care utilizing a structured framework to prompt and guide care. We report on the post-implementation findings of a mixed methodology (survey and focus group [FG] forums) study into staff perceptions of EOL care following the pilot implementation of the LCP into two acute wards. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that within acute settings staff perceive that the LCP improves EOL care overall, assists interdisciplinary communication around death and dying, and that is a useful tool to positively influence decision making and care delivery.

Seibel_2014_Joofpame,JOUR,Terminally ill patients as customers: the patient's perspective,"Seibel, Katharina and Valeo, Sara Celestina and Xander, Carola and Adami, Sandra and Duerk, Thorsten and Becker, Gerhild",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Consumerism in health care defines patients as self-determined, rational customers. Yet, it is questionable whether vulnerable patients, such as the terminally ill, also fulfill these criteria. Vulnerable contexts and the patient's perspective on being a customer remain relatively unexplored. The present study addresses this research gap by analyzing terminally ill patients' views on being customers. AIM: To explore the ways in which patients in palliative care refer to themselves as patients/customers, and how the patients' concepts of self-determination are related to their attitudes toward the patient/customer role. DESIGN: Qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed in three steps: narrative analysis, thematic content analysis, and typology construction. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Researchers recruited 25 patients via the Department of Palliative Care, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. RESULTS: In many ways, palliative patients contradict the image of a self-determined customer. The palliative patient role is characterized by the concept of relational self-determination rather than an unrestricted self-determination. Self-attribution as a customer still occurs when positively associated with a person-centered, individualized treatment. Thus, the customer and patient role overlap within the palliative care setting because of the focus on the individual. CONCLUSIONS: The idealized customer role cannot be arbitrarily applied to all medical fields. Palliative patients are dependent on the physician, regardless of whether the customer or patient role is preferred. Hence, self-determination must be understood in relational terms, and physicians must recognize their crucial role in promoting patients' self-determination in the context of shared decision-making.",2014,10.1089/jpm.2013.0141,17,1,11-17,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Germany and Vulnerable Populations and *Personal Autonomy and Terminally Ill/*psychology and Patient-Centered Care/*standards and Dependency, Psychological and Palliative Care/*psychology/standards",NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reasons for this underutilization need to be determined. OBJECTIVE: We investigated factors associated with completion of advance directives among inpatients. DESIGN: We conducted prospective, structured interviews on family structure, health care, disease, and end-of-life experiences. We compared those with completed advance directives and those without. SETTING/SUBJECTS: We interviewed 130 inpatients in an urban university hospital. MEASUREMENTS: We used bivariate analysis and logistic regression to identify characteristics of patients with living wills and health care proxies versus patients without them. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of patients had a living will and 35% had a health care proxy. Patients with completed living wills were older (p<e2><89><a4>0.0046), had more comorbidities (p=0.018), were widowed (p=0.02), and were more often admitted with chronic disease (p=0.009) compared to those without living wills. Patients with health care proxies were older (p<0.001), had religious affiliations (p=0.04), more children (p=0.03), and more often widowed (p<e2><89><a4>0.001) than those without health care proxies. Patients were 10.8 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.59-25.3), 46.5 times (95% CI 15.1-139.4), and 68.6 times (95% CI 13.0-361.3) more likely to complete a living will when asked by medical staff, legal staff, or family and friends, respectively, than those not asked. Patients with health care proxies were 1.68 times (95% CI 0.81-3.47), 4.34 times (95% CI 1.50-12.6), and 18.0 times (95% CI 2.03-158.8) more likely to have been asked by the same groups. Patients with experience in end-of-life decision-making were 2.54 times more likely to possess a living will (95%CI 1.01-6.42) and 3.53 times more likely to possess a health care proxy (95% CI 1.51-8.25) than those without experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Having been asked about advance directives by medical staff, legal staff, or family and friends increases the likelihood that patients will possess an advance directive.

Seale_2009_Pallmedi,JOUR,End-of-life decisions in the UK involving medical practitioners,"Seale, C.",Palliative medicine,"This study estimates the frequency of different medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) made in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007-2008, comparing these with 2004. Postal survey was carried out with 8857 medical practitioners, of whom 3733 (42%) practitioners replied, with 2869 having attended a person who died in the previous year. The proportion of UK deaths involving (1) voluntary euthanasia (0.21%; CI: 0-0.52), (2) physician-assisted suicide (0.00%) and (3) ending of life without an explicit request from the patient (0.30%; CI: 0-0.60) is low. Better questions about ELDs showed both non-treatment decisions (21.8%; CI: 19.0-24.5) and double effect measures (17.1%; CI: 14.6-19.6) to be much less common than suggested in earlier estimates, rarely involving intent to end life or being judged to have shortened life by more than a day. Continuous deep sedation (16.5%; CI: 14.3-18.7) is relatively common in UK medical practice, particularly in hospitals, home care settings and with younger patients. Further findings about the distribution of ELDs across subgroups are also reported.

METHODS: Primary care physicians (n = 388) likely to manage nursing home patients in Hawaii were surveyed. Respondents indicated the factors of great importance in tube feeding decisions based on a vignette of a poststroke patient failing to thrive and family disagreement with advance directives. chi(2) and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between physician demographics and factors of importance to physicians and their decisions based on the vignette. RESULTS: Starting tube feeding (chosen by 31% of respondents) was associated with internal medicine specialty (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-4.6), and placing great importance on family preference (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.0-9.8) and liability (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.8). After 3 months without improvement, 58% chose to withdraw tube feeding. Continuing tube feeding was associated with placing great importance on family wishes (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.8-5.1) and liability (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9). Placing great importance on the living will was associated with decreased likelihoods of starting (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04-0.3) and continuing (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04-0.3) tube feeding.

NPPV has a well-established, evidence-based role in the management of respiratory failure due to acute exacerbations of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, both for patients with and without restrictions on endotracheal intubation. There are emerging uses of NPPV in patients clearly nearing the end-of-life, but the evidence to support these applications is limited. Alongside these emerging applications of NPPV are new ethical dilemmas that should be considered in medical decision-making regarding these therapies. DISCUSSION: Herein, we describe the use of NPPV in four patients with advanced disease and preexisting treatment-limiting directives. We discuss some of the ethical dilemmas and unintended consequences that may accompany the use of NPPV in such circumstances, and we review the benefits and burdens of palliative NPPV.

We aimed to evaluate the overall survival, factors associated with early mortality, and adoption of additional procedures in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and poor ECOG-PS treated with PC. METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced cancer treated with PC during hospitalization at an academic cancer center in Brazil from 2014 to 2016. Eligibility criteria included: ECOG-PS 3-4 and start of first-line PC; or ECOG-PS <e2><89><a5> 2 and start of second or subsequent lines. Primary endpoint was 30-day survival from start of PC. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates and Cox regression for factors associated with 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were eligible. 21.9, 66.7 and 11.4% of patients had ECOG-PS 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 49.6% had gastrointestinal tumors. Median follow-up was 49 days (range 1-507). 98.2% of patients had died, 32% during the index hospitalization.

Goldstein_2013_Joofpame,JOUR,Parents' views of their child's end-of-life care: subanalysis of primary care involvement,"Goldstein, Richard and Rimer, Kathleen P.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: The medical literature encourages primary care pediatricians (PCPs) to play a role in the care of patients who are dying. Actual involvement has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore current involvement of PCPs when their patients face the end of life and bereaved parents' attitudes toward it. DESIGN: Individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted using a focused ethnographic technique. Qualitative analysis was performed on the interviews. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Most (14/16) interviews were conducted in the family's home, involving parents of Massachusetts children who died aged 1 month to 11 years during 2005. MEASUREMENTS: Themes identified through thematic analysis of interview transcripts were utilized. RESULTS: Interviews were thematically analyzed, revealing four categories of themes: 1) the role of individual PCP in decision making and care at end of life; 2) general attitudes about the care provided by the PCP; 3) the impact of practice infrastructure on the PCP's care; and 4) bereavement involvement. From the interviews we hypothesize that PCPs play a supportive and appreciated role while having limited involvement in decision making and care; an involved PCP acting with knowledge of a family may in some cases provide profound guidance, but that kind of involvement is not typical; and although there is an articulated role for the PCP with the parents' and siblings' bereavement, it is not routinely exercised.

RESULTS: A total of 371 of 6526 patients (5.7%) had LST withheld or withdrawn; 339 of these patients died in the ICU. Patients whose LST was withheld or withdrawn were older, had a high number of comorbidities, and were admitted with higher SAPS II and APACHE II scores than the general ICU population.

Their support for the different decisions existed regardless of whether they had cared for terminally ill patients or not. Most nurses also thought that they have an important role to play especially in the ELD-making process.

However, there is an ongoing debate concerning the appropriateness of its use for decision-making in palliative care. AIM: To systematically map pros and cons of using the Quality-Adjusted Life Year to inform decisions on resource allocation among palliative care interventions, as brought forward in the debate, and to discuss the Quality-Adjusted Life Year's value for palliative care. DESIGN: The integrative review method of Whittemore and Knafl was followed. Theoretical arguments and empirical findings were mapped. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL, in which MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms were Palliative Care, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Quality of Life, and Quality-Adjusted Life Years. FINDINGS: Three themes regarding the pros and cons were identified: (1) restrictions in life years gained, (2) conceptualization of quality of life and its measurement, including suggestions to adapt this, and (3) valuation and additivity of time, referring to changing valuation of time. The debate is recognized in empirical studies, but alternatives not yet applied. CONCLUSION: The Quality-Adjusted Life Year might be more valuable for palliative care if specific issues are taken into account. Despite restrictions in life years gained, Quality-Adjusted Life Years can be achieved in palliative care.

Their beliefs about resuscitation and prior experiences with end-of-life care may impact the manner in which they approach patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore residents' perceptions of end-of-life discussions, determine the features they find most important, and discern the challenges they face in this process. METHODS: Internal medicine residents were surveyed about their experiences discussing resuscitation with patients including perceptions of patient understanding, outcomes of resuscitation, and regret about attempting to resuscitate patients. They were asked what features of these discussions are most important and which are the most challenging. Qualitative content analysis was used to examine the responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: Fifty-five residents completed the survey. Residents reported rarely feeling satisfied with the results of these discussions and disagreed with the decision for resuscitation numerous times. They perceive that few patients and families understand resuscitation. In their description of important features, they focus on the content of the discussion rather than the process, with the most common responses centering on a description of resuscitation. In contrast, the greatest challenge they identify is dealing with the emotional aspects of the discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Residents report internal conflict about their experiences discussing resuscitation with patients.

The response rate was 50.3%. CONCLUSION: We found that having previous EOL care education was common among ICU staff. However, several deficiencies in self-perceived EOL competencies were identified among staff, particularly in the areas of communication, continuity of care, and decision-making process. Nursing and medical staff also had different perceptions on how certain EOL behaviors were carried out in the ICU. Educational interventions will be implemented in our ICU in an effort to improve staff preparedness for the provision of quality EOL care.",2012,10.1089/jpm.2011.0265,15,1,29-36,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Health Care Surveys and Wisconsin and *Intensive Care Units and *Health Personnel and *Terminal Care and *Self Efficacy and *Clinical Competence,NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lotz_2017_Pallmedi,JOUR,"""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"": A qualitative interview study on parents' needs and fears in pediatric advance care planning","Lotz, Julia Desiree and Daxer, Marion and Jox, Ralf J. and Borasio, Gian Domenico and Fuhrer, Monika",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric advance care planning is advocated by healthcare providers because it may increase the chance that patient and/or parent wishes are respected and thus improve end-of-life care. However, since end-of-life decisions for children are particularly difficult and charged with emotions, physicians are often afraid of addressing pediatric advance care planning. AIM: We aimed to investigate parents' views and needs regarding pediatric advance care planning. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative interview study with parents of children who had died from a severe illness. The interviews were analyzed by descriptive and evaluation coding according to Saldana. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 parents of 9 children. Maximum variation was sought regarding the child's illness, age at death, care setting, and parent gender. RESULTS: Parents find it difficult to engage in pediatric advance care planning but consider it important. They argue for a sensitive, individualized, and gradual approach. Hope and quality of life issues are primary. Parents have many non-medical concerns that they want to discuss. Written advance directives are considered less important, but medical emergency plans are viewed as necessary in particular cases. Continuity of care and information should be improved through regular pediatric advance care planning meetings with the various care providers. Parents emphasize the importance of a continuous contact person to facilitate pediatric advance care planning. CONCLUSION: Despite a need for pediatric advance care planning, it is perceived as challenging. Needs-adjusted content and process and continuity of communication should be a main focus in pediatric advance care planning. Future research should focus on strategies that facilitate parent engagement in pediatric advance care planning to increase the benefit for the families.",2017,10.1177/0269216316679913,31,8,764-771,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and pediatrics and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and *Needs Assessment and *Terminal Care and *Fear and *Advance Care Planning and Parents/*psychology and *Child Mortality and Advance care planning and advance directives and *Advance Directives and terminal care and resuscitation orders",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many patients with heart failure (HF) may benefit from more timely ACP, in part due to the unpredictable trajectory of the disease. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multiple-component hospital-based intervention on completion of ACP forms among HF patients. METHODS: A brief hospital-based ACP intervention was led by a nonclinician health educator that included (1) an educational video about shared decision making and (2) a protocol to engage HF providers in patients' ACP decision making after the hospitalization. We surveyed patients regarding attitudes toward the ACP intervention and studied completion rates of advance directives (ADs) or physician orders for life sustaining treatment (POLST) forms six months following discharge. RESULTS: The educational video component of this intervention was considered helpful by 92% of participants, and 70% said they were more likely to talk with their physician about their end-of-life preferences after watching the video and interacting with the health educator. Of 37 participants, 49% had evidence of completion of an AD or POLST in their medical records six months after the index hospitalization compared to 32% before the intervention. The number of patients having a signed scanned POLST form increased from 10 (27%) before the intervention to 16 (43%) six months after the intervention (p = 0.03).

Parents depend on neonatologists to interpret complex information, identify critical opportunities for decision-making, and present options for care. How neonatologists' belief systems affect care delivery for critically ill newborns is unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationship between neonatologists' religiosity or spirituality and the provision of intensive care services for high-risk newborns. METHODS: Neonatologists practicing at an American Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal-Perinatal Training Program were surveyed about their religious/spiritual beliefs, provision of LST for critically ill neonates, and communication with families. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-eight neonatologists responded to the survey; 66.4% consider themselves very or moderately spiritual, 40.8% very or moderately religious. In response to a hypothetical prenatal consultation for a fetus at 23 1/7 weeks gestation, 96.3% agreed that the physician has a moral obligation to present all options to parents, including the provision of comfort care. More than 95% had no objection to withholding or withdrawing LST, with religion playing almost no part in these decisions. 38% of participants reported no objection to resuscitating an infant with trisomy 13 or 18; 40% of these neonatologists considered themselves very/moderately religious, 60% slightly/not at all religious. Eighty-nine neonatologists reported that their religious beliefs influence their medical practice. These physicians had similar responses as those not influenced by religion. CONCLUSION: For the majority of neonatologists participating in this study, differences in critical care practice cannot be attributed to personal religious or spiritual views.",2010,10.1089/jpm.2010.0049,13,10,1219-1224,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Logistic Models and Surveys and Questionnaires and Analysis of Variance and Morals and Infant, Newborn and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Decision Making/*ethics and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics and *Religion and *Spirituality and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/ethics/statistics & numerical data and *Neonatology and Critical Illness/*psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2010/10//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Information on whether existing models of integrated care are applicable to the home care system and how working procedures and skills of the palliative care teams might require adaptation is missing. AIM: To gain insight into differences between early and late involvement and the effect on existing working procedures and skills as perceived by palliative home care teams. DESIGN: Qualitative study - focus group interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Six palliative home care teams in Flanders, Belgium. Participants included physicians, nurses and psychologists. RESULTS: Differences were found concerning (1) reasons for initiation, (2) planning of care process, (3) focus on future goals versus problems, (4) opportunity to provide holistic care, (5) empowerment of patients and (6) empowerment of professional caregivers. A shift from a medical approach to a more holistic approach is the most noticeable. Being involved earlier also results in a more structured follow-up and in empowering the patient to be part of the decision-making process. Early involvement creates the need for transmural collaboration, which leads to the teams taking on more supporting and coordinating tasks. DISCUSSION: Being involved earlier leads to different tasks and working procedures and to the need for transmural collaboration.

It may influence the impact of end-of-life care on patients' relatives. We aimed to assess end-of-life care and communication from the perspective of intensive care unit staff and relate it to relatives' psychological symptoms. DESIGN: Prospective observational study based on consecutive patients with severe sepsis receiving end-of-life care; trial registration NCT01247792. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Four interdisciplinary intensive care units of a German University hospital. Responsible health personnel (attendings, residents and nurses) were questioned on the day of the first end-of-life decision (to withdraw or withhold life-supporting therapies) and after patients had died or were discharged. Relatives were interviewed by phone after 90 days. RESULTS: Overall, 145 patients, 610 caregiver responses (92% response) and 84 relative interviews (70% response) were analysed. Most (86%) end-of-life decisions were initiated by attendings and only 2% by nurses; 41% of nurses did not know enough about end-of-life decisions to communicate with relatives. Discomfort with end-of-life decisions was low. Relatives reported high satisfaction with decision-making and care, 87% thought their degree of involvement had been just right. However, 51%, 48% or 33% of relatives had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression, respectively. Predictors for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were patient age and relatives' gender. Relatives' satisfaction with medical care and communication predicted less anxiety (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Communication should be improved within the intensive care unit caregiver team to strengthen the involvement of nurses in end-of-life care.

This article describes end-of-life guidelines for hospital health care professionals caring for Orthodox Jewish patients and their families. Religious perspectives on advance directives, comfort care and pain control, nutrition and hydration, do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), and extubation are often unfamiliar to the American medical community. DESIGN: The guidelines for the care of the dying Orthodox Jewish patient were mutually agreed upon by the authors, recognized authorities in medicine, ethics, and Jewish law, who presented their perspectives during a 1-day symposium and who participated in an active working-group session. CONCLUSIONS: Care of the religious patient close to death is enormously complex especially when balancing religious obligations, the role of the rabbi, medical procedures, and personal preferences. These guidelines address from a religious perspective profound issues such as the definition of death, organ donation, and caring for the patient at life's end.

OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to describe the use and content of PICU FCs. DESIGN: The study design was a prospective chart review comparing patients who had conferences with those who did not, and a sub-analysis of patients with chronic care conditions (CCCs). SETTING/SUBJECTS: The study setting was an academic PICU from January 2011 through June 2011. MEASUREMENTS: Medical events under consideration were placement of tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube; initiation of chronic ventilation; palliative care involvement; use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation; care limitation orders; death; length of stay; and discharge to a new environment. RESULTS: From 661 admissions, we identified 74 conferences involving 49 patients. Sixty-four conferences (86%) were held about 40 patients with CCCs. Having a conference was associated with (p<0.05): length of PICU admission; palliative care involvement; initiation of chronic ventilation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; death; discharge to a new environment; and care limitation orders. Twenty-nine percent of patients who had a new tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube placed had a conference. We identified two categories of discussion topics: information exchange and future management.

OBJECTIVE: We developed a questionnaire to measure pediatric fellows' self-efficacy (comfort), knowledge, and perceived adequacy of prior medical education. We measured the questionnaire's reliability and validity. METHODS: The questionnaire contains questions regarding self-efficacy (23), knowledge (10), fellow's perceived adequacy of prior medical education (6), and demographics. The survey was developed with palliative care experts, and sent to fellows in U.S. pediatric cardiology, critical care, hematology/ oncology, and neonatal-perinatal medicine programs. Measures of reliability, internal consistency, and validity were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven fellows completed the survey at test and retest. The self-efficacy and medical education questionnaires showed high internal consistency of 0.95 and 0.84. The test-retest reliability for the Self-Efficacy Summary Score, measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted kappa, was 0.78 (item range 0.44-0.81) and 0.61 (item range 0.36-0.70), respectively. For the Adequacy of Medical Education Summary Score, ICC was 0.85 (item range 0.6-0.78) and weighted kappa was 0.63 (item range 0.47-0.62). Validity coefficients for these two questionnaires were 0.88 and 0.92. Fellows answered a mean of 8.8/10 knowledge questions correctly; percentage agreement ranged from 65% to 99%.

APPROACH: It is unique in that the approach has a strong counseling base in providing the palliative service, rather than major reliance on advance practice nurses or palliative physicians. The Medical Center of Central Georgia employs master's prepared counselors who spend the hours needed to assist families in making difficult end-of-life decisions. MODEL: Using a family systems therapy approach, these counselors have developed the Transitions and Palliative Care Therapy Model, which has proved to be a successful means of providing the services. The model includes the ""7 Core Components of Communication and Decision Making,"" which gives the counselors actual interventions to use in working through these complex cases. OUTCOMES: The growth of the program over 7 years is staggering with the outcomes far exceeding even the predicted volume from the Center to Advance Palliative Care. CONCLUSIONS: The model has the counselor at the heart of the team, keeping the communication open and flowing. The Transitions and Palliative Care Therapy Model has become an accepted standard of practice at Medical Center of Central Georgia and continues to be a successful means of managing the most complex cases in the hospital.",2011,10.1089/jpm.2010.0432,14,4,491-500,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Diffusion of Innovation and Models, Theoretical and Georgia and *Hospitals and *Professional Role and *Palliative Care and Counseling/*organization & administration and Family Therapy",NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that providing communication skills training to cardiologists is feasible and improves their perceived preparedness (PP) for leading difficult conversations. METHODS: CardioTalk is a workshop to improve communication through short didactic sessions followed by interactions with standardized patients. Competencies include giving bad news, defining goals of care, responding to emotion, supporting religious beliefs, and withdrawing therapies. Settings/Subjects: First year cardiology fellows, heart failure fellows, and cardiac intensive care unit attendings. MEASUREMENTS: Surveys evaluated the curriculum's efficacy and learners' PP before and after the workshop. RESULTS: Eight cardiology attendings and 20 cardiology fellows participated. Eighty-nine percent reported having any prior education in communication. Fellows reported more prior education than attendings (100% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.017). Level of PP improved in all competencies for all learners. Ninety-six percent of respondents would recommend the training to peers.

Despite this prevalence, there are inconsistencies in attitudes toward, and delivery of, neonatal palliative care. Implementing neonatal palliative care practice requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative effort. Objective: To examine institutional and individual barriers to and facilitators of neonatal palliative care from both medical and nursing perspectives. Design/Setting/Subjects: A prospective cross-sectional study design was used to collect data using the Neonatal Palliative Care Attitude Scale (NiPCAS) survey from medical providers and nurses in a 64-bed level IV neonatal intensive care unit in the United States. The response rate was 67%. Measurements: The NiPCAS survey included 26 attitudinal questions on a Likert scale. The instrument included three subscales: organization, resources, and clinician, in addition to other questions. Results: Six facilitators to neonatal palliative care were identified: (1) support of palliative care by the health care team, (2) support of palliative care by medical and nursing practice, (3) agreement that palliative care is as important as curative care, (4) parental involvement in decision making, (5) recognition of the importance of palliative care education, and (6) prioritizing pain relief. Three barriers to neonatal palliative care were highlighted: (1) a physical environment that is not conducive to providing palliative care, (2) technological obligations and parental demands, and (3) the societal belief that babies should not die. In addition, there were differences between medical and nursing staffs' attitudes on several topics. Conclusions: Several facilitators and barriers of neonatal palliative care were identified.

METHODS: Participants were parents of children who had enrolled in a prospective cohort study on parental decision-making for children receiving pediatric palliative care. Sixty-four (88%) of the 73 parents interviewed were asked an open-ended question on how religion, spirituality, or life philosophy (RSLP) was helpful in difficult times. Responses were coded and thematically organized utilizing qualitative data analysis methods. Any discrepancies amongst coders regarding codes or themes were resolved through discussion that reached consensus. RESULTS: Most parents of children receiving palliative care felt that RSLP was important in helping them deal with tough times, and most parents reported either participation in formal religious communities, or a sense of personal spirituality. A minority of parents, however, did not wish to discuss the topic at all. For those who described their RSLP, their beliefs and practices were associated with qualities of their overall outlook on life, questions of goodness and human capacity, or that ""everything happens for a reason."" RSLP was also important in defining the child's value and beliefs about the child's afterlife. Prayer and reading the bible were important spiritual practices in this population, and parents felt that these practices influenced their perspectives on the medical circumstances and decision-making, and their locus of control. From religious participation and practices, parents felt they received support from both their spiritual communities and from God, peace and comfort, and moral guidance. Some parents, however, also reported questioning their faith, feelings of anger and blame towards God, and rejecting religious beliefs or communities.

DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited through five hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants took part. Results confirmed and added depth of understanding to domains previously identified as important for optimal hospital palliative care, including: Effective communication and shared decision making; Expert care; Adequate environment for care; Family involvement in care provision; Financial affairs; Maintenance of sense of self/identity; Minimising burden; Respectful and compassionate care; Trust and confidence in clinicians and Maintenance of patient safety. Two additional domains were noted to be important: Nutritional needs; and Access to medical and nursing specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Taking a person-centred focus has provided a deeper understanding of how to strengthen inpatient palliative care practices. Future work is needed to translate the body of evidence on patient priorities into policy reforms and practice points.",2020,10.1177/0269216320947570,34,10,1402-1415,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,Hospitals and Humans and Australia and qualitative research and Palliative care and patient-centred care and Qualitative Research and hospital and New South Wales and *Inpatients and *Palliative Care and terminal care and consumer participation,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Haines_2019_Joofpame,JOUR,Factors That Impact Family Perception of Goal-Concordant Care at the End of Life,"Haines, Lindsay and Rahman, Omari-Khalid and Sanders, Justin J. and Johnson, Kimberly and Kelley, Amy",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: Goal-concordant care (GCC)-care aligned with a patient's known goals and values-is a measure of the quality of end-of-life (EOL) care that can be assessed by surveying family members after a patient's death. It is unknown whether patient characteristics affect this measure. Objective: The objective of the article was to examine family report of GCC and its associations with patient characteristics. Methods: Using the Health and Retirement Study, which is a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort of adults over age 50, we sampled decedents whose family completed the 2014 postdeath interview. Families reported frequency of GCC at the EOL. A multivariable regression model assessed the associations between family report of GCC and decedent characteristics. Results: Of 1175 respondents, 76% reported that the decedent ""usually"" or ""always"" received GCC. Proxy report of GCC was independently associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.03), having three or more chronic medical conditions (AOR 1.34, CI 1.02-1.77), the presence of written or verbal advance care planning (ACP) (AOR 1.38, CI 1.02-1.88), and an interaction term of race and ability to participate in EOL decision making (AOR 3.83, CI 1.02-14.40). African American race was not independently associated with GCC (AOR 0.73, CI 0.5-1.06). Conclusion: Family's report of GCC is associated with ACP, age, and multimorbidity. Being African American and perceived as able to participate in EOL decision making was significantly associated with report of GCC. Bringing the patient's voice into EOL care discussions through upstream ACP with likely surrogates may be particularly important to improving GCC for African Americans.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2018.0508,22,8,927-932,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"Michigan and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Longitudinal Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Cohort Studies and patient satisfaction and Aged, 80 and over and Caregivers/*psychology and Family/*psychology and Quality of Health Care/*organization & administration and Patient Preference/*psychology and advance care planning and *Organizational Objectives and goal-concordant care and Terminal Care/*organization & administration/*psychology",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study correlates physicians' own racial background, clinical experience, and cultural sensitivity training with their attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of advance care planning issues for African American patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report questionnaire was distributed to 236 physicians at three major teaching hospitals. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of all surveys were returned (183/236). The respondent racial characteristics were 53% white, 28% Asian, and 17% black. While 72% of physicians agreed that different ethnic groups have distinct attitudes towards advance directives, 58% acknowledged lack of familiarity with end-of-life preferences of African American patients. Black physicians (African American and non-U.S.-born) rated the cultural sensitivity training they received on a 0-10 Likert-type scale as 5.43 (n=28) versus a 3.74 rating by white physicians (n=91; p=0.022). Black physicians (African American and non-U.S.-born, n=27) rated their familiarity with advance care planning preferences of African Americans as 5.89 and white physicians (n=90) rated theirs as 4.14 on a 10-point Likert-type scale (p=0.002). Finally, 88% of U.S.-born black physicians (7/8) versus 35% of white physicians (32/91) perceived that the Tuskegee experiment has impacted African American medical decision-making (p=0.014). Similarly, a greater proportion of African American physicians perceived that the Tuskegee experiment has impacted African American medical decision making, compared to non-U.S.-born black physicians (88% (7/8) versus 26% (5/19), p=0.008). CONCLUSION: The majority of the physicians surveyed routinely provide end-of-life care and believe they are aware of racial differences in advance care planning. Yet, most were unfamiliar with specific end-of-life preferences of African American patients.

AIM: The study aimed at identifying key components of paediatric advance care planning through direct discussions with all involved parties. DESIGN: The study had a qualitative design with a participatory approach. Participants constituted an advisory board and took part in two transdisciplinary workshops. Data were collected in discussion and dialogue groups and analysed using content analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We included bereaved parents, health care providers and stakeholders of care networks. RESULTS: Key elements were discussions, documentation, implementation, timing and participation of children and adolescents. Parents engage in discussions with facilitators and persons of trust to reach a decision. Documentation constitutes the focus of professionals, who endorse brief recommendations for procedures in case of emergencies, supplemented by larger advance directives. Implementation hindrances include emotional barriers of stakeholders, disagreements between parents and professionals and difficulties with emergency services. Discussion timing should take into account parental readiness. The intervention should be repeated at regular intervals, considering emerging needs and increasing awareness of families over time. Involving children and adolescents in advance care planning remains a challenge. CONCLUSION: A paediatric advance care planning intervention should take into account potential pitfalls and barriers including issues related to timing, potential conflicts between parents and professionals, ambiguity towards written advance directives, the role of non-medical carers for paediatric advance care planning implementation, the need to involve the child and the necessity of an iterative process.",2020,10.1177/0269216319900317,34,3,300-308,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,decision-making and Humans and Qualitative Research and *Pediatrics and Health Personnel/*psychology and *Advance Care Planning and Parents/*psychology and palliative care and Advance care planning and advance directives and paediatrics and Stakeholder Participation/*psychology,NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 370 patients who were followed by a palliative home care team. Twenty-nine of 245 patients (12%) who died at home had received palliative sedation. The mean age of the patients who received palliative sedation was 58 +/- 17 years, and the mean age of the patients who did not receive palliative sedation was 69 +/- 15 years (p = 0.002). No other differences were detected between patients who did or did not receive palliative sedation. The most common indications for palliative sedation were delirium (62%) and dyspnea (14%). Twenty-seven patients (93%) received midazolam for palliative sedation (final mean dose of 74 mg), and two (7%) received levomepromazine (final mean dose of 125 mg). The mean time between palliative sedation initiation and time of death was 2.6 days. In 13 of the cases (45%), the palliative sedation decision was made with the patient and his or her family members, and in another 13 patients (45%), the palliative sedation decision was made only with the patient's family members.

Intensive care units (ICU) focus on survival, which may not be an appropriate setting to provide palliative care (PC) as needed by cancer patients and families. OBJECTIVE: To describe the cancer patients who died in the ICU in 2010 in a French academic medical center. DESIGN: Retrospective study Measurements: We reviewed medical records of all cancer patients who died in the ICU in 2010. The information collected from electronic medical records included patient sociodemographics and clinical characteristics, PC service referral, and the date of first contact with PC. RESULTS: Among the 536 cancer patients who died in 2010, 42 (8%) died in the ICU. The cancers were hematological (21%), gastrointestinal (21%) and head and neck (21%). One patient had a PC referral versus 45% in the total population (p < 0.001) and the referral was the same day as the death. Eight (19%) patients had chemotherapy during their last month of life and 2 during the ICU hospitalization. Seventy-four per cent of patient admissions to the ICU related directly to malignancy. The mean time between diagnosis of cancer and death was 2.3 years (standard deviation, 4.4).

Their perspectives on these topics are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the perspectives of individuals with serious physical disabilities receiving care from two different healthcare delivery settings on the value of AD and ACP. DESIGN: Key informant interviews were conducted, audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis and constant comparative analysis. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five adults with serious physical disabilities were interviewed. RESULTS: Five organizing themes emerged as follows: (A) AD is a right versus responsibility, (B) past medical experiences influence ACP engagement, (C) ACP requires relationship-centered decision support, (D) concerns for care after death, and (E) suggestions for improving ACP experiences. Participants wished to engage in a relationship-centered approach to ACP, yet voiced hesitation due to experiences of significant medical bias and mistreatment, typically surrounding judgments of their quality of life.

Berns_2017_Joofpame,JOUR,Goals of Care Ambulatory Resident Education: Training Residents in Advance Care Planning Conversations in the Outpatient Setting,"Berns, Stephen H. and Camargo, Marianne and Meier, Diane E. and Yuen, Jacqueline K.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) discussions often occur in the inpatient setting when patients are too ill to participate in decision making. Although the outpatient setting is the preferred time to begin these discussions, few physicians do so in practice. Many internal medicine (IM) residents report inadequate training as a barrier to having outpatient ACP discussions. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a novel curriculum entitled Goals of Care Ambulatory Resident Education (GOCARE) improved resident physicians' understanding of and preparedness for conducting ACP discussions in the outpatient setting. DESIGN: The curriculum was delivered over four weekly three-hour small group sessions to IM residents. Each session included didactics, a demonstration of skills, and a simulated patient communication laboratory that emphasized deliberate practice. SETTING/SUBJECTS: IM residents from an urban, academic ambulatory care practice. MEASUREMENTS: Impact of the intervention was evaluated using a retrospective pre-post design. Residents completed surveys immediately after the course and six months later. RESULTS: Forty-two residents participated in the curriculum and 95% completed the postcourse survey. Residents' self-rated level of preparedness increased for ACP discussions overall (4.0 pre vs. 5.2 post on 7-point Likert scale) and for communication steps involved in ACP (p < 0.001). Fifty-nine percent of participants completed the six-month follow-up survey. Residents' self-rated preparedness to engage in outpatient ACP discussions remained high (4.5 pre vs. 5.5 post at six months p < 0.001).

Despite the suggestion that younger people with dementia and their family might have distinct needs and preferences in this area, studies on advance care planning in young-onset dementia are absent. AIM: We aim to explore (1) whether family caregivers had already engaged in advance care planning with patients and/ or professionals and the accompanying reasons and (2) family caregivers' preferences for how to ideally engage in the process with patients, family and professionals. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted: we analysed semi-structured interviews (n = 15) through the method of constant comparative analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We included Flemish family caregivers of persons with young-onset dementia. RESULTS: Plans for the future typically concerned non-medical affairs. Participants' limited engagement in advance care planning was clarified through several reasons: not considering it useful, hindering patient behaviour, adopting a day-to-day attitude, caregivers emotionally protecting themselves and uncertainty about patients' cognitive competence. However, endorsement for advance care planning showed from respondents' preferences that it should be initiated timely, by a third party, and emphasize patients' remaining capacities. Finally, the need for information and high-quality care emerged. CONCLUSION: A gap of knowledge, of information and in care intertwiningly hinder advance care planning. In young-onset dementia, engaging in advance care planning is not an option equally accessible as not doing so.

Thus far, this topic has received little systematic attention. AIM: To summarise studies describing self-management strategies of patients with advanced cancer and associated experiences and personal characteristics.

Data were analysed using critical interpretive synthesis. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and quality of reporting. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and Google Scholar (until 11 June 2019). RESULTS: Of 1742 identified articles, 31 moderate-quality articles describing 8 quantitative and 23 qualitative studies were included. Patients with advanced cancer used self-management strategies in seven domains: medicine and pharmacology, lifestyle, mental health, social support, knowledge and information, navigation and coordination and medical decision-making (29 articles). Strategies were highly individual, sometimes ambivalent and dependent on social interactions. Older patients and patients with more depressive symptoms and lower levels of physical functioning, education and self-efficacy might have more difficulties with certain self-management strategies (six articles). Healthcare professionals perceived self-management as desirable and achievable if based on sufficient skills and knowledge and solid patient-professional partnerships (three articles).

METHODS: We interviewed surrogate decision makers for patients aged 50 and over, using a structured questionnaire that included a four-question CPR knowledge assessment similar to those used in previous studies. Surrogates in the post-intervention arm viewed a three-minute video decision support tool about CPR before completing the knowledge assessment and completed questions about perceived value of the video. RESULTS: We recruited 23 surrogates during the first three months (pre-intervention arm) and 27 surrogates during the latter three months of the study (post-intervention arm). Surrogates viewing the video had more knowledge about CPR (p=0.008); average scores were 2.0 (SD 1.1) and 2.9 (SD 1.2) (out of a total of 4) in pre-intervention and post-intervention arms.

Efforts to moderate intensive end-of-life care may be facilitated by early identification of those at greatest risk for receiving such care. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with intensive end-of-life medical care utilization in nursing home residents with severe cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Retrospective review of existing Medicare data: 1998-2001 Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare Denominator, MedPAR, and hospice files. METHODS: Subjects were Minnesota and Texas nursing home residents from rural and urban counties (USDA metro-nonmetro continuum codes: 0-2 urban, 6-9 rural), who had severe cognitive impairment and who died during 2000-2001. Hospice and managed care enrollees were excluded. High medical care users were defined as subjects with 7+ intensive care unit (ICU) days in the last 90 days of life. Measures of end-of-life medical care utilization intensity included tube feeding on the last MDS report, number of hospital and ICU days, and total hospital charges during the study period. RESULTS: The study population included 1494 nursing home residents who were hospitalized within 90 days prior to death; 82 (5%) met the high medical care user criteria.

Yet, data are lacking on the communication patterns within this model of care. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to describe the content of patient-clinician discussions among patients receiving PC and to compare differences in discussion content between oncologists and PC clinicians. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative observational analysis. SETTING/SUBJECTS: We included patients with incurable lung and esophageal cancer enrolled in a randomized trial of early, integrated PC versus usual oncology care. We analyzed 68 audio-recorded clinic visits (34 oncologist visits; 34 PC clinician visits) immediately after patients' (N = 19) first and second cancer progressions. We examined themes of clinician communication, comparing the content and frequency of discussions between oncologists and PC clinicians. RESULTS: Although both oncology and PC clinicians discussed symptom management, medical understanding, and treatment decision making with patients at nearly all postprogression visits, PC clinicians tended to assess patient understanding of the treatment process and prognosis more often than oncologists. PC clinicians addressed patient coping, caregiver experiences and needs, and advance care planning more frequently than oncologists. CONCLUSION: PC clinicians play a distinct, complementary role to oncologists in providing care for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers.

Within-group variations, however, may exist based on level of acculturation. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which EOL treatment factors (EOL treatment preferences and physician-caregiver communication) and select psychosocial factors (mental health, complementary therapies, and internal and external social support) differ based on the level of acculturation of caregivers of patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven primary caregivers of patients with advanced cancer were interviewed as part of the multisite, prospective Coping with Cancer Study. RESULTS: Caregivers who were less acculturated were more positively predisposed to use of a feeding tube at EOL (odds ratio [OR] 0.99 [p = 0.05]), were more likely to perceive that they received too much information from their doctors (OR 0.95 [p = 0.05]), were less likely to use mental health services (OR 1.03 [p = 0.003] and OR 1.02 [p = 0.02]), and desire additional services (OR 1.03 [p = 0.10] to 1.05 [p = 0.009]) than their more acculturated counterparts. Additionally, caregivers who were less acculturated cared for patients who were less likely to report having a living will (OR 1.03 [p = 0.0003]) or durable power of attorney for health care (OR 1.02 [p = 0.007]) than more acculturated caregivers. Caregivers who were less acculturated felt their religious and spiritual needs were supported by both the community (beta -0.28 [p = 0.0003]) and medical system (beta -0.38 [p < 0.0001]), had higher degrees of self-efficacy (beta -0.22 [p = 0.005]), and had stronger family relationships and support (beta -0.27 [p = 0.0004]).

Dillon_2019_Joofpame,JOUR,Surgeon Perspectives Regarding Death and Dying,"Dillon, Brendan R. and Healy, Mark A. and Lee, Christina W. and Reichstein, Ari C. and Silveira, Maria J. and Morris, Arden M. and Suwanabol, Pasithorn A.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Surgical patients most commonly receive palliative care services within 24-48 hours of death, and reasons for this delay are poorly understood. Research with nonsurgeons suggests that physician characteristics and beliefs about death and dying may contribute to late referral. OBJECTIVE: To describe surgeon perspectives related to death and dying, and their relationship with delayed referrals to palliative care. DESIGN: Using a previously validated survey instrument supplemented by open-ended questions, deductive content analysis was used to describe surgeon preferences for end-of-life care. SETTINGS: Participants were all current nonretired members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgeon descriptions of a ""good death"" and how personal experiences influence care provided. RESULTS: Among 131 survey respondents (response rate 16.5%), 117 (89.3%) completed all or part of the qualitative portion of the survey. Respondents consistently reported their personal preferences for end-of-life care, and four central themes emerged: (1) pain and symptom management, (2) clear decision making, (3) avoidance of medical care, and (4) completion. Surgeons also reflected on both good and bad experiences with patients and family members dying, and how these experiences impact practice. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size inherent to Internet surveys may limit generalizability and contribute to selection bias. CONCLUSION: This study reveals surgeon preferences for end-of-life care, which may inform initiatives aimed at surgeons who may underuse or delay palliative care services. Future studies are needed to better understand how surgeon preferences may directly impact treatment recommendations for their patients.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2018.0197,22,2,132-137,eng,1557-7740,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and surgery and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Terminal Care/*psychology and perspective and *Attitude to Death and palliative care and end-of-life care and Palliative Care/*psychology and death and surgeon and Hospice Care/*psychology and Surgeons/*psychology,NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Waldrop_2018_Joofpame,JOUR,Mediating Systems of Care: Emergency Calls to Long-Term Care Facilities at Life's End,"Waldrop, Deborah P. and McGinley, Jacqueline M. and Clemency, Brian",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) residents account for over 2.2 million emergency department visits yearly; the majority are cared for and transported by prehospital providers (emergency medical technicians and paramedics). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate prehospital providers' perceptions of emergency calls at life's end. This article focuses on perceptions of end-of-life calls in long-term care (LTC). DESIGN: This pilot study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. Concepts from the symbolic interaction theory guided the exploration of perceptions and interpretations of emergency calls in LTC facilities. SETTING/SUBJECTS: A purposeful sample of prehospital providers was developed from one agency in a small northeastern U.S. city. MEASUREMENTS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 43 prehospital providers to explore their perceptions of factors that trigger emergency end-of-life calls in LTC facilities. Qualitative data analysis involved iterative coding in an inductive process that included open, systematic, focused, and axial coding. RESULTS: Interview themes illustrated the contributing factors as follows: care crises; dying-related turmoil; staffing ratios; and organizational protocols. Distress was crosscutting and present in all four themes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings illuminate how prehospital providers become mediators between NHs and emergency departments by managing tension, conflict, and challenges in patient care between these systems and suggest the importance of further exploration of interactions between LTC staff, prehospital providers, and emergency departments. Enhanced communication between LTC facilities and prehospital providers is important to address potentially inappropriate calls and transport requests and to identify means for collaboration in the care of sick frail residents.",2018,10.1089/jpm.2017.0332,21,7,987-991,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Pilot Projects and emergency medical services and New England and *Attitude of Health Personnel and long-term care and Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data and *Attitude to Death and Terminal Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Allied Health Personnel/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data and end-of-life decision making and Homes for the Aged/statistics & numerical data and Long-Term Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Nursing Homes/supply & distribution,NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rodriguez_2007_Joofpame,JOUR,Perceptions and utilization of palliative care services in acute care hospitals,"Rodriguez, Keri L. and Barnato, Amber E. and Arnold, Robert M.",Journal of palliative medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To understand perceptions of palliative care in acute care hospitals and identify barriers to earlier use of palliative care in the illness trajectory. METHODS: In Pennsylvania hospitals, we completed semistructured interviews with 131 providers involved in decision making or discharge planning. We used qualitative methods to analyze transcripts. RESULTS: Most interviewees characterized palliative care as end-of-life or hospice care that is initiated after the decision to limit curative treatment is made. Few recognized the role of palliative care in managing symptoms and addressing psychosocial needs of patients with chronic illnesses other than cancer. Interviewees viewed earlier and broader palliative care consultations less in terms of clinical benefits than in terms of cost savings accrued from shorter terminal hospitalizations. In general, they thought nurses were most likely to facilitate these consultations, surgeons were most likely to resist them, and intensive care specialists were most likely to view palliative care as within their own scope of practice. Suggestions for broadening palliative care utilization included providing education and training, improving financial reimbursement and sustainability for palliative care, and fostering a hospital culture that turns to high-intensity care only if it meets individual needs and goals of chronically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: In acute care hospitals, palliative care is primarily perceived as a means to limit life-sustaining treatment or allow death. Moving consultation earlier in the hospitalization of ""dying"" patients is a greater preoccupation than increasing palliative service use earlier in the illness trajectory. Any move short of far upstream will require palliative care specialists to market benefits to patients and referring providers in ways that emphasize compatibility with parallel treatment plans and do not threaten provider autonomy.",2007,10.1089/jpm.2006.0155,10,1,110-99,eng,1096-6218 1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Chronic Disease and Pennsylvania and Health Care Surveys and Interviews as Topic and Organizational Policy and Social Work and Critical Illness and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Terminal Care/*methods and Palliative Care/*statistics & numerical data and Medical Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Hospital Units/*standards",NA,NA,2007/02//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Escher_2021_Pallmedi,JOUR,Physicians' predictions of long-term survival and functional outcomes do not influence the decision to admit patients with advanced disease to intensive care: A prospective study,"Escher, Monica and Nendaz, Mathieu and Scherer, Fabienne and Cullati, Stephane and Perneger, Thomas",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Long-term survival and functional outcomes should influence admission decisions to intensive care, especially for patients with advanced disease. AIM: To determine whether physicians' predictions of long-term prognosis influenced admission decisions for patients with and without advanced disease. DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted. Physicians estimated patient survival with intensive care and with care on the ward, and the probability of 4 long-term outcomes: leaving hospital alive, survival at 6 months, recovery of functional status, and recovery of cognitive status. Patient mortality at 28 days was recorded. We built multivariate logistic regression models using admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) as the dependent variable. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: ICU consultations for medical inpatients at a Swiss tertiary care hospital were included. RESULTS: Of 201 evaluated patients, 105 (52.2%) had an advanced disease and 140 (69.7%) were admitted to the ICU. The probability of admission was strongly associated with the expected short-term survival benefit for patients with or without advanced disease. In contrast, the predicted likelihood that the patient would leave the hospital alive, would be alive 6 months later, would recover functional status, and would recover initial cognitive capacity was not associated with the decision to admit a patient to the ICU. Even for patients with advanced disease, none of these estimated outcomes influenced the admission decision. CONCLUSIONS: ICU admissions of patients with advanced disease were determined by short-term survival benefit, and not by long-term prognosis. Advance care planning and developing decision-aid tools for triage could help limit potentially inappropriate admissions to intensive care.",2021,10.1177/0269216320963931,35,1,161-168,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,Hospitalization and Humans and decision making and Prospective Studies and Palliative care and Patient Admission and Intensive Care Units and *Physicians and *Critical Care and patient admission and prognosis and end of life and intensive care and prospective study,NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

R.",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Advance directives and palliative crisis cards are means by which palliative care patients can exert their autonomy in end-of-life decisions. AIM: To examine paramedics' attitudes towards advance directives and end-of-life care. DESIGN: Questionnaire-based investigation using a self-administered survey instrument. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Paramedics of two cities (Hamburg and Goettingen, Germany) were included. Participants were questioned as to (1) their attitudes about advance directives, (2) their clinical experiences in connection with end-of-life situations (e.g. resuscitation), (3) their suggestions in regard to advance directives, 'Do not attempt resuscitation' orders and palliative crisis cards. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 728 paramedics (response rate: 81%). The majority of paramedics (71%) had dealt with advance directives and end-of-life decisions in emergency situations. Most participants (84%) found that cardiopulmonary resuscitation in end-of-life patients is not useful and 75% stated that they would withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the case of legal possibility. Participants also mentioned that more extensive discussion of legal aspects concerning advance directives should be included in paramedic training curricula. They suggested that palliative crisis cards should be integrated into end-of-life care. CONCLUSIONS: Decision making in prehospital end-of-life care is a challenge for all paramedics. The present investigation demonstrates that a dialogue bridging emergency medical and palliative care issues is necessary. The paramedics indicated that improved guidelines on end-of-life decisions and the termination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in palliative care patients may be essential.

Carter_2007_Joofpame,JOUR,Utility of morbidity and mortality conference in end-of-life education in the neonatal intensive care unit,"Carter, Brian Scott and Guthrie, Scott Osborn",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: A monthly neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) morbidity and mortality conference (M&MC) was used to study the documentation of end-of-life (EOL) care, and integrate related education for staff and trainees. OBJECTIVE: To study the current documentation of comprehensive, interdisciplinary, palliative EOL care in the NICU at the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital and improve it relative to a historical background. DESIGN/METHODS: A survey tool was developed and used at all neonatal M&MCs for 1 year (August 2003 through July 2004), in conducting a prospective chart audit of 50% of NICU deaths. The survey ascertained documentation of EOL care to include the anticipation of death by family and staff; provision of pain management; discussion of ethical and EOL decision-making issues; and the use of supportive services. Clinical education and literature references pertaining to these elements of care were presented in the conferences. RESULTS: Twenty-six surveys were completed (48% of deaths in NICU over the study period). Documentation of EOL care ranged from excellent (pain management, 100%) to poor (spiritual support, 54%). Documentation of all other measures varied from 69% to 92%. Staff and trainees reported educational enhancement of the M&MC, and greater awareness of issues important to EOL care throughout this period. CONCLUSIONS: Areas for improving EOL care exist in the NICU. The M&MC is a familiar venue for incorporating EOL care education for staff and trainees.

METHODS: Goals of care were elicited from the parents and children with complex, life-limiting conditions during initial palliative care consultation. Data abstracted included: diagnoses, demographics, time from diagnosis until initial palliative care consult, spirituality status, resuscitative status, and disposition at discharge. Goals of care were categorized into one of four quality-of-life domains: 1) physical health and independence, 2) psychological and spiritual, 3) social, and 4) environment. Summary statistics were prepared and comparisons were made between the four categories of goals. Descriptive statistics were utilized to explore potential associations with a decision to pursue full medical support. RESULTS: One hundred and forty goals of care were obtained from 50 patients/parents. The median patient age was 4.6 years. Thirty-seven patients had significant cognitive delay/impairment. Neuromuscular disorders accounted for more than half of the diagnoses. Forty-nine patients identified at least one goal pertaining to physical health and independence. This was significantly more than any other category (p < 0.0001). Thirty-three of the 50 patients (66%) opted for full medical support at the time of initial consult.

O.Hanlon_2018_Joofpame,JOUR,A Framework to Guide Economic Analysis of Advance Care Planning,"O'Hanlon, Claire E. and Walling, Anne M. and Okeke, Edward and Stevenson, Sharon and Wenger, Neil S.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) is fundamental to guiding medical care at the end of life. Understanding the economic impact of ACP is critical to implementation, but most economic evaluations of ACP focus on only a few actors, such as hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To develop a framework for understanding and quantifying the economic effects of ACP, particularly its distributional consequences, for use in economic evaluations. DESIGN: Literature review of economic analyses of ACP and related costs to estimate magnitude and direction of costs and benefits for each actor and how data on these costs and benefits could be obtained or estimated. RESULTS: ACP can lead to more efficient allocation of resources by reducing low-value care and reallocating resources to high-value care, and can increase welfare by aligning care to patient preferences. This economic framework considers the costs and benefits of ACP that accrue to or are borne by six actors: the patient, the patient's family and caregivers, healthcare providers, acute care settings, subacute and home care settings, and payers. Program implementation costs and nonhealthcare costs, such as time costs borne by patients and caregivers, are included. Findings suggest that out-of-pocket costs for patients and families will likely change if subacute or home care is substituted for acute care, and subacute care utilization is likely to increase while primary healthcare providers and acute care settings may experience heterogeneous effects. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive economic evaluation of ACP should consider how costs and benefits accrue to different actors.",2018,10.1089/jpm.2018.0041,21,10,1480-1485,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Costs and Cost Analysis and *Decision Making and *Models, Economic and medical economics and end-of-life care and advance care planning and Terminal Care/*economics and Advance Care Planning/*economics and costs and cost analysis and healthcare economics and organizations",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rory",Journal of palliative medicine,"Nearly 20% of cancer patients develop symptomatic spine metastases. Metastatic spine tumors are most commonly extradural tumors that grow quickly and often cause persistent pain, weakness, paresthesias, urinary/bowel dysfunction, and/or paralysis. Surgical intervention aims to achieve more effective pain management, preserve/restore neurological function, provide local tumor control, and stabilize the spinal column. The desired result of treatment is ultimately to improve a patient's quality of life. Neurosurgeons employ multiple decision frameworks and grading scales to assess the need and effectiveness of a variety of surgical interventions ranging from minimally to maximally invasive. Likewise, palliative care offers an array of treatment options that allows the best, individualized plan to be determined for a given patient. Therefore, crossfunctional collaboration between palliative care, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and neurosurgery is crucial both in the maximization of available treatment options and optimization of quality of life for patients.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2018.0608,22,1,84-89,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,Humans and Decision Making and Quality of Life and Health Personnel and Pain Management and Palliative Care/*methods and neurosurgery and extradural tumors and intradural tumors and metastatic spinal tumors and palliative treatment and Spinal Neoplasms/*secondary/*therapy and spinal tumors,NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: This cross-sectional, mixed methods online study explores the concept of the bucket list and seeks to identify common bucket list themes. Data were collected in 2015-2016 through an online survey, which was completed by a total of 3056 participants across the United States. Forty participants who had a bucket list were identified randomly and used as the development cohort: their responses were analyzed qualitatively using grounded theory methods to identify the six key bucket list themes. The responses of the remaining 3016 participants were used for the validation study. The codes identified from the development cohort were validated by analyses of responses from 50 randomly drawn subjects from the validation cohort. All the 3016 validation cohort transcripts were coded for presence or absence of each of the six bucket list themes. RESULTS: Around 91.2% participants had a bucket list. Age and spirituality influence the patient's bucket-list. Participants who reported that faith/religion/spirituality was important to them were most likely (95%) to have a bucket list compared with those who reported it to be unimportant (68.2%), <cf><87>(2) = 37.67.

Wastila_2014_Joofpame,JOUR,Residents' perceptions about surrogate decision makers' financial conflicts of interest in ventilator withdrawal,"Wastila, Lisa J. and Farber, Neil J.",Journal of palliative medicine,"PURPOSE: There have been no studies to date that examine physicians' decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment for patients based on their surrogates' financial gain. The authors' objective was to ascertain physician attitudes about withdrawing life-sustaining treatment when financial considerations are involved. METHODS: A survey was developed and pretested containing eight scenarios in which a terminally ill patient's spouse had a decision to make regarding withdrawal of the ventilator, which was deemed medically futile. Nested variables included agreement or disagreement between the spouse and patient, decision to withdraw or continue the ventilator, and financial gain or no financial gain for the spouse. The authors surveyed all internal medicine residents at the University of California, San Diego in the autumn of 2011 and winter of 2012. The responses on each of the three variables for which respondents were likely to withdraw the ventilator were analyzed via student's t-tests. RESULTS: Residents were more likely to withdraw the ventilator when requested to do so than when it was requested to be continued. They were also more likely to withdraw the ventilator when there was agreement in the decision between the spouse and the patient. Residents were more likely to withdraw the ventilator when the spouse would not benefit financially. CONCLUSIONS: Internal medicine residents make some decisions about whether to withdraw life-sustaining treatment based on financial considerations.

Given the value that patient surrogates place on the physician's perception of prognosis, understanding prognostic indicators that influence clinical judgment of outcomes is critical. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the patient variables and comorbid illnesses associated with DNR orders placed on patients within 72 hours after ICH. DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective review of medical records of 198 consecutive patients with an admission diagnosis of primary supratentorial ICH between July 2007 and December 2010. SUBJECTS: Patients who did not experience a DNR order placement during their primary admission for ICH (non-DNR group) were compared to patients who received a new DNR order in the first 72 hours of admission (DNR group). MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics obtained include demographic data, past medical history, clinical data pertaining to the admission for the ICH, and radiographic images. Demographic, medical, and ICH injury data during the first three days of admission were collected. RESULTS: Multiple differences in patient and hospital factors were found between patients receiving a new, early DNR order and those who did not receive a DNR order after ICH. In regression modeling, Caucasian race, direct admission, and higher ICH score were associated with placement of a new DNR order early in the course of injury.

Lin_2020_Pallmedi,JOUR,Feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted advance care planning intervention for people living with advanced cancer and their families: A mixed methods study,"Lin, Cheng-Pei and Evans, Catherine J. and Koffman, Jonathan and Chen, Ping-Jen and Hou, Ming-Feng and Harding, Richard",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows that advance care planning is effective in improving outcomes. However, its applicability and acceptability outside Western cultures remain unknown. Examination of relevant cultural adaptations is required prior to wider adoption. AIM: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted advance care planning intervention in a Taiwanese inpatient hospital for advanced cancer patients, family members and healthcare professionals. METHODS: A single-group, non-controlled, mixed methods feasibility study guided by a previously developed logic model. The culturally adapted advance care planning intervention represented a one-time intervention, comprising pre-advance care planning preparation and follow-up consultation. Qualitative interviews explored participants' view on their involvement in the study. Patients' medical records were examined to assess intervention fidelity. Findings from both data sets were integrated following analysis. RESULTS: N = 29 participants (n = 10 patients; n = 10 family members and n = 9 healthcare professionals) participated in the intervention, of who 28 completed follow-up interviews. Of the 10 advance care planning interventions delivered, most components (n = 10/13) were met. Key contextual moderators influencing the intervention feasibility included: (1) resource constraints resulting in increased workload; (2) care decisions informed by relatives' experiences of care; (3) the requirement for financial and policy support; and (4) a presumption for end-of-life care provision and surrogate decision-making. Six areas of intervention refinement were identified for future research. CONCLUSION: Implementing a culturally adapted advance care planning intervention in an inpatient hospital setting in Taiwan is possible. The participants reported the intervention to be acceptable. However, careful attention to the conceptual underpinning using local primary data is imperative for its success.",2020,10.1177/0269216320902666,34,5,651-666,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,Humans and Feasibility Studies and Family and cancer and Cultural Characteristics and Taiwan and *Terminal Care and *Advance Care Planning and palliative care and *Neoplasms and Advance care planning and cultural adaptation and feasibility and acceptability,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vivat_2019_Pallmedi,JOUR,Palliative care specialists in hospice and hospital/community teams predominantly use low doses of sedative medication at the end of life for patient comfort rather than sedation: Findings from focus groups and patient records for I-CAN-CARE,"Vivat, Bella and Bemand-Qureshi, Lucy and Harrington, Jane and Davis, Sarah and Stone, Patrick",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Little research has explored the detail of practice when using sedative medications at the end of life. One work package of the I-CAN-CARE research programme investigates this in UK palliative care. AIMS: To investigate current practices when using sedative medication at the end of life in London, UK, by (1) qualitatively exploring the understandings of palliative care clinicians, (2) examining documented sedative use in patient records and (3) comparing findings from both investigations. DESIGN: We conducted focus groups with experienced palliative care physicians and nurses, and simultaneously reviewed deceased patient records. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In total, 10 physicians and 17 senior nurses in London hospice or hospital/community palliative care took part in eight focus groups. Simultaneously, 50 patient records for people who received continuous sedation at end of life in the hospice and hospital were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Focus group participants all said that they used sedative medication chiefly for managing agitation or distress; selecting drugs and dosages as appropriate for patients' individual needs; and aiming to use the lowest possible dosages for patients to be 'comfortable', 'calm' or 'relaxed'. None used structured observational tools to assess sedative effects, strongly preferring clinical observation and judgement. The patient records' review corroborated these qualitative findings, with the median continuous dose of midazolam administered being 10 mg/24 h (range: 0.4-69.5 mg/24 h). CONCLUSION: Clinical practice in these London settings broadly aligns with the European Association for Palliative Care framework for using sedation at the end of life, but lacks any objective monitoring of depth of sedation.

Hussain_2018_Pallmedi,JOUR,Palliative care triggers in progressive neurodegenerative conditions: An evaluation using a multi-centre retrospective case record review and principal component analysis,"Hussain, Jamilla and Allgar, Victoria and Oliver, David",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: The use of specific triggers has been suggested to help identify patients with progressive neurological disease who would benefit from palliative care. AIM: This study aimed to improve the evidence base for the use of triggers for patients with progressive neurological disease. DESIGN: An evaluation of palliative care services was undertaken using a retrospective case note review of the timing and presence of triggers in the last 2 years of life. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 12 specialist palliative care units across the United Kingdom provided data from 300 patients: mean patient age 70 years, 50% male, diagnoses included motor neurone disease 58%, Parkinson's disease 17% and Parkinson's Plus syndromes 12%. RESULTS: There was a high burden of triggers - 17 in the last 2 years of life and 10 in the last 6 months of life. The most frequent triggers were deteriorating physical function, complex symptoms and dysphagia. Four factors were found to explain 64% of the total variance: Factor 1 - Deterioration in physical function, dysphagia, significant complex symptoms and pain; Factor 2 - Weight loss and respiratory symptoms; Factor 3 - Recurrent infections and cognitive decline; Factor 4 - Aspiration pneumonia. Cox regression analyses found different triggers were associated with survival from diagnosis versus survival from referral to palliative care. Different triggers were also associated with survival for different neurological conditions. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is a high burden of triggers in the last months and years of life and that these could potentially be reduced to fewer components.

Moore_2015_Pallmedi,JOUR,Age as a factor in do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions: a multicentre blinded simulation-based study,"Moore, Nicholas A. and Wiggins, Natasha and Adams, Joe",Palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: The European Resuscitation Council Guidelines recognise that there is a lack of direct evidence for the effect of age on outcome following cardiopulmonary resuscitation. AIM: To determine the role that advancing age plays in the decision by clinicians to complete a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation order based on perceived futility. DESIGN: A questionnaire-based trial. Clinicians were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of a patient case, varying in age but otherwise identical (90 years vs 60 years). Participants were asked to decide whether a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation form should be completed based on perceived futility for a single patient case. Rates of do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation order were compared between groups. PARTICIPANTS: Consultant physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists from 12 district general hospitals in England. RESULTS: In total, 291 questionnaires were returned. Overall, clinicians were significantly more likely to complete a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation form for a 90-year-old patient than a 60-year-old patient, when all other factors are equal (67.7% vs 7.4%, p < 0.001). This finding was consistent across speciality and experience level of the consultant. Surgeons were found to be significantly less likely to complete a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation order in the 90-year-old patient compared to other consultants (46.4% vs 74.1%, p < 0.001). Anaesthetists were more likely than other consultants to complete a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation order in the 60-year-old patient (17.8% vs 4.3%, p < 0.05).

Garland_2007_Joofpame,JOUR,Physicians' influence over decisions to forego life support,"Garland, Allan and Connors, Alfred F.",Journal of palliative medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association between individual physicians and decisions to limit use of life supporting therapies for critically ill patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational data collected 2002-2005 in the adult medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a publicly owned teaching hospital. Nine intensivists staff this closed-model ICU; in rotating 2 week blocks of time one intensivist is responsible for directing all care. In order to uniquely associate care with individual physicians, eligible patients were cared for by a single intensivist throughout their ICU stay. Life support decisions were identified as orders to withhold or withdraw any form of life supporting medical therapy, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement therapy. We used multivariable Cox modeling to identify variables associated with decisions to limit use of life support. The association with the individual physicians was assessed as the hazard ratios of indicator variables representing the individual physicians. RESULTS: A decision to limit use of life support was made in 191 (14.0%) of 1363 ICU admissions. The hazard ratios associated with individual intensivists spanned a 15-fold range (0.069-1.042; p = 0.0003). Decisions to limit life support were more strongly related to the identity of the intensivist than to comorbid conditions, acute diagnostic category, and the source of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have, for the first time, quantified the association between individual physicians and decisions made to limit life support for critically ill patients. More research is needed to understand the nature and implications of this association.",2007,10.1089/jpm.2007.0061,10,6,1298-1305,eng,1096-6218 1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Proportional Hazards Models and Hospitals, Teaching and Intensive Care Units and *Decision Making and *Physician's Role and *Refusal to Treat and Life Support Care/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2007/12//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

After prenatal diagnosis, it is imperative to consider families' values and to support their decision-making process. Prenatal palliative care is a growing field mainly based on family conferences. The prenatal care setting is unique and differs from postnatal and adult care. There are no descriptions of family conferences in prenatal palliative care. The descriptions of themes that emerge from the prenatal care conference charts may guide professionals in this delicate task, and help determine the causes of suffering and identify family values before the birth of the infant. Aim: To perform a content analysis of medical records of family conferences and to describe the main themes observed during prenatal palliative care follow-up after the diagnosis of a life-limiting fetal condition. Design: This is a retrospective study of medical records of family conferences from a perinatal palliative care group, the GAI group, between May 2015 and September 2016. Setting/Participants: Families with estimated perinatal mortality >50% and eligibility for follow-up at our tertiary fetal medicine center were enrolled. We included women who participated in at least one family conference with the GAI group and who had given birth at the clinic or delivered at another center and returned for the postnatal family conference. Results: Fifty women met the inclusion criteria. Five main themes and 18 categories emerged from the charts and are described in detail. A model of follow-up in prenatal palliative care is proposed based on the themes and categories identified.

Volandes_2008_Joofpame,JOUR,Health literacy not race predicts end-of-life care preferences,"Volandes, Angelo E. and Paasche-Orlow, Michael and Gillick, Muriel R. and Cook, E. F. and Shaykevich, Shimon and Abbo, Elmer D. and Lehmann, Lisa",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that African Americans are more likely than whites to prefer aggressive treatments at the end of life. OBJECTIVE: Since the medical information presented to subjects is frequently complex, we hypothesized that apparent differences in end-of-life preferences and decision making may be due to disparities in health literacy. A video of a patient with advanced dementia may overcome communication barriers associated with low health literacy. DESIGN: Before and after oral survey. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects presenting to their primary care doctors. METHODS: Subjects were asked their preferences for end-of-life care after they heard a verbal description of advanced dementia. Subjects then viewed a 2-minute video of a patient with advanced dementia and were asked again about their preferences. For the analysis, preferences were dichotomized into comfort care and aggressive care. Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and subjects were divided into three literacy categories: low (0-45, sixth grade and below), marginal (46-60, seventh to eighth grade) and adequate (61-66, ninth grade and above). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were fit using stepwise algorithms to examine factors related to initial preferences before the video. RESULTS: A total of 80 African Americans and 64 whites completed the interview. In unadjusted analyses, African Americans were more likely than whites to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, odds ratio (OR) 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-10.9). Subjects with low or marginal health literacy were also more likely than subjects with adequate health literacy to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, OR 17.3 (95% CI 6.0-49.9) and OR 11.3 (95% CI 4.2-30.8) respectively. In adjusted analyses, health literacy (low health literacy: OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1-24.2; marginal health literacy OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.6-16.3) but not race (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.3-3.2) was an independent predictor of preferences after the verbal description. After watching a video of advanced dementia, there were no significant differences in the distribution of preferences by race or health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and not race was an independent predictor of end-of-life preferences after hearing a verbal description of advanced dementia. In addition, after viewing a video of a patient with advanced dementia there were no longer any differences in the distribution of preferences according to race and health literacy. These findings suggest that clinical practice and research relating to end-of-life preferences may need to focus on a patient education model incorporating the use of decision aids such as video to ensure informed decision-making.",2008,10.1089/jpm.2007.0224,11,5,754-762,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care and Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Whites and Video Recording and *Health Status Disparities and *African Americans and *Patient Satisfaction and *Terminal Care and *Educational Status and Dementia/ethnology/therapy,NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some authors have published effective communication styles, but there are currently no published guidelines for the content of a discussion about resuscitation or goals of care. METHODS: We identified a group of physicians with expertise in end-of-life care and communication, and used the Delphi method to develop a series of consensus statements about the ideal content of a discussion of CPR and goals of care. RESULTS: Twelve physicians agreed to participate in the study, generating nine consensus statements. These statements addressed the following topics: timing the discussion; framing the discussion in terms of ""goals of care""; distinguishing between life-sustaining therapy (LST) and CPR; describing a cardiac arrest, LST, CPR, and palliative care; describing what happens after a cardiac arrest; how to modify the discussion to respect a patient's medical condition or beliefs; offering a prognosis; making a recommendation; and the importance of trust and rapport. There was consensus for each statement after the second Delphi round. INTERPRETATION: Physicians with expertise in end-of-life care and communication were able to develop consensus statements for the ideal content of a discussion of CPR and goals of care.

The goal of this study was to compare the acceptability of the letter advance directive (LAD) to the traditional advance directive (TAD) of the state of California. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: A web-based, randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which the participants were randomized to one of two types of advance directives (ADs): the LAD (intervention) or the TAD (control). Primary outcomes were participant ratings of the ease, value, and their level of comfort in the AD document they completed. RESULTS: A total of 400 participants completed the study, with 216 randomized to the LAD and 184 to the TAD by a computerized algorithm. Overall, participants preferred the LAD to the TAD (success rate difference [SRD] = 0.46, 95th percentile confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.56, p < 0.001). The participants felt that, compared to the TAD, the LAD was easier to read and understand (SRD = 0.56, CI: 0.47-0.65, p < 0.001); better reflected what matters most to them (SRD = 0.39, CI: 0.29-0.48, p < 0.001); helped stimulate their thinking about the types of treatments they wanted at the end of life (SRD = 0.32, CI: 0.23-0.42, p < 0.001); allowed them to describe how they made medical decisions in their family (SRD = 0.31, CI: 0.21-0.40, p < 0.001); and could help their doctor(s) (SRD = 0.24, CI: 0.13-0.34, p < 0.001) and their families (SRD = 0.19, CI: 0.08-0.28, p < 0.001) understand their end-of-life treatment preferences.

O.Mahony_2010_Pallmedi,JOUR,Preliminary report of the integration of a palliative care team into an intensive care unit,"O'Mahony, Sean and McHenry, Janet and Blank, Arthur E. and Snow, Daniel and Eti Karakas, Serife and Santoro, Gabriella and Selwyn, Peter and Kvetan, Vladimir",Palliative medicine,"Nearly half of Americans who die in hospitals spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the last 3 days of life. Minority patients who die in the ICU are less likely to formalize advance directives and surviving family members report lower satisfaction with the provision of information and sensitivity to their cultural traditions at the end-of-life. This is a descriptive report of a convenience sample of 157 consecutive patients served by a palliative care team which was integrated into the operations of an ICU at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, from August 2005 until August 2007. The team included an advance practice nurse (APN) and social worker. A separate case-control study was conducted comparing the length of hospital stay for persons who died in the ICU during the final 6 months of the project, prior to and post-palliative care consultation for 22 patients at the hospital campus where the project team was located versus 24 patients at the other campus. Pharmaco-economic data were evaluated for 22 persons who died with and 43 who died without a palliative care consultation at the intervention campus ICU to evaluate whether the project intervention was associated with an increase in the use of pain medications or alterations in the use of potentially non-beneficial life-prolonging treatments in persons dying in the ICU. Data was abstracted from the medical record with a standardized chart abstraction instrument by an unblinded research assistant. Interviews were conducted with a sample of family members and ICU nurses rating the quality of end-of-life care in the ICU with the Quality of Dying and Death in the ICU instrument (ICUQODD), and a family focus group was also conducted. Forty percent of patients were Caucasian, 35% were African American or Afro-Caribbean, 22% Hispanic and 3% were Asian or other. Exploration of the patients' and families' needs identified significant spiritual needs in 62.4% of cases. Education on the death process was provided to 85% of families by the project team. Twenty-nine percent of patients were disconnected from mechanical ventilators following consultation with the Palliative Care Service (PCS), 15.9% of patients discontinued the use of inotropic support, 15.3% stopped artificial nutrition, 6.4% stopped dialysis and 2.5% discontinued artificial hydration. Recommendations on pain management were made for 51% of the project's patients and symptom management for 52% of patients. The project was associated with an increase in the rate of the formalization of advance directives. Thirty-three percent of the patients who received PCS consultations had 'do not resuscitate' orders in place prior to consultation and 83.4% had 'do not resuscitate' orders after the intervention. The project team referred 80 (51%) of the project patients to hospice and 55 (35%) patients were enrolled on hospice, primarily at the medical center. The mean time from admission to palliative care consultation at the project site was 2.8 days versus 15.5 days at the other campus (p = 0.0184). Median survival times from admission to the medical center were not significantly different when stratified by palliative care consultation status: 12 days for the control group (95% CI 8-18) and 13.5 days for the intervention group (95% CI 8-20). Median charges for the use of opioid medications were higher (p = 0.01) for the intervention group but lower for use of laboratory (p = 0.004) and radiology tests (p = 0.027). We conclude that the integration of palliative care experts into the operation of critical care units is of benefit to patients, families and critical care clinicians. Preliminary evidence suggest that such models may be associated with improved quality of life, higher rates of formalization of advance directives and utilization of hospices, as well as lower use of certain non-beneficial life-prolonging treatments for critically ill patients who are at the end of life.",2010,10.1177/0269216309346540,24,2,154-165,eng,1477-030X 0269-2163,Humans and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Ethnicity and Length of Stay and New York City and Patient Transfer and Family/psychology and Resuscitation Orders and Patient Care Team/*organization & administration and Intensive Care Units/*organization & administration/standards and *Terminally Ill/psychology and Hospice Care/statistics & numerical data and Palliative Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/psychology/*standards,NA,NA,2010/03//undefined,Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lilley_2017_Joofpame,JOUR,Palliative Care in Surgery: Defining the Research Priorities,"Lilley, Elizabeth J. and Cooper, Zara and Schwarze, Margaret L. and Mosenthal, Anne C.",Journal of palliative medicine,"Given the acute and often life-limiting nature of surgical illness, as well as the potential for treatment to induce further suffering, surgical patients have considerable palliative care needs. Yet, these patients are less likely to receive palliative care than their medical counterparts and palliative care consultations often occur when death is imminent, reflecting poor quality end-of-life care. Surgical patients would likely benefit from early palliative care delivered alongside surgical treatment to promote goal-concordant decision making and to improve patients' physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being and quality of life. To date, evidence to support the role of palliative care in surgical practice is sparse and palliative care research in surgery is encumbered by methodological challenges and entrenched cultural norms that impede appropriate provision of palliative care. The objective of this article was to describe the existing science of palliative care in surgery within three priority areas and expose specific gaps within the field. We propose a research agenda to address these gaps and provide a road map for future investigation.",2017,10.1089/jpm.2017.0079,20,7,702-709,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,Humans and Research and Research Design and *Health Services Research and palliative care and Palliative Care/*methods and goals of care and Hospice Care/*methods and Terminal Care/*methods and General Surgery/*methods and life-limiting illness and palliative care research and surgical patients,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schockett_2021_Joofpame,JOUR,Integrating Palliative Care on an Adult Trauma Service,"Schockett, Erica R. and Prather, Christina P. and Benjenk, Ivy and Estroff, Jordan M.",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: In 2017, the American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement Program adopted a Palliative Care Best Practices Guidelines that calls for early palliative care for hospitalized injured patients. Objective: To develop an educational intervention to address the palliative needs of injured patients. Design: Palliative faculty presented a three-part monthly lecture series focused on core primary palliative skills, including the components of palliative care; conducting family conferences; communication skills for complex medical decision making; pain management; and, end-of-life planning. Additionally a palliative provider joined trauma team rounds every other week to highlight opportunities for enhanced palliative assessments, identify appropriate consults, and provide just-in-time teaching. Setting: Urban, level-1 trauma center. Measurements: Surgical residents completed a survey at the beginning and end of the academic year, during which the intervention took place. All survey questions were answered with a 5-point Likert scale. Rate of palliative care consultation was also tracked. Results: There were statistically significant perceived improvements in goals-of-care discussions (initial discussion-4.30 vs. 3.52, p = 0.4; follow-up discussion-3.89 vs. 3.05, p = 0.021) and documentation (3.89 vs. 2.9, p = 0.032), incorporation of patient preferences into decision making (4.20 vs. 3.43, p = 0.04), discussion of palliative needs during rounds (4.30 vs. 2.81; p < 0.001) and care transitions (3.90 vs. 3.05, p = 0.008), respect for decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatments (4.40 vs. 3.52, p = 0.004), and identification of advance directives (4.11 vs. 3.05, p = 0.002) and surrogate decision maker (4.44 vs. 3.60, p = 0.015). The overall rate of palliative specialist consultation also increased (8.4% vs. 16.1%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Embedding primary palliative education into usual didactic and rounding time for an inpatient trauma team is an effective way to help residents develop palliative skills and foster culture change.

Edmonds_2019_Joofpame,JOUR,"Do We Know What We Mean? An Examination of the Use of the Phrase ""Goals of Care"" in the Literature","Edmonds, Kyle P. and Ajayi, Toluwalase A.",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: There is no consensus approach to describe the process or components of goals of care (GOC) conversations. Objective: The objective was to review the utilization of the phrase ""GOC"" in PubMed-indexed literature to contextualize the use of the phrase. Secondary aim was to describe the use of this phrase within journals focused on palliative care. Methods: A review of articles in the PubMed-indexed literature published during a single year utilizing the phrase ""goals of care."" Results: A total of 191 articles were reviewed after exclusions. Few articles included an operant definition for GOC (n = 27, 14%). It was often used to describe conversations focused on determining intent for treatment (n = 57, 30%), talks about death or dying (n = 52, 27%), or simply vague discussions (n = 39, 20%). The agenda was focused on the outcomes of the conversation (n = 169, 88%) compared with factors such as hopes, worries, values, and personhood (n = 22, 12%). The majority did not utilize the phrase ""palliative care"" (n = 77, 40%); those who did frequently used ""palliative care"" incorrectly (n = 72, 38%). Conclusions: The definition of the phrase GOC is most often assumed with its context centered on the needs of the health care system and linked to a specific medical topic. It is most commonly used to describe determinations of the patient's therapy intent, second most commonly to describe end-of-life conversations. The use of the phrase GOC within the palliative literature does not differ notably from its use in the broader literature.",2019,10.1089/jpm.2019.0059,22,12,1546-1552,eng,1557-7740,communication and Humans and shared decision making and *Terminology as Topic and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and goals of care and Palliative Care/*standards and Terminal Care/*standards and palliative and Patient Care Planning/*standards,NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: We aimed to assess differences in perceptions between physicians and prosecutors toward LOMT. Measurements: We sent a survey to intensivists, oncologists, and prosecutors from Brazil, from February 2018 to May 2018. Respondents rated the degree of agreement with withholding or withdrawal of therapies in four different vignettes portraying a patient with terminal lung cancer. We measured the difference in agreement between respondents. Results: There were 748 respondents, with 522 (69.8%) intensivists, 106 (14.2%) oncologists, and 120 (16%) prosecutors. Most respondents agreed with withhold of chemotherapy (95.2%), withhold of mechanical ventilation (MV) (90.2%), and withdrawal of MV (78.4%), but most (75%) disagreed with withdrawal of MV without surrogate's consent. Prosecutors were less likely than intensivists and oncologists to agree with withhold of chemotherapy (95.7% vs. 99.2% vs. 100%, respectively, p < 0.001) and withhold of MV (82.4% vs. 98.3% vs. 97.9%, respectively, p < 0.001), whereas intensivists were more likely to agree with withdrawal of MV than oncologists (87.1% vs. 76.1%, p = 0.002). Moreover, prosecutors were more likely to agree with withholding of active cancer treatment than with withholding of MV [difference (95% confidence interval, CI) = 13.2% (5.2 to 21.6), p = 0.001], whereas physicians were more likely to agree with withholding than with withdrawal of MV [difference (95% CI) = 10.9% (7.8 to 14), p < 0.001].

Colaberdino_2016_Joofpame,JOUR,Economic Impact of an Advanced Illness Consultation Program within a Medicare Advantage Plan Population,"Colaberdino, Vincent and Marshall, Colleen and DuBose, Paul and Daitz, Mitchell",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: In the United States the quality and cost associated with medical treatment for individuals experiencing an advanced illness is highly variable and is often misaligned with the patient's and family's quality of life values and priorities. Many of the obstacles that stand in the way of aligning the care that an individual receives with their priorities are well understood in the context of behavioral science. Through employing behavioral based approaches to improve the quality of communication and shared decision making processes among patients, providers and families it is possible to enhance the efficiency of delivering care which is also more highly aligned with the individual's preferences. OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to measure the economic impact of a proprietary advanced illness behavioral consultation program, the Vital Decisions Living Well Consultation Program (LWCP), on the cost of care delivered during the last six and three months of life for enrolled members in a Medicare Advantage plan. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective matched case control analysis examined medical, pharmaceutical, and capitation expenses after an offset by premium revenue. METHODS: The treatment population consisted of participating members of the LWCP who died between October 1, 2011 and March 31, 2013 (N = 1755). The control population consisted of plan members who died between July 1, 2008 and June 1, 2011, prior to the introduction of the LWCP (N = 5560). Criteria used to match treatment subjects with one or more control subjects were diagnosis, age at death, and health care costs incurred prior to the time under examination. A paired t-test evaluated the significance of differences between the matched treatment and control members. RESULTS: The mean cost reduction during the last six months of life for treatment members compared to matched control group members was $13,956 (p < 0.001) during the last six months of life and $9,285 (p < 0.001) during the last three months of life.

To reduce ambiguity, many hospitals allow patients to elect partial DNRs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of partial DNRs on physicians' willingness to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and nonarrest procedures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using scenario-based questionnaires between October 2015 and March 2016. A partial DNR was identified as a DNR with Adult Emergency Protocols (AEP) order. Each survey presented 3 patient scenarios followed by 10 interventions. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Preclerkship and clerkship medical students, and internal medicine residents at a single medical school, and hospitalists at a tertiary-care academic medical center. RESULTS: Responses from 275 of 366 (75.1%) eligible subjects were collected. Compared to the case with a full DNR, the presence of a partial DNR was positively associated with subjects' willingness to provide both nonarrest procedures and CPR (p < 0.05). The number of training or practice years was positively associated with a decision not to perform CPR: case 1 (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.16; p = 0.003); case 2 (OR, 1.07; CI, 1.01-1.14; p = 0.03); and case 3 (OR, 1.09; CI, 1.04-1.16; p < 0.001).

Sue_2021_Joofpame,JOUR,Attitudes on Palliative Care for Adults with Developmental Disabilities,"Sue, Kyle and Mar, Nicole",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) are defined as physical/mental impairments before age 18. Not only are many IDD patients living into adulthood, but deinstitutionalization has also led to most living in community settings. Little is known about end-of-life needs in these adults, and existing literature does not examine attitudes of Canadian providers. Objective: Thematic and content analysis examined attitudes of Canadian Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) practitioners on caring for adults with IDD to identify components of care, which could be improved. Design: An anonymized survey was created (Surveymonkey.com) using open-ended and Likert-scale questions, with thematic/subthematic coding on NVivo11. Initial coding included a codebook, which was refined. Independent coding was compared with initial coding. Coded data were reanalyzed after demographic stratification, results discussed, and consensus reached. Settings/Subjects: All Canadian PPC centers responded through snowball sampling (25 of 36 [70%] practitioners). Measurements/Results: Major themes covered communication and decision making, lack of resources (including access to appropriate services), and knowledge/skill/experience gaps among adult palliative care and generalist practitioners. Gaps included complex medical conditions of IDD patients, trajectories, and related management. Knowledge ratings of adult palliative care and generalist practitioners by respondents were evenly distributed, but only pediatricians gave ratings of poor or worse. PPC practitioners are comfortable being consulted by adult palliative care and generalist colleagues. However, frequency of consults varied dramatically, from one to two times/month in British Columbia to never. Conclusions: PPC practitioners across Canada identified several major issues and barriers to optimal palliative care for adults with IDD.",2021,10.1089/jpm.2020.0274,24,3,391-396,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Adolescent and Adult and Child and Attitude and British Columbia and *Palliative Care and palliative care and *Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing and adult palliative care and adult palliative medicine and developmental disabilities and Developmental Disabilities/therapy and intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities,NA,NA,2021/03//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Simmons_2008_Joofpame,JOUR,Intracerebral hemorrhage for the palliative care provider: what you need to know,"Simmons, B. Brent and Parks, Susan M.",Journal of palliative medicine,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) makes up 10%-30% of all strokes. Palliative care providers are often asked to get involved with ICH cases to aid with development of short-term and long-term goals. Prognosis can be calculated using the ICH score (based on Glasgow Coma Score score, ICH volume, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, age, and location of origin) or the Essen score (based on age, NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS], and level of consciousness). Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status is important to discuss with families. Expert consensus states DNR is appropriate if the patient has two of the following: severe stroke, life-threatening brain damage, or significant comorbidities. The process of withdrawing ventilatory support can differ greatly from that of a medical intensive care unit (ICU) patient. Most ICH patients die within 24 hours following extubation. Symptoms of dyspnea and pain warrant use of opioids before and after terminal extubation. In addition, treating death rattle and postextubation stridor are important interventions. Family meetings are a vital intervention to help explain prognosis, establish a plan of care, and to get all family members on the same page.

In a cross-sectional survey, we examine whether physicians recommend PEG placement more for African American than Caucasian patients and identify physician characteristics related to recommendation for PEG. METHODS: We randomly assigned two versions, varying only by race, of a case patient with advanced dementia to all internal and family medicine physicians in the North Carolina Medical Society. Respondents gave recommendations regarding PEG tube feeding and demographic data including their race, age, gender, and specialty. We analyzed data using logistic regression, controlling for physician characteristics that were statistically significant in chi(2) analyses. RESULTS: Of 2058 physicians, 53% (n = 1,083) responded. Of 981 responses with complete data, 18.0% recommended PEG, 80.0% recommended against PEG or made no recommendation. Recommendations for PEG did not differ significantly by race of the case patient (Caucasian = 16.4% versus African American = 19.6%). Fewer recommendations for PEG tube placement were made by Caucasian (13.0% versus Asian 54.3% and African American 40.0%; p < 0.001) and internal medicine and geriatrics physicians (13.8% and 9.1% versus family medicine 23.4%; p = 0.001). Of African American physicians, 51.4% recommended PEG for African American patients and 24.0% for the Caucasian patient.

OBJECTIVES: To describe how families of hospitalized children view and utilize hospital chaplains. DESIGN: Telephone survey with 40 questions: Likert, yes/no, and short-answer responses. SUBJECTS: Parents visited by a hospital chaplain during their child's hospitalization in a tertiary care center. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Nonparametrics were used to compare religious versus nonreligious parents. Regression was used to identify independent predictors of a chaplain visit positively influencing satisfaction with hospital care. RESULTS: Seventy-four parents were interviewed; most were 25-50 years old, and 75% felt their child was very sick. Children ranged from newborn to adolescence. Forty-two percent of parents requested a chaplain visit; of the 58% with an unsolicited visit, 11% would have preferred giving prior approval. Parents felt that chaplains provided religious and secular services, including family support and comfort, help with decision making, medical terminology, and advocacy. Chaplains helped most parents maintain hope and reduce stress. Seventy-five percent of parents viewed chaplains as a member of the healthcare team; 38% reported that chaplains helped medical personnel understand their preferences for care and communication. Most parents (66%) felt that hospital chaplaincy increased their satisfaction with hospital care. CONCLUSION: Families play a fundamental role in the recovery of hospitalized children.

Gamondi_2020_Joofpame,JOUR,Swiss Families' Experiences of Interactions with Providers during Assisted Suicide: A Secondary Data Analysis of an Interview Study,"Gamondi, Claudia and Pott, Murielle and Preston, Nancy and Payne, Sheila",Journal of palliative medicine,"Context: Families are known to be involved in assisted dying and their involvement can be influenced by many factors. Objectives: To explore how Swiss families interact with health care professionals and right-to-die associations regarding assisted suicide and their choices around disclosure. Methods: A secondary data analysis on a cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland was conducted. Interviews with 28 bereaved family members were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Two main themes were identified: (1) Interactions with physicians and right-to-die associations. (2) Choices about disclosing their experiences. In general, families believed that assisted suicide is a private matter, to be pursued mainly outside the medical field and involved physicians only when necessary. Families appeared to deliberately limit interaction with physicians and to be more comfortable interacting with the right-to-die associations. Some participants presumed a clear choice between assisted suicide or palliative care. Disclosing to others the decision, and preparation of assisted suicide emerged to be an important emotional burden for families. Some family members preferred to restrict disclosure before and after assisted suicide, by sometimes not informing other family members until the final days. Conclusions: In Switzerland, there is limited interaction between families and health care professionals concerning assisted suicide decisions, whereas families reported more open interactions with right-to-die associations. It is recommended that the needs of families should be reflected in health policies, taking into consideration the different contexts where assisted dying is permitted.",2020,10.1089/jpm.2019.0286,23,4,506-512,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and decision making and Switzerland and Family Health and experiences and Data Analysis and *Euthanasia and assisted suicide and euthanasia and palliative care and *Suicide, Assisted and assisted dying and families'",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: To identify possible difficulties and barriers to effective collaboration at the EOL between GPs and HPs from the perspective of Swiss GPs. DESIGN: Twenty-three qualitative semi-structured interviews with GPs were transcribed and analyzed using Mayring's content analysis. Interdisciplinary clinical-ethical analysis focused on the quality of GP and HP professional collaboration. RESULTS: GPs described the quality of collaboration with HPs as poor, in particular the lack of communication. There were two main issues to emerge. First, infrequent communication with HPs could negatively affect the care of the patient. Second, GPs were concerned with the lack of information about hospital care and involvement in medical decision making given their longstanding relationships with their patients. CONCLUSIONS: The research showed that Swiss GPs were concerned with the quality of their patients' EOL care and the current level of GP/HP collaboration. GPs appealed for greater involvement with EOL care decisions based on their relationship of care and knowledge of patient preferences. These findings require further critical evaluation to explore the potential advantages for patient care. Existing evidence suggests that there are measurable health benefits from successful GP/HP collaborations. A change in the way GPs maintain involvement with their patients during hospitalizations would be warranted if it resulted in a better use of resources, better patient experiences, and better health outcomes.",2016,10.1089/jpm.2015.0377,19,9,983-986,eng,1557-7740,Communication and Hospitals and Humans and Attitude of Health Personnel and General Practitioners and *Terminal Care,NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A controlled study of a cognitive model for ACP embedded in a quality improvement (QI) project. RESULTS: In the setting of a QI project for medical residents and interdisciplinary staff, we developed and implemented a cognitive model of ACP discussions that involved two types of meetings for patients: (1) information-sharing meetings for seriously ill but clinically stable patients and (2) decision-making meetings for clinically unstable patients. Patients on the intervention floor were significantly more likely to have a discussion about goals of care (33.8%) than patients on the control floor (21.2%, p = < 0.001) and significantly more likely to have a limitation of life-sustaining treatment upon discharge (19.1% vs. 13.9%, p = 0.04).

M. and O'Callaghan, A. C.",Palliative medicine,"The importance of evaluating systematically the effectiveness of hospice care has been noted for at least 20 years. There is, however, limited evidence about whether and how the care provided to terminally ill patients by in-patient hospices in the UK differs from that provided in NHS hospitals. In this article, we, therefore, present a comparison of hospice in-patient care and hospital care for cancer patients in the UK, from the perspective of bereaved relatives who had experienced both types of care during the last 3 months of the patient's life. The Office of National Statistics drew a random sample of 800 deaths in South London in 2002, and sent the person who registered the death (the informant) a Views of Informal Carers - Evaluation of Services (VOICES) questionnaire 3-9 months after the death, with up to two reminders. There was a response rate of 48%. For this analysis, 40 cancer patients whose informant reported both a hospice in-patient admission and a hospital admission in the last 3 months of life were identified. Informants answered the same questions about each admission and responses on these were compared. There were statistically significant differences between respondents' views of hospice and hospital care on eight out of 13 variables measuring aspects of satisfaction with care, with a trend towards statistical significance on a further two: in all cases respondents rated hospice care more positively than hospital care. There were no differences in the experience of pain and breathlessness in the two settings, but respondents rated pain control by the hospice as more effective. In comparison to hospital care, from the perspective of bereaved relatives, hospice in-patient care provided better pain control, better communication with patients and families, and better medical, nursing and personal care, which treated the patient with more dignity.

Ozanne_2009_Joofpame,JOUR,Doctor-patient communication about advance directives in metastatic breast cancer,"Ozanne, Elissa M. and Partridge, Ann and Moy, Beverly and Ellis, Katherine J. and Sepucha, Karen R.",Journal of palliative medicine,"PURPOSE: Oncology providers often find it difficult to discuss end-of-life issues with patients and assume that patients are reluctant to think about the issues involved. This study examined whether or not patients with metastatic breast cancer had advance directives, and if so, with whom they discussed written plans for end-of-life decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 32 women with metastatic breast cancer and their providers from two academic medical centers in the United States were surveyed at baseline and again 3 months later about advance directives, decision-making goals, and their expectations. After the baseline assessment, patients viewed a decision aid that discussed choices for treatment of metastatic disease. The patients' experience with advance directives in addition to associations between advance directives and patient preferences regarding end-of-life care, demographics, and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: At baseline, the majority of women had gathered information (75%) about or had written (66%) advance directives. These percentages increased at 3 months. Providers were only aware of the presence of an advance directive in a minority of cases (14%). Patients were more than three times as likely to talk to and share written plans with family and friends than with their providers. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients gathered information about advance directives and had made written plans, yet few discussed these plans with their providers. Explicit discussion of advance directives and patient preferences regarding end-of-life care are lacking in this setting.

With concerns about its use after the Neuberger review, an audit of patients on the CDP was performed to determine if the use of such a pathway should be continued locally. METHODS: A two-year retrospective audit of CDP use was conducted. Aspects of communication, initiation of CDP, patient monitoring, medications, nutrition, and hydration were assessed. RESULTS: In the 111 patient records reviewed, there were documented extent of care discussions with 94% of caregivers and 29% of patients before CDP initiation. Of the 88% of CDPs initiated within office hours, 90% fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All patients were monitored at least every eight hours. Seventy-three patients (66%) were prescribed opioids or sedatives and subsequently monitored appropriately, albeit 56% had no documented prior discussion with caregivers regarding medication use. Indications for opioid use were documented for all patients and only one patient had documentation of excessive sedation. Oral feeding and parenteral hydration were continued in 85% and 74% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: There was no documented compromise in medication safety, clinical monitoring, and provision of nutrition and hydration for patients on the CDP.

OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to review the evidence on variables associated with explicit decisions about limitation of treatment in patients with cancer and to critically appraise the factors from a clinical ethics perspective. METHODS: A search was conducted of studies published in EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Assia, Current Contents Medicine, Belit, and Euroethics before February 5, 2014. Eligible studies reported data on explicit treatment limitation in patients with cancer and included a statistical analysis on possibly associated factors. Information on study participants, types of limited treatment, and variables associated with limiting treatment were extracted by two researchers independently. Data synthesis was performed jointly by researchers from oncology, medical ethics, and social sciences. RESULTS: The search yielded 897 publications, of which 7 were relevant for this review. Factors significantly associated with decisions about limitation of treatment could be distinguished in three categories: first, sociodemographic variables such as the ethnic background of patients; second, health- or treatment-related variables including a lack of capacity in patients with cancer; and third, patients' preferences and the role of relatives in decisions about limitation of treatment. Limitations to this study are that the studies lacked a predefined hypothesis and they all had been conducted in Western countries.

Dzul.Church_2010_Joofpame,JOUR,"""I'm sitting here by myself ..."": experiences of patients with serious illness at an Urban Public Hospital","Dzul-Church, Virginia and Cimino, Jenica W. and Adler, Shelley R. and Wong, Piera and Anderson, Wendy G.",Journal of palliative medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To describe experiences of serious illness including concerns, preferences, and perspectives on improving end-of-life (EOL) care in underserved inpatients. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of 1-hour interviews with inpatients at a public hospital whose physician ""would not be surprised"" by the patient's death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within a year. Patients who were non-English speaking, lacked mental capacity, or had uncontrolled symptoms were excluded. A semistructured interview guide was developed and used for all interviews. We digitally recorded, transcribed, and conducted a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: Twenty patients participated. Difficult events such as estrangement, homelessness, substance abuse, and imprisonment shaped patients' approaches to serious illness. This influence manifested in interpersonal relationships, conceptualizations of death and concerns about dying, and approaches to coping with EOL. Because patients lacked social support, providers played significant roles at EOL. Patients preferred honest communication with providers and sharing in medical decision-making. A prolonged dying process was feared more than sudden death. Concerns included pain, dying in the hospital, and feeling unwelcome in the hospital. Patients coped by advocating for their own care, engaging with religion/spirituality, and viewing illness as similar to past trauma. Participants suggested that providers listen to their concerns and requested accessible chaplaincy and home-based services. CONCLUSIONS: Providers should consider that difficult life events influence underserved patients' approaches to dying.

Secondary aims explored whether select demographic, clinical, or personal measures were associated with different perceptions of chance for survival. DESIGN: Prospective, sequential, observational, survey-based study. Primary measures were perception of chance for survival as compared to actual survival and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. SETTING: Tertiary care, academic medical intensive care unit (MICU). PATIENTS: Subjects were English-speaking adult MICU patients with a MICU length-of-stay greater than three days or their surrogates (n = 100). RESULTS: Respondents tended to be more optimistic regarding chance for survival than supported by actual survival (p = 0.07) or APACHE II tertile (p = 0.34). Secondary analyses found African American race, faith, or religion impacting health decision-making, and higher health status reports were associated with more optimistic perceptions of chance for survival.

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate the association between medical record documentation of patient-physician care planning discussions and intensity of EOL care among veterans with advanced cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Subjects were 665 veteran decedents diagnosed with stage IV colorectal, lung, or pancreatic cancer in 2008, and followed till death or the end of the study period in 2011. We estimated the effect of patient-physician care planning discussions documented within one month of metastatic diagnosis on the intensity of EOL care measured by receipt of acute care, intensive interventions, chemotherapy, and hospice care, using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Veterans in our study were predominantly male (97.1%), white (74.7%), with an average age at diagnosis of 66.4 years. Approximately 31% received some acute care, 9.3% received some intensive intervention, and 6.5% had a new chemotherapy regimen initiated in the last month of life. Approximately 41% of decedents received no hospice or were admitted within three days of death. Almost half (46.8%) had documentation of a care planning discussion within the first month after diagnosis and those who did were significantly less likely to receive acute care at EOL (OR: 0.67; p=0.025).

Yet there are few systematic investigations of the withdrawal of invasive home mechanical ventilation (IHMV). This article aims to describe the medical and patient-related aspects of terminating IHMV in patients with advanced stage ALS. METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study was made of all ALS patients cared for at our center from 2002 to 2009 who decided to withdraw their consent for IHMV. RESULTS: All 12 ALS patients (4 females) received continuous IHMV. They had a median age of 61 years (range, 39-69 years). In all cases advance directives for end of life care, particularly concerning withdrawal of treatment, were discussed before the initiation of IHMV. The median time from initiation of IHMV to the decision to terminate treatment was 22 months (range, 1-35 months). The reasons for requests were for all patients a general loss of ""meaning in life."" Deep sedation was achieved with high dose morphine and diazepam before disconnecting the ventilator. CONCLUSION: Patients' requests for the withdrawal of IHMV in advanced stage ALS was related to a perceived ""loss of meaning in life.""

To improve communication, physicians must be responsive to families' needs and values surrounding the care of their hospitalized infant. OBJECTIVE: We adapted a Decision-Making Tool for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (N-DMT) to encourage consideration of family concerns and preferences in daily care planning. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled design. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Parents and providers of critically ill neonates were eligible. Parents were randomized to an intervention group (using the N-DMT) or standard of care. N-DMT information was shared through the electronic medical record and communicated directly to the primary provider. MEASUREMENTS: Daily rounds on all infants were audio recorded. Parents completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at the first interview and 2 weeks later. Parents completed the Family Inventory of Needs-Pediatrics (FIN-PED) survey and an N-DMT-specific survey 2 weeks postenrollment. RESULTS: Complete data were obtained on 10 control and 9 intervention families. Groups did not differ on demographics or mean infant Score of Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) scores (36 versus 37). FIN-PED scores were similar for both groups. The control group showed decreased anxiety over time. The content of rounds did not differ between groups. The intervention group reported lower satisfaction with care, specifically in questions regarding communication.

These conversations are even more challenging with adolescents and young adults due to the poignancy of the situation and the need for developmentally appropriate language. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether adolescents and young adults living with a life-limiting illness find it acceptable and helpful to have a planning document to share their wishes and thoughts regarding EOL care. If so, to learn about specific concerns adolescents and young adults feel are important to include in such a document. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults with metastatic cancer or pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection were presented Five Wishes, an advance directive document for adults. Each participant was asked to critically evaluate each wish in terms of whether the concepts within were considered (1) appropriate to ask individuals the participant's age; (2) helpful for other people the participant's age to think about; (3) helpful to the participant to think about; (4) stressful to contemplate. Participants were also asked to suggest modifications and additions to the document. RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the survey. Ninety-five percent of the participants reported that an advance directive like Five Wishes would be ""helpful"" or ""very helpful"" to themselves, 90% stated that the document would be helpful to others, and no patients found talking about the issues in Five Wishes ""stressful"" or ""very stressful."" Participants were more interested in items concerning how they wanted to be treated and remembered than items concerning medical decision-making.

Cancer survivorship transcends distinctions between acute, chronic, malignant, and nonmalignant pain. Partnering with oncologists, PC teams manage pain that persists after disease-directed treatment, evaluate changing symptoms as possible signs of cancer recurrence, taper opioids and mitigate risk of opioid misuse, and manage comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD). While interdisciplinary guidelines exist for pain management in survivorship, there is a need to develop a conceptual model that fully translates the biopsychosocial framework of PC into survivorship pain management. Objective: This review frames a model for pain management in cancer survivorship that balances analgesia with the imperative to minimize risk of OUD, recognizes signs of disease recurrence, and provides whole-person care. Methods: Comprehensive narrative review of the literature. Results: Little guidance exists for co-management of pain, psychological distress, and opioid misuse in survivorship. We identified themes for whole-person pain management in survivorship: use of opioids and co-analgesic medications to prevent recurrent pain from residual tissue damage following cancer treatment, opioid tapering to the lowest effective dose, utilization of nonpharmacologic psychological interventions shown to reduce pain, screening for and management of OUD in partnership with addiction medicine specialists, maintaining vigilance for disease recurrence, and engaging in shared medical decision making.

Discharge summaries (DSs) are an essential tool to maintain continuity of these care plans across multiple locations and providers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of selected DSs of patients who received inpatient PC consultations at the University of Kansas Hospital from July 2011 to May 2015. The study included patients 18 years or older, patients who were discharged alive, and patients who were not discharged with hospice care. Code words and their related phrases, developed by an expert panel of geriatric medicine and palliative medicine physicians, were used to evaluate the DSs. They were categorized into PC, symptom management, hospice and palliative home health, decision making, and plan of care. We also identified whether there was communication between the primary team and PC team, as well as family meeting status in the PC consultation and notes. RESULTS: Of the 961 chart reviews, no code words were found in 22.8% of the DSs. PC was mentioned in only 63.3% and was the only code word in 5.3%. CONCLUSION: More than one in five DSs lacked any code words of the completed PC consultation and more than one in three DSs lacked mention of PC.

Yu_2020_Joofpame,JOUR,Perceptions of Pediatric Palliative Care among Physicians Who Care for Pediatric Patients in South Korea,"Yu, Juyoun and Song, In Gyu and Kim, Cho Hee and Moon, Yi Ji and Shin, Hee Young and Kim, Min Sun",Journal of palliative medicine,"Background: Despite advances in medical technology, resources for pediatric palliative care (PPC) for children with serious illnesses are limited in South Korea. Physicians' awareness of and willingness to provide general palliative care and refer to specialized palliative care are key elements for providing PPC. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore physicians' perceptions of PPC and the differences therein between nononcologists and oncologists. Design: A nationwide survey was conducted among physicians caring for children in 45 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Measurements: A questionnaire was developed to identify the confidence in and need for PPC, appropriate timing for PPC referrals, and perceived barriers to PPC. Results: Overall, 141 physicians responded (response rate: 10.4%). Physicians' confidence in PPC was low, although most reported a high need for PPC. Lack of workforce and facilities specialized in PPC (60.2%) and patients' or caregivers' negative recognition (55.9%) were reported as the main barriers to PPC implementation. Specialized PPC services in children's hospitals were preferred as the model of care (84.2%). Compared with nononcologists, oncologists showed higher confidence levels in decision making and communication with patients and families with poor prognosis (p = 0.041) and education and providing end-of-life care (p < 0.001). Furthermore, oncologists preferred earlier referrals than did nononcologists. Conclusions: To promote PPC provision and improve the quality of life of pediatric patients and their families, it is important to introduce PPC early into disease-modifying treatment at any level of health care.

We developed a consensus-based checklist to document BSC delivery, including symptom management, decision making, and care planning. We hypothesized that BSC can be feasibly documented with this checklist consistent with consolidated standards of reporting trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine feasibility/acceptability of a BSC checklist among clinicians. METHODS: To test feasibility of a BSC checklist in standard care, we enrolled a sample of clinicians treating patients with advanced cancer at four centers. Clinicians were asked to complete the checklist at eligible patient encounters. We surveyed enrollees regarding checklist use generating descriptive statistics and frequencies. RESULTS: We surveyed 15 clinicians and 9 advanced practice providers. Mean age was 41 (SD = 7.9). Mean years since fellowship for physicians was 7.2 (SD = 4.5). Represented specialties are medical oncology (n = 8), gynecologic oncology (n = 4), palliative care (n = 2), and other (n = 1). For ""overall impact on your delivery of supportive/palliative care,"" 40% noted improved impact with using BSC. For ""overall impact on your documentation of supportive/palliative care,"" 46% noted improvement. Impact on ""frequency of comprehensive symptom assessment"" was noted to be ""increased"" by 33% of providers. None noted decreased frequency or worsening impact on any measure with use of BSC. Regarding feasibility of integrating the checklist into workflow, 73% agreed/strongly agreed that checklists could be easily integrated, 73% saw value in integration, and 80% found it easy to use.

Johnson_2011_Joofpame,JOUR,Australian general practitioners' and oncology specialists' perceptions of barriers and facilitators of access to specialist palliative care services,"Johnson, Claire and Paul, Chris and Girgis, Afaf and Adams, Jon and Currow, David C.",Journal of palliative medicine,"PURPOSE: Doctors in Australia play an important role in facilitating access to specialist palliative care (SPC) services for people with advanced cancer. This study aimed to describe doctors' perceptions of barriers to referring patients for SPC, and to identify triggers and facilitators for referral. METHOD: Forty semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with doctors involved in the care of people with advanced cancer from a variety of settings. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: disease and treatment; psychosocial; communication and interpersonal issues; health services issues; timing; and, health professionals' skills. All doctors considered the presence and complexity of physical symptoms, stage of the disease and treatment orientation as important in decisions to refer for SPC. Less important were the psychosocial well-being and cultural characteristics of the person with cancer and their family. Factors reportedly affecting referral and access included health professionals' ability to communicate openly and honestly about disease progression, availability and location of SPC resources and doctors' expertise. Divergent views were expressed about appropriate timing for access. The predominant view that SPC is for management of physical symptoms may result in nonreferral of those who have complex problems without physical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the complex relationship between psychological and physical well-being and health-related quality of life, it is important that all factors contributing to patient well-being are identified. Routine use of objective measures of unmet and complex needs may help identify people who are likely to most benefit from SPC and optimize access, regardless of timing, stage of disease, and treatment orientation.",2011,10.1089/jpm.2010.0259,14,4,429-435,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Australia and Interviews as Topic and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Medical Oncology and General Practitioners/*psychology and *Palliative Care and Health Services Accessibility/*organization & administration,NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Oechsle_2013_Joofpame,JOUR,Anxiety and depression in caregivers of terminally ill cancer patients: impact on their perspective of the patients' symptom burden,"Oechsle, Karin and Goerth, Kathrin and Bokemeyer, Carsten and Mehnert, Anja",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Given the important role caregivers play in palliative care planning and decision making, anxiety and depression in caregivers of terminally ill cancer patients and their impact on the caregivers' evaluation of the patients' physical and psychological symptom burden were analyzed. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Thirty-three patients and their caregivers were recruited through the University Medical Center palliative care inpatient ward <24 h after admission. MEASUREMENTS: Patients completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Caregivers were instructed to evaluate the symptom burden of the patient. Anxiety and depression were measured in caregivers using the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of male caregivers and 36% of female caregivers showed moderate or severe anxiety; 36% of male caregivers compared to 14% of female caregivers had moderate or severe depression. Caregivers' anxiety was associated with a discrepancy in the patients' symptom evaluation for shortness of breath (p<0.05); nausea (p<0.05); and frequency, intensity, and distress due to anxiety (p<0.01). Depression was associated with a discrepancy in the patients' evaluation of distress due to constipation (p<0.05), as well as intensity and distress due to anxiety (p<0.05). Both the caregivers' anxiety and depression were not significantly associated with an underestimation of symptoms. There was a trend towards a higher risk of overestimation in caregivers with higher levels of anxiety (r=0.32) (p=0.07) and depression (r=0.33) (p=0.06).

Chan_2011_Joofpame,JOUR,Being aware of the prognosis: how does it relate to palliative care patients' anxiety and communication difficulty with family members in the Hong Kong Chinese context?,"Chan, Wallace Chi Ho",Journal of palliative medicine,"Chinese family members play an important role in end-of-life decision making. Culturally, they may believe that a patient's awareness of a poor prognosis could harm his or her well-being, and thus they may avoid telling the truth to the patient. To examine this cultural belief empirically, this study aimed to explore the relationships among the patient's awareness of the prognosis, the family's awareness of the prognosis, the patient's anxiety, and difficulty in communicating with family members. Clinical data mining was the research method. Clinical records of deceased cancer patients in the palliative care unit of a hospital during 2003-2005 were reviewed, and 935 patients were included in this study. Logistic regression analyses indicated that patients who did not have a clear awareness of their prognosis were more likely to experience anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.14-1.82, p = 0.002) and difficulty communicating with family members (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.62-2.76, p < 0.001). Patients whose family members were less aware of the prognosis were more likely to experience difficulty communicating with family members (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.93-10.42, p < 0.001). This study further suggests that awareness of prognosis may not harm Chinese patients.

Wu_2013_Joofpame,JOUR,Effects of initiating palliative care consultation in the emergency department on inpatient length of stay,"Wu, Frances M. and Newman, Jeffrey M. and Lasher, Andrew and Brody, Abraham A.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Increased attention has been directed at the intersection of emergency and palliative medicine, since decisions made in the emergency department (ED) often determine the trajectory of subsequent medical treatments. Specifically, we examined whether inpatient admissions after palliative care (PC) consultation initiated in the ED were associated with decreased length of stay (LOS), compared with those in which consultations were initiated after hospital admission. METHODS: Education and training on PC and the consultation service were provided to ED physicians and nurses. The PC service evaluated patients in the ED during weekdays and provided telephone consultation nights and weekends with postadmission follow-up. We compared the outcomes of these patients with those whose PC needs were identified and addressed through consultation postadmission. PC consultation data between January 2006 and December 2010 were retrospectively collected from the administrative records system and analyzed using propensity scores within multivariate regression. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 1435 PC consultations, 50 of which were initiated in the ED across the 4-year study period. Propensity scores were calculated using patient-level characteristics, including All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Group (APRDRG) risk of mortality (ROM) and severity of illness (SOI), age, gender, readmission status, facility, and insurance type. Regression results showed that consultation in the ED was associated with a significantly shorter LOS by 3.6 days (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of PC consultation in the ED was associated with a significantly shorter LOS for patients admitted to the hospital, indicating that the patient- and family-centered benefits of PC are complemented by reduced inpatient utilization.",2013,10.1089/jpm.2012.0352,16,11,1362-1367,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Decision Making and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Severity of Illness Index and Propensity Score and *Referral and Consultation and *Inpatients and Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration and *Palliative Care and Data Collection/methods and Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Zuurmond, Wouter W. A. and van der Maas, Paul J. and van Delden, Johannes J. M. and Rietjens, Judith A. C.",Journal of palliative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation is a medical intervention aimed at relieving symptoms that can no longer be controlled by conventional treatment. Ample knowledge is available regarding the nature of such symptoms, but there is no in-depth information regarding how health care workers decide about palliative sedation. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to investigate considerations concerning the indications for continuous palliative sedation (CPS) and issues that influence these considerations. DESIGN: The study consisted of qualitative interviews regarding patients who had recently received CPS. SETTING/SUBJECTS: The study involved physicians and nurses working in general practice, nursing homes, and hospitals. MEASUREMENT: Analyses by a multidisciplinary research team used the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Together with physical symptoms, psychological and existential suffering may combine to produce a refractory state for which other treatment options than CPS were not available or considered inappropriate. A limited life expectancy was by many considered crucial (e.g., to avoid hastening death) and by some less important (e.g., because the patient's suffering was considered to be key). Issues influencing the decision to use CPS related to patient preferences (e.g., dignity, not wanting to experience further suffering) or family issues (impact of suffering on family, family requesting CPS). CONCLUSIONS: The indication for CPS typically originates from physical symptoms and nonphysical problems producing a refractory state in which a patient suffers unbearably. In such states, preferences of patients and families and the life expectancy criterion are weighed against the severity of refractory symptoms. Therefore the use of CPS is not only a response to the physical suffering of patients in the dying phase.",2014,10.1089/jpm.2013.0121,17,1,27-36,eng,1557-7740,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Life Expectancy and Decision Making and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Netherlands and Patient Preference and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Professional-Family Relations and Terminally Ill/*psychology and Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use and Deep Sedation/methods/psychology/*standards and Pain Management/methods/psychology/*standards and Palliative Care/methods/psychology/*standards,NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Retrospective exploratory study. SETTING: Seven Italian long-term care institutions with more than 200 beds. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-one patients with advanced (FAST stage = 7c) dementia (Alzheimer disease, vascular, other kinds of dementia, severe cognitive impairment). MEASUREMENT: Diagnosis, Mini-Mental State Examination, cause of death. Data were collected from clinical and nursing records referring to the last 30 days of life: symptoms and signs, intensity and incidence, treatments (antibiotics, analgesics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, artificial nutrition/hydration, and use of restraints); the last 48 hours: cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts and life-sustaining drugs. RESULTS: Patients were given antibiotics (71.6%), anxiolytics (37.1%), and antidepressants (7.8%). Twenty-nine patients (20.5%) were tube- or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)-fed. Most patients (66.6%) were also parenterally hydrated (72 intravenously, 15 by hypodermoclysis). Some form of physical restraint was used for 58.2% (bed-rails and other immobilizers).

Objective: To test the potential association of perceived social support with anxiety in parents of children with SLTIs over time. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Two hundred parents of 158 children in the Decision Making in Serious Pediatric Illness study, conducted at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Measurements: Parental anxiety and perceived social support were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). We performed bivariate linear regressions to test cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the SPS and anxiety scores at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Results: The average SPS total and subscale scores decreased significantly from baseline to 12 months, and increased from 12 to 24 months. The average HADS-Anxiety scores decreased significantly from baseline to 12 months, and remained stable at 24 months. Cross-sectionally, total SPS scores were negatively associated with anxiety scores at each time point. Longitudinally, SPS scores were associated with anxiety scores, although this association weakened in adjusted modeling.

Objective: To evaluate feasibility, safety, and early effectiveness of video-based ACP in a surgical population. Design: Randomized controlled trial with two study arms. Setting: Single, academic, inner-city tertiary care hospital. Subjects: Patients undergoing major cancer surgery were recruited from nine surgical clinics. Of 106 consecutive potential participants, 103 were eligible and 92 enrolled. Interventions: In the intervention arm, patients viewed an ACP video developed by patients, surgeons, palliative care clinicians, and other stakeholders. In the control arm, patients viewed an informational video about the hospital's surgical program. Measurements: Primary Outcomes-ACP content and patient-centeredness in patient-surgeon preoperative conversation. Secondary outcomes-patient Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score; patient goals of care; patient and surgeon satisfaction; video helpfulness; and medical decision maker designation. Results: Ninety-two patients (target enrollment: 90) were enrolled. The ACP video was successfully integrated with no harm noted. Patient-centeredness was unchanged (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.06, confidence interval [0.87-1.3], p = 0.545), although there were more ACP discussions in the intervention arm (23% intervention vs. 10% control, p = 0.18).

Family conferences offer patient-focused, family-oriented care that brings together patients, family members, and health care providers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a research-based model for family conferences to help physicians and other health care providers conduct such conferences effectively and improve communication with patients and families. DESIGN: We prospectively studied family conferences for patients facing life-threatening illness in two inpatient medical centers. We videotape and audiotape recorded real-life conferences and postconference interviews with participants. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four family conferences were included in the study. Participants consisted of 24 patients, 10 of whom took part in the family conferences, 49 family members, and 85 health care providers. APPROACH: A multidisciplinary team conducted a qualitative analysis of the videotaped and audiotaped materials using thematic analysis. The team used a multistage approach to independently and collectively analyze and integrate three data sources. MAIN RESULTS: The resulting theoretical model for family conferences has 4 main components. These include the underlying structural context of conference organization and the key process components of negotiation and personal stance. Emotional engagement by health care providers, emotion work, appears central to the impact of these components on the successful outcome of the conference. In addition to the theoretical model, the authors found that family conference participants place specific value on the ""simultaneous presence"" of conference attendees that leads to being on the ""same page.""

This makes it necessary to confront not only medical aspects but also those of infrastructure and ethical issues. On some occasions, literature needs to be consulted to work out the best approach in a patient's particular case. Our aim was to review the literature contained in PubMed and EMBASE so as to find out about the information available on transfusion in PCPs. METHODS: A search for literature was carried out in databases PubMed and EMBASE, using ""transfusion,"" ""cancer,"" ""end-of-life care,"" ""terminal care,"" and ""palliative care"" as key words. Publications were classified according to the main topic discussed (clinical, infrastructure, and ethics) and the information included in each article critically assessed. RESULTS: We found 334 articles but only 43 were considered valuable for the present study. Of these 43 articles, 21 deal with clinical topics while 12 deal with infrastructure and 10 with ethical issues. There is an absolute lack of randomized controlled trials or clinical guidelines. Trigger parameters for transfusion are not clearly established. Benefits of the procedure are shortly experienced and remain controversial. Home transfusions are encouraged, but this sole procedure has not been demonstrated to be cost effective. Different cultures, cases, and realities illustrate the diversity of the ethical management of transfusion in PCPs. DISCUSSION: Although transfusion is certainly a common practice in PCPs, there is a relative lack of literature on this topic. Publications are unconnected and hardly any prospective studies have been performed. A large part of the little literature available only concerns descriptive and very general aspects of the issue.

Interracial differences have been identified in adult EOLC preferences, but the relation of race to EOLC in pediatric oncology has not been reported. We assessed whether race (white, black) was associated with the frequency of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, the number and timing of EOLC discussions, or the timing of EOLC decisions among patients treated at our institution who died. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 380 patients who died between July 1, 2001 and February 28, 2005. Chi(2) and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test the association of race with the number and timing of EOLC discussions, the number of DNR changes, the timing of EOLC decisions (i.e., DNR order, hospice referral), and the presence of a DNR order at the time of death. These analyses were limited to the 345 patients who self-identified as black or white. RESULTS: We found no association between race and DNR status at the time of death (p = 0.57), the proportion of patients with DNR order changes (p = 0.82), the median time from DNR order to death (p = 0.51), the time from first EOLC discussion to DNR order (p = 0.12), the time from first EOLC discussion to death (p = 0.33), the proportion of patients who enrolled in hospice (p = 0.64), the time from hospice enrollment to death (p = 0.2) or the number of EOLC discussions before a DNR decision (p = 0.48). CONCLUSION: When equal access to specialized pediatric cancer care is provided, race is not a significant factor in the presence or timing of a DNR order, enrollment in or timing of enrollment in hospice, or the number or timing of EOLC discussions before death.",2009,10.1089/jpm.2008.0172,12,1,71-76,eng,1557-7740 1096-6218,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Medical Audit and *Decision Making and *Pediatrics and *Terminal Care and *Resuscitation Orders and *Whites and *Blacks and *Cancer Care Facilities",NA,NA,2009/01//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lamas_2017_Joofpame,JOUR,Conversations About Goals and Values Are Feasible and Acceptable in Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals: A Pilot Study,"Lamas, Daniela J. and Owens, Robert L. and Nace, R. Nicholas and Massaro, Anthony F. and Pertsch, Nathan J. and Moore, Susan T. and Bernacki, Rachelle E. and Block, Susan D.",Journal of palliative medicine,"RATIONALE: The chronically critically ill have survived acute critical illness but require prolonged mechanical ventilation. These patients are frequently transferred from acute care to long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) for prolonged recovery, yet many suffer setbacks requiring readmission to acute care. The patient's relatively improved condition while at the LTACH might be an opportunity for communication regarding care goals; however, there have been no prior studies of the feasibility of such conversations in the LTACH. OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential usefulness of conversations about serious illness with chronic critical illness patients or their surrogate decision makers after LTACH admission. METHODS: We adapted an existing conversation guide for use in chronically critically ill (defined by tracheotomy for prolonged ventilation) LTACH patients or their surrogates to explore views about quality of life, understanding of medical conditions, expectations, and planning for setbacks. These conversations were conducted by one interviewer and summarized for the patients' clinicians. We surveyed patients, surrogates, and clinicians to assess acceptability. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 70 subjects were approached and 50 (71%) were enrolled, including 30 patients and 20 surrogates. The median duration of the conversation was 14 minutes 45 seconds [IQR 12:46, 19]. The presence of ongoing mechanical ventilation did not lead to longer conversations; in fact, conversations with patients were shorter than those with surrogates. The majority of subjects (81%) described the conversation as worthwhile. The majority of clinicians (73%) reported that the conversation offered a new and significant understanding of the patient's preferences if a setback were to occur. CONCLUSIONS: Conversations about serious illness care goals can be accomplished in a relatively short period of time, are acceptable to chronically critically ill patients and their surrogate decision makers in the LTACH, and are perceived as worthwhile by patients, surrogates, and clinicians.",2017,10.1089/jpm.2016.0485,20,7,710-715,eng,1557-7740,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Organizational Objectives and Decision Making and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Communication and Family/*psychology and Health Personnel/*psychology and Professional-Family Relations and Critical Care/*organization & administration and Patient Preference/*psychology and end of life and chronic critical illness and Chronic Disease/psychology/therapy and Long-Term Care/*organization & administration and long-term nursing home patients at the end of life and Respiration, Artificial/*psychology",NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wu_2008_Joofpame,JOUR,Advance care planning among the oldest old,"Wu, Pauline and Lorenz, Karl A. and Chodosh, Joshua",Journal of palliative medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To describe end-of-life advance care planning among the oldest-old (those >/= 85 years) and to identify patient characteristics and healthcare utilization patterns associated with likelihood of care planning documentation. DESIGN: Medical charts were abstracted for evidence of advance care planning documentation (including surrogate for health care decisions) and linked to patient demographic, clinical, and health utilization characteristics. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VA GLAHS). PARTICIPANTS: All Veterans (n = 175) aged >/= 85 who died between September 1999 and October 2000 and used services at the VA GLAHS in the last year of life. MEASUREMENTS: The association of patient demographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics with documentation of advance care planning and surrogates was modeled using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among veterans (mean age at death, 89.4 +/- 3.8 years), 50 of 149 (34%) electronic available records had documented care preferences whereas 68 (46%) had documentation of surrogates. Considering demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics, only age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.1 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.2) and outpatient visits (AOR: 1.6 per quartile of general and geriatric medicine visit frequency; 95% CI: 1.1-;2.3) were associated with advance directive completion. A multivariable regression model using the same predictors to predict documentation of surrogates found similar associations with total outpatient visits (AOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) and general and geriatric medicine utilization. (AOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0). CONCLUSION: Even in a health care system known for high-quality chronic illness care, documentation of advance care planning and selected proxies for health care decisions at the end of life was infrequent. Outpatient primary care and geriatric providers' visits were more frequent among those who had documented advance care planning, suggesting that involvement of these practitioners may improve end-of-life care.",2008,10.1089/jpm.2007.0134,11,2,152-157,eng,1096-6218 1557-7740,"Humans and Male and Adult and Veterans and Chronic Disease and Decision Making and Documentation and Aged, 80 and over and *Advance Directives and *Health Planning",NA,NA,2008/03//undefined,J Palliat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
