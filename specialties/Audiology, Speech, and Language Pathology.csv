Saunders_2020_Earandhea,JOUR,Application of Big Data to Support Evidence-Based Public Health Policy Decision-Making for Hearing,"Saunders, Gabrielle H. and Christensen, Jeppe H. and Gutenberg, Johanna and Pontoppidan, Niels H. and Smith, Andrew and Spanoudakis, George and Bamiou, Doris-Eva",Ear and hearing,"Ideally, public health policies are formulated from scientific data; however, policy-specific data are often unavailable. Big data can generate ecologically-valid, high-quality scientific evidence, and therefore has the potential to change how public health policies are formulated. Here, we discuss the use of big data for developing evidence-based hearing health policies, using data collected and analyzed with a research prototype of a data repository known as EVOTION (EVidence-based management of hearing impairments: public health pOlicy-making based on fusing big data analytics and simulaTION), to illustrate our points. Data in the repository consist of audiometric clinical data, prospective real-world data collected from hearing aids and an app, and responses to questionnaires collected for research purposes. To date, we have used the platform and a synthetic dataset to model the estimated risk of noise-induced hearing loss and have shown novel evidence of ways in which external factors influence hearing aid usage patterns. We contend that this research prototype data repository illustrates the value of using big data for policy-making by providing high-quality evidence that could be used to formulate and evaluate the impact of hearing health care policies.",2020,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000850,41,5,1057-1063,eng,1538-4667 0196-0202,Humans and Health Policy and Prospective Studies and *Big Data and *Policy Making and Hearing,NA,NA,2020/10//Sep undefined,Ear Hear,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chang_2020_Amjoofsppa,JOUR,Effects of Visual Aids for End-of-Life Care on Decisional Capacity of People With Dementia,"Chang, Wan-Zu D. and Bourgeois, Michelle S.",American journal of speech-language pathology,"Purpose This study evaluated the decision-making capacity of persons with mild and moderate dementia on end-of-life care when using visual aids. A secondary purpose was to learn whether the judges naive to the experimental conditions would rate participants' decisional abilities as better when augmented by visual aids, thereby validating the behavioral changes due to the use of these external support. Method Twenty older adults with mild and moderate dementia demonstrated Understanding, Expressing a Choice, Reasoning, and Appreciation of 2 medical vignettes under 2 counterbalanced conditions: verbal alone or verbal with visual aids. Transcripts were analyzed and scored to measure decisional skills. Twelve judges rated participants' decisional abilities using a 7-point Likert scale. Results Participants demonstrated significantly better overall decisional capacity in Understanding, Reasoning, and Appreciation when supported by visual aids during the decision-making process. No significant differences between conditions were found in Expressing a Choice, the decisional skill Logical Sequence under Reasoning, and Acknowledgment under Appreciation. Overall, the judges' ratings validated these outcomes; the judges' ratings reflected greater agreement in the visual condition than in the verbal condition. Conclusions Findings indicated that visual aids (a) improved the decision-making capacity of individuals with dementia in comprehending medical information, employing supportive reasons, and relating this information to his or her own situation and (b) contain the potential for judges who majored or are majoring in speech-language pathology to reach a stronger consensus when determining the decision-making capacity of individuals with dementia.",2020,10.1044/2019_AJSLP-19-0028,29,1,185-200,eng,1558-9110 1058-0360,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Patient Participation and Aged, 80 and over and *Choice Behavior and *Audiovisual Aids and Terminal Care/*methods and Dementia/*psychology and Mental Status and Dementia Tests",NA,NA,2020/02/07/,Am J Speech Lang Pathol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Baylor_2019_Amjoofsppa,JOUR,Teaching Medical Students Skills for Effective Communication With Patients Who Have Communication Disorders,"Baylor, Carolyn and Burns, Michael and McDonough, Karen and Mach, Helen and Yorkston, Kathryn",American journal of speech-language pathology,"Purpose Patients with communication impairments including speech, language, cognition, or hearing disorders face many barriers to communication in health care settings. These patients report loss of autonomy in health care decision making, are at increased risk for medical errors, and are less satisfied with health care than patients without communication disorders. Although medical students receive training in effective patient-provider communication, most of this training assumes patients have intact communication abilities. Medical students and other health care providers are often unprepared to meet the communication needs of patients with communication disorders in health care encounters. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a curriculum for training medical students to communicate effectively with patients who have a range of communication disorders. Method Twenty-six 2nd-year medical students volunteered for assessments before and after a required workshop in a class. This workshop included instruction about different types of communication disorders and communication strategies, followed by practice with standardized patients portraying different communication disorders. Outcome measures included a knowledge test, ratings of self-efficacy, and evaluation of students' skills when interviewing standardized patients portraying aphasia and dysarthria. Results Medical students demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, and use of recommended communication techniques. Conclusions The curriculum appeared effective in changing medical students' knowledge and skills for working with patients with communication disorders.

The purpose of this tutorial is to review the myriad issues surrounding consent, refusal, and waivers. The larger goal is to invigorate clinical practice by providing clinicians with knowledge of ethics and law. This tutorial is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. METHOD: The authors use a hypothetical case of a ""noncompliant"" individual under the care of an interdisciplinary neurorehabilitation team to illuminate the ethical and legal features of the patient-practitioner relationship; the elements of clinical decision-making capacity; the duty of disclosure and the right of informed consent or informed refusal; and the relationship among noncompliance, defensive practices, and iatrogenic harm. We explore the legal question of whether waivers of liability in the medical context are enforceable or unenforceable as a matter of public policy. CONCLUSIONS: Speech-language pathologists, among other health care providers, have fiduciary and other ethical and legal obligations to patients. Because waivers try to shift liability for substandard care from health care providers to patients, courts usually find waivers of liability in the medical context unenforceable as a matter of public policy.",2016,10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0041,25,4,453-469,eng,1558-9110 1058-0360,Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and *Informed Consent and *Deglutition Disorders and Treatment Refusal/*ethics,NA,NA,2016/11/01/,Am J Speech Lang Pathol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Caduff_2020_Earandhea,JOUR,Physiological Monitoring and Hearing Loss: Toward a More Integrated and Ecologically Validated Health Mapping,"Caduff, Andreas and Feldman, Yuri and Ben Ishai, Paul and Launer, Stefan",Ear and hearing,"With an ongoing shift from managing disease toward the inclusion of maintaining health and preventing disease, the world has seen the rise of increasingly sophisticated physiological monitoring and analytics. Innovations range from wearables, smartphone-based spot monitoring to highly complex noncontact, remote monitoring, utilizing different mechanisms. These tools empower the individual to better navigate their own health. They also generate powerful insights towards the detection of subclinical symptoms or processes via existing and novel digital biomarkers. In that context, a topic that is receiving increasing interest is the modulation of human physiology around an individual ""baseline"" in everyday life and the impact thereof on other sensorineural body functions such as hearing. More and more fully contextualized and truly long-term physiological data are becoming available that allows deeper insights into the response of the human body to our behavior, immediate environment and the understanding of how chronic conditions are evolving. Hearing loss often goes hand in hand with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, cognitive impairment, increased risk of fall, mental health, or cardiovascular risk factors. This inspires an interest to not only look at hearing impairment itself but to take a broader view, for example, to include contextualized vital signs. Interestingly, stress and its physiological implications have also been shown to be a relevant precursor to hearing loss and other chronic conditions. This article deduces the requirements for wearables and their ecosystems to detect relevant dynamics and connects that to the need for more ecologically valid data towards an integrated and more holistic mapping of hearing characteristics.",2020,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000960,41 Suppl 1,NA,120S-130S,eng,1538-4667 0196-0202,"Humans and Ecosystem and Monitoring, Physiologic and *Hearing Loss/diagnosis and Hearing and *Deafness",NA,NA,2020/12//Nov undefined,Ear Hear,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs) were recently introduced for the purpose of integrating data from different databases by providing an abstract representation of audiological measurements. This paper aims at collecting expert labels for a sample database and to determine statistical models from the labelled data set.Design: By an expert survey, CAFPAs as well as labels for audiological findings and treatment recommendations were collected for patients from the database of Horzentrum Oldenburg.Study sample: A total of 287 single patient cases were assessed by twelve highly experienced audiological experts.Results: The labelled data set was used to derive probability density functions for categories given by the expert labels. The collected data set is suitable for estimating training distributions due to realistic variability contained in data for different, distinct categories. Suitable distribution functions were determined. The derived training distributions were compared regarding different audiological questions.Conclusions: The method-expert survey, sorting data into categories, and determining training distributions - could be extended to other data sets, which could then be integrated via the CAFPAs and used in a classification task.",2020,10.1080/14992027.2020.1728401,59,7,534-547,eng,1708-8186 1499-2027,"machine learning and Humans and Probability and Databases, Factual and Reproducibility of Results and Data Interpretation, Statistical and *Expert Systems and *Models, Statistical and *Datasets as Topic and Audiology/*statistics & numerical data and Correction of Hearing Impairment/*statistics & numerical data and Hearing Tests/statistics & numerical data and Medical audiology and precision diagnostics and Tele-audiology/tele-health",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Int J Audiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Audiometric and noise exposure data were collected on a population of screened workers (N = 1,113) from 17 factories located in Zhejiang province, China. All the subjects were exposed to complex noise. Each subject was given an otologic examination to determine their pure-tone hearing threshold levels and had their personal full-shift noise recorded. For each subject, the hearing loss was evaluated according to the hearing impairment definition of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Age, exposure duration, equivalent A-weighted SPL (LAeq), and median kurtosis were used as the input for four machine learning algorithms, that is, support vector machine, neural network multilayer perceptron, random forest, and adaptive boosting. Both classification and regression models were developed to predict noise-induced hearing loss applying these four machine learning algorithms. Two indexes, area under the curve and prediction accuracy, were used to assess the performances of the classification models for predicting hearing impairment of workers. Root mean square error was used to quantify the prediction performance of the regression models. RESULTS: A prediction accuracy between 78.6 and 80.1% indicated that the four classification models could be useful tools to assess noise-induced hearing impairment of workers exposed to various complex occupational noises. A comprehensive evaluation using both the area under the curve and prediction accuracy showed that the support vector machine model achieved the best score and thus should be selected as the tool with the highest potential for predicting hearing impairment from the occupational noise exposures in this study. The root mean square error performance indicated that the four regression models could be used to predict noise-induced hearing loss quantitatively and the multilayer perceptron regression model had the best performance.

DESIGN: ANLs were measured before hearing-aid fitting. Post-fitting outcome was assessed using the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and a hearing-aid use questionnaire. Models that predicted outcomes (successful vs. unsuccessful) were built using logistic regression and several machine learning algorithms, and were evaluated using the cross-validation technique. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 132 adults with hearing impairment. RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of the models ranged from 61% to 68% (IOI-HA) and from 55% to 61% (hearing-aid use questionnaire). The models performed more poorly in predicting 12-month than three-month outcomes. The ANL cutoff between successful and unsuccessful users was higher for experienced (<e2><88><bc>18 dB) than first-time hearing-aid users (<e2><88><bc>10 dB), indicating that most experienced users will be predicted as successful users regardless of their ANLs. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-fitting ANL is more useful in predicting short-term (three months) hearing-aid outcomes for first-time users, as measured by the IOI-HA.

The aim of this study is to review factors that influence this choice and to formulate a flowchart. An extensive Medline search was performed. Factors can be divided into surgical, audiological, and patient factors. Surgical factors are anatomic variation and otological medical history. Both are divided in absolute and relative contraindications. Duration of deafness and residual hearing are combined in the audiological factor. Likeliness of improvement of speech perception after CI at different durations of deafness is estimated. This is followed by comparison of between-ear differences in duration of deafness. If there is a large difference, above the presented 5% interval, the ear with the shortest duration is preferred.

Bartlett_2018_Amjoofsppa,JOUR,Insights Into Oropharyngeal Dysphagia From Administrative Data and Clinical Registries: A Literature Review,"Bartlett, Rebecca S. and Thibeault, Susan L.",American journal of speech-language pathology,"PURPOSE: The call for data-driven health care has been bolstered by the digitization of medical records, quality initiatives, and payment reform. Administrative databases and clinical registries are increasingly being used to study oropharyngeal dysphagia and to facilitate data-driven decision making. The objective of this work was to summarize key findings, etiologies studied, data sources used, study objectives, and quality of evidence of all original research articles that have investigated oropharyngeal dysphagia or aspiration pneumonia using administrative or clinical registry data to date. METHOD: A literature search was completed in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar (January 1, 1990, to February 1, 2017). Each study that met inclusion criteria was rated for quality of evidence on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Eighty-four research articles were included in the final analysis (n = 221-1,649,871). Over the past 20 years, the number of new publications in this area has quintupled. Most of the administrative database and clinical registry studies of dysphagia have been retrospective cohort studies and cross-sectional studies and limited to quality of evidence levels of 3-4. In these studies, much has been learned about risk factors for dysphagia and pneumonia in defined populations and health care costs and usage. Little has been gleaned from these studies regarding swallowing physiology or dysphagia management. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators are just beginning to develop the methods to study oropharyngeal dysphagia using administrative data and clinical registries. Future research is needed in all areas, from the fundamental issue of how to identify individuals with dysphagia with high sensitivity in these data sets to evaluating treatment effectiveness.

The aims of this study were to identify practice patterns, knowledge, and confidence levels of SLPs working with adults with TBI with cognitive-communication disorders. METHOD: We surveyed 100 SLPs from rural and urban hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and outpatient clinics in Wisconsin and analyzed data descriptively. RESULTS: SLPs in this sample had a combination of accurate and inaccurate knowledge related to TBI. Although all participants reported working with individuals with TBI, many participants rated themselves as lacking confidence or knowledge in this practice area. SLPs reported variable use of evidence-based procedures and training related to TBI. CONCLUSION: Results confirmed the high prevalence of TBI-related practice among SLPs in medical settings, but there was variable knowledge, confidence, and use of current evidence in practice.

Grenness_2015_Earandhea,JOUR,"Communication patterns in audiologic rehabilitation history-taking: audiologists, patients, and their companions","Grenness, Caitlin and Hickson, Louise and Laplante-Levesque, Ariane and Meyer, Carly and Davidson, Bronwyn",Ear and hearing,"OBJECTIVES: The nature of communication between patient and practitioner influences patient outcomes. Specifically, the history-taking phase of a consultation plays a role in the development of a relationship and in the success of subsequent shared decision making. There is limited research investigating patient-centered communication in audiology, and this study may be the first to investigate verbal communication in an adult audiologic rehabilitation context. This research aimed, first, to describe the nature of verbal communication involving audiologists, patients, and companions in the history-taking phase of initial audiology consultations and, second, to determine factors associated with communication dynamics. DESIGN: Sixty-three initial audiology consultations involving patients over the age of 55, their companions when present, and audiologists were audio-video recorded. Consultations were coded using the Roter Interaction Analysis System and divided into three consultation phases: history, examination, and counseling. This study analyzed only the history-taking phase in terms of opening structure, communication profiles of each speaker, and communication dynamics. Associations between communication dynamics (verbal dominance, content balance, and communication control) and 11 variables were evaluated using Linear Mixed Model methods. RESULTS: The mean length of the history-taking phase was 8.8 min (range 1.7 to 22.6). A companion was present in 27% of consultations. Results were grouped into three areas of communication: opening structure, information exchange, and relationship building. Examination of the history opening structure revealed audiologists' tendency to control the agenda by initiating consultations with a closed-ended question 62% of the time, followed by interruption of patient talk after 21.3 sec, on average. The aforementioned behaviors were associated with increased verbal dominance throughout the history and increased control over the content of questions. For the remainder of the history, audiologists asked 97% of the questions and did so primarily in closed-ended form. This resulted in the audiologist talking as much as the patient and much more than the companions when they were present. Questions asked by the audiologist were balanced in topic: biomedical and psychosocial/lifestyle; however, few emotionally focused utterances were observed from any speaker (less than 5% of utter ances). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of verbal communication involving audiologists, patients, and companions in the history-taking phase in 63 initial audiology consultations revealed a communicative exchange that was audiologist-controlled and structured, but covered both medical and lifestyle content. Audiologists often attempted to create a relationship with their patients; however, little emotional relationship building occurred, which may have implications later in the consultation when management decisions are being made. These results are not in line with patient-centered communication principles. Further research and changes to clinical practice are warranted to transform patient-centered communication from an ideal to a reality.",2015,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000100,36,2,191-204,eng,1538-4667 0196-0202,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Patient Participation and Prospective Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Video Recording and *Communication and Friends and *Professional-Patient Relations and *Patient-Centered Care and *Audiology and *Medical History Taking",NA,NA,2015/04//Mar undefined,Ear Hear,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tai_2019_Injoofau,JOUR,Towards patient-centred communication: an observational study of supervised audiology student-patient hearing assessments,"Tai, Samantha and Barr, Caitlin and Woodward-Kron, Robyn",International journal of audiology,"OBJECTIVE: This study has two interconnected aims. The first was to better understand how audiology students co-construct hearing assessments with patients while supervised by a clinical educator. The second was to investigate how students' communication aligns with principles of patient-centred communication. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-three final year audiology students from two Australian universities participated in the study. RESULTS: The supervised student-patient hearing appointments were video-recorded and transcribed. Genre analysis, a form of discourse analysis, was carried out to identify the structure and communication patterns. The six-function model of medical communication was adopted as an analytical framework to map students' patient-centred communication. The findings showed generic structure of the hearing assessments were the main stages of taking a history, providing a diagnosis, and initiating management plans. For patient-centred communication functions, students demonstrated their ability to foster the relationship and gather information. The communication functions of decision-making, enablement, and responding to patients' emotions were rarely observed. A significant relationship was found between clinical educators' interjection as a function of students' patient-centred communication tendencies. CONCLUSION: To enhance students' patient-centred communication, teaching should include explaining and planning as well as addressing additional aspects of patient-centred communication. Support of clinical educators is needed to optimise students' communication skills learning.",2019,10.1080/14992027.2018.1538574,58,2,106-97,eng,1708-8186 1499-2027,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Learning and students and Attitude of Health Personnel and Clinical Competence and *Communication and *Professional-Patient Relations and *Patient-Centered Care and discourse analysis and *Education, Professional and *Students, Health Occupations/psychology and Audiologists/*education/psychology and audiology and clinical communication and clinical education and Patient-centred communication",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Int J Audiol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Fitzpatrick_2015_Earandhea,JOUR,Pediatric Cochlear Implantation: Why Do Children Receive Implants Late?,"Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth M. and Ham, Julia and Whittingham, JoAnne",Ear and hearing,"OBJECTIVES: Early cochlear implantation has been widely promoted for children who derive inadequate benefit from conventional acoustic amplification. Universal newborn hearing screening has led to earlier identification and intervention, including cochlear implantation in much of the world. The purpose of this study was to examine age and time to cochlear implantation and to understand the factors that affected late cochlear implantation in children who received cochlear implants. DESIGN: In this population-based study, data were examined for all children who underwent cochlear implant surgery in one region of Canada from 2002 to 2013. Clinical characteristics were collected prospectively as part of a larger project examining outcomes from newborn hearing screening. For this study, audiologic details including age and severity of hearing loss at diagnosis, age at cochlear implant candidacy, and age at cochlear implantation were documented. Additional detailed medical chart information was extracted to identify the factors associated with late implantation for children who received cochlear implants more than 12 months after confirmation of hearing loss. RESULTS: The median age of diagnosis of permanent hearing loss for 187 children was 12.6 (interquartile range: 5.5, 21.7) months, and the age of cochlear implantation over the 12-year period was highly variable with a median age of 36.2 (interquartile range: 21.4, 71.3) months. A total of 118 (63.1%) received their first implant more than 12 months after confirmation of hearing loss. Detailed analysis of clinical profiles for these 118 children revealed that late implantation could be accounted for primarily by progressive hearing loss (52.5%), complex medical conditions (16.9%), family indecision (9.3%), geographical location (5.9%), and other miscellaneous known (6.8%) and unknown factors (8.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that despite the trend toward earlier implantation, a substantial number of children can be expected to receive their first cochlear implant well beyond their first birthday because they do not meet audiologic criteria of severe to profound hearing loss for cochlear implantation at the time of identification of permanent hearing loss. This study underscores the importance of carefully monitoring all children with permanent hearing loss to ensure that optimal intervention including cochlear implantation occurs in a timely manner.",2015,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000184,36,6,688-694,eng,1538-4667 0196-0202,"Humans and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Cohort Studies and Prospective Studies and Canada and Ontario and Comorbidity and Parents and Age Factors and *Decision Making and Time-to-Treatment/*statistics & numerical data and Cochlear Implantation/*statistics & numerical data and Deafness/*rehabilitation and Early Medical Intervention/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2015/12//Nov undefined,Ear Hear,NA,NA,NA,NA
Fitzpatrick_2017_Injoofau,JOUR,Characteristics of children with unilateral hearing loss,"Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth M. and Al-Essa, Rakan S. and Whittingham, JoAnne and Fitzpatrick, Jessica",International journal of audiology,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL), examine deterioration in hearing, and explore amplification decisions. DESIGN: Population-based data were collected prospectively from time of diagnosis. Serial audiograms and amplification details were retrospectively extracted from clinical charts to document the trajectory and management of hearing loss. SAMPLE: The study included all children identified with UHL in one region of Canada over a 13-year period (2003-2015) after implementation of universal newborn hearing screening. RESULTS: Of 537 children with permanent hearing loss, 20.1% (108) presented with UHL at diagnosis. They were identified at a median age of 13.9 months (IQR: 2.8, 49.0). Children with congenital loss were identified at 2.8 months (IQR: 2.0, 3.6) and made up 47.2% (n = 51), reflecting that a substantial portion had late-onset, acquired or late-identified loss. A total of 42.4% (n = 39) showed deterioration in hearing, including 16 (17.4%) who developed bilateral loss. By study end, 73.1% (79/108) of children had received amplification recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 20% of children with permanent HL are first diagnosed with UHL. About 40% are at risk for deterioration in hearing either in the impaired ear and/or in the normal hearing ear.",2017,10.1080/14992027.2017.1337938,56,11,819-828,eng,1708-8186 1499-2027,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Age Factors and Age of Onset and Disease Progression and Clinical Decision-Making and *Adolescent Behavior and Ontario/epidemiology and paediatric and *Auditory Perception and *Child Behavior and *Hearing and *Hearing Aids and Demographics/epidemiology and Disabled Children/psychology/*rehabilitation and hearing aids and Hearing Loss, Bilateral/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitation and Hearing Loss, Unilateral/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitation and Infant Behavior and medical audiology and Persons With Hearing Impairments/psychology/*rehabilitation",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,Int J Audiol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Petty_2012_Jov.ojotVF,JOUR,Health information-seeking behaviors among classically trained singers,"Petty, Brian E.",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,"Understanding health information-seeking behaviors (HISBs) within a particular patient demographic group is an important part of effective clinical outreach and education efforts. Although the community of classically trained singers has long been recognized by specialized health care providers, no studies have yet addressed the processes by which they search for voice-related health information, and little is known about how they use and access medical care. An electronic questionnaire focusing on HISB and voice-related health care issues was administered to 151 self-identified classically trained singers and 49 nonsinger controls. Outcomes of interest were tested for association with groups of singers and controls, followed by tests of association between demographic variables (age, gender, insurance status) with each outcome of interest. Results showed significant differences in specialty care access including point of first contact (P=0.0085), gender-associated delay of treatment initiation (P=0.0324), and use of home remedies for vocal problems (P<e2><89><a4>0.0001). Significant differences in HISB were noted as well, including history of having undertaken an information search (P<e2><89><a4>0.0001), likelihood of having concerns about information quality (P<e2><89><a4>0.0001), and difficulty knowing where to find information (P<e2><89><a4>0.0001).

Fitzpatrick_2010_Earandhea,JOUR,Clinical practice for children with mild bilateral and unilateral hearing loss,"Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth M. and Durieux-Smith, Andree and Whittingham, Joanne",Ear and hearing,"OBJECTIVE: Historically, children with mild bilateral and unilateral hearing loss have been reported to experience difficulties related to language and academic functioning. In the context of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening, there is an increasing focus on determining optimal clinical interventions for this population of children. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of mild bilateral or unilateral hearing loss identified in a clinical population from 1990 to 2006 and to document clinical practices related to recommendations and uptake of amplification. DESIGN: This population-based study consisted of a detailed retrospective chart review of all children identified with mild bilateral or unilateral hearing loss in a Canadian pediatric center between 1990 and 2006. Hearing loss and patient characteristics were extracted to describe the clinical population. Amplification recommendations and uptake of amplification were documented. Clinical decisions regarding amplification practices were explored as a function of age of identification and severity of hearing loss. RESULTS: A total of 670 children were identified with permanent hearing loss during the 16-yr study period, of which 291 were presented with a mild bilateral or unilateral hearing loss. Detailed reviews of the 255 available medical charts showed that at diagnosis, 178 children presented with mild bilateral, 31 with mild bilateral high frequency, and 46 with unilateral hearing loss. Eighty percent of children had been referred through conventional medical processes before the implementation of universal hearing screening and 20% had been exposed to screening. The average age of identification for the entire group was 54.2 mos (interquartile range, 30.1 to 76.9 mos). Amplification was prescribed for 91.4% of children but there was considerable delay from confirmation of hearing loss to amplification for both children identified with and without screening. Overall, 54.1% received an initial recommendation for amplification and a further 37.3% received a recommendation more than 3 mos after hearing loss confirmation. Practice patterns varied according to category of hearing loss with 60.1% of children with mild bilateral hearing loss receiving an initial recommendation compared with 26.1% of those with unilateral hearing loss. Clinical decision making relative to amplification needs was also changed during the course of audiologic care. The decision to amplify was significantly related to age at identification and degree of hearing loss in the mild bilateral group but not in the unilateral group. Although, more than 90% of children received a recommendation for amplification, chart documentation revealed that less than two thirds of children consistently used their amplification devices. Use of amplification did not vary among children with mild bilateral, mild bilateral high frequency, and unilateral hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: : This research suggests that there is considerable uncertainty related to clinical recommendations of intervention for this population of children. The impact of parental indecision regarding the benefits of amplification is unknown. Further studies are required to document the potential benefits and factors affecting amplification recommendations and use in the current practice environment where children with mild bilateral or unilateral hearing loss are identified early through newborn hearing screening.",2010,10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181cdb2b9,31,3,392-400,eng,1538-4667 0196-0202,"Humans and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Prevalence and Infant, Newborn and Severity of Illness Index and Canada/epidemiology and Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data and Hearing Tests/statistics & numerical data and Hearing Aids/*statistics & numerical data and *Hearing Loss, Bilateral/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and *Hearing Loss, Unilateral/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and Neonatal Screening and Professional Practice/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,Ear Hear,NA,NA,NA,NA
