Tauschmann_2018_NatureviEndo,JOUR,Technology in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus - current status and future prospects,"Tauschmann, Martin and Hovorka, Roman",Nature reviews. Endocrinology,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) represents 5-10% of diabetes cases worldwide. The incidence of T1DM is increasing, and there is no immediate prospect of a cure. As such, lifelong management is required, the burden of which is being eased by novel treatment modalities, particularly from the field of diabetes technologies. Continuous glucose monitoring has become the standard of care and includes factory-calibrated subcutaneous glucose monitoring and long-term implantable glucose sensing. In addition, considerable progress has been made in technology-enabled glucose-responsive insulin delivery. The first hybrid insulin-only closed-loop system has been commercialized, and other closed-loop systems are under development, including dual-hormone glucose control systems. This Review focuses on well-established diabetes technologies, including glucose sensing, pen-based insulin delivery, data management and data analytics. We also cover insulin pump therapy, threshold-based suspend, predictive low-glucose suspend and single-hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop systems. Clinical practice recommendations for insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring are presented, and ongoing research and future prospects are highlighted. We conclude that the management of T1DM is improved by diabetes technology for the benefit of the majority of people with T1DM, their caregivers and guardians and health-care professionals treating patients with T1DM.",2018,10.1038/s41574-018-0044-y,14,8,464-475,eng,1759-5037 1759-5029,"Humans and Female and Male and Quality Improvement and Forecasting and Disease Management and Drug Delivery Systems and Severity of Illness Index and Biomedical Technology and Blood Glucose/metabolism and *Insulin Infusion Systems and *Pancreas, Artificial and Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring/standards/trends and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*diagnosis/*drug therapy and Insulin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology",NA,NA,2018/08//undefined,Nat Rev Endocrinol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Farran_2019_Frinen,JOUR,Use of Non-invasive Parameters and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Predicting Future Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Health Data From Kuwait,"Farran, Bassam and AlWotayan, Rihab and Alkandari, Hessa and Al-Abdulrazzaq, Dalia and Channanath, Arshad and Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Objective: In recent decades, the Arab population has experienced an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), particularly within the Gulf Cooperation Council. In this context, early intervention programmes rely on an ability to identify individuals at risk of T2DM. We aimed to build prognostic models for the risk of T2DM in the Arab population using machine-learning algorithms vs. conventional logistic regression (LR) and simple non-invasive clinical markers over three different time scales (3, 5, and 7 years from the baseline). Design: This retrospective cohort study used three models based on LR, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVM) with five-fold cross-validation. The models included the following baseline non-invasive parameters: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), pre-existing hypertension, family history of hypertension, and T2DM. Setting: This study was based on data from the Kuwait Health Network (KHN), which integrated primary health and hospital laboratory data into a single system. Participants: The study included 1,837 native Kuwaiti Arab individuals (equal proportion of men and women) with mean age as 59.5 <c2><b1> 11.4 years. Among them, 647 developed T2DM within 7 years of the baseline non-invasive measurements. Analytical methods: The discriminatory power of each model for classifying people at risk of T2DM within 3, 5, or 7 years and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined. Outcome measures: Onset of T2DM at 3, 5, and 7 years. Results: The k-NN machine-learning technique, which yielded AUC values of 0.83, 0.82, and 0.79 for 3-, 5-, and 7-year prediction horizons, respectively, outperformed the most commonly used LR method and other previously reported methods. Comparable results were achieved using the SVM and LR models with corresponding AUC values of (SVM: 0.73, LR: 0.74), (SVM: 0.68, LR: 0.72), and (SVM: 0.71, LR: 0.70) for 3-, 5-, and 7-year prediction horizons, respectively. For all models, the discriminatory power decreased as the prediction horizon increased from 3 to 7 years. Conclusions: Machine-learning techniques represent a useful addition to the commonly reported LR technique. Our prognostic models for the future risk of T2DM could be used to plan and implement early prevention programmes for at risk groups in the Arab population.",2019,10.3389/fendo.2019.00624,10,NA,624,eng,1664-2392,logistic regression and support vector machine and type 2 diabetes and body mass index and prognosis and hypertension and k-nearest neighbours,NA,NA,2019///,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),NA,NA,NA,NA
Rapone_2020_Frinen,JOUR,Does Periodontal Inflammation Affect Type 1 Diabetes in Childhood and Adolescence? A Meta-Analysis,"Rapone, Biagio and Corsalini, Massimo and Converti, Ilaria and Loverro, Maria Teresa and Gnoni, Antonio and Trerotoli, Paolo and Ferrara, Elisabetta",Frontiers in endocrinology,"The emergence of link between periodontal disease and diabetes has created conditions for analyzing new interdisciplinary approach making toward tackling oral health and systemic issues. As periodontal disease is a readily modifiable risk factor this association has potential clinical implications. The aim of this paper was systematically review the extant literature related to analytics data in order to identify the association between type 1 diabetes (T1DM) in childhood and adolescence with periodontal inflammation. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a database search between 2004 and 2019. A manual search of the literature was conducted as an additional phase of the search process, with the aim of identifying studies that were missed in the primary search. One hundred and thirty-nine records were screened and 10 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies were of moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included assessments of diabetes and periodontal status. In diabetic populations, compared to healthy subjects, interindividual differences in periodontal status are reflected in higher severity of periodontal inflammation. The most reported barriers to evidence uptake were the intrinsic limits of cross-sectional report data and relevant research, and lack of timely research output. Based on the evidence presented within the literature, the aforementioned biomarkers correlate with poor periodontal status in type 1 diabetic patients. Whilst the corpus of the evidence suggests that there may be an association between periodontal status and type 1 diabetes, study designs and methodological limitations hinder interpretation of the current research.",2020,10.3389/fendo.2020.00278,11,NA,278,eng,1664-2392,"Humans and Adolescent and Child and children and Risk Factors and Prognosis and adolescents and type 1 diabetes and Biomarkers/metabolism and periodontitis and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/etiology/metabolism/*pathology and Inflammation/*complications and periodontal disease and Periodontal Diseases/*complications",NA,NA,2020///,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),NA,NA,NA,NA

Hilvo_2020_Frinen,JOUR,Ceramides and Ceramide Scores: Clinical Applications for Cardiometabolic Risk Stratification,"Hilvo, Mika and Vasile, Vlad C. and Donato, Leslie J. and Hurme, Reini and Laaksonen, Reijo",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Ceramides are bioactive lipids that have an important role in many cellular functions such as apoptosis and inflammation. During the past decade emerging clinical data have shown that ceramides are not only of great biochemical interest but may also have diagnostic utility. Ceramides have shown independent predictive value for negative cardiovascular outcomes as well as for the onset of type 2 diabetes. Based on abundant published data, risk score using the concentrations of circulating ceramides have been developed and adapted for routine clinical practice. Currently serum ceramides are used clinically as efficient risk stratifiers for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). A direct cause-effect relationship between CVD and ceramide has not been established to date. As ceramide-specific medications are being developed, conventional strategies such as lipid lowering agents and lifestyle interventions can be used to reduce overall risk. Ceramides can identify a very high-risk coronary heart disease category of patients in need for more intense medical attention, specifically those patients at higher risk as highlighted in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for stable chronic coronary syndrome patients. In addition, the ceramide risk score may be used as a decision-making tool in primary prevention patients with moderate CVD risk. Finally, the ceramide risk score may have a unique utility as a motivational tool to increase patient's adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle changes.",2020,10.3389/fendo.2020.570628,11,NA,570628,eng,1664-2392,"stroke and Humans and Risk Factors and Animals and Biomarkers and diabetes mellitus and heart failure and cardiovascular disease and Cardiovascular Diseases/*blood/*diagnosis and ceramide and ceramide score and Ceramides/*blood and coronary heart disease and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/diagnosis and Metabolic Diseases/*blood/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2020///,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),NA,NA,NA,NA

The best way to deliver preconception care to address health risks related to nutrition is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to study the impact of conversational agent technology in 13 domains of preconception care among 528 non-pregnant African American and Black women. This analysis is restricted to those 480 women who reported at least one of the ten risks related to nutrition and dietary supplement use. INTERVENTIONS: An online conversational agent, called ""Gabby"", assesses health risks and delivers 12 months of tailored dialogue for over 100 preconception health risks, including ten nutrition and supplement risks, using behavioral change techniques like shared decision making and motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk to a health care provider. RESULTS: After 6 months, women using Gabby (a) reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for, on average, 52.9% (SD, 35.1%) of nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.9% (SD, 35.4) in the control group (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.45, P = 0.019); and (b) reported achieving the action and maintenance stage of change for, on average, 52.8% (SD 37.1) of the nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.8% (SD, 37.9) in the control group (IRR 1.26, 96% CI 1.08-1.48, P = 0.004). For subjects beginning the study at the contemplation stage of change, intervention subjects reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for 75.0% (SD, 36.3%) of their health risks compared to 52.1% (SD, 47.1%) in the control group (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The scalability of Gabby has the potential to improve women's nutritional health as an adjunct to clinical care or at the population health level. Further studies are needed to determine if improving nutrition and supplement risks can impact clinical outcomes including optimization of weight.

M. and Hoermann, Rudolf",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Although technical problems of thyroid testing have largely been resolved by modern assay technology, biological variation remains a challenge. This applies to subclinical thyroid disease, non-thyroidal illness syndrome, and those 10% of hypothyroid patients, who report impaired quality of life, despite normal thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations under levothyroxine (L-T4) replacement. Among multiple explanations for this condition, inadequate treatment dosage and monotherapy with L-T4 in subjects with impaired deiodination have received major attention. Translation to clinical practice is difficult, however, since univariate reference ranges for TSH and thyroid hormones fail to deliver robust decision algorithms for therapeutic interventions in patients with more subtle thyroid dysfunctions. Advances in mathematical and simulative modeling of pituitary-thyroid feedback control have improved our understanding of physiological mechanisms governing the homeostatic behavior. From multiple cybernetic models developed since 1956, four examples have also been translated to applications in medical decision-making and clinical trials. Structure parameters representing fundamental properties of the processing structure include the calculated secretory capacity of the thyroid gland (SPINA-GT), sum activity of peripheral deiodinases (SPINA-GD) and Jostel's TSH index for assessment of thyrotropic pituitary function, supplemented by a recently published algorithm for reconstructing the personal set point of thyroid homeostasis. In addition, a family of integrated models (University of California-Los Angeles platform) provides advanced methods for bioequivalence studies.

Though skin biopsy with quantitation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is still currently recognized as the gold standard, sudorimetry may yield diagnostic information not only on autonomic dysfunction but also enhance the assessment of the small somatosensory nerves, disease detection, progression, and response to therapy. Sudorimetry can be assessed using Sudoscan<e2><84><a2>, which measures electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) of hands and feet. It is based on different electrochemical principles (reverse iontophoresis and chronoamperometry) to measure sudomotor function than prior technologies, affording it a much more practical and precise performance profile for routine clinical use with potential as a research tool. Small nerve fiber dysfunction has been found to occur early in metabolic syndrome and diabetes and may also be the only neurological manifestation in small fiber neuropathies, beneath the detection limits of traditional nerve function tests. Test results are robust, accomplished within minutes, require little technical training and no calculations, since established norms have been provided for the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity. Sudomotor testing has been greatly under-utilized in the past, restricted to specialized centers capable of handling the technically demanding and expensive technology. Yet, evaluation of autonomic and somatic nerve function has been shown to be one of the best estimates of cardiovascular risk. Evaluation of sweating has the appeal of quantifiable non-invasive determination of the integrity of the peripheral autonomic nervous system, and can now be accomplished rapidly at point of care clinics with the determination of ESC, allowing intervention for morbid complications prior to permanent structural nerve damage. We review here sudomotor function testing technology, the research evidence accumulated supporting the clinical utility of measuring ESC, the medical applications of sudorimetry now available to physicians with this device, and clinical vignettes illustrating its use in the clinical decision-making process.",2015,10.3389/fendo.2015.00094,6,NA,94,eng,1664-2392,autonomic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy and small nerve fiber and sudomotor and sudorimetry,NA,NA,2015///,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),NA,NA,NA,NA
Wu_2019_Frinen,JOUR,Identification of a Five-Gene Signature and Establishment of a Prognostic Nomogram to Predict Progression-Free Interval of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma,"Wu, Mengwei and Yuan, Hongwei and Li, Xiaobin and Liao, Quan and Liu, Ziwen",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Background: The incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is high and increasing worldwide. Although prognosis is relatively good, it is important to select the minority of patients with poorer prognosis to avoid side effects associated with unnecessary over-treatment in low-risk patients; this requires accurate prognostic predictions. Materials and Methods: Six PTC expression datasets were obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Level 3 mRNA expression and clinicopathological data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Cancer (TCGA-THCA) database. Through integrated analysis of these datasets, highly reliable differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal tissue were identified and lasso Cox regression was applied to identify DEGs related to the progression-free interval (PFI) and to establish a prognostic gene signature. The performance of a five-gene signature was evaluated based on a Kaplan-Meier curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and Harrell's concordance index (C-index). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with PTC prognosis. Finally, a prognostic nomogram was established based on the TCGA-THCA dataset. Results: A novel five-gene signature was established to predict the PTC PFI, which included PLP2, LYVE1, FABP4, TGFBR3, and FXYD6, and the ROC curve and C-index showed good performance in both training and validation datasets. This could classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct PFIs and differentiate PTC tumors from normal tissue. Univariate Cox regression revealed that this signature was an independent prognostic factor for PTC. The established nomogram, incorporating the prognostic gene signature and clinical parameters, was able to predict the PFI with high efficiency. The gene signature-based nomogram was superior to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification to predict PTC PFI. Conclusions: Our study identified a five-gene signature and established a prognostic nomogram, which were reliable in predicting the PFI of PTC; this could be beneficial for individualized treatment and medical decision making.",2019,10.3389/fendo.2019.00790,10,NA,790,eng,1664-2392,GEO and nomogram and papillary thyroid carcinoma and progression-free interval and TCGA,NA,NA,2019///,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),NA,NA,NA,NA

In this Perspective we propose a framework to guide advancement for DCOEs. With the shift toward value-based purchasing and reimbursement and away from fee for service, defining the procedures for broader implementation of DCOEs as a way to improve population health and patient care experience (including quality and satisfaction) and reduce health care costs becomes critically important. It is prudent to implement new financial systems for compensating diabetes care that may not be provided by fiscally constrained private and academic medical centers.

These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to various diseases, including reproductive disorders, metabolic diseases, and developmental abnormalities, among others. Exposure to EDCs arises from industrial activity, use of personal and home care products, and consumption of contaminated food and water; however, the role of healthcare in exposing individuals to EDCs is grossly underappreciated. Indeed, through the use of medications as well as medical equipment and devices, healthcare providers are unknowing mediators of exposure to EDCs, chemicals that might not only promote disease but that may also antagonize the efficacy of treatments. The ethical implications of provider-dependent exposure are profound. A failure to disclose the endocrine-disrupting properties of medical interventions violates core principles of nonmaleficence, patient autonomy, and justice as well as the practice of informed consent. Furthermore, physicians' lack of knowledge regarding EDCs in medical practice artificially skews risk-benefit calculations that are fundamental to informed medical decision-making. To combat this underappreciated ethical challenge, urgent action is required. Healthcare providers must be educated about endocrine disruption. Known EDCs, defined by endocrinologists, should be clearly labeled on all medical products, and all medication components and devices should be screened for endocrine-disrupting properties. Finally, communication strategies must be devised to empower patients with knowledge about these risks.

OBJECTIVE: To develop quality measures that focus on outpatient hypoglycemia episodes for patients 65 and older with T2DM, which facilitate a clinician's ability to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care and reduce hypoglycemic episodes. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCESS: A technical expert panel established by the Endocrine Society in March 2019, which includes endocrinologists, primary care physicians, a diabetes care and education specialist/pharmacist, and a patient, developed 3 outpatient hypoglycemia quality measures.

PARTICIPANTS: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist. EVIDENCE: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. CONSENSUS PROCESS: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.",2018,10.1210/jc.2018-00229,103,5,1715-1744,eng,1945-7197 0021-972X,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Consensus and Aging/blood and Blood Chemical Analysis/methods/standards and Diagnostic Techniques, Endocrine/standards and Endocrinology/methods/*standards/trends and Hormone Replacement Therapy/methods/*standards and Hypogonadism/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy and Societies, Medical/organization & administration/standards and Testosterone/blood/deficiency/*therapeutic use",NA,NA,2018/05/01/,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mean serum CT concentrations were higher in the first year of life (9.81 <c2><b1> 8.8 pg/mL; range, 2.0-48.9 pg/mL) and the second year of life (4.56 <c2><b1> 2.64 pg/mL; range, 2.0-14.7 pg/mL). A significant decrease of serum CT levels was observed thereafter (P < .001), and starting from the third year of life serum CT levels were similar to those found in adults. No gender difference was found in any age group. Based on these results, age-specific CT reference ranges are needed in the pediatric population, and especially in the first 2 years of life. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study defining the reference range for serum CT in the pediatric population and large enough to be statistically meaningful. Our proposal may facilitate the process of decision making when dealing with gene carriers of MEN 2.",2015,10.1210/jc.2014-4508,100,5,1780-1784,eng,1945-7197 0021-972X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Infant, Newborn and Reference Values and Calcitonin/*blood",NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to identify the degree of reduction in excess body weight associated with cardiometabolic changes (lipid panel, liver function tests, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fasting blood glucose) in overweight and obese children. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through February 12, 2015. We included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated interventions to treat pediatric obesity (medication, surgery, lifestyle, and community-based interventions) with <e2><89><a5> a 6-month follow-up. We used a random effects meta-regression approach to assess the association between body mass index (BMI)/weight and cardiometabolic changes. RESULTS: We included 42 studies (37 randomized controlled trials and five cohorts) enrolling 3807 children (mean age, 12.2 years; weight, 74.7 kg; and BMI, 31.7 kg/m(2)). Studies had overall moderate to low risk of bias. A 1-mm Hg decrease in SBP was significantly associated with a decrease of 0.16 kg/m(2) (P = .04) in BMI. A 1-mg/dL increase in HDL was significantly associated with a 0.74-kg decrease in weight (P = .02). A 1-mg/dL decrease in triglycerides was significantly associated with a 0.1-kg decrease in weight (P = .03). The remaining associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction in children is associated with significant changes in several cardiometabolic outcomes, particularly HDL, SBP, and triglycerides. The magnitude of improvement may help in setting expectations and may inform shared decision-making and counseling.",2017,10.1210/jc.2016-2575,102,3,758-762,eng,1945-7197 0021-972X,"Humans and Adolescent and Child and Treatment Outcome and Blood Pressure and Glucose Tolerance Test and Liver Function Tests and *Weight Loss and Blood Glucose/metabolism and Glycated Hemoglobin A/metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases/*blood/prevention & control and Metabolic Diseases/*blood/prevention & control and Pediatric Obesity/*blood/therapy and Alanine Transaminase/metabolism and Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism and Cholesterol, HDL/metabolism and Cholesterol, LDL/metabolism and Dyslipidemias/metabolism and gamma-Glutamyltransferase/metabolism and Overweight/metabolism/therapy and Pediatric Obesity/metabolism/*therapy and Triglycerides/metabolism",NA,NA,2017/03/01/,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA
