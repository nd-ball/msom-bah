Dreyer_2017_Radi,JOUR,When Machines Think: Radiology's Next Frontier,"Dreyer, Keith J. and Geis, J. Raymond",Radiology,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning are terms now seen frequently, all of which refer to computer algorithms that change as they are exposed to more data. Many of these algorithms are surprisingly good at recognizing objects in images. The combination of large amounts of machine-consumable digital data, increased and cheaper computing power, and increasingly sophisticated statistical models combine to enable machines to find patterns in data in ways that are not only cost-effective but also potentially beyond humans' abilities. Building an AI algorithm can be surprisingly easy. Understanding the associated data structures and statistics, on the other hand, is often difficult and obscure. Converting the algorithm into a sophisticated product that works consistently in broad, general clinical use is complex and incompletely understood. To show how these AI products reduce costs and improve outcomes will require clinical translation and industrial-grade integration into routine workflow. Radiology has the chance to leverage AI to become a center of intelligently aggregated, quantitative, diagnostic information. Centaur radiologists, formed as a synergy of human plus computer, will provide interpretations using data extracted from images by humans and image-analysis computer algorithms, as well as the electronic health record, genomics, and other disparate sources. These interpretations will form the foundation of precision health care, or care customized to an individual patient.

In this context, the integration of the versatile diagnostic information, e.g., from anamnesis, imaging, histopathology, and clinical chemistry, and its comprehensive analysis by artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools is expected to improve diagnostic precision and the therapeutic conduct. However, the complex medical environment poses a major obstacle to the translation of integrated diagnostics into clinical research and routine. There is a high need to address aspects like data privacy, data integration, interoperability standards, appropriate IT infrastructure, and education of staff. Besides this, a plethora of technical, political, and ethical challenges exists. This is complicated by the high diversity of approaches across Europe. Thus, we here provide insights into current international activities on the way to digital comprehensive diagnostics. This includes a technical view on challenges and solutions for comprehensive diagnostics in terms of data integration and analysis. Current data communications standards and common IT solutions that are in place in hospitals are reported. Furthermore, the international hospital digitalization scoring and the European funding situation were analyzed. In addition, the regional activities in radiomics and the related publication trends are discussed.

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention,"We present a deep learning tractography segmentation method that allows fast and consistent white matter fiber tract identification across healthy and disease populations and across multiple diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisitions. We create a large-scale training tractography dataset of 1 million labeled fiber samples (54 anatomical tracts are included). To discriminate between fibers from different tracts, we propose a novel 2D multi-channel feature descriptor (FiberMap) that encodes spatial coordinates of points along each fiber. We learn a CNN tract classification model based on FiberMap and obtain a high tract classification accuracy of 90.99%. The method is evaluated on a test dataset of 374 dMRI scans from three independently acquired populations across health conditions (healthy control, neuropsychiatric disorders, and brain tumor patients). We perform comparisons with two state-of-the-art white matter tract segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our method obtains a highly consistent segmentation result, where over 99% of the fiber tracts are successfully detected across all subjects under study, most importantly, including patients with space occupying brain tumors.

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance.

However, the efficacy of traditional computational models in radiology is a matter of debate. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of a combined machine and deep learning approach for early breast cancer detection applied to a linked set of digital mammography images and electronic health records. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 52 936 images were collected in 13 234 women who underwent at least one mammogram between 2013 and 2017, and who had health records for at least 1 year before undergoing mammography. The algorithm was trained on 9611 mammograms and health records of women to make two breast cancer predictions: to predict biopsy malignancy and to differentiate normal from abnormal screening examinations. The study estimated the association of features with outcomes by using t test and Fisher exact test. The model comparisons were performed with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or by using the DeLong test. Results The resulting algorithm was validated in 1055 women and tested in 2548 women (mean age, 55 years <c2><b1> 10 [standard deviation]). In the test set, the algorithm identified 34 of 71 (48%) false-negative findings on mammograms. For the malignancy prediction objective, the algorithm obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.93), with specificity of 77.3% (95% CI: 69.2%, 85.4%) at a sensitivity of 87%. When trained on clinical data alone, the model performed significantly better than the Gail model (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.54, respectively; P < .004).

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to use machine learning to more accurately predict survival after echocardiography. BACKGROUND: Predicting patient outcomes (e.g., survival) following echocardiography is primarily based on ejection fraction (EF) and comorbidities. However, there may be significant predictive information within additional echocardiography-derived measurements combined with clinical electronic health record data. METHODS: Mortality was studied in 171,510 unselected patients who underwent 331,317 echocardiograms in a large regional health system. The authors investigated the predictive performance of nonlinear machine learning models compared with that of linear logistic regression models using 3 different inputs: 1) clinical variables, including 90 cardiovascular-relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes, and age, sex, height, weight, heart rate, blood pressures, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and smoking; 2) clinical variables plus physician-reported EF; and 3) clinical variables and EF, plus 57 additional echocardiographic measurements. Missing data were imputed with a multivariate imputation by using a chained equations algorithm (MICE). The authors compared models versus each other and baseline clinical scoring systems by using a mean area under the curve (AUC) over 10 cross-validation folds and across 10 survival durations (6 to 60 months). RESULTS: Machine learning models achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy (all AUC >0.82) over common clinical risk scores (AUC = 0.61 to 0.79), with the nonlinear random forest models outperforming logistic regression (p < 0.01). The random forest model including all echocardiographic measurements yielded the highest prediction accuracy (p < 0.01 across all models and survival durations). Only 10 variables were needed to achieve 96% of the maximum prediction accuracy, with 6 of these variables being derived from echocardiography. Tricuspid regurgitation velocity was more predictive of survival than LVEF. In a subset of studies with complete data for the top 10 variables, multivariate imputation by chained equations yielded slightly reduced predictive accuracies (difference in AUC of 0.003) compared with the original data. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning can fully utilize large combinations of disparate input variables to predict survival after echocardiography with superior accuracy.",2019,10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.04.026,12,4,681-689,eng,1876-7591 1936-878X,"machine learning and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Time Factors and electronic health records and Risk Factors and Prognosis and Reproducibility of Results and Predictive Value of Tests and *Databases, Factual and mortality and *Electronic Health Records and *Machine Learning and Data Mining/*methods and echocardiography and *Echocardiography and Heart Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/mortality",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention,"The performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy is fundamentally constrained by fetal motion. Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10-30 minutes). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4% accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.",2019,10.1007/978-3-030-32251-9_44,11767,NA,403-410,eng,NA,Deep learning and Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Pose estimation,NA,NA,2019/10//undefined,Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv,NA,NA,NA,NA

C. and Moors, Ellen H. M.",European radiology,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in clinical radiology in The Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an embedded multiple case study, an exploratory, qualitative research design was followed. Data collection consisted of 24 semi-structured interviews from seven Dutch hospitals. The analysis of barriers and facilitators was guided by the recently published Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework for new medical technologies in healthcare organizations. RESULTS: Among the most important facilitating factors for implementation were the following: (i) pressure for cost containment in the Dutch healthcare system, (ii) high expectations of AI's potential added value, (iii) presence of hospital-wide innovation strategies, and (iv) presence of a ""local champion.""

Cheng_2019_Euroradi,JOUR,Application of a deep learning algorithm for detection and visualization of hip fractures on plain pelvic radiographs,"Cheng, Chi-Tung and Ho, Tsung-Ying and Lee, Tao-Yi and Chang, Chih-Chen and Chou, Ching-Cheng and Chen, Chih-Chi and Chung, I.-Fang and Liao, Chien-Hung",European radiology,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the feasibility of using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for the detection and localization of hip fractures on plain frontal pelvic radiographs (PXRs). Hip fracture is a leading worldwide health problem for the elderly. A missed diagnosis of hip fracture on radiography leads to a dismal prognosis. The application of a DCNN to PXRs can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of hip fracture diagnosis. METHODS: A DCNN was pretrained using 25,505 limb radiographs between January 2012 and December 2017. It was retrained using 3605 PXRs between August 2008 and December 2016. The accuracy, sensitivity, false-negative rate, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated on 100 independent PXRs acquired during 2017. The authors also used the visualization algorithm gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to confirm the validity of the model. RESULTS: The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 91%, a sensitivity of 98%, a false-negative rate of 2%, and an AUC of 0.98 for identifying hip fractures. The visualization algorithm showed an accuracy of 95.9% for lesion identification. CONCLUSIONS: A DCNN not only detected hip fractures on PXRs with a low false-negative rate but also had high accuracy for localizing fracture lesions.

A practical approach to assist with the clinical assessment and treatment planning for patients is to process magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to identify epileptogenic zones. As a widely accepted biomarker of epileptic foci, epileptic MEG spikes need to be precisely detected. Given that the visual inspection of spikes is time consuming, an automatic and efficient system with adequate accuracy for spike detection is valuable in clinical practice. However, current approaches for MEG spike autodetection are dependent on hand-engineered features. Here, we propose a novel multiview Epileptic MEG Spikes detection algorithm based on a deep learning Network (EMS-Net) to accurately and efficiently recognize the spike events from MEG raw data.

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of an automated algorithm that simultaneously quantifies 3-dimensional (3D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Conventional manual 3D TTE tracings and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images were used as a reference for comparison. BACKGROUND: Cardiac chamber quantification from 3D TTE is superior to 2D TTE measurements. However, integration of 3D quantification into clinical practice has been limited by time-consuming workflow and the need for 3D expertise. A novel automated software was developed that provides LV and LA volumetric quantification from 3D TTE datasets that reflect real-life manual 3-dimensional echocardiography measurements and values comparable to CMR. METHODS: A total of 159 patients were studied in 2 separate protocols. In protocol 1, 94 patients underwent 3D TTE imaging (EPIQ, iE33, X5-1, Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) covering the left atrium and left ventricle. LA and LV volumes and LVEF were obtained using the automated software (HeartModel, Philips Healthcare) with and without contour correction, and compared with the averaged manual 3D volumetric measurements from 3 readers. In protocol 2, automated measurements from 65 patients were compared with a CMR reference. The Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, and paired Student t tests were used to assess inter-technique agreement. RESULTS: Correlations between the automated and manual 3D TTE measurements were strong (r = 0.87 to 0.96). LVEF was underestimated and automated LV end-diastolic, LV end-systolic, and LA volumes were overestimated compared with manual measurements. Agreement between the automated analysis and CMR was also strong (r = 0.84 to 0.95). Test-retest variability was low. CONCLUSIONS: Automated simultaneous quantification of LA and LV volumes and LVEF is feasible and requires minimal 3D software analysis training. The automated measurements are not only comparable to manual measurements but also to CMR. This technique is highly reproducible and timesaving, and it therefore promises to facilitate the integration of 3D TTE-based left-heart chamber quantification into clinical practice.",2016,10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.12.020,9,7,769-782,eng,1876-7591,"automation and Automation and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Feasibility Studies and Reproducibility of Results and Predictive Value of Tests and *Algorithms and Observer Variation and Workflow and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ventricular Function, Left and Stroke Volume and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and 3-dimensional echocardiography and Atrial Function, Left and cardiac chamber quantification and Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional/*methods and Heart Atria/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and Heart Ventricles/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and Myocardial Ischemia/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology",NA,NA,2016/07//undefined,JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the added predictive value of combining clinical information and myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging (MPI) data using machine learning (ML) to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE). BACKGROUND: Traditionally, prognostication by MPI has relied on visual or quantitative analysis of images without objective consideration of the clinical data. ML permits a large number of variables to be considered in combination and at a level of complexity beyond the human clinical reader. METHODS: A total of 2,619 consecutive patients (48% men; 62 <c2><b1> 13 years of age) who underwent exercise (38%) or pharmacological stress (62%) with high-speed SPECT MPI were monitored for MACE. Twenty-eight clinical variables, 17 stress test variables, and 25 imaging variables (including total perfusion deficit [TPD]) were recorded. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for MACE prediction were compared among: 1) ML with all available data (ML-combined); 2) ML with only imaging data (ML-imaging); 3) 5-point scale visual diagnosis (physician [MD] diagnosis); and 4) automated quantitative imaging analysis (stress TPD and ischemic TPD). ML involved automated variable selection by information gain ranking, model building with a boosted ensemble algorithm, and 10-fold stratified cross validation. RESULTS: During follow-up (3.2 <c2><b1> 0.6 years), 239 patients (9.1%) had MACE. MACE prediction was significantly higher for ML-combined than ML-imaging (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.78; p < 0.01). ML-combined also had higher predictive accuracy compared with MD diagnosis, automated stress TPD, and automated ischemic TPD (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.65 vs. 0.73 vs. 0.71, respectively; p < 0.01 for all). Risk reclassification for ML-combined compared with visual MD diagnosis was 26% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ML combined with both clinical and imaging data variables was found to have high predictive accuracy for 3-year risk of MACE and was superior to existing visual or automated perfusion assessments.

Cardiovascular imaging,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with gated single-photon emission tomography provides important information on the extent and severity of myocardial perfusion abnormalities, including myocardial ischemia. The availability of software for automated quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion in an objective and more reproducible manner than visual assessment has allowed MPI to be particularly effective in serial evaluation. Serial testing using MPI is widely used in guiding patient care despite the lack of well-defined appropriateness use criteria. This should not be surprising because ischemic heart disease is a life-long malady subject to dynamic changes throughout its natural course and particularly following man-made interventions that may improve or worsen the disease process, such as medical therapy and coronary revascularization. Serial MPI has filled an important clinical gap by providing crucial information for managing patients with changes in clinical presentations or in anticipation of such changes in patients with stable symptoms. In the research arena, serial MPI has been widely applied in randomized controlled trials to study the impact of various medical and interventional therapies on myocardial perfusion, as well as the relative merits of new imaging procedures (hardware and/or software), radiotracers, and stressor agents. Serial testing, however, unlike initial or 1-time testing, has more stringent requirements and is subject to variability because of technical, procedural, interpretational, and biological factors. The intrinsic variability of MPI becomes important in interpreting serial tests in order to define a true change in a given patient and to guide clinical decision making.

An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs might be useful for triage or infection control within a hospital setting, but prior reports have been limited by small data sets, poor data quality, or both. Purpose To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs, that was trained and tested on a large clinical data set. Materials and Methods DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test results as the reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14 788 images (4253 positive for COVID-19) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System from February 2020 to April 2020 and was then tested on 2214 images (1192 positive for COVID-19) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from five experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity and the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 5853 patients (mean age, 58 years <c2><b1> 19 [standard deviation]; 3101 women) were evaluated across data sets. For the entire test set, accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 83%, with an AUC of 0.90. For 300 random test images (134 positive for COVID-19), accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 82%, compared with that of individual radiologists (range, 76%-81%) and the consensus of all five radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than one radiologist (60%, P < .001) and significantly higher specificity (92%) than two radiologists (75%, P < .001; 84%, P = .009). AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.88 compared with the consensus AUC of 0.85 (P = .13 for comparison). With consensus interpretation as the reference standard, the AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98).

The reduction of the CT radiation dose, however, compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, which affects image quality and diagnostic performance. Recently, deep-learning-based algorithms have achieved promising results in LDCT denoising, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures. This paper introduces a conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder (CPCE) network in 2-D and 3-D configurations within the GAN framework for LDCT denoising. A novel feature of this approach is that an initial 3-D CPCE denoising model can be directly obtained by extending a trained 2-D CNN, which is then fine-tuned to incorporate 3-D spatial information from adjacent slices. Based on the transfer learning from 2-D to 3-D, the 3-D network converges faster and achieves a better denoising performance when compared with a training from scratch. By comparing the CPCE network with recently published work based on the simulated Mayo data set and the real MGH data set, we demonstrate that the 3-D CPCE denoising model has a better performance in that it suppresses image noise and preserves subtle structures.",2018,10.1109/TMI.2018.2832217,37,6,1522-1534,eng,1558-254X 0278-0062,"Humans and Algorithms and *Deep Learning and Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods and Phantoms, Imaging and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods",NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA

Joseph",Radiology,"Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) by means of a pressure wire technique is the established reference standard for the functional assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1 , 2 ). Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography has emerged as a noninvasive method for direct assessment of CAD and plaque characterization with high diagnostic accuracy compared with ICA ( 3 , 4 ). However, the solely anatomic assessment provided with both coronary CT angiography and ICA has poor discriminatory power for ischemia-inducing lesions. FFR derived from standard coronary CT angiography (FFR(CT)) data sets by using any of several advanced computational analytic approaches enables combined anatomic and hemodynamic assessment of a coronary lesion by a single noninvasive test. Current technical approaches to the calculation of FFR(CT) include algorithms based on full- and reduced-order computational fluid dynamic modeling, as well as artificial intelligence deep machine learning ( 5 , 6 ). A growing body of evidence has validated the diagnostic accuracy of FFR(CT) techniques compared with invasive FFR. Improved therapeutic guidance has been demonstrated, showing the potential of FFR(CT) to streamline and rationalize the care of patients suspected of having CAD and improve outcomes while reducing overall health care costs ( 7 , 8 ).

H. and Staab, W. and Kleinert, R. and Maintz, D. and Baessler, B.",European radiology,"OBJECTIVES: To assess undergraduate medical students' attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology and medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed using SurveyMonkey, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students' prior knowledge of AI in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards AI in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents' anonymity was ensured. RESULTS: A total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52% were aware of the ongoing discussion about AI in radiology and 68% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83%) but felt that AI would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56%). The majority agreed that AI will revolutionise and improve radiology (77% and 86%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for AI to be included in medical training (71%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of AI and less fearful of these technologies.

METHODS: Three thousand one hundred ninety-nine CT chest examinations were used for training and testing of the feed-forward, single hidden layer neural network (January 2016-December 2017, 60% male, 62 <c2><b1> 15 years, 80/20 split). The model was optimized and trained to predict the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDI(vol)) based on scan patient metrics (scanner, study description, protocol, patient age, sex, and water-equivalent diameter (D(W))). The root mean-squared error (RMSE) was calculated as performance measurement. One hundred separate, consecutive chest CTs were used for validation (January 2018, 60% male, 63 <c2><b1> 16 years), independently reviewed by two blinded radiologists with regard to dose optimization, and used to define an optimal cutoff for the model. RESULTS: RMSE was 1.71, 1.45, and 1.52 for the training, test, and validation dataset, respectively. The scanner and D(W) were the most important features. The radiologists found dose optimization potential in 7/100 of the validation cases. A percentage deviation of 18.3% between predicted and actual CTDI(vol) was found to be the optimal cutoff: 8/100 cases were flagged as suboptimal by the model (range 18.3-53.2%). All of the cases found by the radiologists were identified. One examination was flagged only by the model. CONCLUSIONS: ML can comprehensively detect CT examinations with dose optimization potential. It may be a helpful tool to simplify CT quality assurance. CT scanner and D(W) were most important. Final human review remains necessary. A threshold of 18.3% between the predicted and actual CTDI(vol) seems adequate for CT quality assurance. KEY POINTS: <e2><80><a2> Machine learning can be integrated into CT quality assurance to improve retrospective analysis of CT dose data. <e2><80><a2> Machine learning may help to comprehensively detect dose optimization potential in chest CT, but an individual review of the results by an experienced radiologist or radiation physicist is required to exclude false-positive findings.",2019,10.1007/s00330-019-6013-6,29,7,3705-3713,eng,1432-1084 0938-7994,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Radiation Dosage and *Quality Assurance, Health Care and Thorax and *Machine Learning and Radiography, Thoracic/*standards and Multidetector computed tomography and Multidetector Computed Tomography/*standards and Quality assurance, health care and Radiation dosage and Radiation Injuries/*prevention & control and Thoracic Diseases/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,Eur Radiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention,"Detection and segmentation of ovarian cancer metastases have great clinical impacts on women's health. However, the random distribution and weak boundaries of metastases significantly complicate this task. This paper presents a variational framework that combines region competition based level set propagation and image matching flow computation to jointly detect and segment metastases. Image matching flow not only detects metastases, but also creates shape priors to reduce over-segmentation. Accordingly, accurate segmentation helps to improve the detection accuracy by separating flow computation in metastasis and non-metastasis regions. Since all components in the image processing pipeline benefit from each other, our joint framework can achieve accurate metastasis detection and segmentation. Validation on 50 patient datasets demonstrated that our joint approach was superior to a sequential method with sensitivity 89.2% vs. 81.4% (Fisher exact test p = 0.046) and false positive per patient 1.04 vs. 2.04. The Dice coefficient of metastasis segmentation was 92 +/- 5.2% vs. 72 +/- 8% (paired t-test p = 0.022), and the average surface distance was 1.9 +/- 1.5mm vs. 4.5 +/- 2.2mm (paired t-test p = 0.004).",2013,10.1007/978-3-642-40763-5_11,16,Pt 2,83-90,eng,NA,"Humans and Female and Sensitivity and Specificity and Reproducibility of Results and *Algorithms and *Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Image Enhancement/methods and Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology/*secondary",NA,NA,2013///,Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seventy six medical students without specific domain knowledge who voluntarily participated in three experiments solved two relevant annotation tasks on histopathological images: 1) labeling of images showing tissue regions and 2) delineation of morphologically defined image objects. We focus on methods to ensure sufficient annotation quality including several tests on the required number of participants and on the correlation of participants' performance between tasks. In a set up simulating annotation of images with limited ground truth, we validated the feasibility of a confidence score using full ground truth.

The aim of this article is to develop and validate a standardized patient questionnaire on the implementation of AI in radiology. METHODS: Six domains derived from a previous qualitative study were used to develop a questionnaire, and cognitive interviews were used as pretest method. One hundred fifty-five patients scheduled for CT, MRI, and/or conventional radiography filled out the questionnaire. To find underlying latent variables, we used exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring and oblique promax rotation. Internal consistency of the factors was measured with Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors on AI in radiology: (1) distrust and accountability (overall, patients were moderately negative on this subject), (2) procedural knowledge (patients generally indicated the need for their active engagement), (3) personal interaction (overall, patients preferred personal interaction), (4) efficiency (overall, patients were ambiguous on this subject), and (5) being informed (overall, scores on these items were not outspoken within this factor). Internal consistency was good for three factors (1, 2, and 3), and acceptable for two (4 and 5). CONCLUSIONS: This study yielded a viable questionnaire to measure acceptance among patients of the implementation of AI in radiology.

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both standard FTR and SR of 26 patients with VFSS were acquired. A dedicated template focusing on oropharyngeal phases was created for SR using online software with clickable decision-trees and concomitant generation of semantically structured reports. All reports were evaluated regarding overall quality and content, information extraction and clinical decision support (10-point Likert scale (0 = I completely disagree, 10 = I completely agree)). RESULTS: Two otorhinolaryngologists and two speech therapists evaluated FTR and SR. SR received better ratings than FTR in all items. SR were perceived to contain more details on the swallowing phases (median rating: 10 vs. 5; P < 0.001), penetration and aspiration (10 vs. 5; P < 0.001) and facilitated information extraction compared to FTR (10 vs. 4; P < 0.001). Overall quality was rated significantly higher in SR than FTR (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: SR of VFSS provide more detailed information and facilitate information extraction.

Materials and Methods In this study, 96 303 head computed tomography (CT) reports were obtained. The linguistic complexity of these reports was compared with that of alternative corpora. Head CT reports were preprocessed, and machine-analyzable features were constructed by using bag-of-words (BOW), word embedding, and Latent Dirichlet allocation-based approaches. Ultimately, 1004 head CT reports were manually labeled for findings of interest by physicians, and a subset of these were deemed critical findings. Lasso logistic regression was used to train models for physician-assigned labels on 602 of 1004 head CT reports (60%) using the constructed features, and the performance of these models was validated on a held-out 402 of 1004 reports (40%). Models were scored by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and aggregate AUC statistics were reported for (a) all labels, (b) critical labels, and (c) the presence of any critical finding in a report. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were reported for the best performing model's (a) predictions of all labels and (b) identification of reports containing critical findings. Results The best-performing model (BOW with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams plus average word embeddings vector) had a held-out AUC of 0.966 for identifying the presence of any critical head CT finding and an average 0.957 AUC across all head CT findings. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying the presence of any critical finding were 92.59% (175 of 189) and 89.67% (191 of 213), respectively. Average sensitivity and specificity across all findings were 90.25% (1898 of 2103) and 91.72% (18 351 of 20 007), respectively. Simpler BOW methods achieved results competitive with those of more sophisticated approaches, with an average AUC for presence of any critical finding of 0.951 for unigram BOW versus 0.966 for the best-performing model. The Yule I of the head CT corpus was 34, markedly lower than that of the Reuters corpus (at 103) or I2B2 discharge summaries (at 271), indicating lower linguistic complexity. Conclusion Automated methods can be used to identify findings in radiology reports. The success of this approach benefits from the standardized language of these reports.

Purpose To validate a commercially available deep learning algorithm for lung cancer detection on chest radiographs in a health screening population. Materials and Methods Out-of-sample testing of a deep learning algorithm was retrospectively performed using chest radiographs from individuals undergoing a comprehensive medical check-up between July 2008 and December 2008 (validation test). To evaluate the algorithm performance for visible lung cancer detection, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and diagnostic measures, including sensitivity and false-positive rate (FPR), were calculated. The algorithm performance was compared with that of radiologists using the McNemar test and the Moskowitz method. Additionally, the deep learning algorithm was applied to a screening cohort undergoing chest radiography between January 2008 and December 2012, and its performances were calculated. Results In a validation test comprising 10 285 radiographs from 10 202 individuals (mean age, 54 years <c2><b1> 11 [standard deviation]; 5857 men) with 10 radiographs of visible lung cancers, the algorithm's AUC was 0.99 (95% confidence interval: 0.97, 1), and it showed comparable sensitivity (90% [nine of 10 radiographs]) to that of the radiologists (60% [six of 10 radiographs]; P = .25) with a higher FPR (3.1% [319 of 10 275 radiographs] vs 0.3% [26 of 10 275 radiographs]; P < .001). In the screening cohort of 100 525 chest radiographs from 50 070 individuals (mean age, 53 years <c2><b1> 11; 28 090 men) with 47 radiographs of visible lung cancers, the algorithm's AUC was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 0.99), and its sensitivity and FPR were 83% (39 of 47 radiographs) and 3% (2999 of 100 478 radiographs), respectively.

To treat the underlying plaque deposits in the arterial walls, intravascular optical coherence tomography can be used by experts to detect and characterize the lesions. In clinical routine, hundreds of images are acquired for each patient, which require automatic plaque detection for fast and accurate decision support. So far, automatic approaches rely on classic machine learning methods and deep learning solutions have rarely been studied. Given the success of deep learning methods with other imaging modalities, a thorough understanding of deep learning-based plaque detection for future clinical decision support systems is required. We address this issue with a new data set consisting of in vivo patient images labeled by three trained experts. Using this data set, we employ the state-of-the-art deep learning models that directly learn plaque classification from the images. For improved performance, we study different transfer learning approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the use of Cartesian and polar image representations and employ data augmentation techniques tailored to each representation. We fuse both representations in a multi-path architecture for more effective feature exploitation. Last, we address the challenge of plaque differentiation in addition to detection. Overall, we find that our combined model performs best with an accuracy of 91.7%, a sensitivity of 90.9%, and a specificity of 92.4%.

Cardiovascular imaging,"Cardiovascular (CV) imaging plays a critical role in therapeutic decision making and is performed in more than 10 million patients each year; a large share of the nearly 40 million patients living with CV disease. CV imaging may serve as a valuable component of a patient's evaluation, provided that its enhanced diagnostic findings invoke appropriate and targeted therapies that improve symptom burden and long-term outcomes and are not offset by the upfront procedural and induced costs of care. As well, the overall clinical benefit that imaging imparts to the patient must significantly outweigh any untoward risk, including radiation or procedural complications. Explosive growth in imaging has resulted in a rapid escalation of costs for testing encumbering an estimated $80 billion dollars annually and represents a sizeable portion of cardiologists' income. Concern remains that continued expansion of CV imaging services may further add to the complexity of health care services and magnify the societal burden of health care. The field of CV imaging is beset by high procedural use, high growth rates, and often, a lack of demonstrable quality. The end result of our current health care system and reimbursement models is an over emphasis on volume and throughput, extensive efforts necessary for justification of procedural use, and a broad referral population exceeding guideline-accepted best practices. An inextricable link between imaging markers and outcomes forms a critical nexus that can be used to establish the value of a test, and is now the standard upon which technology will be evaluated by private payers and governmental agencies alike. This new benchmark necessitates high-quality research to compare the effectiveness of CV imaging modalities to elicit improvements in health outcomes; representing a dramatic paradigm shift for the field of CV imaging research.

Firstly, we define an anatomical region by atlas-based registration and extract vessel structures using a deep convolutional neural network. From this, high-level features based on the ratios of vessel length and volume of the occluded and the contralateral side are defined. Multi-class classification models are used to map the feature space to a four-grade collateral score and a quantitative score. The dataset used for training, validation and testing is from a registry of images acquired in clinical routine at multiple medical centers. The model performance is tested on 269 subjects, achieving an accuracy of 0.8. The dichotomized collateral score accuracy is 0.9.

To minimize the potential health risk caused by the tracer radiation inherent to PET scans, it is of great interest to synthesize the high-quality PET image from the low-dose one to reduce the radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a 3D auto-context-based locality adaptive multi-modality generative adversarial networks model (LA-GANs) to synthesize the high-quality FDG PET image from the low-dose one with the accompanying MRI images that provide anatomical information. Our work has four contributions. First, different from the traditional methods that treat each image modality as an input channel and apply the same kernel to convolve the whole image, we argue that the contributions of different modalities could vary at different image locations, and therefore a unified kernel for a whole image is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a locality adaptive strategy for multi-modality fusion. Second, we utilize 1 *1 *1 kernel to learn this locality adaptive fusion so that the number of additional parameters incurred by our method is kept minimum. Third, the proposed locality adaptive fusion mechanism is learned jointly with the PET image synthesis in a 3D conditional GANs model, which generates high-quality PET images by employing large-sized image patches and hierarchical features. Fourth, we apply the auto-context strategy to our scheme and propose an auto-context LA-GANs model to further refine the quality of synthesized images.

MTBI is a growing public health problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in USA. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete measures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of the previous works, which use hand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more discriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field thus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training. This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to directly classify a subject from MRIs. To overcome this challenge, we first apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn patch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different brain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-words approach. We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects (including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex-matched healthy controls) and compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches.

The recommended formula for echocardiographic estimation of LVM uses linear measurements and is based on the assumption of the left ventricle (LV) as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. CMR permits a modeling of the LV free of cardiac geometric assumptions or acoustic window dependency, showing better accuracy and reproducibility. However, echocardiography has lower cost, easier availability, and better tolerability. From the MEDLINE database, 26 longitudinal echocardiographic studies and 5 CMR studies investigating LVM or LV hypertrophy as predictors of death or major cardiovascular outcomes were identified. LVM and LV hypertrophy were reliable cardiovascular risk predictors using both modalities. However, no study directly compared the methods for the ability to predict events, agreement in hypertrophy classification, or performance in cardiovascular risk reclassification. Indexing LVM to body surface area was the earliest normalization process used, but it seems to underestimate the prevalence of hypertrophy in obese and overweight subjects. Dividing LVM by height to the allometric power of 1.7 or 2.7 is the most promising normalization method in terms of practicality and usefulness from a clinical and scientific standpoint for scaling myocardial mass to body size. The measurement of LVM, calculation of LVM index, and classification for LV hypertrophy should be standardized by scientific societies across measurement techniques and adopted by clinicians in risk stratification and therapeutic decision making.",2012,10.1016/j.jcmg.2012.06.003,5,8,837-848,eng,1876-7591 1936-878X,"Humans and Risk Assessment and Ultrasonography and Imaging, Three-Dimensional and *Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine and Chagas Cardiomyopathy/pathology and Heart Ventricles/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology and Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA

Enzmann_2012_Radi,JOUR,Radiology's value chain,"Enzmann, Dieter R.",Radiology,"A diagnostic radiology value chain is constructed to define its main components, all of which are vulnerable to change, because digitization has caused disaggregation of the chain. Some components afford opportunities to improve productivity, some add value, while some face outsourcing to lower labor cost and to information technology substitutes, raising commoditization risks. Digital image information, because it can be competitive at smaller economies of scale, allows faster, differential rates of technological innovation of components, initiating a centralization-to-decentralization technology trend. Digitization, having triggered disaggregation of radiology's professional service model, may soon usher in an information business model. This means moving from a mind-set of ""reading images"" to an orientation of creating and organizing information for greater accuracy, faster speed, and lower cost in medical decision making. Information businesses view value chain investments differently than do small professional services. In the former model, producing a better business product will extend image interpretation beyond a radiologist's personal fund of knowledge to encompass expanding external imaging databases. A follow-on expansion with integration of image and molecular information into a report will offer new value in medical decision making. Improved interpretation plus new integration will enrich and diversify radiology's key service products, the report and consultation. A more robust, information-rich report derived from a ""systems"" and ""computational"" radiology approach will be facilitated by a transition from a professional service to an information business. Under health care reform, radiology will transition its emphasis from volume to greater value.

Diagnosis, treatment, and care of pressure ulcers are costly for health services. Accurate wound evaluation is a critical task for optimizing the efficacy of treatment and care. Clinicians usually evaluate each pressure ulcer by visual inspection of the damaged tissues, which is an imprecise manner of assessing the wound state. Current computer vision approaches do not offer a global solution to this particular problem. In this paper, a hybrid approach based on neural networks and Bayesian classifiers is used in the design of a computational system for automatic tissue identification in wound images. A mean shift procedure and a region-growing strategy are implemented for effective region segmentation. Color and texture features are extracted from these segmented regions. A set of k multilayer perceptrons is trained with inputs consisting of color and texture patterns, and outputs consisting of categorical tissue classes which are determined by clinical experts. This training procedure is driven by a k-fold cross-validation method. Finally, a Bayesian committee machine is formed by training a Bayesian classifier to combine the classifications of the k neural networks. Specific heuristics based on the wound topology are designed to significantly improve the results of the classification. We obtain high efficiency rates from a binary cascade approach for tissue identification. Results are compared with other similar machine-learning approaches, including multiclass Bayesian committee machine classifiers and support vector machines.

Radiomics is an emerging technique for noninvasive diagnosis based on quantitative medical image analyses. However, current radiomics techniques are not standardized regarding feature extraction, feature selection, and decision making. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation-based radiomics (SRR) system for the diagnosis of brain tumors. First, we developed a dictionary learning- and sparse representation-based feature extraction method that exploits the statistical characteristics of the lesion area, leading to fine and more effective feature extraction compared with the traditional explicitly calculation-based methods. Then, we set up an iterative sparse representation method to solve the redundancy problem of the extracted features. Finally, we proposed a novel multi-feature collaborative sparse representation classification framework that introduces a new coefficient of regularization term to combine features from multi-modal images at the sparse representation coefficient level. Two clinical problems were used to validate the performance and usefulness of the proposed SRR system.

At that point, clinical data should be treated as a form of public good, to be used for the benefit of future patients. In their 2013 article, Faden et al argued that all who participate in the health care system, including patients, have a moral obligation to contribute to improving that system. The authors extend that framework to questions surrounding the secondary use of clinical data for AI applications. Specifically, the authors propose that all individuals and entities with access to clinical data become data stewards, with fiduciary (or trust) responsibilities to patients to carefully safeguard patient privacy, and to the public to ensure that the data are made widely available for the development of knowledge and tools to benefit future patients. According to this framework, the authors maintain that it is unethical for providers to ""sell"" clinical data to other parties by granting access to clinical data, especially under exclusive arrangements, in exchange for monetary or in-kind payments that exceed costs. The authors also propose that patient consent is not required before the data are used for secondary purposes when obtaining such consent is prohibitively costly or burdensome, as long as mechanisms are in place to ensure that ethical standards are strictly followed.

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to define the relationship between functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and to establish the prognostic value of quantitative measures of TR severity (i.e., effective regurgitant orifice area [EROA] and regurgitant volume). BACKGROUND: The significance of TR in chronic heart failure is controversial. Earlier studies have shown an independent impact of TR on mortality, whereas more recent evidence suggests myocardial impairment to be the driving force of mortality rather than TR itself. Earlier studies have used qualitative measures of TR severity, hence the prognostic value of more quantitative measures of TR severity (i.e., EROA and regurgitant volumes) remains unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 382 patients with HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and assessed TR EROA and regurgitant volume by Doppler/2-dimensional echocardiography. All-cause mortality was defined as the primary study endpoint. RESULTS: TR severity was associated with the HFrEF phenotype with more symptoms (p = 0.004), higher neurohumoral activation (p < 0.001), progressive right-ventricular dilatation (p < 0.001), and impaired function (p < 0.001). Cox regression showed a strong association between quantitative measures of TR with mortality (all p < 0.001). Quantitative metrics of TR severity were consistently associated with mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.009 (95% confidence interval: 1.004 to 1.013; p < 0.001) per 0.01 cm(2) increase of the EROA and of 1.013 (95% confidence interval: 1.007 to 1.020; p < 0.001) per 1-ml increase in regurgitant volume. Results remained unchanged after bootstrap- or clinical confounder-based adjustment. A spline curve pattern illustrates the association with mortality with thresholds for the EROA <e2><89><a5>0.2 cm(2), and the regurgitant volume <e2><89><a5>20 ml with sustained excess mortality thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale outcome study demonstrates the prognostic value of quantitative Doppler-echocardiographic measures of TR severity in HFrEF. The thresholds for EROA and TR regurgitant volume associated with mortality in our study fall within current ranges defining nonsevere TR.

METHODS: One thousand one hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with stable chest pain who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) followed ICA within 90 days between January 2007 and December 2016 were included in this retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed for the endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). FFR(CT) values were calculated using an artificial intelligence (AI) ML platform. Disagreements between hemodynamic significant stenosis via FFR(CT) and severe stenosis on qualitative CCTA and ICA were also evaluated. RESULTS: After FFR(CT) results were revealed, a change in the proposed treatment regimen chosen based on ICA results was seen in 167 patients (14.9%). Over a median follow-up time of 26 months (4-48 months), FFR(CT) <e2><89><a4> 0.80 was associated with MACE (HR, 6.84 (95% CI, 3.57 to 13.11); p < 0.001), with superior prognostic value compared to severe stenosis on ICA (HR, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.73), p = 0.002) and CCTA (HR, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.14, p = 0.045). Reserving ICA and revascularization for vessels with positive FFR(CT) could have reduced the rate of ICA by 54.5% and lead to 4.4% fewer percutaneous interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated ML-based FFR(CT) had superior prognostic value when compared to severe anatomic stenosis on CCTA and adding FFR(CT) may direct therapeutic decision-making with the potential to improve efficiency of ICA.

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess associations between left ventricular (LV) mass, all-cause mortality, and need for revascularization in patients undergoing coronary angiography. BACKGROUND: LV hypertrophy is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in healthy subjects. However, its influence in those with known or suspected coronary artery disease is poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 3,754 patients (mean age 59.3 <c2><b1> 13.1 years) undergoing invasive coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (mean interval 1.0 <c2><b1> 1.5 months) were studied. LV mass and volumes were determined from cine images and indexed to body surface area. Analyses were adjusted for CMR variables, medical comorbidities, and severity of coronary artery disease (Duke Jeopardy Score) and were stratified to LV function. RESULTS: At a median of 44.9 months, 315 patients (8.4%) died and 168 patients (4.5%) underwent revascularization. Multivariable analysis showed that each 10 g/m(2) increase in LV mass index was associated with a 6% greater risk of mortality (hazard ratio: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.11; p = 0.02) and a 10% greater need for revascularization (hazard ratio: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17; p < 0.01). According to pre-defined thresholds, moderate to severe hypertrophy was associated with a 1.7-fold risk of mortality (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.3) and 1.8-fold need for revascularization (95% CI: 1.18 to 2.67). These findings were predominantly observed in those with a left ventricular ejection fraction >35% with respective hazard ratios of 2.93 (95% CI: 1.92 to 4.47) and 2.20 (95% CI: 1.21 to 3.98).

The aim of this study was to understand clinicians' perspectives and experiences of interpretation of outsourced reports in clinical practice, if the author of imaging reports matters to clinicians, and actions taken to deal with perceived errors. METHODS: A printed survey was distributed to a purposive sample of 50 of the 250 senior medical and surgical staff of a large National Health Service hospital in the UK who regularly engaged with the Radiology Department between May and October 2017, representing 20% of this hospital workforce. The survey consisted of ten questions examining clinicians' opinions on radiology reporting, with comment options to encourage respondents to give further detail. Participants were requested to return the survey to the study investigators. RESULTS: The survey elicited a 100% response rate (n = 50). A constant comparative framework was used to guide analysis, revealing themes relevant to the ongoing inter-professional relationship between clinicians and radiologists. The disparity between in-house and externally sourced radiology reports and underlying issues of trust surrounding outsourced reports were the most significant themes identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study found outsourcing of radiology reporting needs multi-disciplinary team availability regarding the interpretation and discussions around capacity for effective communication. It raises important issues around often under-acknowledged additional workloads imposed on in-house radiologists. There are financial and pragmatic clinical aspects in pathways of radiology practice which require further research and examination.

These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice.

METHODS: A dedicated mammographic workstation has been developed in which readers can probe image locations for the presence of CAD information. If present, CAD findings are displayed with the computed malignancy rating. A reader study was conducted in which four screening radiologists and five non-radiologists participated to study the effect of this system on detection performance. The participants read 120 cases of which 40 cases had a malignant mass that was missed at the original screening. The readers read each mammogram both with and without CAD in separate sessions. Each reader reported localized findings and assigned a malignancy score per finding. Mean sensitivity was computed in an interval of false-positive fractions less than 10%. RESULTS: Mean sensitivity was 25.1% in the sessions without CAD and 34.8% in the CAD-assisted sessions. The increase in detection performance was significant (p = 0.012). Average reading time was 84.7 <c2><b1> 61.5 s/case in the unaided sessions and was not significantly higher when interactive CAD was used (85.9 <c2><b1> 57.8 s/case).

Cardiovascular imaging,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis with normal flow and low gradients and determine whether they benefit from intervention. BACKGROUND: Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis is a progressive disease with high mortality. Although surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are indicated for patients with high gradients (>40 mm Hg) or low gradients due to low flow, the approach for patients with normal flow and low gradients is poorly defined. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent echocardiography between 2012 and 2015 at Tel-Aviv Medical Center and had an aortic valve area of <e2><89><a4>1.0 cm(2), a mean gradient of <40 mm Hg, a stroke volume index of >35 ml/m(2), and symptoms formed the study group. Patients designated for intervention (SAVR or TAVR) had their procedure within 6 months of the echocardiogram; the others were treated conservatively. The endpoints were all-cause mortality and cardiac-related mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,358 patients with an aortic valve area of <e2><89><a4>1.0 cm(2) and symptoms were identified; 34% of these had normal flow and low gradient aortic stenosis and 303 were included. After mean follow-up of 652 days, 60 patients (20%) had died, with overall mortality rates of 28%, 10%, and 12% for conservatively treated, TAVR, and SAVR patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression with adjustment for other variables, TAVR was associated with improved survival versus conservative treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 0.93; p = 0.03), and lower cardiac mortality (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.74; p = 0.007) with no significant difference for SAVR versus TAVR. After propensity score matching of TAVR and conservatively treated patients, 25 of 94 (28%) conservatively treated and 10 of 94 (12%) TAVR patients had died (p = 0.016). In the matched cohort, Cox regression showed that TAVR had a significant association with improved survival (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.86; p = 0.03).

METHODS: A survey was mailed to Norwegian radiologists; 69% responded. They graded the frequencies of actions related to referrals with ambiguous indications or inappropriate examination choices and the contribution of factors preventing and not preventing an examination of doubtful usefulness from being performed as requested. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (344/361) reported daily or weekly actions related to inadequate referrals. Actions differed among subspecialties. The most frequent were contacting the referrer to clarify the clinical problem and checking test results/information in the medical records. Both actions were more frequent among registrars than specialists and among hospital radiologists than institute radiologists. Institute radiologists were more likely to ask the patient for additional information and to examine the patient clinically. Factors rated as contributing most to prevent doubtful examinations were high risk of serious complications/side effects, high radiation dose and low patient age. Factors facilitating doubtful examinations included respect for the referrer's judgment, patient/next-of-kin wants the examination, patient has arrived, unreachable referrer, and time pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, radiologists facing inadequate referrals considered patient safety and sought more information.

METHODS: This anonymized evaluation was performed after approval of ESR Education on Demand leadership. Forty clinical scenarios were developed in which at least one imaging modality was clinically most appropriate, and the scenarios were divided into sets 1 and 2. These sets were provided to medical students randomly assigned to group A or B to select the most appropriate imaging test for each scenario. Statistical comparisons were made within and across groups. RESULTS: Overall, 40 medical students participated, and 31 medical students (78%) answered both sets.

Maher_2007_Radi,JOUR,Evidence-based Practice in Radiology: steps 3 and 4--appraise and apply interventional radiology literature,"Maher, Michael M. and Hodnett, Philip A. and Kalra, Mannudeep K.",Radiology,"When introducing new interventional radiology techniques or devices, it is important to learn from previous experiences and to remember that there are numerous examples of new techniques that were initially enthusiastically promoted and then subsequently abandoned when early promise was not realized. Appropriateness of new or established interventional radiology techniques to specific clinical conditions must be determined from clinical experience, from communication with experts in the field and/or careful review of available medical literature, and on an individual patient basis by means of review of clinical notes and diagnostic imaging studies. Several paradigms for evidence-based practice (EBP) exist. One model proposes that a central specialized process involving academic centers should primarily construct valid guidelines to direct practice at all levels of medical practice (""top-down"" model). An alternative model integrates ""the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values"" (""bottom-up"" model). This article will focus on the bottom-up model and describe the use of EBP by individual practitioners or groups of practitioners in optimizing literature review and critical appraisal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two competing stroke prevention strategies were compared: (a) an intensive medical therapy-based management strategy versus (b) an imaging-based strategy in which the subset of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with IPH on MR images would undergo immediate carotid endarterectomy in addition to ongoing intensive medical therapy. Patients in the medical therapy-only group could undergo carotid endarterectomy only with substantial carotid artery stenosis disease progression. Lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were modeled for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with 70%-89% and 50%-69% carotid artery stenosis at presentation. Risks of stroke and complications from carotid endarterectomy, costs, and quality of life values were estimated from published sources. RESULTS: The medical therapy-based strategy had a lower life expectancy (12.65 years vs 12.95 years), lower lifetime QALYs (9.96 years vs 10.05 years), and lower lifetime costs ($13 699 vs $15 297) when compared with the MR imaging IPH-based strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the MR imaging IPH strategy compared with the medical therapy-based strategy was $16 000 per QALY by using a base-case 70-year-old patient. When using starting patient ages of 60 and 80 years, the ICERs for the MR imaging IPH strategy were $3100 per QALY and $73 000 per QALY, respectively. The ICERs for the MR imaging IPH strategy were slightly higher at all ages for 50%-69% stenosis but remained below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY for starting ages of 60 and 70 years.

The radiomics approach has the capacity to construct predictive models for treatment response, essential for the pursuit of personalised medicine. In this literature review, we summarise the current status and evaluate the scientific and reporting quality of radiomics research in the prediction of treatment response in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. A total of 178 articles were screened for eligibility and 14 peer-reviewed articles were included. The radiomics quality score (RQS), a radiomics-specific quality metric emulating the TRIPOD guidelines, was used to assess scientific and reporting quality. RESULTS: Included studies reported several predictive markers including first-, second- and high-order features, such as kurtosis, grey-level uniformity and wavelet HLL mean respectively, as well as PET-based metabolic parameters. Quality assessment demonstrated a low median score of + 2.5 (range - 5 to + 9), mainly reflecting a lack of reproducibility and clinical evaluation. There was extensive heterogeneity between studies due to differences in patient population, cancer stage, treatment modality, follow-up timescales and radiomics workflow methodology. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics research has not yet been translated into clinical use. Efforts towards standardisation and collaboration are needed to identify reproducible radiomic predictors of response. Promising radiomic models must be externally validated and their impact evaluated within the clinical pathway before they can be implemented as a clinical decision-making tool to facilitate personalised treatment for patients with NSCLC.

Benedikt and Dreyling, Martin and Rummeny, Ernst J. and Fingerle, Alexander A.",European radiology,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether template-based structured reports (SRs) add clinical value to primary CT staging in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) compared to free-text reports (FTRs). METHODS: In this two-centre study SRs and FTRs were acquired for 16 CT examinations. Thirty-two reports were independently scored by four haematologists using a questionnaire addressing completeness of information, structure, guidance for patient management and overall quality. The questionnaire included yes-no, 10-point Likert scale and 5-point scale questions. Altogether 128 completed questionnaires were evaluated. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: SRs contained information on affected organs more often than FTRs (95 % vs. 66 %). More SRs commented on extranodal involvement (91 % vs. 62 %). Sufficient information for Ann-Arbor classification was included in more SRs (89 % vs. 64 %). Information extraction was quicker from SRs (median rating on 10-point Likert scale=9 vs. 6; 7-10 vs. 4-8 interquartile range). SRs had better comprehensibility (9 vs. 7; 8-10 vs. 5-8). Contribution of SRs to clinical decision-making was higher (9 vs. 6; 6-10 vs. 3-8). SRs were of higher quality (p < 0.001). All haematologists preferred SRs over FTRs.

Purpose To investigate a deep learning-based automated liver fat quantification tool at nonenhanced CT for establishing the prevalence of steatosis in a large screening cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a fully automated liver segmentation algorithm was applied to noncontrast abdominal CT examinations from consecutive asymptomatic adults by using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, including a subcohort with follow-up scans. Automated volume-based liver attenuation was analyzed, including conversion to CT fat fraction, and compared with manual measurement in a large subset of scans. Results A total of 11 669 CT scans in 9552 adults (mean age <c2><b1> standard deviation, 57.2 years <c2><b1> 7.9; 5314 women and 4238 men; median body mass index [BMI], 27.8 kg/m(2)) were evaluated, including 2117 follow-up scans in 1862 adults (mean age, 59.2 years; 971 women and 891 men; mean interval, 5.5 years). Algorithm failure occurred in seven scans. Mean CT liver attenuation was 55 HU <c2><b1> 10, corresponding to CT fat fraction of 6.4% (slightly fattier in men than in women [7.4% <c2><b1> 6.0 vs 5.8% <c2><b1> 5.7%; P < .001]). Mean liver Hounsfield unit varied little by age (<4 HU difference among all age groups) and only weak correlation was seen with BMI (r(2) = 0.14). By category, 47.9% (5584 of 11 669) had negligible or no liver fat (CT fat fraction <5%), 42.4% (4948 of 11 669) had mild steatosis (CT fat fraction of 5%-14%), 8.8% (1025 of 11 669) had moderate steatosis (CT fat fraction of 14%-28%), and 1% (112 of 11 669) had severe steatosis (CT fat fraction >28%). Excellent agreement was seen between automated and manual measurements, with a mean difference of 2.7 HU (median, 3 HU) and r(2) of 0.92. Among the subcohort with longitudinal follow-up, mean change was only -3 HU <c2><b1> 9, but 43.3% (806 of 1861) of patients changed steatosis category between first and last scans. Conclusion This fully automated CT-based liver fat quantification tool allows for population-based assessment of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with objective data that match well with manual measurement.

Although these tests provide new information on many conditions, such as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the differentiation of what is normal, what is abnormal, and what is disease is no longer intuitive. Historically, the diagnosis of DDH was straightforward. The diagnosis was based primarily on clinical findings, which were often confirmed with radiography. Abnormal hips were either subluxated or dislocated and, if left untreated, adverse consequences were certain in either situation. Since the introduction of hip US, however, increased diagnostic sophistication has led to uncertainty as to how to interpret the continuous spectrum of acetabular morphology. There is no consensus on the degree of acetabular dysplasia that does or does not require treatment.

F.",Radiology,"Background Recent investigations have identified a faster time to publication for imaging studies with higher diagnostic test accuracy (DTA), but it is unknown whether such studies are more likely to be published. A higher probability of full-text publication for studies with higher DTA could have negative consequences on clinical decision making and patient care. Purpose To evaluate the proportion of imaging diagnostic accuracy studies presented as conference abstracts that reach full-text publication and to identify whether there is an association between diagnostic accuracy and full-text publication in peer-reviewed journals within 5 years after abstract submission. Materials and Methods Diagnostic accuracy research abstracts presented at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Annual Meeting in 2011 and 2012 were evaluated between September 1, 2017, and January 11, 2018. Sensitivity and specificity from the abstracts were used to calculate the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity-1); additional abstract characteristics were extracted. To identify full-text publications within 5 years after abstract submission, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched, and authors were contacted. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess for associations between higher diagnostic accuracy and full-text publication. Results A total of 7970 abstracts were evaluated, and 405 were included. Of these, 288 (71%) reached full-text publication within 5 years after abstract submission. Logistic regression analysis accounting for several confounding variables failed to show an association between reported Youden index in the conference abstract and probability of full-text publication (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.02; P = .21). Conclusion More than a quarter of abstracts presented at the RSNA Annual Meeting do not reach full-text publication in peer-reviewed journals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Patient knowledge, information sources, and communication preferences were assessed in six focus groups during 2012. The groups consisted of patients undergoing treatment for metastatic colorectal carcinoma, women treated within the past 6 months for early-stage breast carcinoma, men undergoing surveillance after testicular cancer treatment, parents of patients treated for stage I-III neuroblastoma, patients in a thoracic oncology survivorship program, and participants in a lung cancer screening program. A multidisciplinary research team performed thematic content analysis of focus group transcripts. High-level findings were summarized during consensus conferences. RESULTS: Although they were aware of the long-term risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, most participants reported that their health care provider did not initiate discussion about benefits and risks of radiation from imaging tests. Most patients obtained information by means of self-directed internet searches. Participants expressed gratitude for tests (""That CT saved my daughter's life,"" ""I'd rather have the radiation dosage than being opened up""), yet they expressed concern about having to initiate discussions (""If you don't ask, nobody is going to tell you anything"") and the desire to be offered information concerning the rationale for ordering specific imaging examinations, intervals for follow-up imaging, and testing alternatives. Participants believed that such information should be available routinely and that conversation with their personal physician or endorsed, readily available reference materials were ideal methods for information exchange.

Pending legislation specifies clinical decision support before performing advanced imaging at emergency department (ED) visits. Purpose To estimate the volume of advanced imaging tests (CT and MRI) that would require use of clinical decision support to achieve Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) compliance in the ED. Materials and Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of ED visits was conducted by using data from the 2012-2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. PAMA-related visits were identified by selecting the patient reasons for visit (RFVs) related to the eight clinical conditions. Results Among the adult ED visits, 26.7% (20 506 of 77 299, representing 113 000 000 visits across 4 years, or 28 000 000 visits annually) patients presented with a RFV consistent with a PAMA priority clinical area (PCA). Among visits in which a patient described an RFV code consistent with a PAMA PCA, up to 22.9% (4681 of 20 506; 95% confidence interval: 21.8%, 24.1%) patients underwent advanced imaging, translating to approximately 6 000 000 visits annually. Conclusion Protecting Access to Medicare Act legislation targets eight priority clinical areas, estimated to be prevalent among one in four adult emergency department visits. CT and/or MRI studies are performed during up to 23% of these visits. Depending on the particular clinical decision support systems selected within a health system, and how they are implemented, the potential volume of studies in which clinicians must interact with clinical decision support system may either exceed or fall short of these estimates.

Fuks_2012_Radi,JOUR,Acute cholecystitis: preoperative CT can help the surgeon consider conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy,"Fuks, David and Mouly, Charlotte and Robert, Brice and Hajji, Hassene and Yzet, Thierry and Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Radiology,"PURPOSE: To establish whether preoperative computed tomographic (CT) findings in patients with acute cholecystitis were associated with conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in patients with calculous acute cholecystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and written informed consent was provided by all patients at enrollment. From 2008 to 2010, all patients admitted to a university medical center with acute calculous cholecystitis and for whom a preoperative contrast material-enhanced CT study was available were prospectively included. Cholecystectomy was always initiated laparoscopically. To identify risk factors for conversion specifically related to acute cholecystitis, CT studies were analyzed according to predefined criteria by two radiologists who were blinded to the patient's conversion status. Associations between conversion and radiologic findings were assessed by using univariate and multivariate logistic models. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were analyzed (61 men, 47 women; median age, 58 years; age range, 17-88 years). Conversion occurred in 24 (22%) cases. On preoperative CT images, the absence of gallbladder wall enhancement was associated with the presence of gangrenous acute cholecystitis (sensitivity, 73%). The absence of gallbladder wall enhancement (58% and 40% for conversion and nonconversion, respectively; P = .02) and the presence of a gallstone in the gallbladder infundibulum (78% and 22% for conversion and nonconversion, respectively; P = .04) were associated with acute cholecystitis-related conversion in a multivariate analysis. Interobserver agreement for CT study interpretation was very good (median k value, 0.92; range, 0.76-1.00). CONCLUSION: The absence of gallbladder wall enhancement (associated with the presence of gangrenous acute cholecystitis) and the presence of a gallstone in the gallbladder infundibulum are associated with conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy.",2012,10.1148/radiol.12110460,263,1,128-138,eng,1527-1315 0033-8419,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Logistic Models and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Acute Disease and Contrast Media and *Decision Making and *Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted and Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic and Cholecystectomy/*methods and Cholecystitis/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery",NA,NA,2012/04//undefined,Radiology,NA,NA,NA,NA
