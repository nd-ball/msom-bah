However, rapid diagnosis and identification of high-risk patients for early intervention are challenging. Using a large computed tomography (CT) database from 3,777 patients, we developed an AI system that can diagnose NCP and differentiate it from other common pneumonia and normal controls. The AI system can assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis especially when the health system is overloaded. Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties. Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately.

Molecular cell biology,"Protein subcellular localization is tightly controlled and intimately linked to protein function in health and disease. Capturing the spatial proteome - that is, the localizations of proteins and their dynamics at the subcellular level - is therefore essential for a complete understanding of cell biology. Owing to substantial advances in microscopy, mass spectrometry and machine learning applications for data analysis, the field is now mature for proteome-wide investigations of spatial cellular regulation. Studies of the human proteome have begun to reveal a complex architecture, including single-cell variations, dynamic protein translocations, changing interaction networks and proteins localizing to multiple compartments. Furthermore, several studies have successfully harnessed the power of comparative spatial proteomics as a discovery tool to unravel disease mechanisms. We are at the beginning of an era in which spatial proteomics finally integrates with cell biology and medical research, thereby paving the way for unbiased systems-level insights into cellular processes. Here, we discuss current methods for spatial proteomics using imaging or mass spectrometry and specifically highlight global comparative applications. The aim of this Review is to survey the state of the field and also to encourage more cell biologists to apply spatial proteomics approaches.",2019,10.1038/s41580-018-0094-y,20,5,285-302,eng,1471-0080 1471-0072,Humans and Animals and *Proteomics and *Mass Spectrometry and Protein Transport/physiology and Proteome/genetics/*metabolism,NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,NA,NA,NA,NA

SCV quantitatively captures the role of proximity in genotype-to-phenotype spatial-temporal relationships. Phenotype landscapes generated through SCV provide a platform that can be used to describe the functional properties that drive sequence-to-function-to-structure design of the polypeptide fold at atomic resolution.

Using age-stratified human tissue transcriptomes and machine learning, we generated age classifiers and applied these to transcriptomic changes induced by 1,309 different compounds in human cells, ranking these compounds by their ability to induce a ""youthful"" transcriptional state. Testing the top candidates in C. elegans, we identified two Hsp90 inhibitors, monorden and tanespimycin, which extended the animals' lifespan and improved their health. Hsp90 inhibition induces expression of heat shock proteins known to improve protein homeostasis. Consistently, monorden treatment improved the survival of C. elegans under proteotoxic stress, and its benefits depended on the cytosolic unfolded protein response-inducing transcription factor HSF-1.
