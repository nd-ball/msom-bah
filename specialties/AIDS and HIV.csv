While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated effectiveness, adherence has been low among YMSM and difficult to measure accurately. In collaboration with a healthcare company, we configured an automated directly-observed therapy (aDOT) platform for monitoring and supporting PrEP use. Based on interest expressed in focus groups among 54 YMSM, we combined aDOT with an electronic sexual diary to provide feedback on level of protection during sex and to motivate app use. In an 8-week optimization pilot with 20 YMSM in San Francisco and Atlanta, the app was found to be highly acceptable, with median System Usability Scale scores in the ""excellent"" range (80/100). App use was high, with median PrEP adherence of 91% based on aDOT-confirmed dosing. Most (84%) participants reported the app helped with taking PrEP. These promising findings support further evaluation of DOT Diary in future effectiveness studies.",2021,10.1007/s10461-020-03054-2,25,4,1001-1012,eng,1573-3254 1090-7165,"Artificial intelligence and Humans and Male and Medication Adherence and HIV and Adherence and Artificial Intelligence and San Francisco and Mobile health and *Mobile Applications and *Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis and *HIV Infections/prevention & control and *Sexual and Gender Minorities and Homosexuality, Male and Electronics and Pre-exposure prophylaxis",NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,AIDS Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA

HIV,"BACKGROUND: The limitations of existing HIV risk prediction tools are a barrier to implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We developed and validated an HIV prediction model to identify potential PrEP candidates in a large health-care system. METHODS: Our study population was HIV-uninfected adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health-care system, who were not yet using PrEP and had at least 2 years of previous health plan enrolment with at least one outpatient visit from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2017. Using 81 electronic health record (EHR) variables, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to predict incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years on a subset of patients who entered the cohort in 2007-14 (development dataset), assessing ten-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 95% CIs. We compared the full model to simpler models including only men who have sex with men (MSM) status and sexually transmitted infection (STI) positivity, testing, and treatment. Models were validated prospectively with data from an independent set of patients who entered the cohort in 2015-17. We computed predicted probabilities of incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years (risk scores), categorised as low risk (<0<c2><b7>05%), moderate risk (0<c2><b7>05% to <0<c2><b7>20%), high risk (0<c2><b7>20% to <1<c2><b7>0%), and very high risk (<e2><89><a5>1<c2><b7>0%), for all patients in the validation dataset. FINDINGS: Of 3 750 664 patients in 2007-17 (3 143 963 in the development dataset and 606 701 in the validation dataset), there were 784 incident HIV cases within 3 years of baseline. The LASSO procedure retained 44 predictors in the full model, with an AUC of 0<c2><b7>86 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>85-0<c2><b7>87) for incident HIV cases in 2007-14. Model performance remained high in the validation dataset (AUC 0<c2><b7>84, 0<c2><b7>80-0<c2><b7>89). The full model outperformed simpler models including only MSM status and STI positivity. For the full model, flagging 13 463 (2<c2><b7>2%) patients with high or very high HIV risk scores in the validation dataset identified 32 (38<c2><b7>6%) of the 83 incident HIV cases, including 32 (46<c2><b7>4%) of 69 male cases and none of the 14 female cases. The full model had equivalent sensitivity by race whereas simpler models identified fewer black than white HIV cases. INTERPRETATION: Prediction models using EHR data can identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition who could benefit from PrEP. Future studies should optimise EHR-based HIV risk prediction tools and evaluate their effect on prescription of PrEP.

Minimal evidence for racism affecting clinical decision-making emerged. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexism indirectly affected prescribing intention via all anticipated behaviors, tested as parallel mediators. Participants expressing greater heterosexism more strongly anticipated increased risk behavior and adherence problems, which were associated with lower prescribing intention.

Gonsalves_2018_ThelanHIV,JOUR,"Dynamics of the HIV outbreak and response in Scott County, IN, USA, 2011-15: a modelling study","Gonsalves, Gregg S. and Crawford, Forrest W.",The lancet. HIV,"BACKGROUND: In November, 2014, a cluster of HIV infections was detected among people who inject drugs in Scott County, IN, USA, with 215 HIV infections eventually attributed to the outbreak. This study examines whether earlier implementation of a public health response could have reduced the scale of the outbreak. METHODS: In this modelling study, we derived weekly case data from the HIV outbreak in Scott County, IN, and on the uptake of HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services from publicly available reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and researchers from Indiana. Our primary objective was to determine if an earlier response to the outbreak could have had an effect on the number of people infected. We computed upper and lower bounds for cumulative HIV incidence by digitally extracting data from published images from a CDC study using Bio-Rad avidity incidence testing to estimate the recency of each transmission event. We constructed a generalisation of the susceptible-infectious-removed model to capture the transmission dynamics of the HIV outbreak. We computed non-parametric interval estimates of the number of individuals with an undiagnosed HIV infection, the case-finding rate per undiagnosed HIV infection, and model-based bounds for the HIV transmission rate throughout the epidemic. We used these models to assess the potential effect if the same intervention had begun at two key timepoints earlier than the actual date of the initiation of efforts to control the outbreak. FINDINGS: The upper bound for undiagnosed HIV infections in Scott County peaked at 126 around Jan 10, 2015, over 2 months before the Governor of Indiana declared a public health emergency on March 26, 2015. Applying the observed case-finding rate scale-up to earlier intervention times suggests that an earlier public health response could have substantially reduced the total number of HIV infections (estimated to have been 183-184 infections by Aug 11, 2015). Initiation of a response on Jan 1, 2013, could have suppressed the number of infections to 56 or fewer, averting at least 127 infections; whereas an intervention on April 1, 2011, could have reduced the number of infections to ten or fewer, averting at least 173 infections. INTERPRETATION: Early and robust surveillance efforts and case finding alone could reduce nascent epidemics. Ensuring access to HIV services and harm-reduction interventions could further reduce the likelihood of outbreaks, and substantially mitigate their severity and scope.

HIV,"BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective but underused, in part because clinicians do not have the tools to identify PrEP candidates. We developed and validated an automated prediction algorithm that uses electronic health record (EHR) data to identify individuals at increased risk for HIV acquisition. METHODS: We used machine learning algorithms to predict incident HIV infections with 180 potential predictors of HIV risk drawn from EHR data from 2007-15 at Atrius Health, an ambulatory group practice in Massachusetts, USA. We included EHRs of all patients aged 15 years or older with at least one clinical encounter during 2007-15. We used ten-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (cv-AUC) with 95% CIs to assess the model's performance at identifying individuals with incident HIV and patients independently prescribed PrEP by clinicians. The best-performing model was validated prospectively with 2016 data from Atrius Health and externally with 2011-16 data from Fenway Health, a community health centre specialising in sexual health care in Boston (MA, USA). We calculated HIV risk scores (ie, probability of an incident HIV diagnosis) for every HIV-uninfected patient not on PrEP during 2007-15 at Atrius Health and assessed the distribution of scores for thresholds to determine possible candidates for PrEP in the three study cohorts. FINDINGS: We included 1 155 966 Atrius Health patients from 2007-15 (150 [<0<c2><b7>1%] patients with incident HIV) in our development cohort, 537 257 Atrius Health patients in 2016 (16 [<0<c2><b7>1%] with incident HIV) in our prospective validation cohort, and 33 404 Fenway Health patients from 2011-16 (423 [1<c2><b7>3%] with incident HIV) in our external validation cohort. The best-performing algorithm was obtained with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and had a cv-AUC of 0<c2><b7>86 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>82-0<c2><b7>90) for identification of incident HIV infections in the development cohort, 0<c2><b7>91 (0<c2><b7>81-1<c2><b7>00) on prospective validation, and 0<c2><b7>77 (0<c2><b7>74-0<c2><b7>79) on external validation. The LASSO model successfully identified patients independently prescribed PrEP by clinicians at Atrius Health in 2016 (cv-AUC 0<c2><b7>93, 95% CI 0<c2><b7>90-0<c2><b7>96) or Fenway Health (0<c2><b7>79, 0<c2><b7>78-0<c2><b7>80).

However, these data pose unique opportunities and challenges for use in health system monitoring, along with process and impact evaluations. METHODS: Analyses focused on retrospective case reviews of four of the HIV-related studies published in this JIAS supplement. We identify specific opportunities and challenges with respect to the secondary analysis of RHIS and PHI data. RESULTS: Challenges working with both HIV-related RHIS and PHI included missing, inconsistent and implausible data; rapidly changing indicators; systematic differences in the utilization of services; and patient linkages over time and different data sources. Specific challenges among RHIS data included numerous registries and indicators, inconsistent data entry, gaps in data transmission, duplicate registry of information, numerator-denominator incompatibility and infrequent use of data for decision-making. Challenges specific to PHI included the time burden for busy providers, the culture of lax charting, overflowing archives for paper charts and infrequent chart review. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the challenges that undermine effective use of RHIS and PHI data for analyses are related to the processes and context of collecting the data, excessive data requirements, lack of knowledge of the purpose of data and the limited use of data among those generating the data. Recommendations include simplifying data sources, analysis and reporting; conducting systematic data quality audits; enhancing the use of data for decision-making; promoting routine chart review linked with simple patient tracking systems; and encouraging open access to RHIS and PHI data for increased use.",2016,10.7448/IAS.19.5.20847,19,5 Suppl 4,20847,eng,1758-2652,"Humans and Retrospective Studies and data analysis and electronic medical records and Program Evaluation and Health Records, Personal and personal health information and *Information Storage and Retrieval and *Data Collection and *Health Information Systems and health information systems and missing data and *HIV Infections and data accuracy and secondary data analysis",NA,NA,2016///,J Int AIDS Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Machine learning analysis of baseline and longitudinal predictors derived from clinical measures utilized in pediatric HIV. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-five children (ages 2-14 years at baseline; Mage = 6.4 years) with pHIV in Southeast Asia underwent neurocognitive assessment at study enrollment and twice annually thereafter for an average of 5.4 years. Neurocognitive slopes were modeled to establish two subgroups [above (n = 145) and below average (n = 140) trajectories). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions (GBM) with five-fold cross validation were conducted to examine baseline (pre-ART) and longitudinal predictive features derived from demographic, HIV disease, immune, mental health, and physical health indices (i.e. complete blood count [CBC]). RESULTS: The baseline GBM established a classifier of neurocognitive group designation with an average AUC of 79% built from HIV disease severity and immune markers. GBM analysis of longitudinal predictors with and without interactions improved the average AUC to 87 and 90%, respectively. Mental health problems and hematocrit levels also emerged as salient features in the longitudinal models, with novel interactions between mental health problems and both CD4 cell count and hematocrit levels.

What used to be an acute treatment for life threatening complications, and an end-of-life therapy in the beginning of the epidemic, turned over the time into a lifelong care. The good relationship between patients and physicians represents the cornerstone of an optimal long-term therapy. Shared decision making between patients and physicians is a crucial prerequisite for the success of this approach. Several Austrian patient organizations developed an online survey together with MSD (the so-called ""PAB-test"") aimed to evaluate how people living with HIV perceive the level of care in Austria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey has been developed to evaluate how people living with HIV feel about the relationship with their physicians and to what extent they feel involved in treatment related decisions. RESULTS: A total of 303 subjects completed the questionnaire. 44% felt ""totally"" involved in their therapy, 40% ""strongly involved"", 12% ""fairly involved"", 3% ""poorly involved"" and 1% ""not at all involved"" in their therapy. The proportion of subjects who felt totally involved in the therapy was equally distributed between sex, sexual orientation, age groups, groups of various education level, and between patients treated predominantly in intramural or extramural medical care. The most important factor for people living with HIV to feel involved in their therapy is a low amount of long-term ART-related side-effects (Figure 1). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the majority of people living with HIV in Austria feel involved in therapy related decisions. This proportion is equally distributed in patients with different socio-demographic or socio-economic characteristics or level of medical care delivery.

Nearly 85% of VMMCs were for males between ages 15 and 29, while boys 10-14 years were referred outside the program. This analysis uses the Decision Makers Program Planning Tool to understand the impact of age prioritization on circumcision in Namibia. Results indicate that circumcising males aged 20-29 reduced HIV incidence most rapidly, while focusing on ages 15-24 was more cost effective and produced greater magnitude of impact. Providing services to those under 15 could increase VMMC volume 67% while introducing Early Infant Medical Circumcision could expand coverage.

However, little is known about racial biases affecting healthcare providers' willingness to prescribe PrEP. This investigation sought to explore medical students' stereotypes about sexual risk compensation among Black versus White men who have sex with men seeking PrEP, and the impact of such stereotypes on willingness to prescribe PrEP. An online survey presented participants (n = 102) with a clinical vignette of a PrEP-seeking, HIV-negative man with an HIV-positive male partner. Patient race was systematically manipulated. Participants reported predictions about patient sexual risk compensation, willingness to prescribe PrEP, and other clinical judgments. Bootstrapping analyses revealed that the Black patient was rated as more likely than the White patient to engage in increased unprotected sex if prescribed PrEP, which, in turn, was associated with reduced willingness to prescribe PrEP to the patient.",2014,10.1007/s10461-013-0675-x,18,2,226-240,eng,1573-3254 1090-7165,"Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Socioeconomic Factors and Health Care Surveys and Attitude of Health Personnel and Drug Prescriptions and Prejudice and *Decision Making and Students, Medical/*psychology and *Racism and Health Personnel/*psychology and Homosexuality, Male and Cultural Competency and Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use and Whites/statistics & numerical data and *Antibiotic Prophylaxis and Blacks/statistics & numerical data and HIV Infections/ethnology/*prevention & control/psychology",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,AIDS Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we aim to discover the most relevant variables for predicting HIV testing uptake among substance users in substance use disorder treatment programs by applying random forest (RF), a robust multivariate statistical learning method. We also provide a descriptive introduction to this method for those who are unfamiliar with it. We used data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network HIV testing and counseling study (CTN-0032). A total of 1281 HIV-negative or status unknown participants from 12 US community-based substance use disorder treatment programs were included and were randomized into three HIV testing and counseling treatment groups. The a priori primary outcome was self-reported receipt of HIV test results. Classification accuracy of RF was compared to logistic regression, a standard statistical approach for binary outcomes. Variable importance measures for the RF model were used to select the most relevant variables. RF based models produced much higher classification accuracy than those based on logistic regression. Treatment group is the most important predictor among all covariates, with a variable importance index of 12.9%. RF variable importance revealed that several types of condomless sex behaviors, condom use self-efficacy and attitudes towards condom use, and level of depression are the most important predictors of receipt of HIV testing results. There is a non-linear negative relationship between count of condomless sex acts and the receipt of HIV testing. In conclusion, RF seems promising in discovering important factors related to HIV testing uptake among large numbers of predictors and should be encouraged in future HIV prevention and treatment research and intervention program evaluations.",2017,10.1007/s10461-016-1628-y,21,2,534-546,eng,1573-3254 1090-7165,Humans and Female and Male and Substance use and Logistic Models and Supervised learning and Comorbidity and Attitude to Health and Random forest and Self Efficacy and United States/epidemiology and *Machine Learning and Multivariate analysis and *Sexual Behavior and Safe Sex and Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data and HIV Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology and HIV testing and *Counseling and Condoms/statistics & numerical data and Drug Users and Sexual risk behaviors and Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/*therapy,NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,AIDS Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA

""Ending the HIV Epidemic"" now becomes primarily a challenge of will and implementation. This review maps the extent to which implementation research (IR) has been integrated into HIV research by reviewing the recent funding portfolio of the NIH. We searched NIH RePORTER for HIV and IR-related research projects funded from January 2013 to March 2018. The 4629 unique studies identified were screened using machine learning and manual methods. 216 abstracts met the eligibility criteria of HIV and IR. Key study characteristics were then abstracted. NIH currently funds HIV studies that are either formally IR (n = 109) or preparatory for IR (n = 107). Few (13%) projects mentioned a guiding implementation model, theory, or framework, and only 56% of all studies explicitly mentioned measuring an implementation outcome. Considering the study aims along an IR continuum, 18 (8%) studies examined barriers and facilitators, 43 (20%) developed implementation strategies, 46 (21%) piloted strategies, 73 (34%) tested a single strategy, and 35 (16%) compared strategies. A higher proportion of formal IR projects involved established interventions (e.g., integrated services) compared to newer interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis). Prioritizing HIV-related IR in NIH and other federal funding opportunity announcements and expanded training in implementation science could have a substantial impact on ending the HIV pandemic.

We identified factors leading to the retransmission of messages from expert social media accounts to create data-driven recommendations for online HIV messaging. DESIGN AND METHODS: We sampled 20 201 HIV-related tweets (posted between 2010 and 2017) from 37 HIV experts. Potential predictors of retransmission were identified based on prior literature and machine learning methods, and were subsequently analyzed using multilevel negative binomial models. RESULTS: Fear-related language, longer messages, and including images (e.g. photos, gif, or videos) were the strongest predictors of retweet counts. These findings were similar for messages authored by HIV experts, and also messages retransmitted by experts, but created by nonexperts (e.g. celebrities or politicians). CONCLUSIONS: Fear appeals affect how much HIV messages spread on Twitter, as do structural characteristics, like the length of the tweet and inclusion of images. A set of five data-driven recommendations for increasing message spread is derived and discussed in the context of current centers for disease control and prevention social media guidelines.",2018,10.1097/QAD.0000000000002018,32,18,2799-2805,eng,1473-5571 0269-9370,"Humans and *Social Media and Health Education/*methods and Behavior Therapy/*methods and Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control and HIV Infections/diagnosis/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2018/11/28/,AIDS,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite documented effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), PrEP remains unavailable in Ukraine. The aim of this study was to elicit MSM preferences in order to inform program development to facilitate successful delivery of PrEP to Ukrainian MSM. 1184 MSM were recruited through social networking applications to complete a stated preference (choice-based conjoint) survey. Respondents completed 14 choice tasks presenting experimentally-varied combinations of five attributes related to PrEP administration (dosing frequency, dispensing venue, prescription practices, adherence support, and costs). Latent class analysis was used to estimate the relative importance of each attribute and preferences across nine possible PrEP delivery programs. Preferences clustered into five groups. PrEP affordability was the most influential attribute across groups, followed by dosing strategy. Only one group preferred injectable PrEP (n = 216), while the other four groups disliked daily PrEP and strongly preferred the 'on demand' option. One group (n = 258) almost exclusively considered cost in their decision making. One group (n = 151) had very low level of interest in PrEP initiation correlated with low self-perceived risk for HIV. The two most at-risk groups (n = 415) were also more sensitive to changes in program delivery. PrEP uptake among MSM is most likely to be successful when PrEP is affordable, its implementation is targeted, provided as ""on-demand"" with associated education, and when more thorough medical care and related testing is provided to at-risk populations.

X2016_AIDS.LonEngl,JOUR,Evaluation of geospatial methods to generate subnational HIV prevalence estimates for local level planning,NA,"AIDS (London, England)","OBJECTIVE: There is evidence of substantial subnational variation in the HIV epidemic. However, robust spatial HIV data are often only available at high levels of geographic aggregation and not at the finer resolution needed for decision making. Therefore, spatial analysis methods that leverage available data to provide local estimates of HIV prevalence may be useful. Such methods exist but have not been formally compared when applied to HIV. DESIGN/METHODS: Six candidate methods - including those used by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to generate maps and a Bayesian geostatistical approach applied to other diseases - were used to generate maps and subnational estimates of HIV prevalence across three countries using cluster level data from household surveys. Two approaches were used to assess the accuracy of predictions: internal validation, whereby a proportion of input data is held back (test dataset) to challenge predictions; and comparison with location-specific data from household surveys in earlier years. RESULTS: Each of the methods can generate usefully accurate predictions of prevalence at unsampled locations, with the magnitude of the error in predictions similar across approaches. However, the Bayesian geostatistical approach consistently gave marginally the strongest statistical performance across countries and validation procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Available methods may be able to furnish estimates of HIV prevalence at finer spatial scales than the data currently allow. The subnational variation revealed can be integrated into planning to ensure responsiveness to the spatial features of the epidemic. The Bayesian geostatistical approach is a promising strategy for integrating HIV data to generate robust local estimates.",2016,10.1097/QAD.0000000000001075,30,9,1467-1474,eng,1473-5571 0269-9370,"Humans and Prevalence and Kenya/epidemiology and Malawi/epidemiology and HIV Infections/*epidemiology and Spatial Analysis and Tanzania/epidemiology and *Topography, Medical",NA,NA,2016/06/01/,AIDS,NA,NA,NA,NA
