Ngiam_2019_TheLanOnc,JOUR,Big data and machine learning algorithms for health-care delivery,"Ngiam, Kee Yuan and Khor, Ing Wei",The Lancet. Oncology,"Analysis of big data by machine learning offers considerable advantages for assimilation and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. However, to effectively use machine learning tools in health care, several limitations must be addressed and key issues considered, such as its clinical implementation and ethics in health-care delivery. Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem. Also crucial are ethical considerations, which include medico-legal implications, doctors' understanding of machine learning tools, and data privacy and security. In this Review, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of big data and machine learning in health care.",2019,10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30149-4,20,5,e262-e273,eng,1474-5488 1470-2045,"Humans and Health Services Research and Therapy, Computer-Assisted and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted and *Machine Learning and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Medical Oncology and *Big Data and *Data Mining and *Delivery of Health Care, Integrated and *Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Lancet Oncol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oncology,"Wellbeing after successful cancer treatment depends on more than merely reducing the risk of disease recurrence. Cancer survival can be characterised by uncertainty, fear, and the interpretation of bodily sensations as potentially symptomatic of cancer recurrence.

In this Personal View, we consider the medical, psychological, and ethical issues related to the practice of self-directed symptom monitoring after completion of cancer treatment, focusing on the role of doctor-patient communication. We ask how clinicians can account for the plurality of values that patients might have when it comes to deciding on how to manage and respond to experiences of post-cancer symptoms. We advocate a shared decision-making approach that incorporates the assessment of an individual's cancer recurrence risks as well as psychosocial considerations regarding fear of cancer recurrence and mental health.

Oncology,"Medical devices are indispensable for cancer management across the entire cancer care continuum, yet many existing medical interventions are not equally accessible to the global population, contributing to disparate mortality rates between countries with different income levels. Improved access to priority medical technologies is required to implement universal health coverage and deliver high-quality cancer care. However, the selection of appropriate medical devices at all income and hospital levels has been difficult because of the extremely large number of devices needed for the full spectrum of cancer care; the wide variety of options within the medical device sector, ranging from small inexpensive disposable devices to sophisticated diagnostic imaging and treatment units; and insufficient in-country expertise, in many countries, to prioritise cancer interventions and to determine associated technologies. In this Policy Review, we describe the methods, process, and outcome of a WHO initiative to define a list of priority medical devices for cancer management. The methods, approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee, can be used as a model approach for future endeavours to define and select medical devices for disease management.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a worldwide shortage of urological pathologists puts a strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability in grading can result in overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer. To alleviate these problems, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system with clinically acceptable accuracy for prostate cancer detection, localisation, and Gleason grading. METHODS: We digitised 6682 slides from needle core biopsies from 976 randomly selected participants aged 50-69 in the Swedish prospective and population-based STHLM3 diagnostic study done between May 28, 2012, and Dec 30, 2014 (ISRCTN84445406), and another 271 from 93 men from outside the study. The resulting images were used to train deep neural networks for assessment of prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test dataset comprising 1631 biopsies from 246 men from STHLM3 and an external validation dataset of 330 biopsies from 73 men. We also evaluated grading performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics and tumour extent predictions by correlating predicted cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the concordance between grades assigned by the AI system and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's kappa. FINDINGS: The AI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0<c2><b7>997 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>994-0<c2><b7>999) for distinguishing between benign (n=910) and malignant (n=721) biopsy cores on the independent test dataset and 0<c2><b7>986 (0<c2><b7>972-0<c2><b7>996) on the external validation dataset (benign n=108, malignant n=222). The correlation between cancer length predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0<c2><b7>96 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>95-0<c2><b7>97) for the independent test dataset and 0<c2><b7>87 (0<c2><b7>84-0<c2><b7>90) for the external validation dataset. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved a mean pairwise kappa of 0<c2><b7>62, which was within the range of the corresponding values for the expert pathologists (0<c2><b7>60-0<c2><b7>73). INTERPRETATION: An AI system can be trained to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples at a ranking comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. Clinical application could reduce pathology workload by reducing the assessment of benign biopsies and by automating the task of measuring cancer length in positive biopsy cores. An AI system with expert-level grading performance might contribute a second opinion, aid in standardising grading, and provide pathology expertise in parts of the world where it does not exist.

With the ability to generate an individual probability of a clinical event by integrating diverse prognostic and determinant variables, nomograms meet our desire for biologically and clinically integrated models and fulfill our drive towards personalised medicine. Rapid computation through user-friendly digital interfaces, together with increased accuracy, and more easily understood prognoses compared with conventional staging, allow for seamless incorporation of nomogram-derived prognosis to aid clinical decision making. This has led to the appearance of many nomograms on the internet and in medical journals, and an increase in nomogram use by patients and physicians alike. However, the statistical foundations of nomogram construction, their precise interpretation, and evidence supporting their use are generally misunderstood. This issue is leading to an under-appreciation of the inherent uncertainties regarding nomogram use.

However, questions related to what information is relevant, and how to view the relative attributes of alternative interventions have political, social, and medical considerations. In particular, questions about whether cost is a relevant factor, and whether cost-effectiveness is a desirable or necessary component of such research, have become increasingly controversial as the area has gained prominence. Debate has emerged about whether comparative effectiveness research promotes rationing of cancer care. At the heart of this debate are questions related to the role and limits of patient autonomy, physician discretion in health-care decision making, and the nature of scientific knowledge as an objective good. In this article, we examine the role of comparative effectiveness research in the USA, UK, Canada, and other health-care systems, and the relation between research and policy.

Oncology,"It is important to differentiate between two concepts of adjuvant therapy in melanoma-what we have come to call late adjuvant and early adjuvant therapy. Early adjuvant therapy is defined as a medical intervention that is done after resection of a primary melanoma to eradicate possible undetectable minimal residual disease, whereas late adjuvant therapy is done when an overt metastatic disease (nodal or visceral) has been completely resected, to control disease better than if the same treatment were given at a later time, in the presence of multiple metastases. Early adjuvant therapy is thus a preventive treatment strategy, whereas late adjuvant therapy aims at anticipating treatment of metastatic disease. For patients with melanoma, 1-year treatment with targeted therapies and immunotherapy have only been assessed in late adjuvant settings, the outcomes of which more or less reproduce the same dramatic effect as they have in metastatic disease. However, early adjuvant therapy could provide greater benefits in terms of public health, since thin melanomas without nodal metastases are so common that they account for most deaths by melanoma. In the early adjuvant setting, a treatment course of less than 1 year might be sufficient to control the disease, with less toxicity and at reduced costs. In this Personal View, we discuss the potential benefit of short-term early adjuvant treatment in patients with stage II melanoma, with the hope that sentinel-node biopsy and the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging will soon be replaced by more relevant biomarkers to identify the most suitable candidates for early adjuvant therapy for this disease.",2018,10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30596-5,19,12,e720-e725,eng,1474-5488 1470-2045,"Humans and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Patient Selection and Drug Administration Schedule and Neoplasm Staging and Neoplasm, Residual and Chemotherapy, Adjuvant and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Clinical Decision-Making and Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects and Melanoma/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary and Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Lancet Oncol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aberrant organisation of DNA has been correlated with cancer prognosis in analyses of the chromatin component of tumour cell nuclei using image texture analysis. As yet, the methodology has not been sufficiently validated to permit its clinical application. We aimed to define and validate a novel prognostic biomarker for the automatic detection of heterogeneous chromatin organisation. METHODS: Machine learning algorithms analysed the chromatin organisation in 461 000 images of tumour cell nuclei stained for DNA from 390 patients (discovery cohort) treated for stage I or II colorectal cancer at the Aker University Hospital (Oslo, Norway). The resulting marker of chromatin heterogeneity, termed Nucleotyping, was subsequently independently validated in six patient cohorts: 442 patients with stage I or II colorectal cancer in the Gloucester Colorectal Cancer Study (UK); 391 patients with stage II colorectal cancer in the QUASAR 2 trial; 246 patients with stage I ovarian carcinoma; 354 patients with uterine sarcoma; 307 patients with prostate carcinoma; and 791 patients with endometrial carcinoma.

FINDINGS: In all patient cohorts, patients with chromatin heterogeneous tumours had worse cancer-specific survival than patients with chromatin homogeneous tumours (univariable analysis hazard ratio [HR] 1<c2><b7>7, 95% CI 1<c2><b7>2-2<c2><b7>5, in the discovery cohort; 1<c2><b7>8, 1<c2><b7>0-3<c2><b7>0, in the Gloucester validation cohort; 2<c2><b7>2, 1<c2><b7>1-4<c2><b7>5, in the QUASAR 2 validation cohort; 3<c2><b7>1, 1<c2><b7>9-5<c2><b7>0, in the ovarian carcinoma cohort; 2<c2><b7>5, 1<c2><b7>8-3<c2><b7>4, in the uterine sarcoma cohort; 2<c2><b7>3, 1<c2><b7>2-4<c2><b7>6, in the prostate carcinoma cohort; and 4<c2><b7>3, 2<c2><b7>8-6<c2><b7>8, in the endometrial carcinoma cohort). After adjusting for established prognostic patient characteristics in multivariable analyses, Nucleotyping was prognostic in all cohorts except for the prostate carcinoma cohort (HR 1<c2><b7>7, 95% CI 1<c2><b7>1-2<c2><b7>5, in the discovery cohort; 1<c2><b7>9, 1<c2><b7>1-3<c2><b7>2, in the Gloucester validation cohort; 2<c2><b7>6, 1<c2><b7>2-5<c2><b7>6, in the QUASAR 2 cohort; 1<c2><b7>8, 1<c2><b7>1-3<c2><b7>0, for ovarian carcinoma; 1<c2><b7>6, 1<c2><b7>0-2<c2><b7>4, for uterine sarcoma; 1<c2><b7>43, 0<c2><b7>68-2<c2><b7>99, for prostate carcinoma; and 1<c2><b7>9, 1<c2><b7>1-3<c2><b7>1, for endometrial carcinoma). Chromatin heterogeneity was a significant predictor of cancer-specific survival in microsatellite unstable (HR 2<c2><b7>9, 95% CI 1<c2><b7>0-8<c2><b7>4) and microsatellite stable (1<c2><b7>8, 1<c2><b7>2-2<c2><b7>7) stage II colorectal cancer, but microsatellite instability was not a significant predictor of outcome in chromatin homogeneous (1<c2><b7>3, 0<c2><b7>7-2<c2><b7>4) or chromatin heterogeneous (0<c2><b7>8, 0<c2><b7>3-2<c2><b7>0) stage II colorectal cancer. INTERPRETATION: The consistent prognostic prediction of Nucleotyping in different biological and technical circumstances suggests that the marker of chromatin heterogeneity can be reliably assessed in routine clinical practice and could be used to objectively assist decision making in a range of clinical settings. An immediate application would be to identify high-risk patients with stage II colorectal cancer who might have greater absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the survival benefit and cost-effectiveness of using Nucleotyping to guide treatment decisions in multiple clinical settings.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown decreased pregnancy rates and early menopause in female cancer survivors; however, infertility rates and reproductive interventions have not been studied. We investigated infertility and time to pregnancy in female childhood cancer survivors, and analysed treatment characteristics associated with infertility and subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a cohort study including 5 year cancer survivors from 26 Canadian and US institutions who were younger than 21 years at the time of diagnosis between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986, and a sibling control group. We included women aged 18-39 years who had ever been sexually active. We gathered demographic, medical, and reproductive data via a baseline questionnaire, and quantified exposure to alkylating agents and radiation therapy. Self-reported infertility, medical treatment for infertility, time to first pregnancy in survivors and siblings, and the risk of infertility in survivors by demographic, disease, and treatment variables were analysed. FINDINGS: 3531 survivors and 1366 female sibling controls who enrolled between Nov 3, 1992, and April 4, 2004, were included. Compared with their siblings, survivors had an increased risk (relative risk [RR] 1<c2><b7>48 [95% CI 1<c2><b7>23-1<c2><b7>78]; p<0<c2><b7>0001) of clinical infertility (ie, >1 year of attempts at conception without success), which was most pronounced at early reproductive ages (RR 2<c2><b7>92 [95% CI 1<c2><b7>18-7<c2><b7>20], p=0<c2><b7>020, in participants <e2><89><a4>24 years; 1<c2><b7>61 [1<c2><b7>05-2<c2><b7>48], p=0<c2><b7>029, in those aged 25-29 years; and 1<c2><b7>37 [1<c2><b7>11-1<c2><b7>69], p=0<c2><b7>0035, in those aged 30-40 years). Despite being equally likely to seek treatment for infertility, survivors were less likely than were their siblings to be prescribed drugs for treatment of infertility (0<c2><b7>57 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>46-0<c2><b7>70], p<0<c2><b7>0001). Increasing doses of uterine radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy were strongly associated with infertility. Although survivors had an increased time to pregnancy compared with their siblings (p=0<c2><b7>032), 292 (64%) of 455 participants with self-reported clinical infertility achieved a pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: A more comprehensive understanding of infertility after cancer is crucial for counselling and decision making about future conception attempts and fertility preservation.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant! is a web-based program that calculates individualised 10-year survival probabilities and predicted benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy. The Adjuvant! model has not been validated in any large European series. The aim of our study was to validate Adjuvant! in Dutch patients, investigating both its calibration and discriminatory accuracy. METHODS: Patients who were at least partly treated at the Netherlands Cancer Institute for breast cancer between 1987 and 1998 were included if they met the following criteria: tumour size T1 (< or =2 cm), T2 (2-5 cm), or T3 (>5 cm), invasive breast carcinoma, with information about involvement of axillary lymph nodes available, no distant metastases, primary surgery, axillary staging, and radiotherapy according to national guidelines. Clinicopathological characteristics and adjuvant treatment data were retrieved from hospital records and medical registries and were entered into the Adjuvant! (version 8.0) batch processor with blinding to outcome. Endpoints were overall survival and the proportion of patients that did not die from breast cancer (breast-cancer-specific survival [BCSS]). FINDINGS: 5380 patients were included with median follow-up of 11.7 years (range 0.03-21.8). The 10-year observed overall survival (69.0%) and BCSS (78.6%) and Adjuvant! predicted overall survival (69.1%) and BCSS (77.8%) were not statistically different (p=0.87 and p=0.18, respectively). Moreover, differences between predicted and observed outcomes were within 2% for most relevant clinicopathological subgroups. In patients younger than 40 years, Adjuvant! overestimated overall survival by 4.2% (p=0.04) and BCSS by 4.7% (p=0.01). The concordance index, which indicates discriminatory accuracy at the individual level, was 0.71 for BCSS in the entire cohort.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Gene expression patterns can be used as prognostic biomarkers in various types of cancers. We aimed to identify a gene expression pattern for individual distant metastatic risk assessment in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort analysis, we included 937 patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma from three Chinese hospitals: the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China), the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University (Guilin, China), and the First People's Hospital of Foshan (Foshan, China). Using microarray analysis, we profiled mRNA gene expression between 24 paired locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumours from patients at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center with or without distant metastasis after radical treatment. Differentially expressed genes were examined using digital expression profiling in a training cohort (Guangzhou training cohort; n=410) to build a gene classifier using a penalised regression model. We validated the prognostic accuracy of this gene classifier in an internal validation cohort (Guangzhou internal validation cohort, n=204) and two external independent cohorts (Guilin cohort, n=165; Foshan cohort, n=158). The primary endpoint was distant metastasis-free survival. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival. FINDINGS: We identified 137 differentially expressed genes between metastatic and non-metastatic locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. A distant metastasis gene signature for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (DMGN) that consisted of 13 genes was generated to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4<c2><b7>93, 95% CI 2<c2><b7>99-8<c2><b7>16; p<0<c2><b7>0001), disease-free survival (HR 3<c2><b7>51, 2<c2><b7>43-5<c2><b7>07; p<0<c2><b7>0001), and overall survival (HR 3<c2><b7>22, 2<c2><b7>18-4<c2><b7>76; p<0<c2><b7>0001) than patients with low-risk scores. The prognostic accuracy of DMGN was validated in the internal and external cohorts. Furthermore, among patients with low-risk scores in the combined training and internal cohorts, concurrent chemotherapy improved distant metastasis-free survival compared with those patients who did not receive concurrent chemotherapy (HR 0<c2><b7>40, 95% CI 0<c2><b7>19-0<c2><b7>83; p=0<c2><b7>011), whereas patients with high-risk scores did not benefit from concurrent chemotherapy (HR 1<c2><b7>03, 0<c2><b7>71-1<c2><b7>50; p=0<c2><b7>876). This was also validated in the two external cohorts combined. We developed a nomogram based on the DMGN and other variables that predicted an individual's risk of distant metastasis, which was strengthened by adding Epstein-Barr virus DNA status. INTERPRETATION: The DMGN is a reliable prognostic tool for distant metastasis in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma and might be able to predict which patients benefit from concurrent chemotherapy. It has the potential to guide treatment decisions for patients at different risk of distant metastasis.

Michael and Loncaster, Juliette and Hatton, Matthew and Clarke, Jacqueline and Kunkler, Ian H. and Russell, Nicola S.",The Lancet. Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy radiotherapy in patients with four or more positive axillary nodes reduces breast cancer mortality, but its role in patients with one to three involved nodes is controversial. We assessed the effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy on quality of life (QOL) in women with intermediate-risk breast cancer. METHODS: SUPREMO is an open-label, international, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial. Women aged 18 years or older with intermediate-risk breast cancer (defined as pT1-2N1; pT3N0; or pT2N0 if also grade III or with lymphovascular invasion) who had undergone mastectomy and, if node positive, axillary surgery, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chest wall radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions or a radiobiologically equivalent dose of 45 Gy in 20 fractions or 40 Gy in 15 fractions) or no radiotherapy. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks of varying block length, and stratified by centre, without masking of patients or investigators. The primary endpoint is 10-year overall survival. Here, we present 2-year results of QOL (a prespecified secondary endpoint). The QOL substudy, open to all UK patients, consists of questionnaires (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23, Body Image Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], and EQ-5D-3L) completed before randomisation, and at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. The prespecified primary outcomes within this QOL substudy were global QOL, fatigue, physical function, chest wall symptoms, shoulder and arm symptoms, body image, and anxiety and depression. Data were analysed by intention to treat, using repeated mixed-effects methods. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61145589. FINDINGS: Between Aug 4, 2006, and April 29, 2013, 1688 patients were enrolled internationally and randomly assigned to receive chest wall radiotherapy (n=853) or not (n=835). 989 (79%) of 1258 patients from 111 UK centres consented to participate in the QOL substudy (487 in the radiotherapy group and 502 in the no radiotherapy group), of whom 947 (96%) returned the baseline questionnaires and were included in the analysis (radiotherapy, n=471; no radiotherapy, n=476). At up to 2 years, chest wall symptoms were worse in the radiotherapy group than in the no radiotherapy group (mean score 14<c2><b7>1 [SD 15<c2><b7>8] in the radiotherapy group vs 11<c2><b7>6 [14<c2><b7>6] in the no radiotherapy group; effect estimate 2<c2><b7>17, 95% CI 0<c2><b7>40-3<c2><b7>94; p=0<c2><b7>016); however, there was an improvement in both groups between years 1 and 2 (visit effect -1<c2><b7>34, 95% CI -2<c2><b7>36 to -0<c2><b7>31; p=0<c2><b7>010). No differences were seen between treatment groups in arm and shoulder symptoms, body image, fatigue, overall QOL, physical function, or anxiety or depression scores. INTERPRETATION: Postmastectomy radiotherapy led to more local (chest wall) symptoms up to 2 years postrandomisation compared with no radiotherapy, but the difference between groups was small. These data will inform shared decision making while we await survival (trial primary endpoint) results.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Clinical prognostic groupings for localised prostate cancers are imprecise, with 30-50% of patients recurring after image-guided radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. We aimed to test combined genomic and microenvironmental indices in prostate cancer to improve risk stratification and complement clinical prognostic factors. METHODS: We used DNA-based indices alone or in combination with intra-prostatic hypoxia measurements to develop four prognostic indices in 126 low-risk to intermediate-risk patients (Toronto cohort) who will receive image-guided radiotherapy. We validated these indices in two independent cohorts of 154 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center cohort [MSKCC] cohort) and 117 (Cambridge cohort) radical prostatectomy specimens from low-risk to high-risk patients. We applied unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to the copy-number profiles of 126 pre-image-guided radiotherapy diagnostic biopsies to develop prognostic signatures. Our primary endpoint was the development of a set of prognostic measures capable of stratifying patients for risk of biochemical relapse 5 years after primary treatment. FINDINGS: Biochemical relapse was associated with indices of tumour hypoxia, genomic instability, and genomic subtypes based on multivariate analyses. We identified four genomic subtypes for prostate cancer, which had different 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival. Genomic instability is prognostic for relapse in both image-guided radiotherapy (multivariate analysis hazard ratio [HR] 4<c2><b7>5 [95% CI 2<c2><b7>1-9<c2><b7>8]; p=0<c2><b7>00013; area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0<c2><b7>70 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>65-0<c2><b7>76]) and radical prostatectomy (4<c2><b7>0 [1<c2><b7>6-9<c2><b7>7]; p=0<c2><b7>0024; AUC 0<c2><b7>57 [0<c2><b7>52-0<c2><b7>61]) patients with prostate cancer, and its effect is magnified by intratumoral hypoxia (3<c2><b7>8 [1<c2><b7>2-12]; p=0<c2><b7>019; AUC 0<c2><b7>67 [0<c2><b7>61-0<c2><b7>73]). A novel 100-loci DNA signature accurately classified treatment outcome in the MSKCC low-risk to intermediate-risk cohort (multivariate analysis HR 6<c2><b7>1 [95% CI 2<c2><b7>0-19]; p=0<c2><b7>0015; AUC 0<c2><b7>74 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>65-0<c2><b7>83]). In the independent MSKCC and Cambridge cohorts, this signature identified low-risk to high-risk patients who were most likely to fail treatment within 18 months (combined cohorts multivariate analysis HR 2<c2><b7>9 [95% CI 1<c2><b7>4-6<c2><b7>0]; p=0<c2><b7>0039; AUC 0<c2><b7>68 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>63-0<c2><b7>73]), and was better at predicting biochemical relapse than 23 previously published RNA signatures. INTERPRETATION: This is the first study of cancer outcome to integrate DNA-based and microenvironment-based failure indices to predict patient outcome.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and requirements for a uniform protocol have been introduced to standardise assessment of MRI scans in both clinical trials and clinical practice. However, these criteria mainly rely on manual two-dimensional measurements of contrast-enhancing (CE) target lesions and thus restrict both reliability and accurate assessment of tumour burden and treatment response. We aimed to develop a framework relying on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for fully automated quantitative analysis of MRI in neuro-oncology to overcome the inherent limitations of manual assessment of tumour burden. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we compiled a single-institution dataset of MRI data from patients with brain tumours being treated at Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg, Germany; Heidelberg training dataset) to develop and train an ANN for automated identification and volumetric segmentation of CE tumours and non-enhancing T2-signal abnormalities (NEs) on MRI. Independent testing and large-scale application of the ANN for tumour segmentation was done in a single-institution longitudinal testing dataset from the Heidelberg University Hospital and in a multi-institutional longitudinal testing dataset from the prospective randomised phase 2 and 3 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-26101 trial (NCT01290939), acquired at 38 institutions across Europe. In both longitudinal datasets, spatial and temporal tumour volume dynamics were automatically quantified to calculate time to progression, which was compared with time to progression determined by RANO, both in terms of reliability and as a surrogate endpoint for predicting overall survival. We integrated this approach for fully automated quantitative analysis of MRI in neuro-oncology within an application-ready software infrastructure and applied it in a simulated clinical environment of patients with brain tumours from the Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg simulation dataset). FINDINGS: For training of the ANN, MRI data were collected from 455 patients with brain tumours (one MRI per patient) being treated at Heidelberg hospital between July 29, 2009, and March 17, 2017 (Heidelberg training dataset). For independent testing of the ANN, an independent longitudinal dataset of 40 patients, with data from 239 MRI scans, was collected at Heidelberg University Hospital in parallel with the training dataset (Heidelberg test dataset), and 2034 MRI scans from 532 patients at 34 institutions collected between Oct 26, 2011, and Dec 3, 2015, in the EORTC-26101 study were of sufficient quality to be included in the EORTC-26101 test dataset. The ANN yielded excellent performance for accurate detection and segmentation of CE tumours and NE volumes in both longitudinal test datasets (median DICE coefficient for CE tumours 0<c2><b7>89 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>86-0<c2><b7>90], and for NEs 0<c2><b7>93 [0<c2><b7>92-0<c2><b7>94] in the Heidelberg test dataset; CE tumours 0<c2><b7>91 [0<c2><b7>90-0<c2><b7>92], NEs 0<c2><b7>93 [0<c2><b7>93-0<c2><b7>94] in the EORTC-26101 test dataset). Time to progression from quantitative ANN-based assessment of tumour response was a significantly better surrogate endpoint than central RANO assessment for predicting overall survival in the EORTC-26101 test dataset (hazard ratios ANN 2<c2><b7>59 [95% CI 1<c2><b7>86-3<c2><b7>60] vs central RANO 2<c2><b7>07 [1<c2><b7>46-2<c2><b7>92]; p<0<c2><b7>0001) and also yielded a 36% margin over RANO (p<0<c2><b7>0001) when comparing reliability values (ie, agreement in the quantitative volumetrically defined time to progression [based on radiologist ground truth vs automated assessment with ANN] of 87% [266 of 306 with sufficient data] compared with 51% [155 of 306] with local vs independent central RANO assessment). In the Heidelberg simulation dataset, which comprised 466 patients with brain tumours, with 595 MRI scans obtained between April 27, and Sept 17, 2018, automated on-demand processing of MRI scans and quantitative tumour response assessment within the simulated clinical environment required 10 min of computation time (average per scan). INTERPRETATION: Overall, we found that ANN enabled objective and automated assessment of tumour response in neuro-oncology at high throughput and could ultimately serve as a blueprint for the application of ANN in radiology to improve clinical decision making. Future research should focus on prospective validation within clinical trials and application for automated high-throughput imaging biomarker discovery and extension to other diseases.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: Androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer who have relapsed with rising prostate-specific antigen concentration only (PSA-only relapse), or with non-curable but asymptomatic disease at diagnosis, could adversely affect quality of life at a time when the disease itself does not. We aimed to compare the effect of immediate versus delayed androgen-deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life over 5 years in men enrolled in the TOAD (Timing of Androgen Deprivation) trial. METHODS: This randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial done in 29 public and private cancer centres across Australia, New Zealand, and Canada compared immediate with delayed androgen-deprivation therapy in men with PSA-only relapse after definitive treatment, or de-novo non-curable disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a database-embedded, dynamically balanced algorithm to immediate androgen-deprivation therapy (immediate therapy group) or to delayed androgen-deprivation therapy (delayed therapy group). Any type of androgen-deprivation therapy was permitted, as were intermittent or continuous schedules. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and PR25 were completed before randomisation, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for a further 3 years. The primary outcome of the trial, reported previously, was overall survival, with global health-related quality of life at 2 years as a secondary endpoint. Here we report prespecified secondary objectives of the quality-of-life endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. Statistical significance was set at p=0<c2><b7>0036. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12606000301561, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00110162. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2004, and July 13, 2012, 293 men were recruited and randomly assigned; 151 to the delayed therapy group and 142 to the immediate therapy group. There was no difference between the two groups in global health-related quality of life over 2 years from randomisation. There were no statistically significant differences in global quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, or emotional functioning, fatigue, dyspnoea, insomnia, or feeling less masculine over the entire 5 years after randomisation. Sexual activity was lower in the immediate therapy group than in the delayed group at 6 and 12 months (at 6 months mean score 29<c2><b7>20 [95% CI 24<c2><b7>59-33<c2><b7>80] in the delayed group vs 10<c2><b7>40 [6<c2><b7>87-13<c2><b7>93] in the immediate group, difference 18<c2><b7>80 [95% CI 13<c2><b7>00-24<c2><b7>59], p<0<c2><b7>0001; at 12 months 28<c2><b7>63 [24<c2><b7>07-33<c2><b7>18] vs 13<c2><b7>76 [9<c2><b7>94-17<c2><b7>59], 14<c2><b7>86 [8<c2><b7>95-20<c2><b7>78], p<0<c2><b7>0001), with the differences exceeding the clinically significant threshold of 10 points until beyond 2 years. The immediate therapy group also had more hormone-treatment-related symptoms at 6 and 12 months (at 6 months mean score 8<c2><b7>48 [95% CI 6<c2><b7>89-10<c2><b7>07] in the delayed group vs 15<c2><b7>97 [13<c2><b7>92-18<c2><b7>02] in the immediate group, difference -7<c2><b7>49 [-10<c2><b7>06 to -4<c2><b7>93], p<0<c2><b7>0001; at 12 months 9<c2><b7>32 [7<c2><b7>59-11<c2><b7>05] vs 17<c2><b7>07 [14<c2><b7>75-19<c2><b7>39], -7<c2><b7>75 [-10<c2><b7>62 to -4<c2><b7>89], p<0<c2><b7>0001), but with differences below the threshold of clinical significance. For the individual symptoms, hot flushes were clinically significantly higher in the immediate group (adjusted proportion 0<c2><b7>31 for delayed therapy vs 0<c2><b7>55 for immediate therapy, adjusted odds ratio 2<c2><b7>87 [1<c2><b7>96-4<c2><b7>21], p<0<c2><b7>0001) over the 5-year period, as were nipple or breast symptoms (0<c2><b7>06 vs 0<c2><b7>14, 2<c2><b7>64 [1<c2><b7>61-4<c2><b7>34], p=0<c2><b7>00013). INTERPRETATION: Immediate use of androgen-deprivation therapy was associated with early detriments in specific hormone-treatment-related symptoms, but with no other demonstrable effect on overall functioning or health-related quality of life. This evidence can be used to help decision making about treatment initiation for men at this disease stage.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial evaluating tumour bed boost and hypofractionation in patients with non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ following breast-conserving surgery and whole breast radiotherapy. Here, we report the effects of diagnosis and treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 2 years. METHODS: The BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 trial is ongoing at 118 hospitals in 11 countries. Women aged 18 years or older with completely excised non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned, by use of a minimisation algorithm, to tumour bed boost or no tumour bed boost, following conventional whole breast radiotherapy or hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using one of three randomisation categories. Category A was a 4-arm randomisation of tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) versus hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (42<c2><b7>5 Gy in 16 fractions over 3<c2><b7>5 weeks). Category B was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy, and category C was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. Stratification factors were age at diagnosis, planned endocrine therapy, and treating centre. The primary endpoint, time to local recurrence, will be reported when participants have completed 5 years of follow-up. The HRQOL statistical analysis plan prespecified eight aspects of HRQOL, assessed by four questionnaires at baseline, end of treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after radiotherapy: fatigue and physical functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30); cosmetic status, breast-specific symptoms, arm and shoulder functional status (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale); body image and sexuality (Body Image Scale); and perceived risk of invasive breast cancer (Cancer Worry Scale and a study-specific question). For each of these measures, tumour bed boost was compared with no boost, and conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy, by use of generalised estimating equation models. Analyses were by intention to treat, with Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00470236. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2007, and Aug 14, 2013, 1208 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive no tumour bed boost (n=605) or tumour bed boost (n=603). 396 of 1208 women were assigned to category A: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=100) or no boost (n=98), or to hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=98) or no boost (n=100). 447 were assigned to category B: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=223) or no boost (n=224). 365 were assigned to category C: hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=182) or no boost (n=183). All patients were followed up at 2 years for the HRQOL analysis. 1098 (91%) of 1208 patients received their allocated treatment, and most completed their scheduled HRQOL assessments (1147 [95%] of 1208 at baseline; 988 [87%] of 1141 at 2 years). Cosmetic status was worse with tumour bed boost than with no boost across all timepoints (difference 0<c2><b7>10 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>05-0<c2><b7>15], global p=0<c2><b7>00014, Hochberg-adjusted p=0<c2><b7>0016); at the end of treatment, the estimated difference between tumour bed boost and no boost was 0<c2><b7>13 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>06-0<c2><b7>20; p=0<c2><b7>00021), persisting at 24 months (0<c2><b7>13 [0<c2><b7>06-0<c2><b7>20]; p=0<c2><b7>00021). Arm and shoulder function was also adversely affected by tumour bed boost across all timepoints (0<c2><b7>08 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>03-0<c2><b7>13], global p=0<c2><b7>0033, Hochberg adjusted p=0<c2><b7>045); the difference between tumour bed boost and no boost at the end of treatment was 0<c2><b7>08 (0<c2><b7>01 to 0<c2><b7>15, p=0<c2><b7>021), and did not persist at 24 months (0<c2><b7>04 [-0<c2><b7>03 to 0<c2><b7>11], p=0<c2><b7>29). None of the other six prespecified aspects of HRQOL differed significantly after adjustment for multiple testing. Conventional whole breast radiotherapy was associated with worse body image than hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy at the end of treatment (difference -1<c2><b7>10 [95% CI -1<c2><b7>79 to -0<c2><b7>42], p=0<c2><b7>0016). No significant differences were reported in the other PROs between conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Tumour bed boost was associated with persistent adverse effects on cosmetic status and arm and shoulder functional status, which might inform shared decision making while local recurrence analysis is pending.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: The PORTEC-3 trial investigated the benefit of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus pelvic radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. We updated the analysis to investigate patterns of recurrence and did a post-hoc survival analysis. METHODS: In the multicentre randomised phase 3 PORTEC-3 trial, women with high-risk endometrial cancer were eligible if they had International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage I, endometrioid grade 3 cancer with deep myometrial invasion or lymphovascular space invasion, or both; stage II or III disease; or stage I-III disease with serous or clear cell histology; were aged 18 years and older; and had a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive radiotherapy alone (48<c2><b7>6 Gy in 1<c2><b7>8 Gy fractions given on 5 days per week) or chemoradiotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) given intravenously during radiotherapy, followed by four cycles of carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) given intravenously), by use of a biased coin minimisation procedure with stratification for participating centre, lymphadenectomy, stage, and histological type. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and failure-free survival. Secondary endpoints of vaginal, pelvic, and distant recurrence were analysed according to the first site of recurrence. Survival endpoints were analysed by intention-to-treat, and adjusted for stratification factors. Competing risk methods were used for failure-free survival and recurrence. We did a post-hoc analysis to analyse patterns of recurrence with 1 additional year of follow-up. The study was closed on Dec 20, 2013; follow-up is ongoing. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14387080, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00411138. FINDINGS: Between Nov 23, 2006, and Dec 20, 2013, 686 women were enrolled, of whom 660 were eligible and evaluable (330 in the chemoradiotherapy group, and 330 in the radiotherapy-alone group). At a median follow-up of 72<c2><b7>6 months (IQR 59<c2><b7>9-85<c2><b7>6), 5-year overall survival was 81<c2><b7>4% (95% CI 77<c2><b7>2-85<c2><b7>8) with chemoradiotherapy versus 76<c2><b7>1% (71<c2><b7>6-80<c2><b7>9) with radiotherapy alone (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0<c2><b7>70 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>51-0<c2><b7>97], p=0<c2><b7>034), and 5-year failure-free survival was 76<c2><b7>5% (95% CI 71<c2><b7>5-80<c2><b7>7) versus 69<c2><b7>1% (63<c2><b7>8-73<c2><b7>8; HR 0<c2><b7>70 [0<c2><b7>52-0<c2><b7>94], p=0<c2><b7>016). Distant metastases were the first site of recurrence in most patients with a relapse, occurring in 78 of 330 women (5-year probability 21<c2><b7>4%; 95% CI 17<c2><b7>3-26<c2><b7>3) in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 98 of 330 (5-year probability 29<c2><b7>1%; 24<c2><b7>4-34<c2><b7>3) in the radiotherapy-alone group (HR 0<c2><b7>74 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>55-0<c2><b7>99]; p=0<c2><b7>047). Isolated vaginal recurrence was the first site of recurrence in one patient (0<c2><b7>3%; 95% CI 0<c2><b7>0-2<c2><b7>1) in both groups (HR 0<c2><b7>99 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>06-15<c2><b7>90]; p=0<c2><b7>99), and isolated pelvic recurrence was the first site of recurrence in three women (0<c2><b7>9% [95% CI 0<c2><b7>3-2<c2><b7>8]) in the chemoradiotherapy group versus four (0<c2><b7>9% [95% CI 0<c2><b7>3-2<c2><b7>8]) in the radiotherapy-alone group (HR 0<c2><b7>75 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>17-3<c2><b7>33]; p=0<c2><b7>71). At 5 years, only one grade 4 adverse event (ileus or obstruction) was reported (in the chemoradiotherapy group). At 5 years, reported grade 3 adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, occurring in 16 (8%) of 201 women in the chemoradiotherapy group versus ten (5%) of 187 in the radiotherapy-alone group (p=0<c2><b7>24). The most common grade 3 adverse event was hypertension (in four [2%] women in both groups). At 5 years, grade 2 or worse adverse events were reported in 76 (38%) of 201 women in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 43 (23%) of 187 in the radiotherapy-alone group (p=0<c2><b7>002). Sensory neuropathy persisted more often after chemoradiotherapy than after radiotherapy alone, with 5-year rates of grade 2 or worse neuropathy of 6% (13 of 201 women) versus 0% (0 of 187). No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: This updated analysis shows significantly improved overall survival and failure-free survival with chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. This treatment schedule should be discussed and recommended, especially for women with stage III or serous cancers, or both, as part of shared decision making between doctors and patients. Follow-up is ongoing to evaluate long-term survival.
