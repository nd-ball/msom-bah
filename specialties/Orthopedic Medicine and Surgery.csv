Failure to do so risks delays in care, increased morbidity, and further economic burden. Because few arthroplasty experts can confidently classify implants using plain radiographs, automated image processing using deep learning for implant identification may offer an opportunity to improve the value of care rendered. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning system to classify total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing arthroplasty femoral implants as one of 18 different manufacturer models from 1972 retrospectively collected anterior-posterior (AP) plain radiographs from 4 sites in one quaternary referral health system.

Performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared with a reference standard of implant model from operative reports with implant serial numbers. RESULTS: The training and validation data sets from 1715 patients and 1766 AP radiographs included 18 different femoral components across four leading implant manufacturers and 10 fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons.

Deep learning permits automated image processing to mitigate the challenges behind expeditious, cost-effective preoperative planning. Our aim was to investigate whether a deep-learning algorithm could accurately identify the manufacturer and model of arthroplasty implants about the knee from plain radiographs. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning algorithm to classify knee arthroplasty implants from one of 9 different implant models from retrospectively collected anterior-posterior (AP) plain radiographs from four sites in one quaternary referral health system.

The purpose of the current study is to develop machine learning algorithms to predict dissatisfaction after TKA. METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive TKA patients between 2014 and 2016 from 1 large academic and 2 community hospitals was performed. Preoperative variables considered for prediction included demographics, medical history, flexion contracture, knee flexion, and outcome scores (patient-reported health state, Knee Society Score [KSS], and KSS-Function [KSS-F]). Recursive feature elimination was used to select features that optimized algorithm performance. Five supervised machine learning algorithms were developed by training with 10-fold cross-validation 3 times. These algorithms were subsequently applied to an independent testing set of patients and assessed by discrimination, calibration, Brier score, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 430 patients, a total of 40 (9.0%) were dissatisfied with their outcome after primary TKA at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. The random forest algorithm achieved the best performance in the independent testing set not used for algorithm development (c-statistic: 0.77, calibration intercept: 0.087, calibration slope: 0.74, Brier score: 0.082). The most important factors for predicting dissatisfaction were age, number of medical comorbidities, presence of one or more drug allergies, preoperative patient-reported health state score, and preoperative KSS.

Predictive models for clinically meaningful outcomes in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) are unknown. PURPOSE: To apply a machine learning model to determine preoperative variables predictive for achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) at 2 years after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were analyzed for patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for FAIS by a high-volume fellowship-trained surgeon between January 2012 and July 2016. The MCID cutoffs for the Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), HOS-Sport Specific (HOS-SS), and modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) were 9.8, 14.4, and 9.14, respectively. Predictive models for achieving the MCID with respect to each were built with the LASSO algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for feature selection, followed by logistic regression on the selected features. Study data were analyzed with PatientIQ, a cloud-based research and analytics platform for health care. RESULTS: Of 1103 patients who met inclusion criteria, 898 (81.4%) had a minimum of 2-year reported outcomes and were entered into the modeling algorithm. A total of 74.0%, 73.5%, and 79.9% met the HOS-ADL, HOS-SS, and mHHS threshold scores for achieving the MCID. Predictors of not achieving the HOS-ADL MCID included anxiety/depression, symptom duration for >2 years before surgery, higher body mass index, high preoperative HOS-ADL score, and preoperative hip injection (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the HOS-SS MCID included anxiety/depression, preoperative symptom duration for >2 years, high preoperative HOS-SS score, and preoperative hip injection, while running at least at the recreational level was a predictor of achieving HOS-SS MCID (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the mHHS MCID included history of anxiety or depression, high preoperative mHHS score, and hip injections, while being female was predictive of achieving the MCID (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study identified predictive variables for achieving clinically meaningful outcome after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. Patient factors including anxiety/depression, symptom duration >2 years, preoperative intra-articular injection, and high preoperative outcome scores are most consistently predictive of inability to achieve clinically meaningful outcome.

The objective of this study is to (1) develop and validate a machine learning algorithm using preoperative big data to predict length of stay (LOS) and patient-specific inpatient payments after primary THA and (2) propose a risk-adjusted patient-specific payment model (PSPM) that considers patient comorbidity. METHODS: Using an administrative database, we applied 122,334 patients undergoing primary THA for osteoarthritis between 2012 and 16 to a naive Bayesian model trained to forecast LOS and payments. Performance was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and percent accuracy. Inpatient payments were grouped as <$12,000, $12,000-$24,000, and >$24,000. LOS was grouped as 1-2, 3-5, and 6+ days. Payment model uncertainty was applied to a proposed risk-based PSPM.

Matthew and Kamath, Atul F. and Schaffer, Jonathan L. and Krebs, Viktor E. and Ramkumar, Prem N.",The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in machine learning have given rise to deep learning, which uses hierarchical layers to build models, offering the ability to advance value-based healthcare by better predicting patient outcomes and costs of a given treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of 2 common deep learning models, traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the newer dense neural network (DenseNet), in predicting outcomes for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as a foundation for future musculoskeletal studies seeking to utilize machine learning. METHODS: Using 295,605 patients undergoing primary THA and TKA from a New York State inpatient administrative database from 2009 to 2016, 2 neural network designs (MLP vs DenseNet) with different model regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization, and DeCovLoss) were applied to compare model performance on predicting inpatient procedural cost using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Models were implemented to identify high-cost surgical cases. RESULTS: DenseNet performed similarly to or better than MLP across the different regularization techniques in predicting procedural costs of THA and TKA. Applying regularization to DenseNet resulted in a significantly higher AUC as compared to DenseNet alone (0.813 vs 0.792, P = .011). When regularization methods were applied to MLP, the AUC was significantly lower than without regularization (0.621 vs 0.791, P = 1.1 * 10(-15)). When the optimal MLP and DenseNet models were compared in a head-to-head fashion, they performed similarly at cost prediction (P > .999). CONCLUSION: This study establishes that in predicting costs of lower extremity arthroplasty, DenseNet models improve in performance with regularization, whereas simple neural network models perform significantly worse without regularization. In light of the resource-intensive nature of creating and testing deep learning models for orthopedic surgery, particularly for value-centric procedures such as arthroplasty, this study establishes a set of key technical features that resulted in better prediction of inpatient surgical costs. We demonstrated that regularization is critically important for neural networks in arthroplasty cost prediction and that future studies should utilize these deep learning techniques to predict arthroplasty costs.

High-quality studies with long-term follow-up are lacking, and evidence to support decision making is limited. PURPOSE: To evaluate functional and patient-reported outcome, surgical history, and complications among young adults who sustained an ACL injury before the age of 13 years and were treated with active rehabilitation and the option of delayed ACL reconstruction if needed. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Forty-six children aged <13 years with a total intrasubstance ACL injury were included. None of these patients had additional injuries that warranted early surgery. At final follow-up at a mean 8 years after the time of injury, 44 patients remained in the study. The same test battery was conducted at baseline, 1 and 2 years, and final follow-up at approximately 18 years of age. The test battery included functional tests (hop tests and isokinetic muscle strength tests of quadriceps and hamstrings), patient-reported outcome measures (including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form), and clinical examination. Medical records were reviewed to assess surgical history and complications. RESULTS: At a mean 8 years of follow-up, 24 patients (55%) had undergone ACL reconstruction, and 16 (36%) had undergone meniscal surgery. Quadriceps muscle strength symmetry was >90% for 30 patients (68%). Mean leg symmetry indexes for hop and strength tests were consistently >90%, except for the single-hop test and hamstrings muscle strength for ACL-reconstructed knees. Mean <c2><b1> SD International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 86.3 <c2><b1> 13.7 for the ACL-reconstructed knees and 90.6 <c2><b1> 11.8 for the nonreconstructed knees. At final follow-up, forty patients (91%) remained active in sports, but 29 (66%) restricted their activity level to nonpivoting sports.

Jr and Colosimo, Angelo and Hewett, Timothy E.",The American journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND: Release for full activity and return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often dictated by time from surgery and subjective opinion by the medical team. Temporal guidelines for return to sport may not accurately identify impaired strength and neuromuscular control, which are associated with increased risk for second injury (contralateral and/or ipsilateral limb) after ACLR in athletes. HYPOTHESES: Athletes undergoing ACLR and returning to sport would demonstrate functional deficits that would not be associated with time from surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Thirty-three male (n = 10) and female (n = 23) athletes with unilateral ACLR, who were cleared by a physician to return to their sport after surgery and rehabilitation, performed the single-legged vertical hop test for 10 seconds on a portable force plate. Matched teammates of each patient were recruited to serve as sex-, sport-, and age-matched controls (CTRL; n = 67). Maximum vertical ground-reaction force (VGRF) was measured during each single-limb landing. Single-limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated as the ratio of the involved divided by uninvolved limb, expressed as a percentage. RESULTS: The single-limb vertical jump height LSI was reduced in the ACLR group, 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83%-95%), compared with the matched CTRL group, 101% (95% CI, 96%-105%; P < .01). The LSI for VGRF normalized to potential energy achieved during flight of the hop was increased in ACLR at 112% (95% CI, 106%-117%) relative to the CTRL group at 102% (95% CI, 98%-106%; P < .01). Linear regression analysis indicated that time from surgery was not associated with limb symmetry deficits in the ACLR group (P > .05; R (2) = .002-.01). CONCLUSION: Deficits in unilateral force development (vertical jump height) and absorption (normalized VGRF) persist in an athlete's single-limb performance after ACLR and full return to sports. These symmetry deficits appear to be independent of time after reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of these results, clinicians should consider assessment of single-limb power performance in the decision-making process for return-to-sport release. Persistent side-to-side asymmetries may increase the risk of contralateral and/or ipsilateral injury.",2012,10.1177/0363546512454656,40,10,2256-2263,eng,1552-3365 0363-5465,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Time Factors and Recovery of Function and *Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and *Athletic Performance and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries and Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*surgery and Athletic Injuries/*rehabilitation/surgery and Knee Injuries/*rehabilitation/surgery,NA,NA,2012/10//undefined,Am J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Google compiles frequently asked questions associated with a search term using machine learning and natural language processing. Links to individual websites are provided to answer each question. Analysis of this data may help improve understanding of patient concerns and inform more effective counseling. METHODS: Search terms were entered into Google for total hip and total knee arthroplasty. Frequently asked questions and associated websites were extracted to a database using customized software. Questions were categorized by topic; websites were categorized by type. JAMA Benchmark Criteria were used to assess website quality. Pearson's chi-squared and Student's t-tests were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 620 questions (305 total knee arthroplasties, 315 total hip arthroplasties) were extracted with 602 associated websites.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis is increasing in the aging U.S. POPULATION: The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis are debated. In this study, we assessed the utilization and costs of HA injections in the 12 months preceding total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and evaluated the usage of HA injections in end-stage knee osteoarthritis management in relation to other treatments. METHODS: MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits databases (Truven Health Analytics) were reviewed to identify patients who underwent TKA from 2005 to 2012. The utilization of patient-specific osteoarthritis-related health care (including medications, corticosteroid injections, HA injections, imaging, and office visits) and payment information were analyzed for the 12 months preceding TKA. RESULTS: A total of 244,059 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 35,935 (14.7%) had <e2><89><a5>1 HA injection in the 12 months preceding TKA. HA injections were responsible for 16.4% of all knee osteoarthritis-related payments, trailing only imaging studies (18.2%), and HA injections accounted for 25.2% of treatment-specific payments, a rate that was higher than that of any other treatment. Patients receiving HA injections were significantly more likely to receive additional knee osteoarthritis-related treatments compared with patients who did not receive HA injections. CONCLUSIONS: Despite numerous studies questioning the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of HA injections for osteoarthritis of the knee, HA injections are still utilized for a substantial percentage of patients. Given the paucity of data supporting the effectiveness of HA injections and the current cost-conscious health-care climate, decreasing their use among patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis may represent a substantial cost reduction that likely does not adversely impact the quality of care.",2016,10.2106/JBJS.15.01358,98,17,1429-1435,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,"United States and Medicare and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Health Care Costs and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Knee Joint/surgery and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/economics and Hyaluronic Acid/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use and Injections, Intra-Articular/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Osteoarthritis, Knee/*drug therapy/economics and Viscosupplements/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use",NA,NA,2016/09/07/,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patient perception of their health state is one component of such risk. The purpose of the current study is to develop machine learning algorithms to predict CSO for the patient-reported health state (PRHS) and build a clinical decision-making tool based on risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective review of primary THA patients between 2014 and 2017 was performed. Variables considered for prediction included demographics, medical history, preoperative PRHS, and modified Harris Hip Score. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the PRHS was calculated using a distribution-based method. Five supervised machine learning algorithms were developed and assessed by discrimination, calibration, Brier score, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 616 patients, a total of 407 (69.2%) achieved the MCID for the PRHS. The random forest algorithm achieved the best performance in the independent testing set not used for algorithm development (c-statistic 0.97, calibration intercept -0.05, calibration slope 1.45, Brier score 0.054). The most important factors for achieving the MCID were preoperative PRHS, preoperative opioid use, age, and body mass index. Individual patient-level explanations were provided for the algorithm predictions and the algorithms were incorporated into an open access digital application available here: https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/THA_PRHS_mcid/.

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of combining machine learning (ML) with PGHD in TJA to predict patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). METHODS: Twenty-two TJA patients were recruited for this pilot study. Three activity trackers collected 35 features from 4 weeks before to 6 weeks following surgery. PROMs were collected at both endpoints (Hip and Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey Physical Component Score). We used ML to identify features with the highest correlation with PROMs. The algorithm trained on a subset of patients and used 3 feature sets (A, B, and C) to group the rest into one of the 3 PROM clusters. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study and collected 3 million data points. Three sets of features with the highest R(2) values relative to PROMs were selected (A, B and C). Data collected through the 11th day had the highest predictive value. The ML algorithm grouped patients into 3 clusters predictive of 6-week PROM results, yielding total sum of squares values ranging from 3.86 (A) to 1.86 (C).

Integration of wearable sensors into existing fall risk assessment tools enables objective data collection that describes the functional ability of patients. In this study, supervised machine learning was applied to sensor-derived metrics to predict the fall risk of patients following total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: At preoperative, 2-week, and 6-week postoperative appointments, patients (n = 72) were instrumented with sensors while they performed the timed-up-and-go walking test. Preoperative and 2-week postoperative data were used to form the feature sets and 6-week total times were used as labels. Support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis classifier models were developed and tested on various combinations of feature sets and feature reduction schemes. Using a 10-fold leave-some-subjects-out testing scheme, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) were evaluated for all models. RESULTS: A high performance model (accuracy = 0.87, sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.46, AUC = 0.82) was obtained with a support vector machine classifier using sensor-derived metrics from only the preoperative appointment. An overall improved performance (accuracy = 0.90, sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.59, AUC = 0.88) was achieved with a linear discriminant analysis classifier when 2-week postoperative data were added to the preoperative data.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty is a growing concern, as the demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) expands annually. Although 2-stage revision is considered the gold standard in management, there is substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this strategy. One-stage revision is associated with lower mortality rates and better quality of life, and there has been increased interest in utilizing the 1-stage strategy. However, surgeons are faced with a difficult decision regarding which strategy to use to treat these infections, considering uncertainty with respect to eradication of infection, quality of life, and societal costs with each strategy. The purpose of the current study was to use decision analysis to determine the optimal decision for the management of PJI following TKA. METHODS: An expected-value decision tree was constructed to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs associated with 1-stage and 2-stage revision. Two decision trees were created: Decision Tree 1 was constructed for all pathogens, and Decision Tree 2 was constructed solely for difficult-to-treat infections, including methicillin-resistant infections. Values for parameters in the decision model, such as mortality rate, reinfection rate, and need for additional surgeries, were derived from the literature. Medical costs were derived from Medicare data. Sensitivity analysis determined which parameters in the decision model had the most influence on the optimal strategy. RESULTS: In both decision trees, the 1-stage strategy produced greater health utility while also being more cost-effective. In the Monte Carlo simulation for Decision Trees 1 and 2, 1-stage was the dominant strategy in about 85% and 69% of the trials, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the reinfection and 1-year mortality rates were the most sensitive parameters influencing the optimal decision. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 2-stage revision being considered the current gold standard for infection eradication in patients with PJI following TKA, the optimal decision that produced the highest quality of life was 1-stage revision. These results should be considered in shared decision-making with patients who experience PJI following TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level IV.

A Validation Study of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Monitor Adverse Events in a High-Volume, Nonacademic Setting","Van de Meulebroucke, Casper and Beckers, Joris and Corten, Kristoff",The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Quality monitoring is increasingly important to support and assure sustainability of the orthopedic practice. Surgeons in nonacademic settings often lack resources to accurately monitor quality of care. Widespread use of electronic medical records (EMR) provides easier access to medical information, facilitating its analysis. However, manual review of EMRs is highly inefficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) software allows for the development of algorithms for extracting relevant complications from EMRs. We hypothesized that an AI-supported algorithm for complication data extraction would have an accuracy level equal to or higher than manual review after total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: A total of 532 consecutive patients underwent 613 THA between January 1 and December 31, 2017. A random derivation cohort (100 patients, 115 hips) was used to determine accuracy. After generation of a gold standard, the algorithm was compared to manual extraction to validate performance in raw data extraction. The full cohort (532 patients, 613 hips) was used to determine recall, precision, and F-value. RESULTS: AI accuracy was 95.0%, compared to 94.5% for manual review (P = .69). Recall of 96.0% (84.0%-100%), precision of 88.0% (33%-100%) and F-measure of 0.85 (0.5-1) was achieved for all adverse events. No adverse events were recorded in 80.6%, 1.3% required reintervention and 18.1% had ""transient"" events. CONCLUSION: The use of an automated, AI-supported search algorithm for EMRs provided continuous feedback on the quality of care with a performance level comparable to manual data extraction, but with greater speed.

There was substantial agreement between the ACP and surgeon for both hip (kappa = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76) and knee (kappa = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.88). Positive agreement was very high for discharge and routine follow-up; however the ACP was more likely to select annual monitoring and the surgeon urgent review. DISCUSSION: Review of the questionnaire/radiograph together identified all patients in need of increased surveillance, with good agreement for on-going patient management. However, review of the radiograph or questionnaire alone missed some patients with potential problems. A radiograph in conjunction with a questionnaire as a review may represent a cost effective THA/TKA follow-up mechanism.

S. and Kuo, Alfred C. and Bowe, Thomas R. and Manfredi, Luisa and Lalani, Narlina F. and Giori, Nicholas J.",The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 15%-20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients do not experience clinically meaningful improvements. We sought to compare the accuracy and parsimony of several machine learning strategies for developing predictive models of failing to experience minimal clinically important differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 1 year after TKA. METHODS: Patients (N = 587) in 3 large Veteran Health Administration facilities completed PROMs before and 1 year after TKA (92% follow-up). Preoperative PROMs and electronic health record data were used to develop and validate models to predict failing to experience at least a minimal clinically important difference in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Total, KOOS JR, and KOOS subscales (Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Quality of Life, and recreation). Several machine learning strategies were used for model development. Ten-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping were used to produce measures of overall accuracy (C-statistic, Brier Score). The sensitivity and specificity of various predicted probability cut-points were examined. RESULTS: The most accurate models produced were for the Activities of Daily Living, Pain, Symptoms, and Quality of Life subscales of the KOOS (C-statistics 0.76, 0.72, 0.72, and 0.71, respectively). Strategies varied substantially in terms of the numbers of inputs required to achieve similar accuracy, with none being superior for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Models produced in this project provide estimates of patient-specific improvements in major outcomes 1 year after TKA. Integrating these models into clinical decision support, informed consent and shared decision making could improve patient selection, education, and satisfaction.

The purpose of this study is to develop machine learning algorithms for preoperative prediction of prolonged opioid prescriptions after THA. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic health records was conducted at 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals to identify adult patients who underwent THA for osteoarthritis between January 1, 2000 and August 1, 2018. Prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions were defined as continuous opioid prescriptions after surgery to at least 90 days after surgery. Five machine learning algorithms were developed to predict this outcome and were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 5507 patients underwent THA, of which 345 (6.3%) had prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions. The factors determined for prediction of prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions were age, duration of opioid exposure, preoperative hemoglobin, and preoperative medications (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-2-agonists). The elastic-net penalized logistic regression model achieved the best performance across discrimination (c-statistic = 0.77), calibration, and decision curve analysis. This model was incorporated into a digital application able to provide both predictions and explanations (available at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/thaopioid/). CONCLUSION: If externally validated in independent populations, the algorithms developed in this study could improve preoperative screening and support for THA patients at high risk for prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions. Early identification and intervention in high-risk cases may mitigate the long-term adverse consequence of opioid dependence.

Shah_2020_Tb.jj,JOUR,Data for registry and quality review can be retrospectively collected using natural language processing from unstructured charts of arthroplasty patients,"Shah, Romil F. and Bini, Stefano and Vail, Thomas",The bone & joint journal,"AIMS: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an automated method to extract data from unstructured free text fields for arthroplasty registry participation. Our objective was to investigate how accurately NLP can be used to extract structured clinical data from unstructured clinical notes when compared with manual data extraction. METHODS: A group of 1,000 randomly selected clinical and hospital notes from eight different surgeons were collected for patients undergoing primary arthroplasty between 2012 and 2018. In all, 19 preoperative, 17 operative, and two postoperative variables of interest were manually extracted from these notes. A NLP algorithm was created to automatically extract these variables from a training sample of these notes, and the algorithm was tested on a random test sample of notes. Performance of the NLP algorithm was measured in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) by calculating the accuracy of the variables collected, the ability of the algorithm to collect the correct information when it was indeed in the note (sensitivity), and the ability of the algorithm to not collect a certain data element when it was not in the note (specificity). RESULTS: The NLP algorithm performed well at extracting variables from unstructured data in our random test dataset (accuracy = 96.3%, sensitivity = 95.2%, and specificity = 97.4%). It performed better at extracting data that were in a structured, templated format such as range of movement (ROM) (accuracy = 98%) and implant brand (accuracy = 98%) than data that were entered with variation depending on the author of the note such as the presence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (accuracy = 90%). CONCLUSION: The NLP algorithm used in this study was able to identify a subset of variables from randomly selected unstructured notes in arthroplasty with an accuracy above 90%. For some variables, such as objective exam data, the accuracy was very high. Our findings suggest that automated algorithms using NLP can help orthopaedic practices retrospectively collect information for registries and quality improvement (QI) efforts.

Traditionally accomplished through office assessments and surveys with variable follow-up, this strategy lacks continuous and complete data. The primary objective of this study was to validate the feasibility of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) system in terms of the frequency of data interruptions and patient acceptance. Second, we report pilot data for (1) mobility; (2) knee range of motion, (3) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs); (4) opioid use; and (5) home exercise program (HEP) compliance. METHODS: A pilot cohort of 25 patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis was enrolled. Patients downloaded the RPM mobile application preoperatively to collect baseline activity and PROMs data, and the wearable knee sleeve was paired to the smartphone during admission. The following was collected up to 3 months postoperatively: mobility (step count), range of motion, PROMs, opioid consumption, and HEP compliance. Validation was determined by acquisition of continuous data and patient tolerance at semistructured interviews 3 months after operation. RESULTS: Of the 25 enrolled patients, 100% had uninterrupted passive data collection. Of the 22 available for follow-up interviews, all found the system motivating and engaging. Mean mobility returned to baseline within 6 weeks and exceeded preoperative baseline by 30% at 3 months. Mean knee flexion achieved was 119<c2><b0>, which did not differ from clinic measurements (P = .31). Mean KOOS improvement was 39.3 after 3 months (range: 3-60). Opioid use typically stopped by postoperative day 5. HEP compliance was 62% (range: 0%-99%). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we established the ability to remotely acquire continuous data for patients undergoing TKA, who found the application to be engaging. RPM offers the newfound ability to more completely evaluate the patients undergoing TKA in terms of mobility and rehabilitation compliance.

British volume,"Surgical decision-making in lumbar spinal stenosis involves assessment of clinical parameters and the severity of the radiological stenosis. We suspected that surgeons based surgical decisions more on dural sac cross-sectional area (DSCA) than on the morphology of the dural sac. We carried out a survey among members of three European spine societies. The axial T2-weighted MR images from ten patients with varying degrees of DSCA and morphological grades according to the recently described morphological classification of lumbar spinal stenosis, with DSCA values disclosed in half the assessed images, were used for evaluation. We provided a clinical scenario to accompany the images, which were shown to 142 responding physicians, mainly orthopaedic surgeons but also some neurosurgeons and others directly involved in treating patients with spinal disorders. As the primary outcome we used the number of respondents who would proceed to surgery for a given DSCA or morphological grade. Substantial agreement among the respondents was observed, with severe or extreme stenosis as defined by the morphological grade leading to surgery. This decision was not dependent on the number of years in practice, medical density or specialty. Disclosing the DSCA did not alter operative decision-making. In all, 40 respondents (29%) had prior knowledge of the morphological grading system, but their responses showed no difference from those who had not. This study suggests that the participants were less influenced by DSCA than by the morphological appearance of the dural sac.

One characteristic that may influence this decision is a previously established relationship with the patient. We hypothesized that patients receiving their arthroplasty at an outside institution and presenting with infection would be more likely to undergo removal of their implant without an attempt at DAIR compared to patients who underwent primary arthroplasty at the investigating institution. METHODS: The institutional database was queried for primary total hip and knee arthroplasty infections. Manual review of medical records was performed, excluding patients who did not meet the Musculoskeletal Infection Society definition of infection. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, presenting infection characteristics, and surgical intervention were collected. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 270 patients were included for analysis. McPherson score (P < .001) and duration of symptoms (P < .001) were associated with subsequent treatment. Additionally, when controlling for age, gender, symptom duration category, procedure, McPherson score, and American Society of Anesthesiologists category, patients with index procedures at outside hospitals were more likely to undergo implant removal (odds ratio, 36.30; 95% confidence interval, 8.16-161.51; P < .001).

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Informed decision-making has been widely promoted in several medical settings, but little is known about the actual practice in orthopaedic surgery and there are no clear guidelines on how to improve the process in this setting. This study was designed to explore the quality of informed decision-making in orthopaedic practice and to identify excellent time-efficient examples with older patients. METHODS: We recruited orthopaedic surgeons, and patients sixty years of age or older, in a Midwestern metropolitan area for a descriptive study performed through the analysis of audiotaped physician-patient interviews. We used a valid and reliable measure to assess the elements of informed decision-making. These included discussions of the nature of the decision, the patient's role, alternatives, pros and cons, and uncertainties; assessment of the patient's understanding and his or her desire to receive input from others; and exploration of the patient's preferences and the impact on the patient's daily life. The audiotapes were scored with regard to whether there was a complete discussion of each informed-decision-making element (an IDM-18 score of 2) or a partial discussion of each element (an IDM-18 score of 1) as well as with a more pragmatic metric (the IDM-Min score), reflecting whether there was any discussion of the patient's role or preference and of the nature of the decision. The visit duration was studied in relation to the extent of the informed decision-making, and excellent time-efficient examples were sought. RESULTS: There were 141 informed-decision-making discussions about surgery, including knee and hip replacement as well as wrist/hand, shoulder, and arthroscopic surgery. Surgeons frequently discussed the nature of the decision (92% of the time), alternatives (62%), and risks and benefits (59%); they rarely discussed the patient's role (14%) or assessed the patient's understanding (12%). The IDM-18 scores of the 141 discussions averaged 5.9 (range, 0 to 15; 95% confidence interval, 5.4 to 6.5). Fifty-seven percent of the discussions met the IDM-Min criteria. The median duration of the visits was sixteen minutes; the extent of informed decision-making had only a modest relationship with the visit duration. Time-efficient strategies that were identified included use of scenarios to illustrate distinct choices, encouraging patient input, and addressing primary concerns rather than lengthy recitations of pros and cons.

E. and Hart, A.",The bone & joint journal,"AIMS: There are many guidelines that help direct the management of patients with metal-on-metal (MOM) hip arthroplasties. We have undertaken a study to compare the management of patients with MOM hip arthroplasties in different countries. METHODS: Six international tertiary referral orthopaedic centres were invited to participate by organising a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting, consisting of two or more revision hip arthroplasty surgeons and a musculoskeletal radiologist. A full clinical dataset including history, blood tests and imaging for ten patients was sent to each unit, for discussion and treatment planning. Differences in the interpretation of findings, management decisions and rationale for decisions were compared using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Overall agreement between the orthopaedic centres and the recommended treatment plans for the ten patients with MOM hip implants was moderate (kappa = 0.6). Full agreement was seen in a third of cases, however split decisions were also seen in a third of cases. Units differed in their interpretation of the significance of the investigation findings and put varying emphasis on serial changes, in the presence of symptoms. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, the management of raised or rising blood metal ions, cystic pseudotumours and peri-acetabular osteolysis led to inconsistency in the agreement between centres. Coordinated international guidance and MDT panel discussions are recommended to improve consensus in decision making. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A lack of evidence and the subsequent variation in regulator guidance leads to differences in opinions, the clinical impact of which can be reduced through a multi-disciplinary team approach to managing patients with MOM hip implants.

Liu_2018_ThJoofar,JOUR,Patient-Identified Barriers and Facilitators to Pre-Visit Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures Completion in Patients With Hip and Knee Pain,"Liu, Tiffany C. and Ohueri, Chelsi W. and Schryver, Eric M. and Bozic, Kevin J. and Koenig, Karl M.",The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Although patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) provide valuable health information and aid medical decision making for patients with hip and knee arthritis, survey completion rates remain low. The purpose of this study is to elucidate patient preferences regarding location of completion, delivery method, and barriers or facilitators to pre-visit completion. METHODS: Patients with hip and/or knee pain who were asked to complete pre-visit PROMs at 2 urban arthroplasty clinics were recruited. In-person, semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews were conducted, transcribed, and coded for thematic analysis. Codes were developed using a data-driven approach. RESULTS: We analyzed 51 interviews. The mean age was 57 years, 57% were women, and 45% had private or Medicare insurance. Prevalent themes regarding location preferences were convenience and communication preferences. Thirty-four patients stated a preference for completing pre-visit PROMs at home, 19 for in-office completion, and 10 stated no preference. Prevalent themes around delivery methods included technology access and familiarity. Of the 43 patients asked to select their preferred pre-visit PROM delivery method (phone call, email, text message, or postal mail), 31 (72%) preferred email or text messaging. Barriers to completing pre-visit PROMs were technological issues, recognizing the message was healthcare-related, and being too busy or forgetting. Twenty patients identified no barriers. CONCLUSION: Electronic PROM collection is favored by many patients, but alternative methods for patients without access to or familiarity with technology remain important. Clear recognition that the message is from a physician's office and physician communication of the utility of PROMs in clinical decision making may increase pre-visit completion.",2018,10.1016/j.arth.2017.10.022,33,3,643-649.e1,eng,1532-8406 0883-5403,"Physicians and United States and Medicare and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Insurance, Health and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and value and Aged, 80 and over and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Data Collection/*methods and *Patient Participation and *Pain and Arthroplasty and electronic survey and Osteoarthritis, Hip/therapy and Osteoarthritis, Knee/therapy and patient-reported outcomes measures and survey completion and total hip and knee arthroplasty",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,J Arthroplasty,NA,NA,NA,NA
Roberts_2019_Tb.jj,JOUR,Increased conditional risk of recurring complications with contralateral total hip arthroplasty surgery,"Roberts, H. J. and Tsay, E. L. and Grace, T. R. and Vail, T. P. and Ward, D. T.",The bone & joint journal,"AIMS: Increasingly, patients with bilateral hip arthritis wish to undergo staged total hip arthroplasty (THA). With the rise in demand for arthroplasty, perioperative risk assessment and counselling is crucial for shared decision making. However, it is unknown if complications that occur after a unilateral hip arthroplasty predict complications following surgery of the contralateral hip. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used nationwide linked discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between 2005 and 2014 to analyze the incidence and recurrence of complications following the first- and second-stage operations in staged bilateral total hip arthroplasty (BTHAs). Complications included perioperative medical adverse events within 30 to 60 days, and infection and mechanical complications within one year. Conditional probabilities and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to determine whether experiencing a complication after the first stage of surgery increased the risk of developing the same complication after the second stage. RESULTS: A total of 13 829 patients (5790 men and 8039 women) who underwent staged BTHAs were analyzed. The mean age at first operation was 62.9 years (14 to 95). For eight of the 12 outcomes evaluated, patients who experienced the outcome following the first arthroplasty had a significantly increased probability and odds of developing that same complication following the second arthroplasty, compared with those who did not experience the complication after the first surgery. This was true for digestive complications (OR 25.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.86 to 46.08; p < 0.001), urinary complications (OR 6.48, 95% CI 1.7 to 20.73; p = 0.01), haematoma (OR 12.17, 95% CI 4.55 to 31.14; p < 0.001), deep vein thrombosis (OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.34 to 9.65; p < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR 12.03, 95% CI 2.02 to 46.77; p = 0.01), deep hip infection (OR 534.21, 95% CI 314.96 to 909.25; p < 0.001), superficial hip infection (OR 1574.99, 95% CI 269.83 to 9291.81; p < 0.001), and mechanical malfunction (OR 117.49, 95% CI 91.55 to 150.34; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of certain complications after unilateral THA is associated with an increased risk of the same complication occurring after staged arthroplasty of the contralateral hip. Patients who experience these complications after unilateral hip arthroplasty should be appropriately counselled regarding their risk profile prior to undergoing staged contralateral hip arthroplasty.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 90% of current orthopaedic graduates are engaging in fellowship training, with sports medicine being the most commonly chosen specialty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of fellowship training on clinical decision-making by fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeons. METHODS: A survey was designed to assess the importance of fellowship on common clinical decisions made in the nonoperative and surgical treatment of knee, shoulder, and elbow disorders. The survey also included questions for the respondents on their comfort level with a variety of routine and complex surgical procedures. The survey was sent to alumni of 113 orthopaedic sports medicine programs across the United States. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 310 surgeons who had been in practice for an average of 9.0 years. They represented alumni of twenty-nine orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs across sixteen states. Fellowship was considered very important for surgical decision-making in the knee and shoulder. For nonoperative treatment, fellowship had a greater impact on shoulder disorders than on knee or elbow disorders. Fellowship was significantly more important than residency (p < 0.001) for determining preferred surgical equipment, implants, and braces. Among the surgical procedures assessed, respondents were least comfortable with the treatment of multi-ligamentous knee injuries, posterior cruciate ligament injuries, and shoulder instability with bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Fellowship has a significantly higher impact than residency on industry-related decision-making. Fellowship-trained sports surgeons should consider seeking additional training in the treatment of multi-ligamentous knee injuries, posterior cruciate ligament injuries, shoulder instability with bone loss, and elbow disorders.

We aimed to develop and validate a practical, easy-to-use tool based on machine learning that may accurately predict outcome following I&D surgery taking into account the influence of numerous factors. METHODS: This was an international, multicentre retrospective study of 1,174 revision total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasties (TKA) undergoing I&D for PJI between January 2005 and December 2017. PJI was defined using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. A total of 52 variables including demographics, comorbidities, and clinical and laboratory findings were evaluated using random forest machine learning analysis. The algorithm was then verified through cross-validation. RESULTS: Of the 1,174 patients that were included in the study, 405 patients (34.5%) failed treatment. Using random forest analysis, an algorithm that provides the probability for failure for each specific patient was created. By order of importance, the ten most important variables associated with failure of I&D were serum CRP levels, positive blood cultures, indication for index arthroplasty other than osteoarthritis, not exchanging the modular components, use of immunosuppressive medication, late acute (haematogenous) infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, overlying skin infection, polymicrobial infection, and older age. The algorithm had good discriminatory capability (area under the curve = 0.74). Cross-validation showed similar probabilities comparing predicted and observed failures indicating high accuracy of the model. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the orthopaedic literature to use machine learning as a tool for predicting outcomes following I&D surgery. The developed algorithm provides the medical profession with a tool that can be employed in clinical decision-making and improve patient care. Future studies should aid in further validating this tool on additional cohorts.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Literature on complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) discussing the decision to amputate or not, the level of amputation, or the timing of the amputation is scarce. We evaluated informed decision-making regarding amputation for CRPS-I. METHODS: We describe our findings in a retrospective study of the decision-making process of thirty-six patients who underwent amputation for CRPS-I at our university medical center from 2000 to 2012. Additionally, we present the incidents preceding the CRPS-I, the reasons for and the levels of the amputation, and the outcomes after the amputations. RESULTS: Team members and the patient decided together whether or not to amputate and the level of amputation. Issues such as level of pain or allodynia, infection, desired length of the residual limb, joint range of motion, strength of all extremities, ability to use walking aids, and psychological ""green, yellow, and red flags"" were weighed in this process. There were no complications during the amputation surgery, a 22% rate of complications (infection in all but one patient) immediately postoperatively (reamputation not required), a 72% rate of phantom pain immediately after or within the first three months after the amputation, and a 77% rate of phantom pain more than one year after the amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Informed decision-making regarding amputation for CRPS-I remains a complex process for which little evidence is available to support patient choices; patient-specific outcomes are not predictable.

We developed rule-based NLP algorithms to automatically extract surgery specific data elements from knee arthroplasty operative notes. METHODS: Within a cohort of 20,000 knee arthroplasty operative notes from 2000 to 2017 at a large tertiary institution, we randomly selected independent pairs of training and test sets to develop and evaluate NLP algorithms to detect five major data elements. The size of the training and test datasets were similar and ranged between 420 to 1592 surgeries. Expert rules using keywords in operative notes were used to implement NLP algorithms capturing: (1) category of surgery (total knee arthroplasty, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, patellofemoral arthroplasty), (2) laterality of surgery, (3) constraint type, (4) presence of patellar resurfacing, and (5) implant model (catalog numbers). We used institutional registry data as our gold standard to evaluate the NLP algorithms. RESULTS: NLP algorithms to detect the category of surgery, laterality, constraint, and patellar resurfacing achieved 98.3%, 99.5%, 99.2%, and 99.4% accuracy on test datasets, respectively. The implant model algorithm achieved an F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 99.9%.

The goal of this study is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to replicate manual chart review for PJI data elements. METHODS: PJI was identified among all total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures performed at a single academic institution between 2000 and 2017. Data elements that comprise the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria were manually extracted and used as the gold standard for validation. A training sample of 1208 TJA surgeries (170 PJI cases) was randomly selected to develop the prototype NLP algorithms and an additional 1179 surgeries (150 PJI cases) were randomly selected as the test sample. The algorithms were applied to all consultation notes, operative notes, pathology reports, and microbiology reports to predict the correct status of PJI based on MSIS criteria. RESULTS: The algorithm, which identified patients with PJI based on MSIS criteria, achieved an f1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.911. Algorithm performance in extracting the presence of sinus tract, purulence, pathologic documentation of inflammation, and growth of cultured organisms from the involved TJA achieved f1-scores that ranged from 0.771 to 0.982, sensitivity that ranged from 0.730 to 1.000, and specificity that ranged from 0.947 to 1.000.

Such an approach will promote patient-centered decision-making and optimize recovery times while enhancing mandated hospital quality metrics. In the present study, we preoperatively and postoperatively surveyed THA candidates to elucidate the relationship between patient expectations and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This is a multi-institutional prospective study among THA candidates. Patients were surveyed regarding discharge planning 1 week preoperatively and postoperatively to capture perioperative patient expectations and correlate with inpatient LOS. RESULTS: In total, 93 THAs performed by 6 high-volume orthopedic surgeons at 2 medical centers. Our results demonstrated that patients of male gender and commercial insurance had significantly (P < .05) shorter LOS. Shorter LOS patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of LOS acceptance (""very comfortable"" rate in same-day discharge: 75.0% and next-day discharge: 63.8%; 2 days: 40.7%; 3+ days: 42.9%; P < .05) and a higher likelihood to participate in SDD programs. Postoperatively, patients with a shorter LOS had more acceptance to their LOS, albeit not statistically significant (P = .20). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that guiding patient expectations within the perioperative setting is an essential component for successful and timely discharge after THA. Having clear and transparent discussion with the surgical team regarding the perioperative course can improve a THA candidate's understanding and buy-in with the postoperative plan, regardless of LOS.

When the knee is symptomatic, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy has been practised for a long time with many case series reporting improved patient outcomes. Since 2002, several randomised clinical trials demonstrated no additional benefit of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to non-operative treatment, sham surgery or sham arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. These results introduced controversy in the medical community and made clinical decision-making challenging in the daily clinical practice. To facilitate the clinical decision-making process, a consensus was developed. This initiative was endorsed by ESSKA. METHODS: A degenerative meniscus lesion was defined as a lesion occurring without any history of significant acute trauma in a patient older than 35 years. Congenital lesions, traumatic meniscus tears and degenerative lesions occurring in young patients, especially in athletes, were excluded. The project followed the so-called formal consensus process, involving a steering group, a rating group and a peer-review group. A total of 84 surgeons and scientists from 22 European countries were included in the process. Twenty questions, their associated answers and an algorithm based on extensive literature review and clinical expertise, were proposed. Each question and answer set was graded according to the scientific level of the corresponding literature. RESULTS: The main finding was that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy should not be proposed as a first line of treatment for degenerative meniscus lesions. Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy should only be considered after a proper standardised clinical and radiological evaluation and when the response to non-operative management has not been satisfactory. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee is typically not indicated in the first-line work-up, but knee radiography should be used as an imaging tool to support a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or to detect certain rare pathologies, such as tumours or fractures of the knee. DISCUSSION: The present work offers a clear framework for the management of degenerative meniscus lesions, with the aim to balance information extracted from the scientific evidence and clinical expertise. Because of biases and weaknesses of the current literature and lack of definition of important criteria such as mechanical symptoms, it cannot be considered as an exact treatment algorithm. It summarises the results of the ""ESSKA Meniscus Consensus Project"" ( http://www.esska.org/education/projects ) and is the first official European consensus on this topic.

However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Literature regarding zolpidem use in the total knee arthroplasty (TKA) population is limited. The aim of the study was to analyze postoperative zolpidem use in the TKA population regarding medical and implant complications, falls, and readmission. METHODS: The study group was queried according to zolpidem use. Controls consisted of patients who underwent primary TKA without a history of hypnotic drug use. Study group patients were matched to controls in a 1:5 ratio by demographics and comorbidities. Results yielded 99,178 study participants and 495,795 controls. Primary endpoints included 90-day medical and implant complications, fall risk, and readmission. Chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds (OR) for complications, fall risk, and readmission. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Study group patients had increased odds of medical complications (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.71-1.82, P < .0001) and implant complications (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23-1.47, P < .0001) compared to controls. Furthermore, patients in the study group were found to have an increased risk of 90- day falls (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.21, P < .0001). Readmission was similar to controls (5.10% vs 4.84%, P = .12).

Lawrence and Pellegrini, Vincent D. Jr and Van Heest, Ann E. and Black, Kevin P.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,"BACKGROUND: The primary influence on medical students' career choice is their third-year clerkship. However, orthopaedics is not a required rotation in the curriculum of most medical schools. Our goals were to identify factors that motivate students to choose an orthopaedic career and to compare these with the factors that influence students to choose nonorthopaedic disciplines. METHODS: Fourth-year medical students and orthopaedic residents at the postgraduate year (PGY)-1 level at eight orthopaedic training programs in the United States were surveyed to determine the reasons that they chose orthopaedics instead of other medical or surgical fields. RESULTS: Of the 622 individuals who responded to our survey, 125 were entering orthopaedics and 497 were not. Although career choice in both groups was most heavily influenced by third and fourth-year clinical rotations and faculty contacts, orthopaedics-bound respondents were more likely than non-orthopaedics-bound respondents to be strongly influenced by experiences and people prior to medical school. Orthopaedics-bound respondents were less likely to report a faculty member as the most important person influencing career choice. Fifty-one percent (sixty-three) of 124 students who selected orthopaedics had already decided to pursue this field prior to their third-year rotation. Patient care was chosen by 71% (347) of 490 non-orthopaedics-bound respondents and 75% (ninety-four) of 125 orthopaedics-bound respondents as the most important factor for pursuing a particular field. Income was not selected as the deciding factor by respondents in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although faculty contacts and third-year clinical rotations played an important role in student selection of specialty training, they were less influential for those choosing an orthopaedic career than for those choosing other disciplines. Many students choosing orthopaedics made this decision prior to medical school. We believe that increased exposure to positive clinical role models and experiences during medical school would enhance medical students' options for choosing orthopaedic surgery as a career.

Tibbo_2019_ThJoofar,JOUR,Use of Natural Language Processing Tools to Identify and Classify Periprosthetic Femur Fractures,"Tibbo, Meagan E. and Wyles, Cody C. and Fu, Sunyang and Sohn, Sunghwan and Lewallen, David G. and Berry, Daniel J. and Maradit Kremers, Hilal",The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Manual chart review is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge possessed by highly trained medical professionals. The cost and infrastructure challenges required to implement this is prohibitive for most hospitals. Natural language processing (NLP) tools are distinctive in their ability to extract critical information from unstructured text in the electronic health records. As a simple proof-of-concept for the potential application of NLP technology in total hip arthroplasty (THA), we examined its ability to identify periprosthetic femur fractures (PPFFx) followed by more complex Vancouver classification. METHODS: PPFFx were identified among all THAs performed at a single academic institution between 1998 and 2016. A randomly selected training cohort (1538 THAs with 89 PPFFx cases) was used to develop the prototype NLP algorithm and an additional randomly selected cohort (2982 THAs with 84 PPFFx cases) was used to further validate the algorithm. Keywords to identify, and subsequently classify, Vancouver type PPFFx about THA were defined. The gold standard was confirmed by experienced orthopedic surgeons using chart and radiographic review. The algorithm was applied to consult and operative notes to evaluate language used by surgeons as a means to predict the correct pathology in the absence of a listed, precise diagnosis. Given the variability inherent to fracture descriptions by different surgeons, an iterative process was used to improve the algorithm during the training phase following error identification. Validation statistics were calculated using manual chart review as the gold standard. RESULTS: In distinguishing PPFFx, the NLP algorithm demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity. Among 84 PPFFx test cases, the algorithm demonstrated 78.6% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity in determining the correct Vancouver classification. CONCLUSION: NLP-enabled algorithms are a promising alternative to manual chart review for identifying THA outcomes. NLP algorithms applied to surgeon notes demonstrated excellent accuracy in delineating PPFFx, but accuracy was low for Vancouver classification subtype. This proof-of-concept study supports the use of NLP technology to extract THA-specific data elements from the unstructured text in electronic health records in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in enhancing the patient experience after discretionary orthopaedic surgery. Patient narratives are a potentially valuable but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction and with perioperative outcomes. METHODS: An institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment. RESULTS: Most patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, patient-centered care after TSA.",2019,10.2106/JBJS.18.00695,101,4,330-337,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Hospitals, Urban and *Patient Satisfaction and Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data and Operative Time and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder/*psychology/standards and Pain, Postoperative/prevention & control/psychology",NA,NA,2019/02/20/,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

A questionnaire survey of members of the Dutch Orthopaedic Association,"Poolman, Rudolf W. and Sierevelt, Inger N. and Farrokhyar, Forough and Mazel, J. Adriaan and Blankevoort, Leendert and Bhandari, Mohit",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,"BACKGROUND: The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume (The Journal) recently initiated a section called ""Evidence-Based Orthopaedics."" Furthermore, a level-of-evidence rating is now used in The Journal to help readers in clinical decision-making. Little is known about whether this recent emphasis has influenced surgeons' perceptions about and competence in evidence-based medicine. Therefore, we examined perceptions and competence in evidence-based medicine among Dutch orthopaedic surgeons. METHODS: Members of the Dutch Orthopaedic Association were surveyed to examine their attitudes toward evidence-based medicine and their competence in evidence-based medicine. We evaluated competences using a newly developed instrument tailored to surgical practice. RESULTS: Of the 611 members, 367 surgeons (60%) responded. Orthopaedic surgeons welcomed evidence-based medicine. Practical evidence-based medicine resources were perceived as the best method to move from opinion-based or experience-based to evidence-based practice. Four variables were significantly and positively associated with the competence instrument: (1) a younger age, particularly between thirty-six and forty-five years (p = 0.007), (2) experience of less than ten years (p = 0.032), (3) having a PhD degree (p < 0.001), and (4) working in an academic or teaching setting (p = 0.004). The majority of the respondents were aware of The Journal's evidence-based medicine section (84%) and level-of-evidence ratings (65%), and 20% used The Journal's evidence-based medicine abstracts in clinical decision-making. This increased awareness of evidence-based medicine was also reflected in the frequent use of Cochrane reviews in clinical decision-making (27% of the respondents). Surgeons who used and those who were aware of but did not use The Journal's evidence-based medicine abstracts or Cochrane reviews in clinical decision-making had significantly higher competence instrument scores than those who were unaware of these resources (p = 0.03 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based medicine is welcomed by Dutch orthopaedic surgeons. The recent emphasis on evidence-based medicine is reflected in an increased awareness about The Journal's evidence-based medicine section, levels of evidence, and the largest evidence-based medicine resource: the Cochrane reviews. Younger orthopaedic surgeons had better knowledge about evidence-based medicine. The development and use of evidence-based resources as well as preappraised summaries such as The Journal's evidence-based medicine abstracts and Cochrane reviews were perceived as the best way to move from opinion-based to evidence-based orthopaedic practice.",2007,10.2106/JBJS.F.00633,89,1,206-215,eng,0021-9355,"Humans and Data Collection and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Netherlands and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Competence and *Orthopedics and Societies, Medical/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2007/01//undefined,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to assess the usability of the AUC by comparing the actual surgical treatment provided at our institution with that recommended by the AUC. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical charts and radiographs of all patients who underwent surgery for knee osteoarthritis (OA) at our hospital was performed between January and December 2017. Data including each patient's age, gender, pain level, mechanical symptoms, range of motion (ROM) and instability, radiographic pattern and severity, limb alignment, and type of surgical interventions received were collected. The collected data were input into the AUC application to determine the rate of appropriateness of the treatments. Afterwards, the agreement between the actual treatment provided and the AUC recommendation was assessed. RESULTS: A consecutive series of 100 patients were included. The mean age was 63.1 years, with the majority of the patients aged (73%) between 50 and 69 years. Most of the patients were females (74%), and 61% had left knee OA. The most frequent type of patient was a middle-aged patient with function-limiting pain at short distances, no mechanical symptoms or functional instability with full ROM, severe knee multicompartmental radiographic features, and varus or valgus malalignment. Out of the 100 patients, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed in 85 patients, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) was performed in 11 patients, and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) was performed in four patients. According to the AUC, 90 (90%) cases were treated with an appropriate surgical treatment, whereas 10 (10%) cases were treated with a maybe appropriate treatment. The actual surgical treatment performed at our hospital was in agreement with the AUC recommendation in 100% of the TKA cases, 90.9% of the UKA cases, and 100% of the HTO cases. Thus, the agreement rate with the AUC was 99% in all surgical cases. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the AUC for the surgical treatment of knee OA can be applied easily in a clinical setting. Most of the treatments provided at our institution were appropriate and in agreement with the AUC recommendations. Additionally, the AUC had a web-based application that was easy to use and simple for identifying treatment recommendations.

This study aims to assess this procedure in terms of the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis, re-operation rate and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: Sixty-six patients were identified [mean age 40 years (SD 13 years)] who had undergone ankle arthroscopy following a fracture of the distal tibia or fibula. Medical case notes were reviewed to ascertain details of the index injury, intra-operative findings and identify any further procedures. Patients were then contacted using a standardized questionnaire to assess satisfaction and return to normal function. RESULTS: Injury occurred in a mean of 2 years 10 months before arthroscopy (SD 13 months, min 6 months). Forty-nine of 66 fractures (74 %) had been managed operatively. The commonest indication for arthroscopy was anterior impingement (45 %) followed by degenerative change (30 %) and osteochondral lesions (OCL) (18 %). Intra-operative findings revealed an unexpected OCL or frank degenerative change in 20 % of patients. Using a Kaplan-Meier estimate 1 year after arthroscopy, 10 % of patients had undergone further surgery. This had increased to 34 % by 4 years after arthroscopy. Four patients underwent ankle fusion. Questionnaires were completed by 55/66 patients (84 %). Only 28 patients (50 %) felt surgery allowed them to return to normal activity. Thirty-nine patients reported a benefit from surgery (75 %) whilst 43 were satisfied (77 %) and 48 (86 %) would recommend the procedure to a friend. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular pathology was significantly underestimated preoperatively for one patient in five. Arthroscopy improved symptoms in 75 % of patients who complain of ankle symptoms after fracture of the ankle or distal tibia. However, further procedures were required in 34 % of patients. The findings of this study help guide patient counselling and operative decision-making in this challenging group of patients.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the moral reasoning utilized by orthopaedic surgery residents when resolving moral dilemmas. METHODS: Sixty-three residents in an accredited program took the Defining Issues Test-2, an online examination designed to measure and analyze moral reasoning. Scores approximate how often residents utilize three schemas in their moral reasoning: personal interest, maintaining social norms, and postconventional. Scores were analyzed for differences among years of training, previous literature, and established norms. RESULTS: Approximately 9.5% of residents utilized personal interest heavily in their moral reasoning, 27% utilized maintaining norms, and 63.5% utilized postconventional reasoning. There were no significant differences between years of training. The fourth-year (R4) class recorded the highest utilization of principled reasoning, while the fifth-year (R5) class recorded the lowest. The range of principled reasoning scores narrowed from the first year (R1) to R5. The principled reasoning scores of residents were significantly lower than previously reported scores of professional degree-holders and medical students, and empirically lower than previously reported scores of orthopaedic attendings and medical students. CONCLUSIONS: Residents utilized principled reasoning less frequently than expected for physicians. It remains unclear as to what factors contributed to high utilization of principled reasoning in the R4 class but low utilization in the R5 class. Our cross-sectional data suggest that each year of training homogenizes toward a class-specific utilization of principled reasoning.

The purpose of this study is to examine the risks of perioperative complications with this approach in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), to inform shared decision-making. METHODS: We reviewed national hospital discharge data from 2005 to 2014 to compare outcomes between simultaneous-bilateral TKAs (sim-BTKAs) and staged-bilateral TKAs (staged-BTKAs). Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for confounders. Outcomes analyzed included mortality, various medical complications, knee infection, and mechanical complications. RESULTS: This study analyzed 27,301 sim-BTKAs and 45,419 staged-BTKAs. Patients who underwent simultaneous surgery had a statistically significant higher adjusted odds of mortality, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, and complications involving the urinary and digestive systems, and a lower adjusted odds of deep knee infection and hematoma. Thirteen of the 14 complications had overall incidences less than 2% and 1 outcome had an incidence of 3%. The absolute between-group risk difference for any complication was 1% or less.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's database for patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) and revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) between the years 2005 and 2016 was conducted. The 5-factor score, which includes presence of comorbid diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and functional status, was calculated for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the mFI-5 and postoperative complications while controlling for demographic variables. RESULTS: In total, 13,948 patients undergoing rTHA and 16,304 patients undergoing rTKA were identified. The mFI-5 was a strong predictor of serious medical complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), discharge to a facility, total length of stay, readmission, and mortality (P <e2><89><a4> .007). CONCLUSION: The mFI-5 predicts serious medical complications, increased length of stay, discharge to a facility, hospital readmission, and mortality in patients undergoing rTHA and rTKA. All the variables within the mFI-5 are easily obtained through the patient history, allowing for a practical clinical tool that hospitals and physicians can use to identify at-risk patients, educate and engage patients and their families in a shared decision-making conversation, and guide perioperative care in order to optimize patient outcomes.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Partial traumatic hemipelvectomy (THP) is a catastrophic and life-threatening injury caused by high-energy impact. With advances in prehospital resuscitative techniques, more patients now survive this disastrous injury; however, the management of partial THP still lacks well-established therapeutic protocols. The purpose of this study was to present our experience in managing partial THP in a level-I trauma center. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 21 consecutive patients with partial THP. The key points of successful treatment are hemorrhage control, proper decision-making regarding amputation, treatment of associated injuries, and infection control. Data on patient demographics, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Eight female and 13 male patients with a mean age of 31.3 years met the diagnostic criteria. The mean follow-up was 51.9 months. Of 17 surviving patients, 7 underwent primary amputation; limbs were successfully preserved in 4; and 6 patients underwent secondary amputation because of infection, organ dysfunction, and limb necrosis. Two patients died during resuscitation, and 2 patients died after amputation. Phantom limb pain, infection, and skin flap necrosis were the major postoperative complications.

To help understand the application of PROMs in arthroplasty, normative and benchmark data to serve as a comparison to patients presurgery and postsurgery would be extremely valuable. We collected normative data of the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), JR on a healthy population, greater than 17 years of age, in the United States devoid of hip injury and/or surgery. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, where hard copy surveys were administered to 1140 patients, being seen for an orthopedic issue unrelated to their hip, and nonpatient visitors in July 2018 at an outpatient orthopedic clinic in a suburban metropolitan city. Participants were eligible if they self-reported a medical history negative for hip arthroplasty, current hip pain/disability, or hip procedure (surgery or injection) within the past year. Mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals, and ranges on the HOOS, JR interval scores were calculated by sex, age decade, body mass index (BMI), reason for visit, history of orthopedic procedure, and medical history. RESULTS: We included 425 men and 575 women in the final study cohort. Women aged between 70+ years reported the lowest mean interval score (mean = 89.8). Overall women scored lower as well (93.3 vs 95.7, P = .001). There was not a statistical difference between the interval scores by tobacco consumption (93.5 vs 94.4, P = .49) and between patients versus nonpatient visitors (94.2 vs 94.5, P = .672). Lower scores were observed in participants with a past nonhip orthopedic procedure (92.6 vs 94.9, P = .016), with a medical history of a chronic illness (92.5 vs 95.9, P = <.001), and classified as obese (BMI > 30) (91.7 vs 95.2, P < .001). On regression analysis, there was a decrease of 0.3 and 0.1 in the interval score for each unit of BMI and age by year, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study provides normative reference values for the HOOS, JR in a US population from a suburban metropolitan city for individuals greater than 17 years of age. These scores can facilitate physician-patient shared decision-making to help patients understand expectations after hip arthroplasty in respect to PROMs.",2019,10.1016/j.arth.2019.02.035,34,6,1122-1126,eng,1532-8406 0883-5403,"United States and Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Cohort Studies and Body Mass Index and Aged, 80 and over and Self Report and Reference Values and Postoperative Period and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and patient-reported outcome measures and arthroplasty and hip and Pain Measurement/*methods and Arthralgia/*surgery and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*methods/standards and HOOS JR and normative and Obesity/complications/surgery and Orthopedics/standards and Osteoarthritis, Hip/*diagnosis/surgery and Pain/surgery",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,J Arthroplasty,NA,NA,NA,NA

F. and Krych, Aaron J.","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to create a predictive model utilizing baseline demographic and radiographic characteristics for the likelihood that a patient with subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee will progress to knee arthroplasty with emphasis on clinical interpretability and usability. METHODS: A retrospective review of baseline and final radiographs in addition to MRIs were reviewed for evaluation of insufficiency fractures and associated injuries. Patient and radiographic factors were used in building predictive models for progression to arthroplasty with Train: Validation: Test subsets. Multiple models were compared with emphasis on clinical utility. RESULTS: Total of 249 patients with a mean age of 64.6 (SD 10.5) years were included. Knee arthroplasty rate was 27% at mean of 4 years of follow-up. Lasso Regression was non-inferior to other models and was chosen for ease of interpretability. In order of importance, predictors for progression to arthroplasty included lateral meniscus extrusion, Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 4, SIFK on MFC, lateral meniscus root tear, and medial meniscus extrusion. The final SIFK Score stratified patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories with arthroplasty rates of 8.8%, 40.4%, and 78.9% (p < 0.001) and an area under the curve of 82.5%. CONCLUSION: In this validated model, lateral meniscus extrusion, K-L Grade 4, SIFK on MFC, lateral meniscus root tear, and medial meniscus extrusion were the most important factors in predicting progression to arthroplasty (in that order). This model assists in patient treatment and counseling in providing prognostic information based on patient-specific risk factors by classifying them into a low-, medium-, and high-risk categories.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: U.S. practitioners have prescribed opioid analgesics increasingly in recent years, contributing to what has been declared an opioid epidemic by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioids are used frequently in the preoperative and postoperative periods for patients undergoing total joint replacement in developed countries, but cross-cultural comparisons of this practice are limited. An international medical mission such as Operation Walk Boston, which provides total joint replacement to financially vulnerable patients in the Dominican Republic, offers a unique opportunity to compare postoperative pain management approaches in a developed nation and a developing nation. METHODS: We interviewed American and Dominican surgeons and nurses (n = 22) during Operation Walk Boston 2015. We used a moderator's guide with open-ended questions to inquire about postoperative pain management and factors influencing prescribing practices. Interviews were recorded and transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Providers highlighted differences in the patient-provider relationship, pain medication prescribing variability, and access to medications. Dominican surgeons emphasized adherence to standardized pain protocols and employed a paternalistic model of care, and American surgeons reported prescribing variability and described shared decision-making with patients. Dominican providers described limited availability of potent opioid preparations in the Dominican Republic, in contrast to American providers, who discussed opioid accessibility in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cross-cultural comparisons provide insight into how opioid prescribing practices, approaches to the patient-provider relationship, and medication access inform distinct pain management strategies in American and Dominican surgical settings.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Biomedical research is essential for optimizing patient care. Research has suggested inadequacies in nonorthopaedic trainees' understanding of study design and biostatistics. This study assesses orthopaedic residents' knowledge of common biostatistical and study design concepts, as well as their confidence in utilizing the medical literature. METHODS: A validated survey assessing knowledge and the application of study design concepts was administered to residents at 10 U.S. institutions. The survey tested knowledge as well as confidence and attitudes regarding common biostatistics principles. The association of demographic characteristics, work activities, and confidence and attitude ratings with test performance were examined using t tests and analysis of variance. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 64% (178 of 279). The largest group of participants were men (83%, 137 of 165), were between the ages of 26 and 30 years (59%, 105 of 177), and had graduated medical school within the past 4 to 10 years (43%, 76 of 175). Fifty-three percent (93 of 176) had prior biostatistics training, while 44% (77 of 176) had prior epidemiology training. Less than 5% of biostatistics or epidemiology training had taken place after medical school. Forty-seven percent (83 of 176) were unable to determine a study's design. Thirty-eight percent (67 of 178) could not apply the concept of specificity and sensitivity. Eighty-three percent (147 of 178) could not assess the strength of a relationship using odds ratios. Sixty-nine percent (123 of 178) understood the implications of p values. Previous biostatistics training, but not epidemiology or evidence-based medicine training; inclusion of reading research, attending conferences, and data analysis; as well as a self-reported finding of statistics as important for the analysis of one's own research data were significantly associated with better test performance (p < 0.05).

American volume,"A sixty-year-old man presented to an orthopaedic surgeon with a periprosthetic infection after total knee arthroplasty performed by another surgeon. He underwent removal of the components, placement of an antibiotic spacer, and antibiotic suppression therapy. Eight weeks later, a revision total knee arthroplasty was performed. The patient did well initially but returned four months after the revision with periprosthetic reinfection. The revision components were removed, another antibiotic spacer was placed, and antibiotic suppression therapy was again administered. During the operation, the entire extensor mechanism, including the quadriceps tendon, patella, and patellar tendon, was found to be necrotic and required radical debridement. Five months later, another operation was performed to remove the spacer, and a plastic surgeon was consulted to assist in the wound closure because of the presence of extensive scar tissue. Intraoperative cultures were negative during these two most recent procedures. The orthopaedic surgeon presented the patient with four treatment options: arthrodesis, resection arthroplasty, amputation, or revision total knee arthroplasty with extensor mechanism allograft and a possible flap closure (rotational or free flap). The patient refused a knee arthrodesis and voiced a strong preference for amputation over arthrodesis. The patient's first choice, however, was to save the knee and to have a second radical revision performed. The surgeon then discussed in detail the risks that would be involved with reconstruction, including the high risk of reinfection and other wound complications. An infection, he explained, could lead to amputation, sepsis, and death. The surgeon also informed the patient that the procedure was not commonly performed, had no proven success rate, and could be fraught with complications.

METHODS: All patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty between 2011 and 2013 were selected from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. A propensity score was used to match 1476 fast-track (<e2><89><a4>2 day length of stay) inpatients with 492 outpatients (3:1 ratio). Thirty-day complication, reoperation, and readmission rates were compared, both during and after hospitalization. Logistic regression was used to calculate propensity score adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: After matching, outpatients had higher rates of medical complication (anytime, 10.0% vs 6.7%, P = .018; post discharge, 6.3% vs 1.1%, P < .001). Most complications were bleeding requiring transfusion, which occurred at similar rates after surgery but at higher rates post discharge in outpatients (anytime, 7.5% outpatients vs 5.6% inpatients, P = .113; post discharge, 4.1% outpatients vs 0.1% inpatients, P < .001). There was no difference in readmission rate (2.4% outpatient vs 2.0% inpatient, P = .589).

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Competency-based medical education as a resident-training format will move postgraduate training away from time-based training, to a model based on observable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether junior residents and senior residents could demonstrate clinical skills to a similar level, after a sports medicine rotation. METHODS: All residents undertaking a three-month sports medicine rotation had to pass an Objective Structured Clinical Examination. The stations tested the fundamentals of history-taking, examination, image interpretation, differential diagnosis, informed consent, and clinical decision-making. Performance at each station was assessed with a binary station-specific checklist and an overall global rating scale, in which 1 indicated novice, 2 indicated advanced beginner, 3 indicated competent, 4 indicated proficient, and 5 indicated expert. A global rating scale was also given for each domain of knowledge. RESULTS: Over eighteen months, thirty-nine residents (twenty-one junior residents and eighteen senior residents) and six fellows (for a total of forty-five participants) completed the examination. With regard to junior residents and senior residents, analysis using a two-tailed t test demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in both total checklist score and overall global rating scale; the mean total checklist score (and standard deviation) was 56.15% <c2><b1> 10.99% for junior residents and 71.87% <c2><b1> 8.94% for senior residents, and the mean global rating scale was 2.44 <c2><b1> 0.55 for junior residents and 3.79 <c2><b1> 0.49 for senior residents.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Current spine surgeon training in the United States consists of either an orthopaedic or neurological surgery residency, followed by an optional spine surgery fellowship. Resident spine surgery procedure volume may vary between and within specialties. METHODS: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education surgical case logs for graduating orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery residents from 2009 to 2012 were examined and were compared for spine surgery resident experience. RESULTS: The average number of reported spine surgery procedures performed during residency was 160.2 spine surgery procedures performed by orthopaedic surgery residents and 375.0 procedures performed by neurosurgery residents; the mean difference of 214.8 procedures (95% confidence interval, 196.3 to 231.7 procedures) was significant (p = 0.002). From 2009 to 2012, the average total spinal surgery procedures logged by orthopaedic surgery residents increased 24.3% from 141.1 to 175.4 procedures, and those logged by neurosurgery residents increased 6.5% from 367.9 to 391.8 procedures. There was a significant difference (p < 0.002) in the average number of spinal deformity procedures between graduating orthopaedic surgery residents (9.5 procedures) and graduating neurosurgery residents (2.0 procedures). There was substantial variability in spine surgery exposure within both specialties; when comparing the top 10% and bottom 10% of 2012 graduates for spinal instrumentation or arthrodesis procedures, there was a 13.1-fold difference for orthopaedic surgery residents and an 8.3-fold difference for neurosurgery residents. CONCLUSIONS: Spine surgery procedure volumes in orthopaedic and neurosurgery residency training programs vary greatly both within and between specialties. Although orthopaedic surgery residents had an increase in the number of spine procedures that they performed from 2009 to 2012, they averaged less than half of the number of spine procedures performed by neurological surgery residents. However, orthopaedic surgery residents appear to have greater exposure to spinal deformity than neurosurgery residents. Furthermore, orthopaedic spine fellowship training provides additional spine surgery case exposure of approximately 300 to 500 procedures; thus, before entering independent practice, when compared with neurosurgery residents, most orthopaedic spine surgeons complete as many spinal procedures or more. Although case volume is not the sole determinant of surgical skills or clinical decision making, variability in spine surgery procedure volume does exist among residency programs in the United States.",2014,10.2106/JBJS.M.01562,96,23,e196,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,"United States and Humans and Internship and Residency/*statistics & numerical data and Neurology/*education and Orthopedics/*education and Education, Medical, Graduate/*statistics & numerical data and Neurosurgical Procedures/education/*statistics & numerical data and Orthopedic Procedures/education/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2014/12/03/,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Uninsured and underinsured Americans face barriers to access to medical care. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of insurance status on whether patients with a torn meniscus proceed to elective arthroscopic knee surgery. METHODS: The records from January 2003 through April 2006 at a single academic orthopaedic surgery institution in Massachusetts were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with a meniscal tear and to determine whether surgery had been performed within six months after the diagnosis. Six categories of insurance were identified: private insurance, Workers' Compensation, Medicare, Medicaid, Uncompensated Care Pool, and self pay. A comparison of the proportions of insured and uninsured patients who underwent surgery was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: A total of 1127 patients were identified, and 446 (40%) of them underwent surgery within six months after an office visit. The patients with and without surgery had similar age and sex distributions. When patients were divided, according to their insurance status, into insured and uninsured groups, no significant difference was found in the rate of surgery (p = 0.23). However, subgroup analysis revealed significant differences among the six insurance categories. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients in the self-pay group had a lower rate of surgery than those with private insurance (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.75; p = 0.008), whereas patients receiving Workers' Compensation (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 3.55; p = 0.034) and those receiving Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.42; p = 0.016) had higher surgical rates than those with private insurance.

American volume,"Improving value in musculoskeletal health care has emerged as an important objective in both the United States and Canada. In order to achieve this objective, providers need to have a clear definition of value and an infrastructure for measuring outcomes of interest to patients and costs over the episode of care. Although national patient registries have been established in the United States and Canada, they nevertheless lag behind other registries worldwide in terms of collecting patient-reported outcomes and capturing data from a wide cross-section of hospitals and physicians. With the help of professional medical societies and the creation of national initiatives, patient-reported outcomes data collection on a large scale may be possible, but many challenges remain regarding implementation. Alternatives to the fee-for-service payment model, including pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance, may help incentivize physicians and health-care providers to obtain and improve on patient-reported outcomes data collection. Other payment reforms, such as bundled payments, have been piloted in certain regions, but their sustainability and long-term success are unclear at this time. Novel health-care delivery strategies aimed at improving quality, coordinating multispecialty care, and enhancing patient participation in shared decision-making have shown promise in improving patient-centered outcomes, but delivery models continue to vary greatly throughout the United States and Canada.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: With recent advances in the treatment of infection with hepatitis C increasing lifespan and quality of life, the need for total joint arthroplasty in this patient population is expected to grow. Presently, there are limited and conflicting data on the perioperative outcomes of lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty among patients with hepatitis C. The purpose of our study was to assess the association between hepatitis C and perioperative outcomes of lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who underwent a total hip or knee arthroplasty in the United States from 1998 to 2010. Controls were matched in a three-to-one ratio to patients with hepatitis-C infection according to surgical procedure, age, race, sex, Deyo comorbidity score, and year of surgical procedure. Outcomes included perioperative complications (any, medical, surgical) and mean length of stay. RESULTS: There were 1,700,400 total joint arthroplasties performed and recorded in the database during the study period, among which 8044 patients (0.47%) had a documented hepatitis-C infection. The frequency of hepatitis-C infection increased from 1.9 per 1000 total joint arthroplasties in 1998 to 5.9 per 1000 total joint arthroplasties in 2010 (slope = 0.47; r(2) = 0.93). Compared with matched controls, patients with hepatitis C had a 30% increased risk of any complication (95% confidence interval, 17% to 44%; p < 0.001), a 15% increased risk of a medical complication (95% confidence interval, 2% to 30%; p = 0.025), a 78% increased risk of a surgical complication (95% confidence interval, 49% to 112%; p < 0.001), and a mean length of stay that was 14% longer (95% confidence interval, 12% to 15%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Infection with hepatitis C is an infrequent but increasingly common comorbidity among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. Given these findings, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the increased risks of total joint arthroplasty in patients with hepatitis C and should discuss these risks with potential surgical candidates during a shared decision-making process.",2015,10.2106/JBJS.O.00183,97,23,1952-1957,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Databases, Factual and Case-Control Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data and *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee and *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip and Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology and Hepatitis C/*complications and Osteoarthritis, Hip/complications/*surgery and Osteoarthritis, Knee/complications/*surgery",NA,NA,2015/12/02/,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Factors regarding patient willingness to undergo or avoid joint replacement have been studied; however, these factors have not been studied in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. To further understand the aspects that are important for a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome in deciding whether to have surgery, we identified factors that affect this decision in women and that are not related to Workers' Compensation status. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 282 female patients with electrophysiologically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome without a known cause who were recommended for carpal tunnel release by a single hand surgeon in a tertiary medical setting. Of those, thirty-six female patients who were not entitled to Workers' Compensation canceled the operation during the waiting period, which averaged four weeks. Thirty-three of them were surveyed with a questionnaire sent by mail, and eighteen completed surveys were reviewed at a mean follow-up of thirty-two months. Furthermore, seventy female patients who underwent carpal tunnel release were randomly sampled, and thirty-eight patients completed the survey. The operation and cancellation groups were compared with regard to the reasons for choosing or canceling surgery. RESULTS: The groups were similar with regard to age, sociodemographic variables, follow-up length, initial electrophysiological findings, and functional status. The highest-ranked reason for choosing surgery was symptom severity rather than fear of progression or a positive electrodiagnostic result. Those who canceled the operation rated symptom improvement during the waiting period as the leading reason for doing so, but they were also concerned about transient weakness, the financial burden, and a scar or pillar pain. Disease persistence or recurrence was the issue of most concern in both groups. At the time of the final review, the functional status was significantly improved in both groups and no significant difference between the groups was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Women with carpal tunnel syndrome report that subjective symptom severity is the most important reason for undergoing surgery. Understanding this and other patient concerns may help physicians during patient-oriented consultation and decision-making. In particular, recommendations for carpal tunnel release on the basis of symptoms are reasonable from the perspective of the patient who has carpal tunnel syndrome without a known cause.",2009,10.2106/JBJS.H.01221,91,9,2130-2136,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,Humans and Female and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Severity of Illness Index and *Patient Acceptance of Health Care and *Orthopedic Procedures and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome/*surgery,NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

Polly and Bennett, Alexander N.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,"BACKGROUND: Medical practitioners face difficult decisions over whether to amputate or to salvage a lower limb that has undergone trauma. To our knowledge, there has been little evidence reporting the impact of different surgical decisions on functional and mental health outcomes following intensive rehabilitation that might inform decision-making. METHODS: This study is a retrospective, independent-group comparison of rehabilitation outcomes from a U.K. military complex trauma rehabilitation center. There were 100 procedures examined: 36 unilateral amputations (11 immediate-below-the-knee amputations, 15 delayed below-the-knee amputations, and 10 immediate above-the-knee amputations), 43 bilateral amputations, and 21 single-limb salvages (including 13 below-the-knee limb salvages); the patients had a mean age (and standard deviation) of 29 <c2><b1> 6 years and a mean New Injury Severity Score of 34 <c2><b1> 15 points. The outcome measures at completion of rehabilitation included a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre mobility and activities of daily living scores, screening for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and general anxiety disorder (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [GAD-7]), mental health support, and pain scores. RESULTS: On completion of their rehabilitation, the unilateral amputation group walked significantly farther in 6 minutes (564 <c2><b1> 92 m) than the limb-salvage group (483 <c2><b1> 108 m; p < 0.05) and the bilateral amputation group (409 <c2><b1> 106 m; p < 0.001). The delayed below-the-knee amputation group (595 <c2><b1> 89 m) walked significantly farther than the group with limb salvage below the knee (472 <c2><b1> 110 m; p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between the group with delayed below-the-knee amputation and the group with immediate below-the-knee amputation (598 <c2><b1> 63 m; p > 0.05). The limb-salvage group was less capable of running independently compared with all amputee groups. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were reported in mean mental health outcomes between the below-the-knee injury groups, and depression and anxiety scores were comparable with population norms. At discharge, 97% of all patients were able to control their pain. CONCLUSIONS: After completing a U.K. military interdisciplinary rehabilitation program, the unilateral amputation group demonstrated a significant functional advantage over the limb-salvage and bilateral amputation groups. We found that patients electing for delayed amputation below the knee after attempted limb salvage achieved superior functional gains in mobility compared with patients who underwent limb salvage below the knee and experienced no functional disadvantage compared with patients who underwent immediate amputation. The mental health outcomes were comparable with general population norms, optimizing the prospect of full integration back into society. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection after spine surgery is a well-known complication that can result in poor outcomes, arthrodesis-site nonunion, and neurological injury. We hypothesized that a higher surgical invasiveness score will increase the risk for surgical site infection following spine surgery. METHODS: Data were examined from patients undergoing any type of spinal surgery from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2004, at two academic hospitals. The surgical invasiveness index is a previously validated instrument that accounts for the number of vertebral levels decompressed, arthrodesed, or instrumented as well as the surgical approach. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each of the categorical variables. Multivariate binomial stepwise logistic regression was used to examine the association between surgical invasiveness and surgical site infection requiring a return to the operating room for treatment, adjusting for confounding risk factors. RESULTS: The regression analysis of 1532 patients who were evaluated for surgical site infection identified the following significant risk factors for surgical site infection: a body mass index of >35 (relative risk, 2.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 3.86]; p = 0.01), hypertension (relative risk, 1.73 [95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.85]; p = 0.03), thoracic surgery versus cervical surgery (relative risk, 2.57 [95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 5.60]; p = 0.01), lumbosacral surgery versus cervical surgery (relative risk, 2.03 [95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 4.05]; p = 0.02), and a surgical invasiveness index of >21 (relative risk, 3.15 [95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 6.99]; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing more invasive spine surgery as measured with the surgical invasiveness index had greater risk for having a surgical site infection that required a return to the operating room for treatment. Surgical invasiveness was the strongest risk factor for surgical site infection, even after adjusting for medical comorbidities, age, and other known risk factors. The magnitude of this association should be considered during surgical decision-making and intraoperative and postoperative care of the patient. These findings further validate the importance of the invasiveness index when performing safety and clinical outcome comparisons for spine surgery.",2012,10.2106/JBJS.J.01084,94,4,335-342,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Risk Assessment and Aged and Multivariate Analysis and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Spine/*surgery and Orthopedic Procedures/classification/methods and Surgical Wound Infection/*epidemiology,NA,NA,2012/02/15/,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

American volume,"BACKGROUND: There is a current trend in orthopaedic practice to treat nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures with early open reduction and internal fixation instead of cast immobilization. This trend is not evidence-based. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pool data from trials comparing surgical and conservative treatment for acute nondisplaced and minimally displaced scaphoid fractures, thus aiming to summarize the best available evidence. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the medical literature from 1966 to 2009 was performed. We selected eight randomized controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative treatment for acute nondisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures in adults. Data from included studies were pooled with use of fixed-effects and random-effects models with standard mean differences and risk ratios for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed with calculation of the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Four hundred and nineteen patients from eight trials were included. Two hundred and seven patients were treated surgically, and 212 were treated conservatively. Most trials lacked scientific rigor. Our primary outcome parameter, standardized functional outcome, which was assessed for 247 patients enrolled in four trials, significantly favored surgical treatment (p < 0.01). With regard to our secondary parameters, we found heterogeneous results that favored surgical treatment in terms of satisfaction (assessed in one study), grip strength (six studies), time to union (three studies), and time off work (five studies). In contrast, we found no significant differences between surgical and conservative treatment with regard to pain (two studies), range of motion (six studies), the rates of nonunion (six studies) and malunion (seven studies), and total treatment costs (two studies). The rate of complications was higher in the surgical treatment group (23.7%) than in the conservative group (9.1%), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.13). There was a nearly significantly higher rate of scaphotrapezial osteoarthritis in the surgical treatment group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on primary studies with limited methodological quality, this study suggests that surgical treatment is favorable for acute nondisplaced and minimally displaced scaphoid fractures with regard to functional outcome and time off work; however, surgical treatment engenders more complications. Thus, the long-term risks and short-term benefits of surgery should be carefully weighed in clinical decision-making.",2010,10.2106/JBJS.I.01214,92,6,1534-1544,eng,1535-1386 0021-9355,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and Fractures, Bone/surgery/*therapy and Scaphoid Bone/*injuries/surgery",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Bone Joint Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,NA

American volume,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of simultaneous or staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty have long been debated among orthopaedic surgeons. Advocates for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty posit that the benefits of decreased costs and recovery time, with no difference in functional outcomes, outweigh the economic costs of potential complications. The purpose of the study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with that of staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data sets from 2004 to 2007 were used to identify 24,574 simultaneous and 382,496 unilateral procedures. On the basis of the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, perioperative complications were categorized as minor, major, and mortality, and respective probability values were calculated. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data were used to determine hospital costs conditional on procedure type and complications. Rehabilitation costs, anesthesia costs, and heath utilities were estimated from the literature. To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching was used to match the groups on comorbid conditions, socioeconomic variables, and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Using the matched sample, all complication rates were higher for the staged group. The estimated mean cost (in 2012 U.S. dollars) was $43,401 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty compared with $72,233 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. The quality-adjusted life years gained were 9.31 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty and 9.29 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. On the basis of these matched results, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty dominated staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty with lower costs and better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this analysis, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty is more cost-effective than staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty, with lower costs and better outcomes for the average patient.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: There has been limited published information regarding capitellar fractures in the pediatric population. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize capitellar fracture patterns in children and adolescents and to assess early clinical and radiographic treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 37 children and adolescents with capitellar fractures presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital from 2004 to 2014 was performed. The mean patient age at the time of injury was 11.8 years. Medical records and radiographs were evaluated for fracture pattern, treatment, healing, and complications. Fractures were categorized on the basis of prevailing patterns of injury, and a classification system is proposed that aids in treatment decision-making. Thirty-two patients had follow-up of at least 6 weeks and were included for assessment of treatment outcomes. The mean follow-up was 12.3 months. RESULTS: Three predominant capitellar fracture patterns were identified. Type-I fractures (n = 25) were anterior shear injuries. Nondisplaced anterior shear fractures were successfully treated with cast immobilization. Displaced anterior shear fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, with good results in a majority of patients. Of the 21 patients with Type-Ib fractures eligible for analysis, 6 (29%) required a secondary surgical procedure for loss of motion related to soft-tissue contracture, osteonecrosis, implant prominence, and/or intra-articular loose bodies. Type-II fractures (n = 9) were posterolateral shear injuries, typically associated with ulnohumeral dislocations. Among 5 patients with displaced fractures and adequate follow-up, 3 patients were treated nonoperatively and had poor results, with loss of elbow motion or mechanical symptoms, and 2 patients were treated surgically and achieved good functional restoration. Type-III fractures (n = 3) were acute chondral shear injuries, which achieved full restoration of motion after surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A classification of pediatric capitellar fractures is proposed, guiding treatment and prognosis. Nondisplaced fractures heal successfully with cast immobilization. Good results may be expected with surgical fixation of displaced Type-I fractures (anterior shear). Type-II fractures (posterolateral shear) and Type-III fractures (chondral shear) are more subtle; advanced imaging and timely surgical management for displaced injuries are recommended to optimize clinical results.

Trent and Hakeos, William and Moutzouros, Vasilios",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,"BACKGROUND: While previous studies have shown higher union rates and a quicker return to work with operative treatment of substantially displaced clavicle fractures, there is disagreement whether operative treatment results in improved clinical outcomes. Patients who undergo operative treatment sometimes require additional surgery for implant removal. Nonoperative treatment may fail so that delayed surgical intervention is ultimately required. The duration for which the clinical benefits of operative treatment remain superior to those of nonoperative treatment has not been well established in the literature. Considering these uncertainties, surgeons are faced with a difficult decision regarding whether operative treatment of a midshaft clavicle fracture will be cost-effective. The purpose of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy by considering these uncertain parameters with use of decision-analysis techniques. METHODS: An expected-value decision tree was built to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for operative and nonoperative treatment of substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Values for parameters in the decision model were derived from the literature. Medical costs were obtained from the Medicare database. A Markov model was used to calculate the QALYs for the duration of life expectancy. The decision model was used to analyze the duration for which the clinical results of operative treatment were superior to those of nonoperative treatment during the first 5 years after the operation and during a lifetime. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters have the most influence on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Operative treatment was more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment in 54% and 68% of the Monte Carlo trials in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, respectively. The cost per QALY with operative management was <$38,000 and <$8,000 in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, respectively. This is below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. For operative treatment to remain cost-effective, its clinical benefits must persist for at least 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment is more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment for substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. The clinical benefits derived with operative treatment must persist for at least 3 years for operative treatment to remain cost-effective. This research should not be used to conclude that all clavicle fractures should be treated surgically. It is best that such a decision is made through a patient-surgeon shared decision-making process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level II.

American volume,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a heavily utilized resource to evaluate children suspected to have a musculoskeletal infection. Complex interdisciplinary workflows are involved with decision-making with regard to indications, anesthesia, contrast use, and procedural timing relative to the scan. This study assesses the impact of a quality improvement endeavor on MRI workflows at a tertiary pediatric medical center. METHODS: A registry of consecutively enrolled children for a multidisciplinary musculoskeletal infection program identified those evaluated with MRI from 2012 to 2018. Annual MRI process improvement feedback was provided to the key stakeholders. Demographic characteristics, laboratory parameters, MRI indications, anesthesia use, MRI findings, final diagnoses, scan duration, imaging protocol, surgical intervention following MRI, and length of stay were retrospectively compared between the 3 cohorts (initial, middle, and final) representing 2-year increments to assess the impact of the initiative. RESULTS: There were 526 original MRI scans performed to evaluate 1,845 children with suspected musculoskeletal infection. Anesthesia was used in 401 children (76.2%). When comparing the initial, middle, and final study period cohorts, significant improvement was demonstrated for the number of sequences per scan (7.5 sequences for the initial cohort, 5.8 sequences for the middle cohort, and 4.6 sequences for the final cohort; p < 0.00001), scan duration (73.6 minutes for the initial cohort, 52.1 minutes for the middle cohort, and 34.9 minutes for the final cohort; p < 0.00001), anesthesia duration (94.1 minutes for the initial cohort, 68.9 minutes for the middle cohort, and 53.2 minutes for the final cohort; p < 0.00001), and the rate of contrast use (87.6% for the initial cohort, 67.7% for the middle cohort, and 26.3% for the final cohort; p < 0.00001). There was also a trend toward a higher rate of procedures under continued anesthesia immediately following the MRI (70.2% in the initial cohort, 77.8% in the middle cohort, and 84.6% in the final cohort). During the final 6-month period, the mean scan duration was 24.4 minutes, anesthesia duration was 40.9 minutes, and the rate of contrast administration was 8.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive quality improvement through collaborative interdisciplinary communication and workflow redesign led to improved utilization of MRI and minimized contrast use for suspected musculoskeletal infection.
