However, applications at the point of care are still scarce. OBJECTIVE: Review and discuss case studies to understand current capabilities for applying AI/ML in the healthcare setting, and regulatory requirements in the US, Europe and China. METHODS: A targeted narrative literature review of AI/ML based digital tools was performed. Scientific publications (identified in PubMed) and grey literature (identified on the websites of regulatory agencies) were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: From the regulatory perspective, AI/ML-based solutions can be considered medical devices (i.e., Software as Medical Device, SaMD). A case series of SaMD is presented. First, tools for monitoring and remote management of chronic diseases are presented. Second, imaging applications for diagnostic support are discussed. Finally, clinical decision support tools to facilitate the choice of treatment and precision dosing are reviewed. While tested and validated algorithms for precision dosing exist, their implementation at the point of care is limited, and their regulatory and commercialization pathway is not clear. Regulatory requirements depend on the level of risk associated with the use of the device in medical practice, and can be classified into administrative (manufacturing and quality control), software-related (design, specification, hazard analysis, architecture, traceability, software risk analysis, cybersecurity, etc.), clinical evidence (including patient perspectives in some cases), non-clinical evidence (dosing validation and biocompatibility/toxicology) and other, such as e.g. benefit-to-risk determination, risk assessment and mitigation. There generally is an alignment between the US and Europe. China additionally requires that the clinical evidence is applicable to the Chinese population and recommends that a third-party central laboratory evaluates the clinical trial results. CONCLUSIONS: The number of promising AI/ML-based technologies is increasing, but few have been implemented widely at the point of care. The need for external validation, implementation logistics, and data exchange and privacy remain the main obstacles.",2020,10.3389/fphar.2020.00759,11,NA,759,eng,1663-9812,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in medical practice and chronic disease management and clinical decision support tools and model-informed precision dosing and precision dosing and real-world evidence and software as a medical device,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Natsiavas_2019_Frinph,JOUR,Computational Advances in Drug Safety: Systematic and Mapping Review of Knowledge Engineering Based Approaches,"Natsiavas, Pantelis and Malousi, Andigoni and Bousquet, Cedric and Jaulent, Marie-Christine and Koutkias, Vassilis",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Drug Safety (DS) is a domain with significant public health and social impact. Knowledge Engineering (KE) is the Computer Science discipline elaborating on methods and tools for developing ""knowledge-intensive"" systems, depending on a conceptual ""knowledge"" schema and some kind of ""reasoning"" process. The present systematic and mapping review aims to investigate KE-based approaches employed for DS and highlight the introduced added value as well as trends and possible gaps in the domain. Journal articles published between 2006 and 2017 were retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science(R) (873 in total) and filtered based on a comprehensive set of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The 80 finally selected articles were reviewed on full-text, while the mapping process relied on a set of concrete criteria (concerning specific KE and DS core activities, special DS topics, employed data sources, reference ontologies/terminologies, and computational methods, etc.). The analysis results are publicly available as online interactive analytics graphs. The review clearly depicted increased use of KE approaches for DS. The collected data illustrate the use of KE for various DS aspects, such as Adverse Drug Event (ADE) information collection, detection, and assessment. Moreover, the quantified analysis of using KE for the respective DS core activities highlighted room for intensifying research on KE for ADE monitoring, prevention and reporting. Finally, the assessed use of the various data sources for DS special topics demonstrated extensive use of dominant data sources for DS surveillance, i.e., Spontaneous Reporting Systems, but also increasing interest in the use of emerging data sources, e.g., observational healthcare databases, biochemical/genetic databases, and social media. Various exemplar applications were identified with promising results, e.g., improvement in Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) prediction, detection of drug interactions, and novel ADE profiles related with specific mechanisms of action, etc. Nevertheless, since the reviewed studies mostly concerned proof-of-concept implementations, more intense research is required to increase the maturity level that is necessary for KE approaches to reach routine DS practice. In conclusion, we argue that efficiently addressing DS data analytics and management challenges requires the introduction of high-throughput KE-based methods for effective knowledge discovery and management, resulting ultimately, in the establishment of a continuous learning DS system.",2019,10.3389/fphar.2019.00415,10,NA,415,eng,1663-9812,ontologies and pharmacovigilance and knowledge representation and drug safety and knowledge discovery and knowledge engineering and semantic technologies and terminologies,NA,NA,2019///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we show that a particular class of homomers with binding sites spanning multiple protein chains is particularly suitable for targeting by broad-spectrum antibacterial agents because due to the slow evolutionary change of such binding pockets, ligands of such homomers are much more likely to bind their homologs than ligands of monomers, or homomers with a single-chain binding site. Additionally, using de novo ligand design and deep learning, we show that the chemical compounds that can bind several different receptors have common structural characteristics and that halogens and fragments similar to the building blocks existing antimicrobials are overrepresented in them. Finally, we show that binding multiple receptors selects for flexible compounds, which are less likely to accumulate in Gram-negative bacteria; thus there is trade-off between reducing the emergence of resistance by multitargeting and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.",2019,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00220,62,21,9357-9374,eng,1520-4804 0022-2623,Protein Binding and *Drug Design and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology and Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects/metabolism and Ligands and Protein Multimerization/drug effects,NA,NA,2019/11/14/,J Med Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA

Meanwhile, as the Precision Medicine Initiative launched, precision drug design which aims at maximizing therapeutic effects while minimizing undesired side effects for an individual patient has entered a new stage. One of the key strategies of precision drug design is target based drug design. Once a key pathogenic target is identified, rational drug design which constitutes the major part of precision drug design can be performed. Examples of rational drug design on novel druggable targets and protein-protein interaction surfaces are summarized in this review. Besides, various kinds of computational modeling and simulation approaches increasingly benefit for the drug discovery progress. Molecular dynamic simulation, drug target prediction and in silico clinical trials are discussed. Moreover, due to the powerful ability in handling high-dimensional data and complex system, deep learning has efficiently promoted the applications of artificial intelligence in drug discovery and design. In this review, deep learning methods that tailor to precision drug design are carefully discussed.

In these conditions drugs should be avoided, adjusted, or accompanied by extra monitoring. The motivation for many drug-disease interactions in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) is sometimes insufficiently supported by (accessible) evidence. As a consequence the translation of SmPC to clinical practice may lead to non-specific recommendations. For the translation of this information to the real world, it is necessary to evaluate the available knowledge about drug-disease interactions, and to formulate specific recommendations for prescribers and pharmacists. The aim of this paper is to describe a standardized method how to develop practice recommendations for drug-disease interactions by literature review and expert opinion. METHODS: The development of recommendations for drug-disease interactions will follow a six-step plan involving a multidisciplinary expert panel (1). The scope of the drug-disease interaction will be specified by defining the disease and by describing relevant effects of this drug-disease interaction. Drugs possibly involved in this drug-disease interaction are selected by checking the official product information, literature, and expert opinion (2). Evidence will be collected from the official product information, guidelines, handbooks, and primary literature (3). Study characteristics and outcomes will be evaluated and presented in standardized reports, including preliminary conclusions on the clinical relevance and practice recommendations (4). The multidisciplinary expert panel will discuss the reports and will either adopt or adjust the conclusions (5). Practice recommendations will be integrated in clinical decision support systems and published (6). The results of the evaluated drug-disease interactions will remain up-to-date by screening new risk information, periodic literature review, and (re)assessments initiated by health care providers. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS: The practice recommendations will result in advices for specific DDSI. The content and considerations of these DDSIs will be published and implemented in all Clinical Decision Support Systems in the Netherlands.

In particular, plant-derived natural compounds, including phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, are gaining attention as they promote health and prevent disease. Although several in vitro methods have been developed to confirm the biological activities of natural compounds, there is still considerable room to reduce time and cost. To overcome these limitations, several in silico methods have been proposed for conducting large-scale analysis, but they are still limited in terms of dealing with incomplete and heterogeneous natural compound data. Here, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify the medicinal uses of natural compounds by exploiting massive and heterogeneous drug and natural compound data. The rationale behind this approach is that deep learning can effectively utilize heterogeneous features to alleviate incomplete information. Based on latent knowledge, molecular interactions, and chemical property features, we generated 686 dimensional features for 4,507 natural compounds and 2,882 approved and investigational drugs. The deep learning model was trained using the generated features and verified drug indication information. When the features of natural compounds were applied as input to the trained model, potential efficacies were successfully predicted with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",2020,10.3389/fphar.2020.584875,11,NA,584875,eng,1663-9812,deep learning and text mining and network analysis and chemical property and medicinal use and molecular interaction and natural compound and natural product,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Two literature reviews and semi-structured interviews (n = 143) with healthcare stakeholders in Europe and the US were conducted; results of these informed the design of focus group guides. Eight focus groups were conducted with European patients, industry representatives and regulators, and with US regulators and European/Canadian health technology assessment (HTA) representatives. Focus groups were analyzed thematically using NVivo. Results: Stakeholder perspectives on how PPS should be designed and conducted were as follows: 1) study design should be informed by the research questions and patient population; 2) preferred treatment attributes and levels, as well as trade-offs among attributes and levels should be investigated; 3) the patient sample and method should match the MPLC phase; 4) different stakeholders should collaborate; and 5) results from PPS should be shared with relevant stakeholders. The value of patient preferences in decision-making was found to increase with the level of patient preference sensitivity of decisions on medical products. Stakeholders mentioned that patient preferences are hardly used in current decision-making. Potential applications for patient preferences across industry, regulatory and HTA processes were identified. Four applications seemed most promising for systematic integration of patient preferences: 1) benefit-risk assessment by industry and regulators at the marketing-authorization phase; 2) assessment of major contribution to patient care by European regulators; 3) cost-effectiveness analysis; and 4) multi criteria decision analysis in HTA. Conclusions: The value of patient preferences for decision-making depends on the level of collaboration across stakeholders; the match between the research question, MPLC phase, sample, and preference method used in PPS; and the sensitivity of the decision regarding a medical product to patient preferences.

Xiao-Xu-Ming Decoction (XXMD) has been widely used to treat stroke and other neurological diseases for more than 1000 years in China. However, the synergistic mechanism of the constituents in XXMD for the potential treatment of AD is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to predict the potential targets and uncover the material basis of XXMD for the potential treatment of AD. A network pharmacology-based method, which combined data collection, drug-likeness filtering and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/T) properties filtering, target prediction and network analysis, was used to decipher the effect and potential targets of XXMD for the treatment of AD. Then, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory assay was used to screen the potential active constituents in XXMD for the treatment of AD, and the molecular docking was furtherly used to identify the binding ability of active constituents with AD-related target of AChE. Finally, three in vitro cell models were applied to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of potential lead compounds in XXMD. Through the China Natural Products Database, Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) Database, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)-Database @Taiwan and literature, a total of 1481 compounds in XXMD were finally collected. After ADME/T properties filtering, 908 compounds were used for the further study. Based on the prediction data, the constituents in XXMD formula could interact with 41 AD-related targets. Among them, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), estrogen receptor <ce><b1> (ER<ce><b1>) and AChE were the major targets. The constituents in XXMD were found to have the potential to treat AD through multiple AD-related targets. 62 constituents in it were found to interact with more than or equal to 10 AD-related targets. The prediction results were further validated by in vitro biology experiment, resulting in several potential anti-AD multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), including two AChE inhibitors with the IC(50) values ranging from 4.83 to 10.22 <ce><bc>M. Moreover, fanchinoline was furtherly found to prevent SH-SY5Y cells from the cytotoxicities induced by sodium nitroprusside, sodium dithionate and potassium chloride.

Final decision should take into account the societal value of new therapies. OBJECTIVE: This perspective paper discusses the socio-economic burden of disease as a specific reimbursement decision-making criterion and calls for the inclusion of it as a counterbalance to the cost-effectiveness and budget impact criteria. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economic burden is a decision-making criterion, accounting for diseases, for which the assessed medical technology is indicated. This indicator is usually researched through cost-of-illness studies that systematically quantify the socio-economic burden of diseases on the individual and on the society. This is a very important consideration as it illustrates direct budgetary consequences of diseases in the health system and indirect costs associated with patient or carer productivity losses. By measuring and comparing the socio-economic burden of different diseases to society, health authorities and payers could benefit in optimizing priority setting and resource allocation. New medical technologies, especially innovative therapies, present an excellent case study for the inclusion of socio-economic burden in reimbursement decision-making. Assessment and appraisal have been greatly concentrated so far on cost-effectiveness and budget impact, marginalizing all other considerations. In this context, data on disease burden and inclusion of explicit criterion of socio-economic burden in reimbursement decision-making may be highly beneficial. Realizing the magnitude of the lost socio-economic contribution resulting from diseases in question could be a reasonable way for policy makers to accept a higher valuation of innovative therapies.",2016,10.3389/fphar.2016.00252,7,NA,252,eng,1663-9812,decision-making and cost-effectiveness and health technology assessment and rare diseases and burden of disease and cost-of-illness and reimbursement and socio-economic burden,NA,NA,2016///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the advent of high-throughput technologies as well as chemo- and bio-informatics tools presents pan-omics data as the way forward to precision medicine, personalized health care and tailored-made therapeutics can be only envisaged when interindividual variability in response to/toxicity of xenobiotics can be interpreted and thus, predicted. We know that such variability is the net outcome of genetics (host and microbiota) and environmental factors (diet, lifestyle, polypharmacy, and microbiota) and for this, tremendous efforts have been made to clarify key-molecules from correlation to causality to clinical significance. Herein, we focus on the host-microbiome interplay and its direct and indirect impact on efficacy and toxicity of xenobiotics and we inevitably wonder about the role of viruses, as the least acknowledged ones. We present the emerging discipline of pharmacometabolomics-informed viromics, in which pre-dose metabotypes can assist modeling and prediction of interindividual response to/toxicity of xenobiotics.

Pisanu_2019_Frinph,JOUR,Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia: Insights From Genetic Studies and Machine Learning Approaches,"Pisanu, Claudia and Squassina, Alessio",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 23 million people worldwide. It is considered the eighth leading cause of disability according to the World Health Organization and is associated with a significant reduction in life expectancy. Antipsychotics represent the first-choice treatment in SCZ, but approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to acute treatment. These patients are generally defined as treatment-resistant and are eligible for clozapine treatment. Treatment-resistant patients show a more severe course of the disease, but it has been suggested that treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) may constitute a distinct phenotype that is more than just a more severe form of SCZ. TRS is heritable, and genetics has been shown to play an important role in modulating response to antipsychotics. Important efforts have been put into place in order to better understand the genetic architecture of TRS, with the main goal of identifying reliable predictive markers that might improve the management and quality of life of TRS patients.

This activity can be time-consuming because it requires the collection of both patient and medication information. In this paper, we present two visualization and data mining applications to make this task easier for the practitioner. These tools have been developed and tested using the biomedical data warehouse eHOP (Hospital Biomedical Data Warehouse) of the Rennes University Hospital Centre. The first application is a tool to visualize the patient electronic health record in the form of a timeline. All patient data is collected and displayed chronologically. The usability test of the timeline has been very positive (SUS score: 82.5) and the tool is now available for practitioners in their daily practice. The second application is a tool to visualize and search the sequences of a patient cohort. The visual interface allow user to quickly visualize sequences. A query builder allows user to search for sequences in relation with a reference sequence, such as a prescription sequence followed by an abnormal biological value. The sequences are then visually aligned with this reference sequence and ranked by similarity. The GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern) and Apriori algorithms allow us to display a summary of the sequences list by searching for common sequences and associations. The tool was tested on a use case which consisted in detection of inappropriate drug administration. Compared to a random order, we showed this ranking system saved the practitioner time in this task (to analyze one sequence, 3.49 <c2><b1> 3.54 vs. 2.26 <c2><b1> 2.86 s, p = 0.0003).

In the Peruvian Social Security (EsSalud), infliximab is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (in cases refractory to conventional treatment). Biosimilars are a safe and effective alternative approved for these diseases in patients who start treatment with infliximab. Nevertheless, there are people in treatment with the biological reference product (BRP), in whom the continuing therapy with a biosimilar biological product (BBP) must be evaluated. Objectives: To synthesize the best available evidence, calculate a preliminary financial impact and conduct technical discussions about the interchangeability into biosimilar in patients receiving treatment with original infliximab for medical conditions approved in EsSalud. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review of controlled clinical trials. Primary search was performed in Pubmed- MEDLINE, SCOPUS, WOS, EMBASE, TRIPDATABASE, DARE, Cochrane Library, NICE, AHRQ, SMC, McMaster-PLUS, CADTH, and HSE until June-2018. We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias. Also, we implemented a preliminary financial analysis about the impact of biosimilar introduction on institutional purchasing budget. Moreover, technical meetings with medical doctors specialized in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology were held for discussing findings. Results: In primary search, 1136 records were identified, and 357 duplicates were removed. From 799 records, we excluded 765 after title and abstract evaluation. From 14 full-text appraised documents, we included five clinical trials in the risk of bias assessment: four studies evaluated CTP-13 and one tested SB2. Two double-blind clinical trials reported no differences in efficacy and safety profiles between maintenance group (INF/INF) and interchangeability group in all diseases included (INF/CTP-13) and rheumatoid arthritis (CTP13 and SB2). In the other three studies, open-label extension of primary clinical trials, no differences were founded in efficacy and safety profiles between CTP-13/CTP-13 and INF/CTP-13 groups. In financial analysis, the inclusion of biosimilars implied savings around S/7<c2><b4>642,780.00 (1USD=S/3.30) on purchasing budget of EsSalud. In technical meetings, beyond certain concerns, specialists agreed with the findings. Conclusions: Evidence from clinical trials support that there are no differences in efficacy or safety of continuing the treatment with Infliximab BRP or exchanging into its biosimilar in patients with medical conditions approved in EsSalud. Financial analysis shows that the biosimilar introduction produce savings in purchasing institutional budget. Therefore, based on cost-opportunity principle, exchanging into biosimilar in patients receiving the original Infliximab, is a valid therapeutic alternative in the Peruvian Social Security.",2019,10.3389/fphar.2019.01010,10,NA,1010,eng,1663-9812,decision making and biosimilar and Infliximab and interchangeability and Latin-American,NA,NA,2019///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, the computational approaches could be used to develop alternative methods for toxicity prediction. We have developed a tool for the prediction of molecular toxicity along with the aqueous solubility and permeability of any molecule/metabolite. Using a comprehensive and curated set of toxin molecules as a training set, the different chemical and structural based features such as descriptors and fingerprints were exploited for feature selection, optimization and development of machine learning based classification and regression models. The compositional differences in the distribution of atoms were apparent between toxins and non-toxins, and hence, the molecular features were used for the classification and regression. On 10-fold cross-validation, the descriptor-based, fingerprint-based and hybrid-based classification models showed similar accuracy (93%) and Matthews's correlation coefficient (0.84). The performances of all the three models were comparable (Matthews's correlation coefficient = 0.84-0.87) on the blind dataset. In addition, the regression-based models using descriptors as input features were also compared and evaluated on the blind dataset. Random forest based regression model for the prediction of solubility performed better (R(2) = 0.84) than the multi-linear regression (MLR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) models, whereas, the partial least squares based regression model for the prediction of permeability (caco-2) performed better (R(2) = 0.68) in comparison to the random forest and MLR based regression models.

Burnier_2018_Frinph,JOUR,Is There a Threshold for Medication Adherence? Lessons Learnt From Electronic Monitoring of Drug Adherence,"Burnier, Michel",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Medication adherence is a well-recognized problem in the management of patients with chronic diseases needing a long-term pharmacotherapy. While fighting against non-adherence, an important question frequently arises, i.e., how much adherence is enough to obtain the full treatment benefits? Most studies having attempted to answer this question have used large pharmacy records and health care databases to quantify the percentage of days covered by the prescribed treatment and hence deduce a threshold below which there appears to be fewer benefits from therapy. In the present paper, the use of data obtained using electronic monitoring of adherence is discussed as another means to assess adherence thresholds with a particular emphasis on hypertension. The data show that even with the use of electronic monitoring of adherence, which provides a comprehensive dosing history, it is extremely difficult to define an adherence threshold in hypertension. This is due to many factors that need to be taken into account, including not only the pattern of patients' adherence and their clinical and environmental characteristics, but also the pharmacological characteristics of the prescribed drugs, the severity of the disease and many others. To determine adherence cut-offs more precisely, specific protocols should be designed to answer the question in various clinical conditions. These protocols should be conducted in well-defined patients' groups, they should use the most reliable methods to measure adherence providing if possible a detailed dosing history perhaps combined with drugs levels in blood or urine. These studies should also choose the best methods to measure clinical endpoints, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure in the case of hypertension. One important aspect is that datasets should be solid and large enough to be able to analyze adherence data as a continuous variable using newly developed mathematical models including new metrics catching the complexity of adherence. The rapid development of new technologies like devices, connectivity, and analytics, will probably provide new solutions to improve our ability to define valid and clinically useful adherence thresholds in various therapeutic areas.",2018,10.3389/fphar.2018.01540,9,NA,1540,eng,1663-9812,blood pressure and pharmacology and genotype and hypertension and cardiovascular and percentage days covered,NA,NA,2018///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Climent_2018_Frinph,JOUR,Decision Tree for Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment by Community Pharmacists,"Climent, Maria Teresa and Pardo, Juan and Munoz-Almaraz, Francisco Javier and Guerrero, Maria Dolores and Moreno, Lucrecia",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Purpose: The early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is essential in aging societies where dementia is becoming a common manifestation among the elderly. Thus our aim is to develop a decision tree to discriminate individuals at risk of MCI among non-institutionalized elderly users of community pharmacy. A more clinically and patient-oriented role of the community pharmacist in primary care makes the dispensation of medication an adequate situation for an effective, rapid, easy, and reproducible screening of MCI. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 728 non-institutionalized participants older than 65. A total of 167 variables were collected such as age, gender, educational attainment, daily sleep duration, reading frequency, subjective memory complaint, and medication. Two screening tests were used to detect possible MCI: Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants classified as positive were referred to clinical diagnosis. A decision tree and predictive models are presented as a result of applying techniques of machine learning for a more efficient enrollment. Results: One hundred and twenty-eight participants (17.4%) scored positive on MCI tests. A recursive partitioning algorithm with the most significant variables determined that the most relevant for the decision tree are: female sex, sleeping more than 9 h daily, age higher than 79 years as risk factors, and reading frequency. Moreover, psychoanaleptics, nootropics, and antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory drugs achieve a high score of importance according to the predictive algorithms. Furthermore, results obtained from these algorithms agree with the current research on MCI. Conclusion: Lifestyle-related factors such as sleep duration and the lack of reading habits are associated with the presence of positive in MCI test. Moreover, we have depicted how machine learning provides a sound methodology to produce tools for early detection of MCI in community pharmacy. Impact of findings on practice: The community of pharmacists provided with adequate tools could develop a crucial task in the early detection of MCI to redirect them immediately to the specialists in neurology or psychiatry.

Dispensing data is a valuable and commonly utilized measure due accessibility in electronic health data. The purpose of this study was to analyze the changes on adherence implementation rates before and after a community pharmacist intervention integrated in usual real life practice, incorporating big data analysis techniques to evaluate Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) from pharmacy dispensing data. Methods: Retrospective observational study. A de-identified database of dispensing data from 20,335 patients (n = 11,257 on rosuvastatin, n = 6,797 on irbesartan, and n = 2,281 on desvenlafaxine) was analyzed. Included patients received a pharmacist-led medication adherence intervention and had dispensing records before and after the intervention. As a measure of adherence implementation, PDC was utilized. Analysis of the database was performed using SQL and Python. Results: Three months after the pharmacist intervention there was an increase on average PDC from 50.2% (SD: 30.1) to 66.9% (SD: 29.9) for rosuvastatin, from 50.8% (SD: 30.3) to 68% (SD: 29.3) for irbesartan and from 47.3% (SD: 28.4) to 66.3% (SD: 27.3) for desvenlafaxine. These rates declined over 12 months to 62.1% (SD: 32.0) for rosuvastatin, to 62.4% (SD: 32.5) for irbesartan and to 58.1% (SD: 31.1) for desvenlafaxine. In terms of the proportion of adherent patients (PDC >= 80.0%) the trend was similar, increasing after the pharmacist intervention from overall 17.4 to 41.2% and decreasing after one year of analysis to 35.3%. Conclusion: Big database analysis techniques provided results on adherence implementation over 2 years of analysis.

Insights gained from this study were used to provide an optimal approach for implementing HB-HTA in Poland. Materials and methods: Firstly, we carried out a systematic review in PubMed and embase. Secondly, we searched for gray literature via the AdHopHTA online handbook and the design book of the AdHopHTA project, as well as literature describing healthcare systems provided by the WHO. Then, we conducted in-depth interviews with HB-HTA experts from four countries. Finally, we selected ten countries from Europe and prepared frameworks for data collection and analyses. Results: The selected countries (Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Austria) are examples of decentralized or deconcentrated healthcare systems. In terms of HB-HTA, differences in organisational models (independent group, stand-alone, integrated-essential, integrated-specialised), type of financing (internally vs. externally), collaboration with an HTA National Agency and other stakeholders (e.g., Patients' Associations) were identified.

Courtois_2018_Frinph,JOUR,Propensity Score-Based Approaches in High Dimension for Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection: an Empirical Comparison on the French Spontaneous Reporting Database,"Courtois, Emeline and Pariente, Antoine and Salvo, Francesco and Volatier, Etienne and Tubert-Bitter, Pascale and Ahmed, Ismail",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Classical methods used for signal detection in pharmacovigilance rely on disproportionality analysis of counts aggregating spontaneous reports of a given adverse drug reaction. In recent years, alternative methods have been proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports such as penalized multiple logistic regression approaches. These approaches address some well-known biases resulting from disproportionality methods. However, while penalization accounts for computational constraints due to high-dimensional data, it raises the issue of determining the regularization parameter and eventually that of an error-controlling decision rule. We present a new automated signal detection strategy for pharmacovigilance systems, based on propensity scores (PS) in high dimension. PSs are increasingly used to assess a given association with high-dimensional observational healthcare databases in accounting for confusion bias. Our main aim was to develop a method having the same advantages as multiple regression approaches in dealing with bias, while relying on the statistical multiple comparison framework as regards decision thresholds, by considering false discovery rate (FDR)-based decision rules. We investigate four PS estimation methods in high dimension: a gradient tree boosting (GTB) algorithm from machine-learning and three variable selection algorithms. For each (drug, adverse event) pair, the PS is then applied as adjustment covariate or by using two kinds of weighting: inverse proportional treatment weighting and matching weights. The different versions of the new approach were compared to a univariate approach, which is a disproportionality method, and to two penalized multiple logistic regression approaches, directly applied on spontaneous reporting data. Performance was assessed through an empirical comparative study conducted on a reference signal set in the French national pharmacovigilance database (2000-2016) that was recently proposed for drug-induced liver injury. Multiple regression approaches performed better in detecting true positives and false positives. Nonetheless, the performances of the PS-based methods using matching weights was very similar to that of multiple regression and better than with the univariate approach. In addition to being able to control FDR statistical errors, the proposed PS-based strategy is an interesting alternative to multiple regression approaches.",2018,10.3389/fphar.2018.01010,9,NA,1010,eng,1663-9812,pharmacovigilance and signal detection and FDR and penalized multiple regression and propensity score in high dimension and spontaneous reports,NA,NA,2018///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Optimization of supply chains to cut losses related to overstocking, expiration, and inefficiencies protect the investments and strengthen health systems to better deliver the health services. This article shares the experience of developing a service-driven-software for pharmaceutical supplies during emergency conditions and disasters, and the advantages gained. In 2005, Logistic Support System (LSS), the updated version of SUMA (Supply Management), was introduced by WHO during the earthquake in Pakistan which had offered valuable but limited services to many countries. Moving from ad hoc to a more organized approach, the medical donations and stockpiles of essential medicinal supplies were inventoried on LSS database for managing the dispatch of medical supplies to the disaster-hit area in a shortest possible time. Post disaster rescue and rehabilitation work further instigated the need for development of a new software, Pharmaceutical Information Management System (PIMS), that was effective in the emergency as well as routine inventory operations. It was used for efficient and improved access of medicines and faster decision making. The new systems proved vital to anticipate over/under stocking through proactive alerts and prompting. The updated information on epidemiological and drug utilization needs were crucial for the effective quantification and ordering throughout the supply chain. Implementation of PIMS demanded appreciable customization including conversion of system from stand-alone to online system with consolidation of information on stocks from all locations.

METHODS: Data related to the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency (TITCK) organizational structure and general information were collected from publicly available sources. A standard questionnaire was then used to collect data with the aim of identifying the TITCK's review practices and key milestones for the marketing authorization process. Subsequently, a comparison with the previous study was conducted to identify the key changes and developments that had taken place from 2015- 2018. RESULTS: The TITCK has made considerable efforts to improve its regulatory capacity since 2016, which has contributed to the overall decrease in the agency review times. The overall median approval time for new active substances; however, increased from 529 calendar days (2016) to 663 calendar days (2018), with the review time in the agency decreasing from 408 calendar days to 326 calendar days, while the company time increased from 137 to 268 calendar days, respectively, over this period.

A study was conducted to compare the registration review model used by the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency (Turkiye Ilac ve Tibbi Cihaz Kurumu; TITCK) with those of four similar-sized regulatory agencies to identify areas of strength and those requiring further improvement within the TITCK in relation to the review process as well as to assess the level of adherence to good review practices (GRevP) in order to facilitate the TITCK progress toward agency goals. Methods: A questionnaire was completed and validated by the TITCK to collect data related to agency organizational structure, regulatory review process and decision-making practices. Similar questionnaires were completed and validated by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada, Singapore's Health Science Authority (HSA), and the Saudi Arabia Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). Results: The TITCK performs a full review for all new active substance (NAS) applications. Submission of a Certificate of Pharmaceutical product (CPP) with an application is not required; however, evidence of approval in another country is required for final authorization by the TITCK. Pricing data are not required by the TITCK at the time of submission; however, pricing must be completed to enable products to be commercially available. Mean approval times at the TITCK exceeded the agency's overall target time suggesting room for improved performance, consistency, and process predictability. Measures of GRevP are in place, but the implementation by the TITCK is not currently formalized. Discussion: Comparisons made through this study enabled recommendations to the TITCK that include streamlining the good manufacturing practice (GMP) process by sharing GMP inspection outcomes and certificates issued by other authorities, thus avoiding the delays by the current process; removing the requirement for prior approval or CPP; introducing shared or joint reviews with other similar regulatory authorities; formally implementing and monitoring GRevP; defining target timing for each review milestone; redefining the pricing process; and improving transparency by developing publicly available summaries for the basis of approval.",2018,10.3389/fphar.2018.00009,9,NA,9,eng,1663-9812,Health Canada and HSA and SFDA and TGA and TITCK and Turkish regulatory review,NA,NA,2018///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) have independently proposed value assessment frameworks. Objectives: To comprehensively examine the value of nivolumab and pembrolizumab by two value assessment frameworks with a cohort of published randomized controlled trials and offer insight into the association between these two frameworks. Methods: Trials were identified with a cutoff date of Nov 30th, 2019. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to establish the predictive value of ASCO-VF score to meet ESMO-MCBS grade and discriminate the agreement of these two value assessment tools. Spearman correlation was used to assess the association between monthly cost and ASCO-VF score/ESMO-MCBS grade. Results: 19 randomized controlled trials were eligible. seven (36.8%) trials were of treatment included nivolumab while 12 (63.2%) pembrolizumab. 8 (42.1%) of the trials were of treatments for non-small-cell lung cancer, 5 (26.3%) for melanoma, 2 (10.5%) were for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 2 (10.5%) for gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and 1 (5.3%) for urothelial cancer and renal-cell carcinoma respectively. ASCO scores ranged from 7 to 94.7 with median 40.90. 11 (57.9%) trials met the ESMO criteria for meaningful value achieved. Of 14 trials not meeting the ASCO cutoff score, only 8 did not meet the meaningful ESMO criteria. Agreement between these two frameworks thresholds was only fair (<ce><ba> = 0.412, P<0.05). A negative correlation was noted between increment monthly cost and value assessment results. Conclusion: There is only fair correlation between ASCO and ESMO value assessment frameworks.

Keyter_2018_Frinph,JOUR,"The South African Regulatory System: Past, Present, and Future","Keyter, Andrea and Banoo, Shabir and Salek, Sam and Walker, Stuart",Frontiers in pharmacology,"The drive for improved regulatory systems and the establishment of a more effective regulatory framework in South Africa has been evident for the past two decades but despite political intentions and legislative revisions success has been limited to date. Efforts to address the increasing volume of applications that have been received have to date failed and resources have been stretched to capacity resulting in the development of a significant backlog and extended timelines for product registration. The promulgation of the recently amended Medicines and Related Substance Act of 1965 triggered the establishment of the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) as a separate juristic person outside of the National Department of Health to replace the former medicine regulatory authority the Medicines Control Council (MCC). The aim of this review is to provide the historical context supporting the new regulatory environment in South Africa and the transition from the MCC to SAHPRA. Key recommendations to SAHPRA to ensure the full potential of the new regulatory environment in South Africa include: establishing a quality management system to safeguard accountability, consistency and transparency and to streamline the implementation of good review practices including quality decision-making practices and benefit-risk assessment; the measurement and monitoring of regulatory performance, targets for overall approval time and key review milestones to instill a culture of accurate metrics collection and measurement of key performance indicators and their continuous improvement and the employment of a risk-based approach to the evaluation of medical products and codify the use of facilitated regulatory pathways in policy and culture. The application of a risk-based approach to regulatory review commensurate with a product's risk to patients will facilitate the application of increased resources for pharmacovigilance activities and to support the reliance and recognition of reference agencies.",2018,10.3389/fphar.2018.01407,9,NA,1407,eng,1663-9812,legislation and MCC and Medicines Control Council and risk-based review and South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA),NA,NA,2018///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although several biologics have demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability in short-term trials, treatment guidelines recommend them as third line therapies due to a relative lack of long-term safety data. Objective: To determine the frequency and severity of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of biologics in the treatment of PsA and RA, and possible risk factors for such events in a real-life setting. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in PsA and RA patients only taking long-term biological agents from 2003 to 2011. Sources of information included dispensing pharmacy data and interviews with patients. Research staff conducted telephone interviews with patients inquiring about any apparent medication-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or SAEs. ADR/SAE's data was based on pharmacy reports. We conducted a multivariate analysis to identify the factors associated with the risk of ADRs. Results: Of the 305 patients identified, we interviewed 268 patients. Most of these were taking adalimumab 127 (47.4%), 52 (19.4%) etanercept, 42 (15.7%) infliximab, 25 (9.3%) rituximab, 10 (3.7%) abatacept, 9 (3.4%) efalizumab, and 3 (1.1%) tocilizumab. Of the 268 patients, 116 (43.3%) experienced one or more adverse events related to biological agents with 1.6 events per patient, and of these 29 (25%) experienced one or more SAEs, with majority subjected to hospitalizations. The most frequently reported ADRs were administration site reactions as observed in 73 patients (27.2%), infections in 30 patients (11.2%), effects on nervous system in 22 patients (8.2%), and 15 (5.6%) patients withdrew due to ADRs. The use of rituximab was related with less risk of ADR [PR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.96; p = 0.04] than other agents. No other predisposing factors were associated with risk of ADR. The monitoring of patients (medical consultation and laboratory test) was only completed by 48 patients (30.4%). Conclusion: These data showed the early biological experience in Brazil that were associated with ADRs, withdrawals due to ADRs and SAEs. The quantification of adverse effects (serious or nonserious) considering close monitoring and patients' perceptions are increasingly important for future decision-making.",2019,10.3389/fphar.2019.00965,10,NA,965,eng,1663-9812,safety and rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis and adverse reaction and biologic agents,NA,NA,2019///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA

M.",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Many studies have shown that the efficacy and risk of side effects of drug treatment is influenced by genetic variants. Evidence based guidelines are essential for implementing pharmacogenetic knowledge in daily clinical practice to optimize pharmacotherapy of individual patients. A literature search was performed to select committees developing guidelines with recommendations being published in English. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG), the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS), and the French National Network (Reseau) of Pharmacogenetics (RNPGx) were selected. Their guidelines were compared with regard to the methodology of development, translation of genotypes to predicted phenotypes, pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and recommendations on genotyping. A detailed overview of all recommendations for gene-drug combinations is given. The committees have similar methodologies of guideline development. However, the objectives differed at the start of their projects, which have led to unique profiles and strengths of their guidelines. DPWG and CPIC have a main focus on pharmacotherapeutic recommendations for a large number of drugs in combination with a patient's genotype or predicted phenotype. DPWG, CPNDS and RNPGx also recommend on performing genetic testing in daily clinical practice, with RNPGx even describing specific clinical settings or medical conditions for which genotyping is recommended. Discordances exist, however committees also initiated harmonizing projects. The outcome of a consensus project was to rename ""extensive metabolizer (EM)"" to ""normal metabolizer (NM)"". It was decided to translate a CYP2D6 genotype with one nonfunctional allele (activity score 1.0) into the predicted phenotype of intermediate metabolizer (IM). Differences in recommendations are the result of the methodologies used, such as assessment of dose adjustments of tricyclic antidepressants. In some cases, indication or dose specific recommendations are given for example for clopidogrel, codeine, irinotecan. The following drugs have recommendations on genetic testing with the highest level: abacavir (HLA), clopidogrel (CYP2C19), fluoropyrimidines (DPYD), thiopurines (TPMT), irinotecan (UGT1A1), codeine (CYP2D6), and cisplatin (TPMT). The guidelines cover many drugs and genes, genotypes, or predicted phenotypes. Because of this and their unique features, considering the totality of guidelines are of added value. In conclusion, many evidence based pharmacogenetics guidelines with clear recommendations are available for clinical decision making by healthcare professionals, patients and other stakeholders.",2020,10.3389/fphar.2020.595219,11,NA,595219,eng,1663-9812,guidelines and pharmacogenomics and recommendations and pharmacogenetics and CPIC and CPNDS and DPWG and RNPGx,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Poley_2015_Frinph,JOUR,Nutrition and health technology assessment: when two worlds meet,"Poley, Marten J.",Frontiers in pharmacology,"There is a growing recognition that nutrition may have a positive impact on public health and that it may reduce medical expenditures. Yet, such claims need to be substantiated by evidence. This evidence could be delivered by health technology assessment (HTA), which can be thought of as the evaluation of technologies for clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and ethical, legal, and social impacts. The application of HTA to the field of ""nutrition interventions"" is recent. So far, HTA and nutrition have represented two worlds far apart in many respects. This contribution, roughly, addresses the following issues: is there a need for HTAs in the field of nutrition, what would such HTAs look like, and how can the results coming from these HTAs optimally aid policy making? In essence, HTAs of nutrition have much of the same basic principles and structure as HTAs of ""classical"" health care treatments. Nevertheless, there are challenges to rigorous HTAs of nutrition interventions, for various reasons. To mention a few: the evidence base for nutrition interventions is less well developed than that for many health care treatments. Furthermore, it is a matter of debate which outcome measures should be used in HTAs of nutrition. For example, one may argue that nutrition not only has health effects, but also effects that are not captured by traditional health-related quality of life measures (e.g., the pleasure of eating, effects relating to ease of use, or effects on well-being). HTAs in the field of nutrition may deliver information valuable to a wide range of stakeholders, including consumers/patients, health professionals, hospital administrators, insurers, and decision makers. The results of HTAs are typically used in making treatment guidelines, in informing decisions about reimbursement or about public health campaigns, etc. Yet, it is uncertain how the results of HTAs of nutrition can be used optimally. For example, would it be possible to summarize the results of a HTA in a single ratio (such as costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained) and then to either approve or reject the intervention based on this ratio, compared to a certain threshold? Apart from that, in the field of nutrition, it is typically not about reimbursement of a technology. Related to this, it is important that the message from HTAs of nutrition is brought to a range of stakeholders including the general population and that these HTAs are tailored to the decision-making context. To conclude, a growing need is felt for HTA-type evaluations of nutrition, which are sparse these days. Little thought has been given to developing an optimal methodology for HTAs of nutrition and to how its results should be integrated into policy making. Further work in these areas would stimulate the development of nutrition interventions that yield a gain in societal welfare. To achieve this, the two worlds of HTA and nutrition need to be brought together.",2015,10.3389/fphar.2015.00232,6,NA,232,eng,1663-9812,cost-effectiveness and nutrition and health technology assessment and economic evaluation and nutrition economics,NA,NA,2015///,Front Pharmacol,NA,NA,NA,NA
