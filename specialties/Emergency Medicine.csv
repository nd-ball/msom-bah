Kwon_2019_Resu,JOUR,Deep-learning-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic system to predict clinical outcomes,"Kwon, Joon-Myoung and Jeon, Ki-Hyun and Kim, Hyue Mee and Kim, Min Jeong and Lim, Sungmin and Kim, Kyung-Hee and Song, Pil Sang and Park, Jinsik and Choi, Rak Kyeong and Oh, Byung-Hee",Resuscitation,"AIM: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major healthcare burden, and prognosis is critical in decision-making for treatment and the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic system (DCAPS) for predicting neurologic recovery and survival to discharge. METHODS: The study subjects were patients from the Korea OHCA registry who experienced return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA. A total of 36,190 patients were exclusively divided into a set of 28,045 subjects for derivation data and 8,145 subjects for validation data. We used information available for the time of ROSC as predictor variables, and the endpoints were neurologic recovery (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) and survival to discharge. The DCAPS was developed using the derivation data and represented the favorability of prognosis with a score between 0 and 100. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of DCAPS for predicting neurologic recovery for the validation data was 0.953 [95% confidence interval 0.952-0.954]; these results significantly outperformed those of logistic regression (0.947 [0.943-0.948]), random forest (0.943 [0.942-0.945]), support vector machine (0.930 [0.929-0.932]), and conventional methods of a previous study (0.817 [0.815-0.820]). The AUROC of the DCAPS for survival to discharge was 0.901 [0.900-0.903], and this result significantly outperformed those of other models as well. CONCLUSIONS: The DCAPS predicted neurologic recovery and survival to discharge of OHCA patients accurately and outperformed the conventional method and other machine-learning methods.",2019,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.04.007,139,NA,84-91,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,"Machine learning and Artificial intelligence and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Neural networks and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Registries and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and *Deep Learning and Decision support techniques and Out-of-Hospital cardiac arrest and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*mortality/therapy",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Janke_2016_Anofemme,JOUR,Exploring the Potential of Predictive Analytics and Big Data in Emergency Care,"Janke, Alexander T. and Overbeek, Daniel L. and Kocher, Keith E. and Levy, Phillip D.",Annals of emergency medicine,"Clinical research often focuses on resource-intensive causal inference, whereas the potential of predictive analytics with constantly increasing big data sources remains largely unexplored. Basic prediction, divorced from causal inference, is much easier with big data. Emergency care may benefit from this simpler application of big data. Historically, predictive analytics have played an important role in emergency care as simple heuristics for risk stratification. These tools generally follow a standard approach: parsimonious criteria, easy computability, and independent validation with distinct populations. Simplicity in a prediction tool is valuable, but technological advances make it no longer a necessity. Emergency care could benefit from clinical predictions built using data science tools with abundant potential input variables available in electronic medical records. Patients' risks could be stratified more precisely with large pools of data and lower resource requirements for comparing each clinical encounter to those that came before it, benefiting clinical decisionmaking and health systems operations. The largest value of predictive analytics comes early in the clinical encounter, in which diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty are high and resource-committing decisions need to be made. We propose an agenda for widening the application of predictive analytics in emergency care. Throughout, we express cautious optimism because there are myriad challenges related to database infrastructure, practitioner uptake, and patient acceptance. The quality of routinely compiled clinical data will remain an important limitation. Complementing big data sources with prospective data may be necessary if predictive analytics are to achieve their full potential to improve care quality in the emergency department.",2016,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2015.06.024,67,2,227-236,eng,1097-6760 0196-0644,"United States and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Predictive Value of Tests and Biomedical Research and *Risk Assessment and Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration and Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data and Medical Informatics/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2016/02//undefined,Ann Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhai_2014_Resu,JOUR,Developing and evaluating a machine learning based algorithm to predict the need of pediatric intensive care unit transfer for newly hospitalized children,"Zhai, Haijun and Brady, Patrick and Li, Qi and Lingren, Todd and Ni, Yizhao and Wheeler, Derek S. and Solti, Imre",Resuscitation,"BACKGROUND: Early warning scores (EWS) are designed to identify early clinical deterioration by combining physiologic and/or laboratory measures to generate a quantified score. Current EWS leverage only a small fraction of Electronic Health Record (EHR) content. The planned widespread implementation of EHRs brings the promise of abundant data resources for prediction purposes. The three specific aims of our research are: (1) to develop an EHR-based automated algorithm to predict the need for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer in the first 24h of admission; (2) to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm on a held-out test data set; and (3) to compare the effectiveness of the new algorithm's with those of two published Pediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS). METHODS: The cases were comprised of 526 encounters with 24-h Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer. In addition to the cases, we randomly selected 6772 control encounters from 62516 inpatient admissions that were never transferred to the PICU. We used 29 variables in a logistic regression and compared our algorithm against two published PEWS on a held-out test data set. RESULTS: The logistic regression algorithm achieved 0.849 (95% CI 0.753-0.945) sensitivity, 0.859 (95% CI 0.850-0.868) specificity and 0.912 (95% CI 0.905-0.919) area under the curve (AUC) in the test set.

However, evidence-based practice guidelines face barriers to dissemination, implementation, usability, integration into practice, and use. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policies have been shown to be safe and effective and are even cited by other specialties. In spite of the benefits of the ACEP clinical policies, implementation of these clinical practice guidelines into physician practice continues to be a challenge. Translation of the ACEP clinical policies into real-time computerized clinical decision support systems could help address these barriers and improve clinician decision making at the point of care. The investigators convened an emergency medicine informatics expert panel and used a Delphi consensus process to assess the feasibility of translating the current ACEP clinical policies into clinical decision support content.

Christie_2018_Thjooftranaccasu,JOUR,Machine learning without borders? An adaptable tool to optimize mortality prediction in diverse clinical settings,"Christie, S.

Validated metrics rely on prespecified variables and often require advanced diagnostics, which are unfeasible in resource-constrained contexts. We hypothesize that machine learning will generate superior mortality prediction in both high-income and low- and middle-income country cohorts. METHODS: SuperLearner, an ensemble machine-learning algorithm, was applied to data from three prospective trauma cohorts: a highest-activation cohort in the United States, a high-volume center cohort in South Africa (SA), and a multicenter registry in Cameroon. Cross-validation was used to assess model discrimination of discharge mortality by site using receiver operating characteristic curves. SuperLearner discrimination was compared with standard scoring methods. Clinical variables driving SuperLearner prediction at each site were evaluated. RESULTS: Data from 28,212 injured patients were used to generate prediction. Discharge mortality was 17%, 1.3%, and 1.7% among US, SA, and Cameroonian cohorts. SuperLearner delivered superior prediction of discharge mortality in the United States (area under the curve [AUC], 94-97%) and vastly superior prediction in Cameroon (AUC, 90-94%) compared with conventional scoring algorithms. It provided similar prediction to standard scores in the SA cohort (AUC, 90-95%). Context-specific variables (partial thromboplastin time in the United States and hospital distance in Cameroon) were prime drivers of predicted mortality in their respective cohorts, whereas severe brain injury predicted mortality across sites. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning provides excellent discrimination of injury mortality in diverse settings. Unlike traditional scores, data-adaptive methods are well suited to optimizing precise site-specific prediction regardless of diagnostic capabilities or data set inclusion allowing for individualized decision making and expanded access to quality improvement programming.

McC",Resuscitation,"BACKGROUND: Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions are made in hospitals throughout the globe. International variation in clinicians' perception of DNACPR decision-making and implementation and the factors influencing such variation has not previously been explored. METHODS: A questionnaire asking how DNACPR decisions are made, communicated and perceived in their country was composed: it consisted of seven closed-answer and four open-answer questions. It was distributed to 143 medical professionals with prior published material relating to DNACPR decisions. Under-represented geographical areas were identified and an additional 34 physicians were contacted through medical colleagues and students at the university hospital from which this study was based. The respondents had 4 weeks to answer the questionnaire. RESULTS: 78 responses (44%) were received from 43 countries. All continents were represented. 88% of respondents reported a method for implementing DNACPR decisions, 90% of which discussed resuscitation wishes with the patient at least half of the time. 94% of respondents thought that national guidance for DNACPR order implementation should exist; 53% of countries surveyed reported existence of such guidance. Cultural attitudes towards death, medical education and culture, health economics and the societal role of family were commonly identified as factors influencing perception of DNACPR decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of countries surveyed make some form of DNACPR decision but differing cultures and economic status contribute towards a heterogeneity of approaches to resuscitation decision-making.

Using data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), and machine learning (ML) techniques, we developed a model of neurological outcome prediction for OHCA in Chicago, Illinois. METHODS: Rescue workflow data of 2639 patients with witnessed OHCA were retrieved from Chicago's CARES. An Embedded Fully Convolutional Network (EFCN) classification model was selected to predict the patient outcome (survival with good neurological outcomes or not) based on 27 input features with the objective of maximizing the average class sensitivity. Using this model, sensitivity analysis of intervention variables such as bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), targeted temperature management, and coronary angiography was conducted. RESULTS: The EFCN classification model has an average class sensitivity of 0.825. Sensitivity analysis of patient outcome shows that an additional 33 patients would have survived with good neurological outcome if they had received lay person CPR in addition to CPR by emergency medical services and 88 additional patients would have survived if they had received the coronary angiography intervention.

It has been shown that trauma teaching for medical students is sadly lacking within the undergraduate curriculum. We stated that students following formal teaching, even just theory and some practice in basic skills significantly improved their management of trauma patients. METHODS: Hadassah-Hebrew University in Israel runs an annual 2-week trauma course for final-year medical students. The focus is on hands-on practice in resuscitation, diagnosis, procedures, and decision making. After engaging a combination of instructional and interactive teaching methods including practice on simulated injuries that students must assess and treat through the 2 weeks, the course culminates in a disaster drill where students work alongside the emergency services to rescue, assess, treat, and transfer patients. The course is evaluated with a written precourse and postcourse test, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination and detailed feedback from the drill. RESULTS: We analyzed student feedback at the end of each course during a 6-year period from 2007 to 2012. Correct answers for the posttest results were higher each year with good reliability as assessed by Chronbach's <ce><b1> and with significant variation from pretest scores assessed using paired-samples t tests. Best scores were achieved in knowledge acquisition and practical skills gained. Students were also asked whether the course contributed to self-preparedness in treating trauma patients, and this consistently achieved high scores. CONCLUSION: We believe that students benefit substantially from the course and gain lasting skills and confidence in trauma management, decision making, and organizational skills.

The study aimed to develop a decision support tool for distributing casualties to hospitals in an emergency scenario involving multiple casualties. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review and structured interviews with 20 content experts produced a shortlist of relevant criteria for inclusion in the model. A ""load index model"" was prepared, incorporating results of a modified Delphi survey of 100 emergency response experts. The model was tested in three simulation exercises in which an emergency scenario was presented to six groups of senior emergency managers. Information was provided regarding capacities of 11 simulated admitting hospitals in the region, and evacuation destinations were requested for 600 simulated casualties. Of the three simulation rounds, two were performed without the model and one after its presentation. Following simulation experiments and implementation during a real-life security threat, the efficacy of the model was assessed. RESULTS: Variability between experts concerning casualties' evacuation destinations decreased significantly following the model's introduction. Most responders (92%) supported the need for standardized data, and 85% found that the model improved policy setting regarding casualty evacuation in an emergency situation.

We tested the hypothesis that addition of a real-time decision-assist machine-learning algorithm, the compensatory reserve measurement (CRM), used by combat medics could shorten the time required to identify the need for intervention in an unstable patient during a hemorrhage profile as compared with vital signs alone. METHODS: We randomized combat medics from the Army Medical Department Center and School Health Readiness Center of Excellence into three groups: group 1 viewed a display of no simulated hemorrhage and unchanging vital signs as a control (n = 24), group 2 viewed a display of simulated hemorrhage and changing vital signs alone (hemorrhage; n = 31), and group 3 viewed a display of changing vital signs with the addition of the CRM (hemorrhage + CRM; n = 22). Participants were asked to push a computer key when they believed the patient was becoming unstable and needed medical intervention. RESULTS: The average time of 11.0 minutes (95% confidence interval, 8.7-13.3 minutes) required by the hemorrhage + CRM group to identify an unstable patient (i.e., stop the video sequence) was less by more than 40% (p < 0.01) compared with 18.9 minutes (95% confidence interval, 17.2-20.5 minutes) in the hemorrhage group.

METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified all emergency department (ED) visits for acute heart failure between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, among adult health plan members of a large system with 21 EDs. The primary outcome was any 30-day serious adverse event, including death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, balloon-pump insertion, intubation, new dialysis, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Starting with the 13 variables from the STRATIFY rule (base model), we tested whether predictive accuracy in a different population could be enhanced with additional electronic health record-based variables or machine-learning approaches (compared with logistic regression). We calculated our derived model area under the curve (AUC), calculated test characteristics, and assessed admission rates across risk categories. RESULTS: Among 26,189 total ED encounters, mean patient age was 74 years, 51.7% were women, and 60.7% were white. The overall 30-day serious adverse event rate was 18.8%.

Two strategies to increase patient safety are simulator training and crew resource management (CRM) seminars, psychological courses on human performance and error management. AIM: To establish a CRM course combining psychological training on human error with simulator training. METHODS: Evaluation of a new 1-day training approach targeting physicians, nurses, and paramedics. The course was divided into four modules focusing on situation awareness, task management, teamwork, and decision-making. Each of the modules was set up according to a new six-step approach. The course started with an introduction into good CRM behaviour and an instructor demonstration of a simulator scenario. The participants had to debrief the instructors regarding their human performance. Step 2 was a lecture about the psychological background, and the third step consisted of psychological exercises related to the topic of the module. A psychological exercise in a medical context (MiniSim) made up step 4, which involved a patient simulator. The last two steps were a simulator scenario and a debriefing, as in other simulator courses. A psychologist and a physician were the facilitators in all steps. Two pilot courses were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventeen evaluation questionnaires were received. All participants rated the course as good (10) and very good (7). The psychological exercises were highly valued (good, 5; very good, 11 participants). Thirteen participants agreed that the course content was related to their work.

METHODS: Mixed-methods design obtaining data for one year in three emergency medical communication centres (EMCC); Oslo-Akershus (OA), Vestfold-Telemark (VT) and Ostfold (O). Data collection included quantitative data from analysis of dispatch logs, ambulance records and audio files. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and non-participant observations. RESULTS: OA-, VT- and O-EMCC responded to 1095 OHCAs and 579 of these calls were included for further analysis (333, 143 and 103, respectively). There were significant site differences in their recognition of OHCA (89, 94 and 78%, respectively, p<0.001), provision of CPR instructions (83, 83 and 61%, respectively, p<0.001), time from call answered to initial CPR instructions (1.4min (1.2, 1.6), 1.1min (0,9, 1.2) and 1.3 (1.2, 1.7) respectively, p=0.002). The most frequent reason for delayed or failed recognition of OHCA was misinterpretation of agonal breathing. Interviews and observations revealed individual differences in protocol use, interrogation strategy and assessment of breathing. Use of protocol was only part of decision making, dispatchers trusted their own clinical experience and intuition, and used assumptions about the patient and the situation as part of decision making. CONCLUSION: Agonal breathing continues to be the main barrier to recognition of cardiac arrest. Individual differences among dispatchers' strategies can directly impact on performance, mainly due to the wide definition of cardiac arrest and lack of uniform tools for assessment of breathing.",2016,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.09.027,109,NA,56-63,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,Humans and Female and Male and Qualitative Research and mixed-methods and Time-to-Treatment and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cpr and dispatcher and dispatchers and emergency medical communication centre and Emergency medical dispatch and Emergency Medical Dispatcher/*statistics & numerical data and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration/standards and Emergency Medical Technicians/*organization & administration/standards and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hornor_2018_Thjooftranaccasu,JOUR,Examining racial disparities in the time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in trauma,"Hornor, Melissa A. and Byrne, James P. and Engelhardt, Kathryn E. and Nathens, Avery B.",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in medical treatment for seriously injured patients across the spectrum of care are well established, but racial disparities in end of life decision making practices have not been well described. When time from admission to time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) increases, so does the potential for ineffective care, health care resource loss, and patient and family suffering. We sought to determine the existence and extent of racial disparities in late WLST after severe injury. METHODS: We queried the American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2013-2016) for all severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score, > 15; age, > 16 years) with a WLST order longer than 24 hours after admission. We defined late WLST as care withdrawn at a time interval beyond the 75th percentile for the entire cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, and t tests and <cf><87> tests where appropriate. Multivariable regression analysis was performed with random effects to account for institutional-level clustering using late WLST as the primary outcome and race as the primary predictor of interest. RESULTS: A total of 13,054 patients from 393 centers were included in the analysis. Median time to WLST was 5.4 days (interquartile range, 2.6-10.3). In our unadjusted analysis, African-American patients (10.1% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001) and Hispanic patients (7.8% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001) were more likely to have late WLST as compared to early WLST. After adjustment for patient, injury, and institutional characteristics, African-American (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.67) and Hispanic (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.46) race were significant predictors of late WLST. CONCLUSION: African-American and Hispanic race are both significant predictors of late WLST. These findings might be due to patient preference or medical decision making, but speak to the value in assuring a high standard related to identifying goals of care in a culturally sensitive manner.

In such circumstances, rapid activation of the Chain of Survival with effective and continuous realisation of its four links can have a large impact on survival. Mobile phones, which have become the most ubiquitous piece of modern technology, possess a strong potential to strengthen each link of the chain. Initially, they can be used to educate rescuers about appropriate actions performed in each step of the resuscitation process. However, mobile phones can also assume a more active role of helping the rescuer in a real medical emergency. They have a potential to allow for a faster and superior emergency medical services contact, assure a higher quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and quicker retrieval of an automated external defibrillator and facilitate a finer post-resuscitation care through telemedical and clinical decision support systems.

Andrew",The American journal of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Topic identification can facilitate knowledge curation, discover thematic relationships, trends, and predict future direction. We aimed to determine through an unsupervised, machine learning approach to topic modeling the most common research themes in emergency medicine over the last 40 years and summarize their trends and characteristics. METHODS: We retrieved the complete reference entries including article abstracts from Ovid for all original research articles from 1980 to 2019 within emergency medicine for six widely-cited journals. Abstracts were processed through a natural language pipeline and analyzed by a latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling algorithm for unsupervised topic discovery. Topics were further examined through trend analysis, word associations, co-occurrence metrics, and two-dimensional embeddings. RESULTS: We retrieved 47,158 articles during the defined time period that were filtered to 20,528 articles for further analysis. Forty topics covering methodologic and clinical areas were discovered. These topics separated into distinct clusters when embedded in two-dimensional space and exhibited consistent patterns of interaction. We observed the greatest increase in popularity in research themes involving risk factors (0.4% to 5.2%), health utilization (1.2% to 5.0%), and ultrasound (0.7% to 3.3%), and a relative decline in research involving basic science (8.9% to 1.1%), cardiac arrest (6.5% to 2.2%), and vitals (6.3% to 1.3%) over the past 40 years.

Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury. METHODS: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation. RESULTS: The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two-hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours).

This study aims to examine patient sociodemographic and ED clinical characteristics to comprehensively determine predictors of opioid administration during an ED visit (ED-RX) and prescribing upon discharge (DC-RX). METHODS: ED visit data of patients <e2><89><a5>18 years old from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2014 to 2017 were used. Opioid prescriptions were determined utilizing Lexicon narcotic drug classifications. Visit characteristics studied included sociodemographic variables, and ED clinical variables, such as chief complaint, and discharge diagnosis. Machine learning methods were used to determine predictors of ED-RX and DC-RX and weighted logistic regressions were performed using selected predictors. RESULTS: Of the 44,227 ED visits identified, patients tended to be female (57.4%), and White (74.2%) with an average age of 46.4 years (SE = 0.3). Weighted proportions of ED-RX and DC-RX were 23.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The strongest predictors of ED-RX were CT scan ordered (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.84-2.58), abdominal pain (OR = 1.93, 95% CI:1.59-2.34) and back pain (OR = 1.81, 95% CI:1.45-2.27). Tooth pain (OR = 6.94, 95% CI = 4.40-10.94) and fracture injury diagnoses (OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 2.72-5.19) were the strongest predictors of DC-RX.

Shif_2015_Resu,JOUR,What CPR means to surrogate decision makers of ICU patients,"Shif, Yuri and Doshi, Pratik and Almoosa, Khalid F.",Resuscitation,"AIM OF THE STUDY: The decision to accept or decline cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by surrogate decision makers on behalf of a family member is a common and important component of end-of-life decision-making in the ICU. While many determinants influence this decision, surrogates' understanding of CPR may be a major guiding factor. However, little is known about surrogates' knowledge and perceptions of CPR during the periods of time when their family member is critically ill. We conducted this study to explore surrogates' understanding of some basic concepts of CPR. METHODS: This is a descriptive, survey-based exploratory study of understanding of CPR concepts and outcomes conducted in a single-center medical ICU at a tertiary academic hospital in the United States. Study subjects were surrogate decision-makers of critically ill ICU patients who participated in an interview-format survey within 24h of the patient's ICU admission. RESULTS: Of 97 eligible subjects (surrogates), 50 were enrolled in this study and represented a wide spectrum of demographics. All subjects had heard of CPR. The main source of information about CPR was a course. While 46% identified cardiac arrest as a main indication for CPR, only 8% identified at least 2 of the 3 main components of CPR. The majority (72%) believed survival after CPR was <e2><89><a5>75%. Forty-two percent of surrogates had spoken to the patient about CPR prior to coming to the hospital, and 57% had spoken to the physician during this hospitalization. Twenty-six percent changed their decision on CPR during the ICU stay.

Knowledge of (predictors of) diminished quality of life can help improve medical outcome. The aim of this study was to quantify health loss in patients with burns and to assess the contribution of injury extent, age, gender, and psychologic factors to HRQOL and speed of recovery. A multicenter prospective cohort design was used to address these aims. METHODS: Data were obtained from 260 adults with burns. Patients completed the EQ-5D at 3 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 18 months after burn and psychologic questionnaires during hospitalization. Patients' scores were compared with an age- and gender-weighted normpopulation. RESULTS: Patients suffered from substantial health losses at short term, but after 18 months the majority reached a HRQOL comparable with the norm population with the exception of patients requiring two or more surgeries. The best predictor of long-term HRQOL and the speed of recovery was the number of surgeries, followed by psychologic problems. Both predicted baseline and trajectories of improvement. Symptoms of traumatic stress were most debilitating over time. CONCLUSIONS: Both injury severity and psychologic problems play a pivotal role in reduced HRQOL and the speed of recovery. The number of surgeries seems to give a practically useful indication of the expected recovery speed that could aid in decision making and provides adequate information for patients in the aftermath of their initial surgical treatment.

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of RI scores in predicting surgical ICU (SICU) readmission rates and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of surgical patients who were transferred from the SICU to the surgical floor from December 2014 to December 2016. Data included demographics, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and RI at multiple pretransfer and post-transfer time points. RESULTS: A total of 1,445 SICU patients were transferred to the surgical floor; 79 patients (5.5%) were readmitted within 48 hours of transfer. Mean age was 52 years, and 67% were male. Compared to controls, patients readmitted to the SICU within 48 hours experienced higher LOS (29 vs. 11 days, p < 0.05) as well as higher mortality (2.5% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.05). Patients requiring readmission also had a lower RI at 72, 48, and 24 hours before transfer as well as at 24 and 48 hours after transfer (p < 0.05 for all). Rothman Index scores were categorized into higher-risk (<40), medium-risk (40-65), and lower-risk groups (>65); RI scores at 24 hours before transfer were inversely proportional to overall mortality (RI < 40 = 2.5%, RI 40-65 = 0.3%, and RI > 65 = 0%; p < 0.05) and SICU readmission rates (RI < 40 = 9%, RI 40-65 = 5.2%, and RI > 65 = 2.8%; p < 0.05). Patients transferred with RI scores greater than 83 did not require SICU readmission within 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Surgical ICU patients requiring readmission within 48 hours of transfer have a significantly higher mortality and longer LOS compared to those who do not. Patients requiring readmission also have significantly lower pretransfer and post-transfer RI scores compared to those who do not.

Accordingly, we sought to determine whether the use of an electronic decision support tool (DST) improves performance during high-fidelity simulations of IHCA. METHODS: After IRB approval and written informed consent was obtained, 47 senior medical students were enrolled. All participants were ACLS certified and within one month of graduation. Each participant was issued an iPod Touch device with a DST installed that contained all ACLS management algorithms. Participants managed two scenarios of IHCA and were allowed to use the DST in one scenario and prohibited from using it in the other. All participants managed the same scenarios. Simulation sessions were video recorded and graded by trained raters according to previously validated checklists. RESULTS: Performance of correct protocol steps was significantly greater with the DST than without (84.7% v 73.8%, p<0.001) and participants committed significantly fewer additional errors when using the DST (2.5 errors vs. 3.8 errors, p<0.012).

Military MEDEVAC platforms provide lifesaving interventions that improve survival in combat. There is limited evidence to support decision making related to en route care and allocation of resources. The association between provider type and en route care is not well understood. Our objective was to describe MEDEVAC providers and identify associations between provider type, procedures performed, and outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective record review of patients traumatically injured in combat, evacuated by MEDEVAC from the point of injury, between 2011 and 2014. Data abstracted included injury description, provider type, procedures performed, medications administered, survival, and 30-day outcomes. Subjects were grouped according to provider type: medics, paramedics, and ADVs (advanced-level providers to include nurses, physician assistants, and physicians). Groups were compared. Analyses were performed using <cf><87> tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance tests (Kruskal-Wallis tests) for continuous variables; p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The MEDEVAC records were reviewed, and data were abstracted from 1,237 subjects. The providers were composed of medics, 76%; paramedics, 21%; and ADVs, 4%. Patient and injury demographics were similar among groups. The ADVs were most likely to perform intubation, chest needle decompressions (p < 0.0001), and hypothermia prevention (p = 0.01). Paramedics were most likely to administer blood en route (p < 0.0001). All other procedures were similar between groups. Paramedics were most likely to administer ketamine (p < 0.0001), any analgesic (p < 0.0001), or any medication en route (p < 0.0001). Incidence rates of en route events (pain, hypoxia, abnormal hemodynamics, vital signs) were similar between provider types. In-theater and 30-day survival rates were similar between provider types. CONCLUSION: Providers with higher-level training were more likely to perform more advanced procedures during en route care. Our study found no significant association between provider type and in-theater or 30-day mortality rates.

We sought to determine the utility of modeling in the prediction of bacteremia and pneumonia in combat casualties. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational trial of patients with complex wounds treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (2007-2012). Tissue, serum, and wound effluent samples were collected during operative interventions until wound closure. Clinical, biomarker, and outcome data were used in machine learning algorithms to develop models predicting bacteremia or pneumonia. Modeling was performed on the first operative washout to maximize predictive benefit. Variable selection of dataset variables was performed and the best-fitting Bayesian belief network (BBN), using Bayesian information criterion (BIC), was selected for predictive modeling. Random forest was performed using variables from BBN step. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (mean age 23, mean Injury Severity Score 25) were enrolled. Patients required a median of 3 (2-13) operations. The incidence of bacteremia and pneumonia was 22% and 12%, respectively. Best-fitting variable selected BBNs were maximum-minimum parents and children (MMPC) for both bacteremia (BIC-24948) and pneumonia (BIC-17886). Full variable and MMPC random forest models AUC were 0.721 and 0.834, respectively, for bacteremia and 0.809 and 0.856, respectively, for pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a profile predictive of bacteremia and pneumonia in combat casualties. This has important clinical implications and should be validated in the civilian trauma population.

METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using focus groups to collect data from patients with a previous stroke or brain injury and their families and from young men at risk for traumatic brain injury. Discussions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Five focus groups, involving 40 participants, were convened. Major themes included the awareness and understanding of key clinical trial concepts, including prominent concerns about placebo and therapeutic misconception; inability to obtain informed consent and acceptable surrogate decision-making; EFIC in emergency research and whether existing regulations are acceptable; specific trial design problems, including comparison to standard of care versus 2 competing active therapies; and community consultation and representation. CONCLUSION: In this study sample, EFIC trials were deemed appropriate and acceptable for acute neurologic emergency research. Education, along with open discussion about basic clinical research concepts, disease- and trial-specific information, and potential surrogate decision-making, was essential to determine the acceptability of an EFIC trial.

A.",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,"BACKGROUND: The genomic landscape of gallbladder disease remains poorly understood. We sought to examine the association between genetic variants and the development of cholecystitis. METHODS: The Biobank of a large multi-institutional health care system was used. All patients with cholecystitis were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes and genotyped across six batches. To control for population stratification, data were restricted to that from individuals of European genomic ancestry using a multidimensional scaling approach. The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and cholecystitis was evaluated with a mixed linear model-based analysis, controlling for age, sex, and obesity. The threshold for significance was set at 5 * 10. RESULTS: Of 24,635 patients (mean <c2><b1> SD age, 60.1 <c2><b1> 16.7 years; 13,022 females [52.9%]), 900 had cholecystitis (mean <c2><b1> SD age, 65.4 <c2><b1> 14.3 years; 496 females [55.1%]). After meta-analysis, three single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 5p15 exceeded the threshold for significance (p < 5 * 10). The phenotypic variance of cholecystitis explained by genetics and controlling for sex and obesity was estimated to be 17.9%.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 4 university teaching hospitals, covering 101 randomly selected elderly patients admitted to emergency department and their respective physicians. Physicians were asked to forecast their plans for treatment or therapeutic abstention, in the event that patients might require aggressive measures (cardiopulmonary resuscitation or admission to critical care units). Data were collected on physicians' reasons for taking such decisions and their patients' functional capacity and cognitive status (Katz index and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly). A logistic regression model was constructed taking physicians' decisions as the dependent variables and adjusting for patient factors and physician impressions. RESULTS: The functional status reported by reliable informants and the mental status measured by validated instruments were not coincident with the physicians' perception (functional status <ce><ba>, 0.47; mental status <ce><ba>, 0.26).

Given the complexities involved with informed consent for procedures in the ED, it is important to understand the experience of key stakeholders involved. METHODS: For this review, we searched Medline, the Cochrane database, and Clinicaltrials.gov for studies involving informed consent in the ED. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to select for studies that included issues related to informed consent as primary outcomes. The following data was extracted from included studies: Title, authors, date of publication, study type, participant type (i.e. adult patient, pediatric patient, parent of pediatric patient, patient's family, or healthcare provider), number of participants, and primary outcomes measured.

The survey asked respondents to estimate reimbursement rates for a limited set of medical tests and procedures, rate their level of current cost knowledge, and determine the effect of health expenditures on their medical decision making. We calculated relative accuracy of cost knowledge as a percent difference of participant estimation of cost from the CMS reimbursement rate. RESULTS: Ninety-seven physicians participated in the study. Most respondents (65%) perceived their knowledge of costs as inadequate, and 39.3% indicated that beliefs about cost impacted their ordering behavior. Eighty percent of physicians surveyed were unable to estimate 25% of the costs within <c2><b1>25%, and no physicians estimated at least 50% of costs within 25% of the CMS reimbursement and only 17.3% of medical services were estimated correctly within <c2><b1>25% by 1 or more physicians.

Among then, diagnosis of atelectasis with ultrasound remains rare and unusual. We report the case of a worker who had a sharp chest pain currently after using a jackhammer. First clinical examination suspected a left tension pneumothorax but ruled out by sliding sign in left hemithorax ultrasound (US) examination.

A ""rip's organ absent sign"" excluded the hypothesis of an acute diaphragmatic rupture. An atelectasis was at once suspected and confirmed at hospital by tomodensitometry. Diaphragmatic injury can be suspected when ""rip's absent organ sign,"" diaphragm poor movement or elevation, liver sliding sign, subphrenic effusion, or spleen or liver intrathoracic presence. Unusually, these signs can put diagnosis in a wrong track as described in our case report. Lung pulse, absent sliding sign, or hemidiaphragm standstill is highly suspect of atelectasis but cannot be established formally.

Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac arrest, we sought to measure the use and impact of PC in the care of patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 317 consecutive patients undergoing TH after cardiac arrest. We compared intensive care unit (ICU) characteristics and clinical outcomes of subjects who received PC consultation (n=125) to those who did not (n=192). RESULTS: The proportion of TH patients with PC consultations increased to greater than 60% by 2013, corresponding to our institution's expansion of PC services, development of a dedicated PC unit, and integration of this service into our published TH protocol. In the TH population, time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was associated with higher inpatient mortality (p<0.001) and placement of a PC consult (p=0.011). TH patients who received PC consultation had longer ICU stays (p=0.034), more ventilator days (p<0.001), and higher inpatient mortality (p<0.001). When these measures were analyzed cohort-wide comparing all TH patients pre- and post-2013, at which time the frequency of PC consultation had dramatically increased, there were no statistically significant differences in ICU care or outcomes.

In rural states, this may require long transport durations, with uncertainty about the effects on clinical decline. We investigate adherence to the FTDS and the effect of transport duration on clinical decline in helicopter emergency medical system (HEMS) and ground emergency medical system (GEMS) transport in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved study retrospectively analyzed deidentified data from the 2017 National EMS Information System for Kentucky. Patients were classified using step 1 FTDS criteria (respiratory rate [RR], <10 or >29 breaths per minute; systolic blood pressure (SBP), <90 mm Hg; or Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, <14 points), by mode of transport (HEMS or GEMS), and by arrival at an appropriate center (levels I-III trauma center). Clinical decline was defined in both groups as an in route decrease in GCS of 2 points or greater, a SBP decrease of 1 SD or greater into or within the low range, an RR increase of 1 SD or greater into or within the high range, or an RR decrease of 1 SD or greater into or within the low range. RESULTS: Almost half (46.3%) of step 1 patients were transported to an inappropriate center; the most common reason recorded was ""closest facility"" (57.8%). The percent of step 1 patients who declined in route increased with prehospital time in both HEMS and GEMS (p < 0.001). Overall, 12.2% of step 1 patients declined during transport, most commonly because of decreasing GCS (median change, -5 points; interquartile range, -3 to -9, in GCS declining patients). Helicopter EMS patients were more likely to meet step 1 criteria at the scene (29.9% vs. 5.8% GEMS, p < 0.001) and to decline (27.8% vs. 6.1% GEMS, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that, in a rural state, injured patients meeting FTDS step 1 criteria reach levels I to III trauma centers only about half the time. The FTDS step 1 criteria identified patients at higher risk of further prehospital clinical decline. Rather than decline after 1 hour, these data show that an increasing proportion of patients experience clinical decline throughout prehospital transport.

METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to the 8000 members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine during September and October 2012. The survey had 27 questions divided into three categories: background data, clinical data, decision-making and consequences. RESULTS: A total of 1025 respondents (13%) answered the survey with complete forms in more than 90%. Twenty per cent of respondents practiced outside of Europe. Overall, 22% answered that they had national recommendations, with the highest percentage in the Netherlands (>80%). Eighty-nine per cent used induced hypothermia (32-34 <c2><b0>C) for comatose cardiac arrest patients, while 11% did not. Twenty per cent had separate prognostication protocols for hypothermia patients. Seventy-nine per cent recognized that neurological examination alone is not enough to predict outcome and a similar number (76%) used additional methods. Intermittent electroencephalography (EEG), brain computed tomography (CT) scan and evoked potentials (EP) were considered most useful. Poor prognosis was defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 3-5 (58%) or CPC 4-5 (39%) or other (3%). When prognosis was considered poor, 73% would actively withdraw intensive care while 20% would not and 7% were uncertain. CONCLUSION: National recommendations for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest are uncommon and only one physician out of five uses a separate protocol for hypothermia treated patients. A neurological examination alone was considered insufficient to predict outcome in comatose patients and most respondents advocated a multimodal approach: EEG, brain CT and EP were considered most useful. Uncertainty regarding neurological prognostication and decisions on level of care was substantial.",2015,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.01.018,90,NA,158-162,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,"Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Europe and Prognosis and Prognostication and Societies, Medical and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Electroencephalography and Clinical Decision-Making and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Neurologic Examination and Survey and Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data and Brain/diagnostic imaging and Cardiac arrest and Outcome and Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology and Coma and Coma/therapy and Evoked Potentials and Heart Arrest/*complications/therapy and Hypothermia, Induced/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hamada_2014_Thjooftranaccasu,JOUR,Evaluation of the performance of French physician-staffed emergency medical service in the triage of major trauma patients,"Hamada, Sophie Rym and Gauss, Tobias and Duchateau, Francois-Xavier and Truchot, Jennifer and Harrois, Anatole and Raux, Mathieu and Duranteau, Jacques and Mantz, Jean and Paugam-Burtz, Catherine",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,"BACKGROUND: Proper prehospital triage of trauma patients is a cornerstone for the process of care of trauma patients. In France, emergency physicians perform this process according to a national triage algorithm called Vittel Triage Criteria (VTC), introduced in 2002 to help the triage decision-making process. The aim of this two-center study was to evaluate the performance of the triage process based on the VTC to identify major trauma patients in the Paris area. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of all patients admitted between January 2011 and September 2012 in two trauma referral centers in the region of Paris (Ile de France) and allowed estimation of overtriage. Undertriage was assessed in a second cohort made up of all prehospital trauma interventions from one emergency medicine sector during the same period. Adequate triage was defined by a direct admission of patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15 into one of the regional trauma centers, and undertriage was defined as an initial nonadmission to a trauma center. Overtriage was defined by an admission of patients with an ISS of 15 or lower to a trauma center. The performance of the VTC was evaluated according to a strict to-the-letter application of the VTC and termed as theoretical triage. Logistic regression was performed to identify VTC criteria able to predict major trauma. RESULTS: Among 998 admitted patients of the first cohort, 173 patients (17%) were excluded because they were not directly admitted in the first 24 hours. In the first cohort (n = 825), adequate triage was 58% and overtriage was 42%. In the second cohort (n = 190), adequate triage was 40%, overtriage was 60%, and undertriage was less than 1%. Theoretical triage generated a nonsignificantly lower overtriage and a higher undertriage compared with observed triage. The most powerful predictors of major trauma were paralysis (odds ratio [OR,] 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.22), flail chest (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.01-0.03), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 13 (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45), whereas global assessments of speed and mechanism alone were poor predictors (positive likelihood ratio, 0.92-1.4). CONCLUSION: In the Paris area, the French physician-based prehospital triage system for patients with suspicion of major trauma showed a high rate of overtriage and a low rate of undertriage. Criteria of global assessment of speed and mechanism alone were poor predictors of major trauma.",2014,10.1097/TA.0000000000000239,76,6,1476-1483,eng,2163-0763 2163-0755,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Workforce and *Algorithms and France and *Quality Assurance, Health Care and Triage/*organization & administration and Emergency Medical Services/*standards and *Trauma Centers/standards and Multiple Trauma/*therapy and Physicians/*supply & distribution",NA,NA,2014/06//undefined,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Delahanty_2019_Anofemme,JOUR,Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Model for the Early Identification of Patients at Risk for Sepsis,"Delahanty, Ryan J. and Alvarez, JoAnn and Flynn, Lisa M. and Sherwin, Robert L. and Jones, Spencer S.",Annals of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Third International Consensus Definitions (Sepsis-3) Task Force recommended the use of the quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score to screen patients for sepsis outside of the ICU. However, subsequent studies raise concerns about the sensitivity of qSOFA as a screening tool. We aim to use machine learning to develop a new sepsis screening tool, the Risk of Sepsis (RoS) score, and compare it with a slate of benchmark sepsis-screening tools, including the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), qSOFA, Modified Early Warning Score, and National Early Warning Score. METHODS: We used retrospective electronic health record data from adult patients who presented to 49 urban community hospital emergency departments during a 22-month period (N=2,759,529). We used the Rhee clinical surveillance criteria as our standard definition of sepsis and as the primary target for developing our model. The data were randomly split into training and test cohorts to derive and then evaluate the model. A feature selection process was carried out in 3 stages: first, we reviewed existing models for sepsis screening; second, we consulted with local subject matter experts; and third, we used a supervised machine learning called gradient boosting. Key metrics of performance included alert rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. Performance was assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after an index time. RESULTS: The RoS score was the most discriminant screening tool at all time thresholds (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.93 to 0.97). Compared with the next most discriminant benchmark (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), RoS was significantly more sensitive (67.7% versus 49.2% at 1 hour and 84.6% versus 80.4% at 24 hours) and precise (27.6% versus 12.2% at 1 hour and 28.8% versus 11.4% at 24 hours). The sensitivity of qSOFA was relatively low (3.7% at 1 hour and 23.5% at 24 hours). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, RoS was more timely and discriminant than benchmark screening tools, including those recommend by the Sepsis-3 Task Force. Further study is needed to validate the RoS score at independent sites.",2019,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.11.036,73,4,334-344,eng,1097-6760 0196-0644,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Hospitals, Urban and Early Diagnosis and Severity of Illness Index and *Machine Learning and Organ Dysfunction Scores and Sepsis/*diagnosis and Lactic Acid/metabolism",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,Ann Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to identify what barriers delayed the implementation of these guidelines in EMS agencies. METHODS: We surveyed 178 EMS agencies as part of a larger quantitative survey regarding guideline implementation and conducted a single-question semi-structured interview using the Grounded Theory method. We asked ""What barriers if any, delayed implementation of the (2005 AHA) guidelines in your EMS agency?"" Data were coded and member validation was employed to verify our findings. RESULTS: 176/178 agencies completed the quantitative survey. Qualitative data collection ceased after reaching theoretical saturation with 34 interviews. Ten unique barriers were identified. We categorized these 10 barriers into three themes. The theme instruction delays (reported by 41% of respondents) included three barriers: booking/training instructors (9%), receiving training materials (15%), and scheduling staff for training (18%). The second theme, defibrillator delays (38%), included two barriers; reprogramming defibrillators (24%) and receiving new defibrillators to replace non-upgradeable units (15%). The third theme was decision-making (38%) and included five barriers; coordinating with allied agencies (9%), government regulators such as state and provincial health authorities (9%), medical direction and base hospitals (9%), ROC participation (9%), and internal crises (3%). CONCLUSION: Many barriers contributed to delays in the implementation of the 2005 AHA guidelines in EMS agencies. These identified barriers should be proactively addressed prior to the 2010 Guidelines to facilitate rapid translation of science into clinical practice.",2010,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.03.012,81,7,836-840,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,United States and Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Canada and Health Care Surveys and American Heart Association and Survival Analysis and Clinical Competence and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Emergency Medical Services/*standards and Guideline Adherence/*statistics & numerical data and Heart Arrest/mortality/*therapy and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*standards/trends,NA,NA,2010/07//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Half of all critically injured patients do not receive recommended care, and medical errors are common. Little is known about the aspects of injury care that are important to patients and their families. The purpose of this study was to explore the views of patients and families affected by injury on desired components of injury care in the hospital setting. METHODS: With the use of a grounded theory approach, this qualitative study involved focus groups with injured patients, family members of survivors, and bereaved family members from four Canadian trauma (injury care) centers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants included injured patients (n = 16), family members of survivors (n = 13), and bereaved family members (n = 9) across four trauma (injury care) centers in different jurisdictions. Participants articulated numerous themes reflecting important components of injury care organized across three domains as follows: clinical care (staff availability, professionalism, physical comfort, adverse events), holistic care (patient wellness, respect for patient and family, family access to patient, family wellness, hospital facilities, supportive care), and communication and information (among staff, with or from staff, content, delivery, and timing). Bereaved family members commented on decision making and end-of-life processes. Subthemes were revealed in most of these themes. Trends by site or type of participant were not identified. CONCLUSION: The framework of patient- and family-derived components of quality injury care could be used by health care managers and policy makers to guide quality improvement efforts. Further research is needed to extend and validate these components among injured patients and families elsewhere. Translating these components into quality indicators and blending those with measures that reflect a provider perspective may offer a comprehensive means of assessing injury care.",2014,10.1097/TA.0000000000000432,77,5,749-756,eng,2163-0763 2163-0755,NA,NA,NA,2014/11//undefined,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this observational study we assessed RAA accuracy in prehospital interventions. For every rhythm analysis judged to be inaccurate, we looked for causal factors and estimated the impact on outcome. METHODS: In 135 consecutive patients, two physicians reviewed 837 rhythm analyses independently. When they disagreed, a third physician made the final decision. RESULTS: Among 148 shockable episodes, 23 (16%) were not recognized by the RAA due to external artifacts (n=7), fine ventricular fibrillation (VF; n=7), RAA error without external artifacts (n=4) or a combination of factors (n=5). In six cases the omitted/delayed shock was judged to be of clinical relevance: survival with some neurological deficit (n=4), death without regaining consciousness (n=1) and no restoration of spontaneous circulation (n=1). In 689 non-shockable episodes, the RAA decided ""shockable"" 25 times (4%). This wrongful decision was due to external artifacts (n=9), a concurrent shock of an internal cardioverter defibrillator (n=1), RAA error without external artifacts (n=13) or a combination of factors (n=2). Fifteen spurious shocks were delivered. As these non-shockable rhythms did not deteriorate after the shock, we assumed that no significant harm was done. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 16% of shockable rhythms were not detected and 4% of non-shockable rhythms were interpreted as shockable. Therefore, all AED interventions should be reviewed. Feedback to caregivers may avoid future deleterious interactions with the AED, whereas AED manufacturers may use this information to improve RAA accuracy.

AIMS: 1) To measure variability in the initiation of resuscitation attempts in EMS-assessed OHCA patients across EMS agencies, 2) to evaluate the association between selected EMS agency characteristics and the proportion of patients receiving resuscitation attempts, and 3) to evaluate the association between proportion receiving resuscitation attempts and survival. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using data from 129 EMS agencies participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) epidemiologic registry (EPISTRY) - Cardiac Arrest from 12/01/2005 to 12/31/2010. We included non-traumatic OHCA patients assessed by EMS. RESULTS: We included 86,912 OHCA patients. Overall, 54.8% had resuscitation attempted by EMS providers, varying from 23.9% to 100% (p=<0.001) across EMS agencies. The proportion of patients receiving a resuscitation attempt was 7.87% less (95% CI 3.73-12.0) among agencies with longer average response intervals (<e2><89><a5>6min) compared with shorter average response intervals (<6min) and 16.9% less (95% CI 11.9-21.9) among agencies with higher levels of advanced life support (ALS) availability (<e2><89><a5>50% of available units) compared with lower levels of ALS availability (<50% of available units). There was a moderate positive correlation between the proportion of patients with resuscitation attempts and survival to hospital discharge (r=0.54, p<0.001).

Under this strategy, ambulances bound for one hospital are redirected to another, usually under policies established by regional emergency medical services systems. Other responses to this mismatch include maladaptive behaviors (such as ""boarding"" in ""hallway beds"") and the development of terminology intended to normalize these practices, all of which are reviewed in this article. We examine the history and causes of diversion as well as the ethical foundations and practical consequences of it. We contend that (1) from a moral viewpoint, the most important stakeholder is the individual patient because diversion decisions are usually relative rather than absolute; (2) decisions regarding ambulance diversion should be made with careful consideration of individual patient preferences, local and state emergency medical services laws, and institutional surge capacity; and (3) authorities should consider the potential positive effects of a regional or statewide ban on diversion.",2015,10.1016/j.ajem.2014.12.002,33,6,822-827,eng,1532-8171 0735-6757,"Humans and Decision Making/ethics and Crowding and Emergency Service, Hospital/*ethics and Ambulance Diversion/*ethics and Surge Capacity",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also studied if the opening of an ED-based observation unit affected the relationship between risk scales and admission decisions. METHODS: Data from a prospective study of ED patients 30 years or older with chest pain were used. Risk scales were administered to ED attending physicians who initially evaluated them. Physicians were divided into quartiles for each separate risk scale. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2872 patients were evaluated by 31 physicians. The most risk-averse quartile of RTS was associated with higher admission rates (78% vs 68%) and greater use of cardiac markers (83% vs 78%) vs the least risk-averse quartile. This was not true for MFS or SUS. Similar associations were observed in low-risk patients (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score of 0 or 1). The observation unit was not associated with a higher admission rate and did not modify the relationship between risk scales and admission rates. CONCLUSION: The RTS was associated with the decision to admit or use computed tomography coronary angiogram, as well as the use of cardiac markers, whereas the MFS and SUS were not.

Recent literature has demonstrated the use of CT scan guidelines in the management of pediatric trauma. The study objective is to review our treatment of pediatric blunt trauma patients and evaluate CT use before and after CT-guideline implementation. METHODS: Our Pediatric Level 2 Trauma Center (TC) implemented a CT scan practice guideline for pediatric trauma patients in March 2014. The guideline recommended for or against CT of the head and abdomen/pelvis using published criteria from the Pediatric Emergency Care and Research Network. There was no chest CT guideline. We reviewed all pediatric trauma patients for CT scans obtained during initial evaluation before and after guideline implementation, excluding inpatient scans. The Trauma Registry Database was queried to include all pediatric (age < 15) trauma patients seen in our TC from 2010 to 2016, excluding penetrating mechanism and deaths in the TC. Scans were considered positive if organ injury was detected. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients undergoing CT and percent positive CTs. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, readmissions, and mortality. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed with <cf><87> and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We identified 1,934 patients: 1,106 pre- and 828 post-guideline. Absolute reductions in head, chest, and abdomen/pelvis CT scans were 17.7%, 11.5%, and 18.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Percent positive head CTs were equivalent, but percent positive chest and abdomen CT increased after implementation. Secondary outcomes were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a pediatric CT guideline significantly decreases CT use, reducing the radiation exposure without a difference in outcome.

Richard",Resuscitation,"BACKGROUND: The basic life support (BLS) termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule recommends transport and continued resuscitation when cardiac arrest is witnessed by EMT-Ds, or there is a return of spontaneous circulation, or a shock is given, and prior studies have suggested the transport rate should fall to 37%. METHODS AND RESULTS: This real-time prospective multi-center implementation trial evaluated the BLS TOR rule for compliance, transport rate and provider and physician comfort. Both provider and physician noted their decision-making rationale and ranked their comfort on a 5-point Likert scale. Functional survival was measured at discharge. Of 2421 cardiac arrests, 953 patients were eligible for the rule, which was applied correctly for 755 patients (79%) of which 388 were terminated. 565 patients were transported resulting in a reduction of the transport rate from 100% (historical control) to 59% (p<0.001). The BLS TOR rule was not followed in 198 eligible patients (21%) and they were all transported despite meeting the criteria to terminate. Providers cited 241 reasons for non-compliance: family distress, short transport time interval, younger age and public venue. All 198 transported patients, non-compliant with the rule, died. Both providers and physicians were comfortable with using the rule to guide TOR (median [IQR] of 5 [4,5]; p<0.001).

METHODS: The Imperial Paediatric Emergency Training Toolkit (IPETT) was developed based on current evidence-base and expert input. IPETT assesses both technical and non-technical skills. The technical component covers skills in the areas of clinical assessment, airway and breathing, cardiovascular, and drugs. The non-technical component is based on the validated NOTECHS tool and covers communication and interaction, cooperation and team skills, leadership and managerial skills, and decision-making. The reliability (internal consistency), content validity (inter-correlations between different skills) and concurrent validity (correlations between global technical and non-technical scores) of IPETT were prospectively evaluated in 45 simulated paediatric crises carried out in a PICU with anaesthetic and paediatric trainees (N=52). Non-parametric analyses were carried out. Significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients were overall acceptable for the technical (alpha range=0.638-0.810) and good for the non-technical (alpha range=0.701-0.899) component of IPETT. The median inter-skill correlation was rho=0.564 and rho=0.549 for the technical and non-technical components, respectively. These indicate good content validity, as the skills were inter-related but not redundant. We also demonstrate a correlation between the global technical and non-technical scores (rho=0.471) - all Ps<0.05 during the assessments. CONCLUSION: IPETT offers a psychometrically viable and feasible to use tool in the context of paediatric emergencies training. This study shows that assessment of technical and non-technical skills in combination may offer a more clinically relevant model for training in paediatric emergencies. Further validation should aim to demonstrate skill retention over time and skill transfer from simulation-based training to real emergencies.",2013,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2012.11.013,84,6,831-836,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,"Pediatrics and Humans and Child and Feasibility Studies and Prospective Studies and Psychometrics and Reproducibility of Results and Critical Care/*standards and Emergencies and Clinical Competence/*standards and Education, Medical, Graduate/*methods",NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yun_2017_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Attending documentation contribution to billing at an academic ED with an electronic health record,"Yun, Brian J. and Dorner, Stephen C. and Baccari, Brian M. and Brennan, John and Smith, Karen and Raja, Ali S. and White, Benjamin A.",The American journal of emergency medicine,"INTRODUCTION: In emergency medicine (EM), patient care documentation serves many functions, including supporting reimbursement. In addition, many electronic health record systems facilitate automatically populating certain data fields. As a result, in the academic model, the attending's note may now more often recapitulate many of the same elements found in the resident's or physician assistant's (PA) note. We sought to determine the value of additional attending documentation, and how often the attending documentation prevented a downcoding event. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study was exempted by the Institutional Review Board. We randomly reviewed 10 charts for each attending physician during the study period. Outcome measures included the frequency of prevented downcoding events, and the difference in this incidence between residents and PAs. RESULTS: 530 charts were identified, but 6 were excluded as these patients left without being seen. 524 charts remained, of which 286 (45%) notes were written by residents and 238 (55%) notes were written by PAs. Attending documentation prevented 16 (3%) downcoding events, of which 11 were in patient encounters documented by residents and 5 were in encounters documented by PAs (p=0.057). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of an academic medical center documentation model with an EHR, EM attending documentation of the history of present illness, review of systems, physical exam, and medical decision making portions prevented downcoding in a small number of cases. In addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of prevented downcoding events between residents and PAs.",2017,10.1016/j.ajem.2017.04.021,35,10,1494-1496,eng,1532-8171 0735-6757,"Electronic health records and United States and Education and Medical records and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Reimbursement and Educational Measurement and Clinical Competence and *Electronic Health Records and Academic Medical Centers/*statistics & numerical data and Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data and Internship and Residency/*organization & administration and Emergency medicine and Emergency Medicine/*education and Education, Medical, Graduate/*methods and Medical coding and Physician assistants and Residency",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Iserson_2008_Anofemme,JOUR,Fight or flight: the ethics of emergency physician disaster response,"Iserson, Kenneth V. and Heine, Carlton E. and Larkin, Gregory Luke and Moskop, John C. and Baruch, Jay and Aswegan, Andrew L.",Annals of emergency medicine,"Most disaster plans depend on using emergency physicians, nurses, emergency department support staff, and out-of-hospital personnel to maintain the health care system's front line during crises that involve personal risk to themselves or their families. Planners automatically assume that emergency health care workers will respond. However, we need to ask: Should they, and will they, work rather than flee? The answer involves basic moral and personal issues. This article identifies and examines the factors that influence health care workers' decisions in these situations. After reviewing physicians' response to past disasters and epidemics, we evaluate how much danger they actually faced. Next, we examine guidelines from medical professional organizations about physicians' duty to provide care despite personal risks, although we acknowledge that individuals will interpret and apply professional expectations and norms according to their own situation and values. The article goes on to articulate moral arguments for a duty to treat during disasters and social crises, as well as moral reasons that may limit or override such a duty. How fear influences behavior is examined, as are the institutional and social measures that can be taken to control fear and to encourage health professionals to provide treatment in crisis situations. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of effective risk communication in enabling health care professionals and the public to make informed and defensible decisions during disasters. We conclude that the decision to stay or leave will ultimately depend on individuals' risk assessment and their value systems. Preparations for the next pandemic or disaster should include policies that encourage emergency physicians, who are inevitably among those at highest risk, to ""stay and fight.""",2008,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.07.024,51,4,345-353,eng,1097-6760 0196-0644,Humans and Risk Assessment and Decision Making and Morals and *Disasters and Emergency Medical Services/*ethics and Physicians/*ethics,NA,NA,2008/04//undefined,Ann Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ekstrom_2015_Anofemme,JOUR,Forecasting emergency department visits using internet data,"Ekstrom, Andreas and Kurland, Lisa and Farrokhnia, Nasim and Castren, Maaret and Nordberg, Martin",Annals of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Using Internet data to forecast emergency department (ED) visits might enable a model that reflects behavioral trends and thereby be a valid tool for health care providers with which to allocate resources and prevent crowding. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Web site visits to a regional medical Web site, the Stockholm Health Care Guide, a proxy for the general public's concern of their health, could be used to predict the ED attendance for the coming day. METHODS: In a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study, a model for forecasting the daily number of ED visits was derived and validated. The model was derived through regression analysis, using visits to the Stockholm Health Care Guide Web site between 6 pm and midnight and day of the week as independent variables. Web site visits were measured with Google Analytics. The number of visits to the ED within the region was retrieved from the Stockholm County Council administrative database. All types of ED visits (including adult, pediatric, and gynecologic) were included. The period of August 13, 2011, to August 12, 2012, was used as a training set for the model. The hourly variation of visits was analyzed for both Web site and the ED visits to determine the interval of hours to be used for the prediction. The model was validated with mean absolute percentage error for August 13, 2012, to October 31, 2012. RESULTS: The correlation between the number of Web site visits between 6 pm and midnight and ED visits the coming day was significant (r=0.77; P<.001). The best forecasting results for ED visits were achieved for the entire county, with a mean absolute percentage error of 4.8%. The result for the individual hospitals ranged between mean absolute percentage error 5.2% and 13.1%. CONCLUSION: Web site visits may be used in this fashion to predict attendance to the ED. The model works both for the entire region and for individual hospitals.

Cheney_2008_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Safety and compliance with an emergency medical service direct psychiatric center transport protocol,"Cheney, Paul and Haddock, Tiffany and Sanchez, Leslie and Ernst, Amy and Weiss, Steven",The American journal of emergency medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate compliance and safety of an emergency medical service (EMS) triage protocol that allows paramedics to transport patients directly to psychiatric emergency services. METHODS: A psychiatric patient diversion protocol was developed for our system. Protocol compliance was evaluated the following 3 ways: (1) psychiatric facility intake forms completed by mental health workers on patients transported by EMS directly to a psychiatric emergency service (PES) bypassing the ED, (2) hospital records for patients who were redirected from PES to the ED for medical evaluation, (3) retrospective analysis of ambulance charts. Study outcomes included protocol noncompliance rate, protocol failure rate, and any morbidity associated with either noncompliance or protocol failure. Data were analyzed using proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 174 patients were directly transported to PES bypassing ED medical clearance. The protocol effectively screened for medical issues in 96% of cases. Protocol noncompliance occurred in 51 cases for a frequency of 29% (CI, 22%-36%). One patient in the paramedic noncompliance group required hospital admission. There was protocol failure in 5 (2.9%; 95% CI, 0.9-6.6) of the patients who fit all protocol requirements for transport to PES but required secondary transport to the ED. All were subsequently transferred back to PES. Nine patients (5.2%; CI, 2.7%-9.5%) required secondary transfer to the ED. No patient had critical or life-threatening problems.

Ward_2013_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Operational data integrity during electronic health record implementation in the ED,"Ward, Michael J. and Froehle, Craig M. and Hart, Kimberly W. and Lindsell, Christopher J.",The American journal of emergency medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Operational data are often used to make systems changes in real time. Inaccurate data, however, transiently, can result in inappropriate operational decision making. Implementing electronic health records (EHRs) is fraught with the possibility of data errors, but the frequency and magnitude of transient errors during this fast-evolving systems upheaval are unknown. This study was done to assess operational data quality in an emergency department (ED) immediately before and after an EHR implementation. METHODS: Direct observations of standard ED timestamps (arrival, bed placement, clinician evaluation, disposition decision, and exit from ED) were conducted in a suburban ED for 4 weeks immediately before and 4 weeks after EHR implementation. Direct observations were compared with electronic timestamps to assess data quality. Differences in proportions and medians with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the magnitude of effect. RESULTS: There were 260 observations: 122 before and 138 after implementation. We found that more systematic data errors were introduced after EHR implementation. The proportion of discrepancies where the observed and electronic timestamp differed by more than 10 minutes was reduced for the disposition timestamp (29.3% vs 16.1%; difference in proportions, -13.2%; 95% CI, -24.4% to -1.9%). The accuracy of the clinician-evaluation timestamp was reduced after implementation (median difference of 3 minutes earlier than observed; 95% CI, -5.02 to -0.98). Multiple service intervals were less accurate after implementation. CONCLUSION: This single-center study raises questions about operational data quality in the peri-implementation period of EHRs. Using electronic timestamps for operational assessment and decision making following implementation should recognize the magnitude and compounding of errors when computing service times.",2013,10.1016/j.ajem.2013.03.027,31,7,1029-1033,eng,1532-8171 0735-6757,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Time and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration and Academic Medical Centers/organization & administration",NA,NA,2013/07//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

After determining whether a difference existed in admit/discharge decision making of EPs for general ED patients, we focus our study in examining the influence of EP seniority on the decision to discharge ED patients. METHODS: In a 1-year retrospective study, we included a convenience sample of all 18 953 adult nontraumatic ED patients. We reviewed the admit/discharge dispositions at each shift made by 16 EPs. EPs were categorized by seniority to determine whether seniority influenced disposition. Three groups had 5, 4, and 7 EPs each, with >10 years, 5 to 9 years, and <5 years of working experience, respectively. RESULTS: Patient demographics, triage level, and number of patients per shift did not differ statistically between EPs and each group. The number of discharged patients per shift differed statistically between EPs (P < .001) and each group. The most senior EPs had the lowest discharge rates compared with EPs in intermediate and junior groups. They had lower discharge rates for patients at triage levels 1, 2, and 3 as well as for all patients. However, no difference in unscheduled ED revisit rates was found.

PATIENTS: All patients in Goteborg, Sweden, who called the dispatch center because of chest pain during 3 months (n = 503) were included in this study. METHODS: Age, sex, and symptom profile were background variables. Based on these, we studied allocation of LSL by the dispatchers and its relationship to AMI, LTC, and death. All evaluations were made from a sex perspective. Finally, we studied the potential benefit of using a statistical model for allocating LSL. RESULTS: The advanced life support level (ALSL) was used equally frequently for men and women. There was no difference in age or symptom profile between men and women in relation to allocation. However, the allocation of ALSL was predictive of AMI and LTC only in men. The sensitivity was far lower for women than for men. When a statistical model was used for allocation, the ALSL was predictive for both men and women. Using a separate model for men and women respectively, sensitivity increased, especially for women, and specificity was kept at the same level.

We sought to identify factors associated with acute management of children at-risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) and describe symptom management. METHODS: Observational evaluation of children, ages 0-4years, presenting to a pediatric ED following minor head injury. Children with <e2><89><a5>1 risk element per the Pediatric Emergency Care Academic Research Network's decision rule were deemed ""at-risk"" for ciTBI. Clinician surveys regarding their initial clinical management were used to identify three care groups. Nonparametric tests analyzed group differences and logistic regression investigated associations of putative high-risk factors with neuroimaging. RESULTS: Of 104 children enrolled: (i) 30 underwent neuroimaging, (ii) 59 were observed, and (iii) 15 were discharged following the clinician's initial patient exam. Children with a non-frontal scalp hematoma were more likely to receive immediate neuroimaging and children not acting like themselves per caregiver report were more likely to be initially observed, relative to the other care groups (p<e2><89><a4>0.01).

In parallel, some countries have developed uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs using ECMO to preserve organs for transplantation purposes. AIM: When facing a refractory OHCA, how does the medical team choose between initiating ECMO as part of an E-CPR protocol or ECMO as part of a uDCDD protocol? METHODS: To answer these questions we conducted a literature review on E-CPR compared to uDCDD protocols using ECMO and analyzed the raised ethical issues. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals that the inclusion criteria in E-CPR and uDCDD protocols are similar. There may be a non-negligible risk of including patients in a uDCDD protocol, when the patient might have been saved by the use of E-CPR. CONCLUSION: In order to avoid the fatal error of letting a saveable patient die, safeguards are necessary. We recommend: (1) the development of internationally accepted termination of resuscitation guidelines that would have to be satisfied prior to inclusion of patients in any uDCDD protocol, (2) the choice regarding modalities of ongoing resuscitation during transfer should be focused on the primary priority of attempting to save the life of patients, (3) only centers of excellence in life-saving resuscitation should initiate or maintain uDCDD programs, (4) E-CPR should be clinically considered first before the initiation of any uDCDD protocol, and (5) there should be no discrimination in the availability of access to E-CPR.",2016,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.07.003,108,NA,87-94,eng,1873-1570 0300-9572,Humans and Decision Making and Bioethical Issues and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*ethics and Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics and Organ Transplantation and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/mortality/*therapy and Emergency Medical Services/ethics and Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*ethics and Out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and Uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD),NA,NA,2016/11//undefined,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the majority may actually die following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) with a presumption of poor neurological recovery. We investigated how the protocol for neurological prognostication was used and how related treatment recommendations might have affected WLST decision-making and outcome after OHCA in the targeted temperature management (TTM) trial. METHODS: Analyses of prospectively recorded data: details of neurological prognostication; recommended level-of-care; WLST decisions; presumed cause of death; and cerebral performance category (CPC) 6 months following randomization. RESULTS: Of 939 patients, 452 (48%) woke and 139 (15%) died, mostly for non-neurological reasons, before a scheduled time point for neurological prognostication (72h after the end of TTM). Three hundred and thirteen (33%) unconscious patients underwent prognostication at a median 117 (IQR 93-137) hours after arrest. Thirty-three (3%) unconscious patients were not neurologically prognosticated and for 2 patients (1%) data were missing.

METHODS: Using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we identified the top 150 ED medications administered and prescribed at discharge in 2015. We used average wholesale prices (AWP) for each year from 2006 to 15 from the Red Book (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Average wholesale price per patient (AWPP) was calculated by dividing AWP by drug uses. This was then multiplied by the total drug administrations or prescriptions to estimate the total cost in a given the year. All prices were converted to 2015 dollars. RESULTS: Aggregate costs of drugs administered in the ED increased from $688.7 million in 2006 to $882.4 million in 2015. For discharge prescriptions, aggregate costs increased from $2.031 billion in 2006 to $4.572 billion in 2015. AWPP for drugs administered in the ED in 2015 was 14.5% higher than in 2006 and 24.3% higher at discharge. The largest absolute increase in AWPP for drugs administered was for glucagon, which increased from $111 in 2006 to $235 in 2015.

Elaine and Moore, Chris L.",The American journal of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Nontraumatic shock in the emergency department (ED) has multiple causes and carries in-hospital mortality approaching 20%, underscoring the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic ultrasonography at the point of care is one method that may improve the ability of ED physicians to quickly diagnose and treat. This study assesses the effect of the use and timing of point-of-care (POC) ultrasonography on time to disposition request. METHODS: This retrospective study across 4 Connecticut EDs compared propensity score matched shock patients who did and did not receive POC ultrasonography. Two propensity score matches were performed: the first using covariates of time to disposition from previous literature and the second using 25 novel covariates identified from electronic health records using machine learning to reduce variable selection biases. RESULTS: A total of 3834 unique patients presented with shock during an 18-month period, and 703 (18.3%) patients received POC ultrasonography. Mean time to disposition for all patients was 255.4minutes (interquartile range, 163.8). After propensity score matching, patients had a mean reduction of 26.7minutes (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-58.3) in time to disposition when POC ultrasonography was performed within 1hour of ED arrival and a lesser reduction of 16.7minutes (95% CI, -2.8 to 35.5) when POC ultrasonography was performed within 2hours. There was no evidence of reduction in time to disposition when ultrasonography was performed after 2hours (16.7minutes; 95% CI, -14.3 to 29.9).

Rosman_2009_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Carbamate poisoning: treatment recommendations in the setting of a mass casualties event,"Rosman, Yossi and Makarovsky, Igor and Bentur, Yedidia and Shrot, Shai and Dushnistky, Tsvika and Krivoy, Amir",The American journal of emergency medicine,"The threat of using chemical compounds by terrorists as weapons of mass casualties has been a rising concern in recent years. Carbamates, a group of reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, could be potentially involved in such toxic mass casualty events because they can cause cholinergic crisis that could lead to fatality, similar to that of organophosphate poisoning. The medical management of carbamate poisoning consists of supportive measures and specific antidotal treatment, that is, the anticholinergic compound atropine. The administration of oximes, acetylcholinesterase reactivators, in carbamate poisoning is controversial because of the potential toxicity of oximes in conjunction with carbamate especially in the case of the carbamate--""carbaryl"" poisoning. However, recent data suggest that this concern may be unwarranted. In this article, we review the current data regarding the pros and cons of using oximes against carbamates poisoning in a mass casualties event scenario. We also propose a new decision-making algorithm for the medical first responders in a mass casualties event suspected to be caused by a cholinergic substance (organophosphate or carbamate). According to this algorithm, treatment should consist of atropine and oxime regardless of the exact toxic compound involved. We speculate that in a mass casualties event, the benefits of using oximes outweigh the low level of potential risk.",2009,10.1016/j.ajem.2009.01.035,27,9,1117-1124,eng,1532-8171 0735-6757,Humans and *Mass Casualty Incidents and Antidotes/*therapeutic use and Atropine/therapeutic use and Carbamates/*poisoning and Chemical Terrorism and Insecticides/*poisoning and Muscarinic Antagonists/therapeutic use and Oximes/therapeutic use and Poisoning/diagnosis/etiology/therapy,NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aim to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. METHODS: Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42 hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100, mortality can be reduced to 60% or less. Prolonged interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent mortality.

We examined the incremental value of addition of a screening clinical tool (CT), containing clinical information and a Zoll electrocardiogram (ECG)-resident STEMI identification program (ZI) to ZI alone. METHODS: All EMS-performed and ZI-analyzed ECGs transmitted to a percutaneous coronary intervention hospital from October 2009 to January 2011 were reviewed for diagnostic accuracy. ZI performance was also compared to ECG interpretations by 2 experienced readers The CT was then retrospectively applied to determine the incremental benefit above the ZI alone. RESULTS: ST-elevation myocardial infarction was confirmed in 23 (7.5%) of 305 patients. ZI was positive in 37 (12.1%): sensitivity: 95.6% and specificity: 94.6%, positive predictive value (PPV), 59.5%, negative predictive value (NPV), 99.6%, and accuracy of 93.8%. Moderate agreement was observed among the readers and ZI. CT criteria for CL activation were met in 24 (7.8%): 20 (83.3%) were confirmed STEMIs: sensitivity: 86.9%, specificity: 98.5%, a PPV: 83.3%, and NPV: 98.6%, accuracy of 97.7%. CT + ZI increased PPV (P<0.05) and specificity (P<0.003) by reducing false positive STEMI identifications from 15 (4.9%) to 4 (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In an urban cohort of all EMS transmitted ECGs, ZI has high sensitivity and specificity for STEMI identification. Whereas the PPV was low, reflecting both low STEMI prevalence and presence of STEMI-mimics, the NPV was very high. These findings suggest that a simplified CT combined with computer STEMI interpretation can identify patients for pre-hospital CL activation.

Geyer_2014_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Patient preferences for testing for pulmonary embolism in the ED using a shared decision-making model,"Geyer, Brian C. and Xu, Maria and Kabrhel, Christopher",The American journal of emergency medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Shared decision making (SDM) is a process whereby patients and clinicians work together to make informed medical decisions that incorporate patient values. Recent data suggest that, for patients with low pretest probability of pulmonary embolism (PE), doubling the standard d-dimer cutoff may reduce the need for imaging with minimal increase in missed PE diagnoses. We used an SDM approach to determine patient preferences regarding this diagnostic approach. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a consecutive sample of emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain or dyspnea. We provided patients with a standardized description of the diagnostic workup for PE. We also provided image arrays describing the risks of computed tomography in low pretest probability patients and the risks of deferring imaging assuming a d-dimer was less than twice the value normally considered positive. We surveyed patients for their preference to undergo or defer imaging in this scenario. RESULTS: We enrolled 203 ED patients. Mean age was 55 <c2><b1> 17 years, and 61% were male. Seventy-four patients (37%) elected to defer computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries testing. Patients with a previous PE diagnosis were less likely to defer computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries testing (P = .007). There was no association between the decision to defer testing and age, sex, family history of PE, or self-assessed risk-taking tendency. CONCLUSIONS: When presented with a hypothetical scenario, more than one-third of patients deferred imaging for PE based on low clinical probability and a d-dimer less than twice the normal threshold.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of perception of inappropriate CPR of the last cardiac arrest encountered by clinicians working in emergency departments and out-of-hospital, factors associated with perception, and its relation to patient outcome. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 288 centres in 24 countries. Factors associated with perception of CPR and outcome were analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests and conditional logistic models. RESULTS: Of the 4018 participating clinicians, 3150 (78.4%) perceived their last CPR attempt as appropriate, 548 (13.6%) were uncertain about its appropriateness and 320 (8.0%) perceived inappropriateness; survival to hospital discharge was 370/2412 (15.3%), 8/481 (1.7%) and 8/294 (2.7%) respectively. After adjusting for country, team and clinician's characteristics, the prevalence of perception of inappropriate CPR was higher for a non-shockable initial rhythm (OR 3.76 [2.13-6.64]; P < .0001), a non-witnessed arrest (2.68 [1.89-3.79]; P < .0001), in older patients (2.94 [2.18-3.96]; P < .0001, for patients >79 years) and in case of a ""poor"" first physical impression of the patient (3.45 [2.36-5.05]; P < .0001). In accordance, non-shockable and non-witnessed arrests were both associated with lower survival to hospital discharge (0.33 [0.26-0.41]; P < 0.0001 and 0.25 [0.15-0.41]; P < 0.0001, respectively), as were older patient age (0.25 [0.14-0.44]; P < 0.0001 for patients >79 years) and a ""poor"" first physical impression (0.26 [0.19-0.35]; P < 0.0001).

METHODOLOGY: We distributed a survey through professional societies and research networks. We asked demographic characteristics, preferences for prognostic test performance characteristics and views on acceptable false positive rates for decisions about LST after cardiac arrest. RESULTS: Overall, 640 respondents participated in our survey. Most respondents were attending physicians (74%) with >10 years of experience (59%) and practiced at academic centers (77%). Common specialties were neurology (22%), neuro- or general critical care (24%) and palliative care (31%). The majority (56%) felt an acceptable FPR for withdrawal of LST from patients who might otherwise have recovered was <e2><89><a4>0.1%. Acceptable FPRs for continuing LST in patients with unrecognized irrecoverable injury was higher, with 59% choosing a threshold <e2><89><a4>1%. Compared to providers with >10 years of experience, those with <5 years thought lower FPRs were acceptable (P < 0.001 for both). Palliative care providers accepted significantly higher FPRs for withdrawal of LST (P < 0.0001), and critical care providers accepted significantly higher FPRs for provision of long-term LST (P = 0.02). With regard to test performance characteristics, providers favored accuracy over timeliness, and prefer tests be optimized to predictrather than favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Medical providers are comfortable with low acceptable FPR for withdrawal (<e2><89><a4>0.1%) and continuation (<e2><89><a4>1%) of LST after cardiac arrest.

However, our data showed that some of those OHCA patients with Do-Not-Resuscitate orders signed in hospital survived to hospital discharge, and even recovered with favorable neurological function. In this study, we described their clinical features and identified those factors that were associated with better outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, observational analysis was performed on all adult non-traumatic OHCA who were enrolled in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) PRIMED study but signed Do-Not-Resuscitate orders in hospital after admission. We reported their demographics, characteristics, interventions and outcomes of all enrolled cases. Patients surviving and not surviving to hospital discharge, as well as those who did and did not obtain favorable neurological recovery, were compared. Logistic regression models assessed those factors which might be prognostic to survival and favorable neurological outcomes at discharge. RESULTS: Of 2289 admitted patients with Do-Not-Resuscitate order signed in hospital, 132(5.8%) survived to hospital discharge and 28(1.2%) achieved favorable neurological recovery. Those factors, including witnessed arrest, prehospital shock delivered, Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) obtained in the field, cardiovascular interventions or procedures applied, and no prehospital adrenaline administered, were independently associated with better outcomes.

SETTING AND POPULATIONS: A Tertiary Referral Hospital (TRH) and a Metropolitan General Hospital (MGH) who combined have approximately 82,000 admissions annually with 38,000 patients meeting the eligibility criteria. The population included all admissions to the two hospitals aged 15 years and over with a stay>1 day (12 months period). Admissions that had a MET call originating in general wards were defined as Admissions Associated with a MET call (AAMET). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of MET call audit forms, a Death Review database, and routinely collected hospital data for the period 1st October 2004 to 30th September 2005, inclusive. Chronic morbidity was calculated as a Charlson Index (CI) score over previous visits and admissions using ICD10 & ICD9 diagnosis and procedure codes. RESULTS: There were 633 and 349 AAMETs. The incidence rates (MET calls/1000 admissions) were 37.6 and 34.1. They were associated with being elderly; males; higher CI scores; surgical admissions, Emergency Department (ED) admissions, and longer length of stay (LOS). A systolic BP<90mm Hg, and ""worried"" were the most frequent MET call criteria. There were 27 (4.3%) and 9 (2.6%) deaths following a MET call, of these 17 and 5 had Cardiac Arrest (CA) as the reason for the call. Death occurred for 192 and 54 AAMETs, only 38 (20%) and 14 (26%) were Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) deaths. One hundred and forty-seven (23.2%) and eighty-seven (24.9%) AAMETs had a MET call within 24h of transfer from a critical care area; the proportions of transfers differed significantly between the two hospitals. CONCLUSION: A well established MET system identified similar AAMET populations from two different hospital populations.

The effects of medical decision making on resource use was assessed by comparing costs of radiographic studies, laboratory studies, and medication. RESULTS: Between-group differences in mean patient age, sex, and triage category were insignificant. Compared to pediatricians, EPs used radiographic and laboratory studies more frequently (respectively, 10.1% and 3.8% higher frequency and 90.5% and 7.6% higher cost) and less medication (12.5% lower cost). Patients managed by EPs had longer ED length of stay (LOS), higher admission rates to general wards, and shorter LOS per hospitalization but similar 72-hour revisit rates, needed more frequent referral for medical reasons, and left more frequently against medical advice.

METHODS: The study relied on secondary data originally collected as part of nurses' assessment of emergency physicians' nonclinical skills in the emergency department (ED) of an academic medical center in the Middle East. Participants were 36 registered nurses who had worked in the ED for at least 2 years and had worked for at least 2 shifts per month with the physician being evaluated. RESULTS: Through content analysis, a nurse-led competency model was identified, including 8 core competencies encompassing 33 subcompetencies. The 8 core competencies were emotional intelligence; problem-solving and decisionmaking skills; operations management; patient focus; patient care, procedural skills, and medical knowledge; professionalism; communication skills; and team leadership and management. When the developed model was compared with the ACGME model, the 2 models diverged more than they converged. CONCLUSION: The nurses' perspective offered distinctive insight into the competencies needed for physicians in an emergency medicine environment, indicating the value of nurses' perspective and shedding light on the need for more systematic and more methodologically sound studies to examine the issue further.

We seek to determine whether the use of shared decisionmaking changes perceptions of fault and liability in the case of an adverse outcome. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled simulation experiment conducted by survey, using clinical vignettes featuring no shared decisionmaking, brief shared decisionmaking, or thorough shared decisionmaking. Participants were adult US citizens recruited through an online crowd-sourcing platform. Participants were randomized to vignettes portraying 1 of 3 levels of shared decisionmaking. All other information given was identical, including the final clinical decision and the adverse outcome. The primary outcome was reported likelihood of pursuing legal action. Secondary outcomes included perceptions of fault, quality of care, and trust in physician. RESULTS: We recruited 804 participants. Participants exposed to shared decisionmaking (brief and thorough) were 80% less likely to report a plan to contact a lawyer than those not exposed to shared decisionmaking (12% and 11% versus 41%; odds ratio 0.2; 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.31). Participants exposed to either level of shared decisionmaking reported higher trust, rated their physicians more highly, and were less likely to fault their physicians for the adverse outcome compared with those exposed to the no shared decisionmaking vignette.

Its predictive value upon hospital admission remains unclear. Our objective was to determine the prognostic value of the absence of PLR upon hospital admission in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We prospectively included all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring between July 2011 and July 2017 treated by a mobile medical team (MMT) based on data from a French cardiac arrest registry database. PLR was evaluated upon hospital admission and the outcome on day 30. The prognosis was classified as good for Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2, and poor for CPC 3-5 or in case of death. RESULTS: Data from 10151 patients was analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of the absence of PLR for a poor outcome were 72.2% (71.2-73.2) and 68.8% (66.7-70.1), respectively. We identified several variables modifying the sensitivity values and the false positive fraction of a factor, ranging from 0.49 (0.35-0.69) for the Glasgow Coma Scale to 2.17 (1.09-2.48) for pupillary asymmetry. Among those living with CPC 1 or 2 on day 30 (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>1990; 19.6%), 621 (31.2% (29.2-33.3)) had no PLR upon hospital admission. In the multivariate analysis, loss of PLR was associated with a poor outcome (OR<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>3.1 (2.7-3.5)).

We evaluated the performance of disposition and acuity prediction by emergency physicians (EPs) using a System 1 decision-making process. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of attending EPs and emergency medicine residents. Physicians were provided patient demographics, chief complaint, and vital sign data and made two assessments on initial presentation: (1) likely disposition (discharge vs admission) and (2) ""sick"" vs ""not-sick"". A patient was adjudicated as sick if he/she had a disease process that was potentially life or limb threatening based on pre-defined operational, financial, or educationally derived criteria. RESULTS: We obtained 266 observations in 178 different patients. Physicians predicted patient disposition with the following performance: sensitivity 87.7% (95% CI 81.4-92.1), specificity 65.0% (95% CI 56.1-72.9), LR+ 2.51 (95% CI 1.95-3.22), LR- 0.19 (95% CI 0.12-0.30).

METHODS: Retrospective medical record review from a single large urban EMS system of EMS-treated pediatric (<18years of age) out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) occurring between 2008 and 2011. A chart review tool was developed for this project and each chart was reviewed by a multidisciplinary review panel. Safety events were identified in the following clinical domains: resuscitation; assessment, impression/diagnosis, and clinical decision making; airway/breathing; fluids and medications; procedures; equipment; environment; and system. RESULTS: From a total of 497 critical transports during the study period, we identified 35 OHCA cases (7%). A total of 87% of OHCA cases had a safety event identified. Epinephrine overdoses were identified in 31% of the OHCA cases, most of which were 10-fold overdoses. Other medication errors included failure to administer epinephrine when indicated and administration of atropine when not indicated. In 20% of OHCA cases, 3 or more intubation attempts took place or intubation attempts were ultimately not successful. Lack of end-tidal C02 use for tube confirmation was also common. The most common arrest algorithm errors were placing an advanced airway too early (before administration of epinephrine) and giving a medication not included in the algorithm, primarily atropine, both occurring in almost 1/3 of cases.

Michael",Resuscitation,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of children at risk for cardiac arrest would allow for skill training associated with improved outcomes and provides a prevention opportunity. OBJECTIVE: Develop and assess a predictive model for cardiopulmonary arrest using data available in the first 4 h. METHODS: Data from PICU patients from 8 institutions included descriptive, severity of illness, cardiac arrest, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 10074 patients, 120 satisfying inclusion criteria sustained a cardiac arrest and 67 (55.9%) died. In univariate analysis, patients with cardiac arrest prior to admission were over 6 times and those with cardiac arrests during the first 4 h were over 50 times more likely to have a subsequent arrest. The multivariate logistic regression model performance was excellent (area under the ROC curve = 0.85 and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, p = 0.35). The variables with the highest odds ratio's for sustaining a cardiac arrest in the multivariable model were admission from an inpatient unit (8.23 (CI: 4.35-15.54)), and cardiac arrest in the first 4 h (6.48 (CI: 2.07-20.36). The average risk predicted by the model was highest (11.6%) among children sustaining an arrest during hours >4-12 and continued to be high even for days after the risk assessment period; the average predicted risk was 9.5% for arrests that occurred after 8 PICU days.

Our objective was to determine the extent of physician variation in the HEART score of admitted patients stratified by years of experience. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review at an academic tertiary care emergency department to determine HEART score, outcome of hospitalization, and 30-day MACE. Electrocardiograms were graded by consensus between 3 physicians. We used analysis of variance to determine the difference in mean HEART scores between providers, Fisher's exact test to determine difference in MACE by duration of training, and logistic regression to determine predictors of low-risk admission (HEART score<e2><89><a4>3). RESULTS: The average mean HEART score for 19 full-time physicians was 4.41 (SD 0.43). Individually, there was no difference in mean scores (P=.070), but physicians with 10-15 years of experience had significantly higher mean scores than those with 0-5 years of experience (mean HEART score 4.65 vs 3.93, P=.012). Those with 10-15 years of experience also had a significantly higher proportion of MACE in their admitted cohort (15.3%, P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: More experienced providers admitted higher-risk patients and were more likely to admit patients who would experience a MACE.

This study performed an external validation of the STONE score, focusing on the Korean population, and a derivation of the modified STONE score for better specificity and sensitivity. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients complaining of flank pain at a single emergency department from January 2013 to December 2014. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to their STONE score. The prevalence of ureter stones and other alternative findings were calculated in each group. We derived a modified STONE score based on a multivariable analysis and performed an interval validation. RESULTS: From the 700 patients included in the analysis, 555 patients (79%) had a ureter stone. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the STONE score was 0.92. The sensitivity of the high stone score was 0.56. In the modified STONE score, nausea, vomiting, and racial predictors were substituted by C-reactive protein and previous stone history. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity of the modified STONE score in the internal validation group significantly increased to 0.94 and 0.80, respectively. CONCLUSION: The STONE score can be used to predict a ureter stone with a low probability of other alternative findings. The modified STONE score might increase the diagnostic performance in suspicious urinary stone cases.

ED visits often mark an inflection point in these patients' illness trajectories, signaling a more rapid rate of decline. Although most patients are there seeking care for acute issues, many of them have priorities other than to simply live as long as possible; yet without discussion of preferences for treatment, they are at risk of receiving care not aligned with their goals. An ED visit may offer a unique ""teachable moment"" to empower patients to consider their ability to influence future medical care decisions. However, the constraints of the ED setting pose specific challenges, and little research exists to guide clinicians treating patients in this setting. We describe the current state of goals-of-care conversations in the ED, outline the challenges to conducting these conversations, and recommend a research agenda to better equip emergency physicians to guide shared decisionmaking for end-of-life care.

Recommendations from other specialties may also identify opportunities to improve quality and patient safety in emergency care. The Choosing Wisely work group of the ACEP Quality and Patient Safety Committee seeks to identify and characterize the Choosing Wisely recommendations from other professional societies with the highest relevance to emergency care. METHODS: In June 2016, all Choosing Wisely recommendations from other specialties were obtained from the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation. Using a modified Delphi method, the 10 group members rated recommendations for relevance on a validated 7-point scale. Recommendations identified as highly relevant (median score=7) were rated on 3 additional characteristics: cost savings (1=large, 5=none), risk-benefit profile (1=benefit >risk, 5=risk >benefit), and actionability by emergency physicians (1=complete, 5=none). Results are presented as overall means (eg, mean of subcategory means) and subcategory means with SDs. RESULTS: Initial review of 412 recommendations identified 49 items as highly relevant to emergency care. Eleven were redundant with ACEP recommendations, leaving 38 items from 25 professional societies. Overall means for items ranged from 1.57 to 3.1. Recommendations' scores averaged 3.2 (SD 0.6) for cost savings, 1.9 (SD 0.4) for risk-benefit, and 1.6 (SD 0.5) for actionability. The most common conditions in these recommendations were infectious diseases (14 items; 37%), head injury (4 items; 11%), and primary headache disorders (4 items; 11%).

Both patients and physicians consider good communication important, however little is known about patient involvement in and understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) directives. AIM: To determine the prevalence of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)-orders, to describe recollection of CPR-directive conversations and factors associated with patient recollection and understanding. METHODS: This was a two-week nationwide multicentre cross-sectional observational study using a study-specific survey. The study population consisted of patients admitted to non-monitored wards in 13 hospitals. Data were collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) concerning CPR-directive, comorbidity and at-home medication. Patients reported their perception and expectations about CPR-counselling through a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1136 patients completed the questionnaire. Patients' CPR-directives were documented in the EMR as follows: 63.7% full code, 27.5% DNR and in 8.8% no directive was documented. DNR was most often documented for patients >80 years (66.4%) and in patients using >10 medications (45.3%). Overall, 55.8% of patients recalled having had a conversation about their CPR-directive and 48.1% patients reported the same CPR-directive as the EMR. Most patients had a good experience with the CPR-directive conversation in general (66.1%), as well as its timing (84%) and location (94%) specifically. CONCLUSIONS: The average DNR-prevalence is 27.5%. Correct understanding of their CPR-directive is lowest in patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years and multimorbid patients.

Heavier workload in the ED and greater severity of the triage classification predicted more LET (OR-1.67, CI<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>1.05-1.76, p<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>.003 and OR<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>1.42, CI-0.60-0.81, p<e2><80><af><<e2><80><af>.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that patient characteristics contributed most crucially to the therapeutic approaches (C statistic 0.624-0.675, CI-0.62-0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic approach used for EOL patients in the ED depends on variables in all three treatment layers: patient, medical staff, and ED setting.

In 2015, the UK Royal College of Emergency Medicine introduced explicit validated descriptors of nontechnical skills needed to function effectively in the ED. A new nontechnical skills assessment tool that provided a score for 12 domains of nontechnical skills and detailed narrative feedback, the Extended Supervised Learning Event (ESLE), was introduced and was mandated as part of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine assessment schedule. We aim to evaluate the psychometric reliability of the ESLE in its first year of use. METHODS: ESLEs were mandated for all UK emergency medicine trainees in the final 4 years of a 6-year national training program from August 2015. The completed assessments were uploaded to the Royal College of Emergency Medicine e-portfolio. All assessments recorded in the Royal College of Emergency Medicine e-portfolio database between August 2015 and August 2016 were anonymized and analyzed for psychometric reliability, using generalizability theory. Decision analysis was used to model the effect of altering the number of episodes and assessors on reliability. RESULTS: A total of 1,390 ESLEs were analyzed. The majority (62%) of the variation in nontechnical skills scores was attributable to the trainee's ability. The circumstances of the event (eg, case complexity, workload) accounted for 21% and the stringency or leniency of assessors the remaining 16%. Decision analysis suggests that 3 ESLEs by 2 or more assessors, as currently recommended in the Royal College of Emergency Medicine curriculum, provide an assessment with a reliability coefficient of 0.8.

K.",The American journal of emergency medicine,"BACKGROUND: Acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is a common reason for hospitalization with substantial associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Differentiation of high- and low-risk patients using established risk scoring systems has been advocated. The aim of this study was to determine whether these scoring systems are more accurate than an emergency physician's clinical decision making in predicting the need for endoscopic intervention in acute UGIH. METHODS: Patients presenting to a tertiary care medical center with acute UGIH from 2003 to 2006 were identified from the hospital database, and their clinical data were abstracted. One hundred ninety-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The clinical Rockall score and Blatchford score (BS) were calculated and compared with the clinical triage decision (intensive care unit vs non-intensive care unit admission) in predicting the need for endoscopic therapy. RESULTS: Clinical Rockall score greater than 0 and BS greater than 0 were sensitive predictors of the need for endoscopic therapy (95% and 100%) but were poorly specific (9% and 4%), with overall accuracies of 41% and 39%. At higher score cutoffs, clinical Rockall score greater than 2 and BS greater than 5 remained sensitive (84% and 87%) and were more specific (29% and 33%), with overall accuracies of 48% and 52%. Clinical triage decision, as a surrogate for predicting the need for endoscopic therapy, was moderately sensitive (67%) and specific (75%), with an overall accuracy (73%) that exceeded both risk scores.

An observational study in a low-resource sub-Saharan hospital,"Kellett, John and Wasingya-Kasereka, Lucien and Brabrand, Mikkel",Resuscitation,"BACKGROUND: The first clinical re-assessment after admission to hospital probably provides the best opportunity to detect clinical deterioration or failure to improve, and decide if care should be intensified. AIM: Compare changes the day after admission in the patient's subjective feelings and objective findings that included age, gender, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) on admission, gait stability and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) on admission, and changes in NEWS, gait stability and mental alertness. SETTING: Acutely ill medical patients admitted to a low-resource sub-Saharan hospital. METHODS: Prospective observational study. RESULTS: 1810 patients were reassessed 18 h after hospital admission. Logistic regression identified NEWS and gait stability on admission, a subjective feeling of improvement, the change in NEWS, and MUAC as clinically significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Stratifying patients according to their NEWS on admission altered the predictive value of the four other predictors: for patients with an admission NEWS < 3 a subjective feeling of improvement is the most powerful predictor of a good outcome. For patients with an admission NEWS > = 3 the change in NEWS, gait stability on admission and MUAC provide additional prognostic information.

Bahus_2012_Resu,JOUR,"Law, ethics and clinical judgment in end-of-life decisions--how do Norwegian doctors think?","Bahus, Marianne K. and Steen, Petter Andreas and Forde, Reidun",Resuscitation,"AIM: According to Norwegian law, an autonomous patient has the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment. If the patient is not defined as dying, however, health personnel are obliged to instigate life-saving treatment in an emergency situation even against the patient's wishes. The purpose of this study was to investigate how doctors' attitudes and knowledge agree with these legal provisions, and how the statutory provision on emergency situations influences the principle of patient autonomy for severely ill, but not dying, patients. METHOD: A strategic sample of 1175 Norwegian doctors who are specialists in internal medicine, paediatrics, surgery, neurology and neurosurgery received a mail questionnaire about decisions on end-of-life care in hypothetical scenarios. The case presented concerns a 45-year-old autonomous patient diagnosed with end-stage ALS who declines ventilatory treatment. Recipients were randomly selected from the membership roster of the Norwegian Medical Association. 640 (54.5%) responded; of these, 406 had experience with end-of-life decisions. RESULTS: 56.1% (221/394) stated that ALS patients in such situations can always refuse life-prolonging treatment, and 42.4% (167/394) were of the opinion that the patient can normally refuse life-prolonging treatment. 1.5% (6/394) stated that the patient cannot refuse life-prolonging treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The answers indicate that the respondents include patients' refusal in an overall clinical judgement, and interpret patients' right to decline life-saving treatment in different ways.

METHODS: Retrospective review at two academic EDs. Adult trauma patients undergoing FAST examinations used for clinical decision-making at the bedside were identified from an ED ultrasound image archival system. Expert sonologists reviewed ultrasound images for incidental findings, as well as electronic medical records for demographic information, mechanism of injury, type of incidental findings, documentation of incidental findings, and communication of incidental findings to the patient. RESULTS: A total of 1,452 FAST examinations were reviewed. One hundred and thirty-seven patients with incidental findings were identified (9.4%); 7 patients had an additional incidental finding.

Yet, despite numerous studies, the potential of HRV to improve clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether HRV metrics provide additional diagnostic information, beyond routine vital signs, for making a specific clinical assessment: identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. METHODS: Adult prehospital trauma patients were analyzed retrospectively, excluding those who lacked a complete set of reliable vital signs and a clean electrocardiogram for computation of HRV metrics. We also excluded patients who did not survive to admission. The primary outcome was hemorrhagic injury plus different PRBC transfusion volumes. We performed multivariate regression analysis using HRV metrics and routine vital signs to test the hypothesis that HRV metrics could improve the diagnosis of hemorrhagic injury plus PRBC transfusion vs routine vital signs alone. RESULTS: As univariate predictors, HRV metrics in a data set of 402 subjects had comparable areas under receiver operating characteristic curves compared with routine vital signs. In multivariate regression models containing routine vital signs, HRV parameters were significant (P<.05) but yielded areas under receiver operating characteristic curves with minimal, nonsignificant improvements (+0.00 to +0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A novel diagnostic test should improve diagnostic thinking and allow for better decision making in a significant fraction of cases.

METHODS: We conducted a 2-year cohort study at a level 1 trauma center and compared our results with the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2010. All adult patients discharged from the ED with MTBI-associated diagnoses were included. After a baseline observation period at our institution, real-time CDS was implemented. Based upon the clinical history entered, low utility orders triggered an alert to clinicians, suggesting imaging studies might not adhere to evidence-based guidelines.

Although there is increasing acceptance of out-of-hospital termination of resuscitation for adult traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest when there is no expectation of a good outcome, children are routinely excluded from state termination-of-resuscitation protocols. The decision to withhold resuscitative efforts in a child under specific circumstances (decapitation or dependent lividity, rigor mortis, etc) is reasonable. If there is any doubt as to the circumstances or timing of the traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest, under the current status of limiting termination of resuscitation in the field to persons older than 18 years in most states, resuscitation should be initiated and continued until arrival to the appropriate facility. If the patient has arrested, resuscitation has already exceeded 30 minutes, and the nearest facility is more than 30 minutes away, involvement of parents and family of these children in the decision-making process with assistance and guidance from medical professionals should be considered as part of an emphasis on family-centered care, because the evidence suggests that either death or a poor outcome is inevitable.",2014,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2014.01.013,63,4,504-515,eng,1097-6760 0196-0644,Humans and Adolescent and Child and children and emergency medical services and outcome and *Resuscitation Orders and survival and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*standards and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*therapy and advanced life support and and adolescent and basic life support and blunt trauma and cardiorespiratory arrest and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and out-of-hospital termination of resuscitation and resuscitative thoracotomy and Thoracotomy/standards and traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest and Wounds and Injuries/*therapy,NA,NA,2014/04//undefined,Ann Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Return of spontaneous circulation has been reported in as few as 0% and as many as 45% of patients with cardiac standstill. When explicitly documented, the definition of cardiac activity in these studies varied from any slight change in echogenicity of the myocardium to any kinetic cardiac activity. We hypothesize that the variability in research definitions of cardiac activity may affect interpretation of video clips of patients in cardiac arrest. The goal of this study is to assess the variability in interpretation of standstill among physician sonographers. METHODS: We surveyed physician sonographers at 6 conferences held at 3 academic medical centers in the Greater New York area. Survey respondents were allotted 20 seconds per slide to determine whether each of 15 video clips of patients in cardiac arrest were standstill or not. Data were collected anonymously with radio frequency remotes. RESULTS: There were 127 total participants, including faculty, fellows, and resident physicians specializing in emergency medicine, critical care, and cardiology. There was only moderate interrater agreement among all participants (<ce><b1>=0.47). This lack of agreement persisted across specialties, self-reported training levels, and self-reported ultrasonographic expertise.

A previous prearrest prediction tool for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) have not performed satisfactory in external validation in a Swedish cohort. Therefore our aim was to develop a prediction model for the Swedish setting. METHODS: Model development was based on previous external validation of The Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score, with 717 adult IHCAs. It included redefinition and reduction of predictors, and addition of chronic comorbidity, to create a full model of 9 predictors. Outcome was favourable neurological survival defined as Cerebral Performance Category score 1-2<e2><80><af> at discharge. The likelihood of favourable neurological survival was categorised into very low (<1%), low (1-3%) and above low (>3%). RESULTS: We called the model the Prediction of outcome for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (PIHCA) score. The AUROC was 0.808 (95% CI 0.807-0.810) and calibration was satisfactory. With a cutoff of 3% likelihood of favourable neurological survival sensitivity was 99.4% and specificity 8.4%. Although specificity was limited, predictive value for classification into <e2><89><a4>3% likelihood of favorable neurological survival was high (97.4%) and false classification into <e2><89><a4>3% likelihood of favourable neurological survival was low (0.6%).

Therefore it is essential for physicians to make an objective prearrest prediction of the outcome after an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Our aim was external validation of the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score in a population based setting. METHODS: The study was based on a retrospective cohort of adult IHCAs in Stockholm County 2013-2014 identified through the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry. This registry provided patient and event characteristics and neurological outcome at discharge. Neurologically intact survival is defined as Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) 1 at discharge. Data for the GO-FAR variables was obtained from manual review of electronic patient records. Model performance was evaluated by measure of discrimination with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and calibration with assessment of the calibration plot. RESULTS: The cohort included 717 patients with neurologically intact survival at discharge of 22%. In complete case analysis (523 cases) AUROC was 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86) indicating good discrimination. The calibration plot showed that the GO-FAR score systematically underestimates the probability of neurologically intact survival.

The incidence was 6.3/1000 index RRT reviews or 4.6/100,000 hospital admissions. Patients who suffered an IHCA within 48<e2><80><af>h after RRT review were more likely to have a preceding ICU admission, and their median national early warning scores (NEWSs) at the end of the index RRT reviews (=last NEWSs) were higher than those of the controls. Higher last NEWS was the only factor associated with ICHA after RRT review (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.49, p<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.048) in a conditional multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: IHCA within 48<e2><80><af>h after an index RRT review on general ward is a rare event with poor prognosis. It is independently associated with higher NEWS at the end of the index RRT review.

For anaphylaxis, it is given intramuscularly at a low dose, whereas for cardiac arrest a higher dose is required intravenously. We encountered a patient with suspected anaphylaxis who developed transient severe systolic dysfunction because of inappropriately received cardiac arrest dose, ie, larger dose given as an intravenous push. Three additional patients who experienced potentially lethal cardiac complications after receiving inappropriately higher doses intravenously were also identified. These iatrogenic errors resulted from underlying confusion by physicians about proper dosing of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. The risk of error was amplified by the need for rapid decision making in critically ill anaphylactic patients. An e-mail survey of local hospitals in southeast Michigan revealed that 6 of 7 hospitals did not stock prefilled intramuscular dose syringes for emergency use in anaphylaxis. At our institution, we have introduced prefilled and appropriately labeled intramuscularly dosed epinephrine syringes in crash carts, which are easily distinguished from intravenously dosed epinephrine syringes. In this Concepts article, we describe the clinical problem of inadvertent epinephrine overdose and propose a potential solution.

We studied the impact of prior noninvasive testing (ie, stress testing) for myocardial ischemia on disposition decision making in ED patients with potential ACS. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of ED patients with chest pain who received an electrocardiogram for potential ACS. Data included demographics, medical history, stress test history, and TIMI risk score. Patients were followed in-house; 30-day telephone interviews were performed for follow-up. Main outcomes were ED disposition (admit/discharge) and a composite of 30-day death, acute myocardial infarction, and revascularization stratified on the basis of prior stress testing known at the time of presentation. Standard statistical techniques were used with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: There were 1853 patients enrolled and 97% had follow-up. Patients had a mean age of 53 +/- 14 years; 60% were women, 67% were black. There were 1491 (79%) patients without a prior stress test, 291 (16%) had a normal prior stress test result, and 89 (5%) had an abnormal prior stress test result. Admission rates were 92% (95% CI, 87%-98%) for patients with a prior abnormal stress test, 73% (95% CI, 67%-78%) for patients with a normal prior stress test, and 70% (95% CI, 67%-72%) for patients without a prior stress test. Adverse outcomes were the highest among patients with prior abnormal stress test but did not differ significantly between patients with no prior stress test and patients with prior normal stress test (10.1% [95% CI, 3.6-16.7%] vs 5.2% [95% CI, 4.1-6.4%] vs 4.8% [95% CI, 2.4-7.3%]). CONCLUSION: Patients without prior stress tests and patients with prior normal stress tests were admitted for potential ACS at the same rate and had the same 30-day cardiovascular event rates. This suggests that prior stress testing does not affect subsequent disposition decisions. Perhaps cardiac catheterization or computed tomography coronary angiograms would have more of an impact on subsequent visits, making them potentially more cost-effective in the low-risk patient.",2007,10.1016/j.ajem.2006.05.027,25,1,39-44,eng,0735-6757,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Prospective Studies and *Emergency Service, Hospital and *Exercise Test and Chest Pain/*diagnosis/physiopathology and Coronary Disease/*diagnosis/physiopathology",NA,NA,2007/01//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) was used to identify all cases of traumatic OHCA between July 2008 and June 2014. We excluded cases <16 years of age or with a mechanism of hanging or drowning. RESULTS: Of the 2334 cases of traumatic OHCA, resuscitation was attempted in 28% of cases and this rate remained steady over time (p=0.10). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the arresting rhythm [shockable (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=18.52, 95% confidence interval (CI):6.68-51.36) or pulseless electrical activity (AOR=12.58, 95%CI:9.06-17.45) relative to asystole] and mechanism of injury [motorcycle collision (AOR=2.49, 95%CI:1.60-3.86), fall (AOR=1.91, 95%CI:1.17-3.11) and shooting/stabbing (AOR=2.25, 95%CI:1.17-4.31) relative to a motor vehicle collision] were positively associated with attempted resuscitation. Arrests occurring in rural regions had a significantly lower odds of attempted resuscitation relative to those in urban regions (AOR=0.64, 95%CI:0.46-0.90). Resuscitation attempts <e2><89><a4>10min represented 34% of cases in which resuscitation was attempted but the patient died at the scene. When these resuscitation attempts were selectively excluded from the overall EMS treated population, survival to hospital discharge non-significantly increased from 3.8% to 5.0% (p=0.314).

Transferred patients rarely meet the 120-minute benchmark for timely reperfusion, and referring emergency departments (EDs) are a major source of preventable delays. We sought to use more granular data at transferring EDs to describe the variability in length of stay at referring EDs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a secondary data set used for quality improvement for patients with STEMI transferred to a single PCI center between 2008 and 2012. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the total time spent at each referring ED (door-in-door-out [DIDO] interval), periods that comprised DIDO (door to electrocardiogram [EKG], EKG-to-PCI activation, and PCI activation to exit), and the relationship of each period with overall time to reperfusion (medical contact-to-balloon [MCTB] interval). RESULTS: We identified 41 EDs that transferred 620 patients between 2008 and 2012. Median MCTB was 135 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 114,172). Median overall ED DIDO was 74 minutes (IQR 56,103) and was composed of door to EKG, 5 minutes (IQR 2,11); EKG-to-PCI activation, 18 minutes (IQR 7,37); and PCI activation to exit, 44 minutes (IQR 34,56). Door-in door-out accounted for the largest proportion (60%) of overall MCTB and had the largest variability (coefficient of variability, 1.37) of these intervals. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of transferring EDs, we found high variability and substantial delays after EKG performance for patients with STEMI.

METHODS: Volunteers underwent an alcohol challenge. Pre- and post-alcohol challenge, subjects were videotaped performing three standardized clinical examinations: (1) Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) examination, (2) Hack's Impairment Index (HII) examination, and (3) Cincinnati Intoxication Examination (CIE). Emergency clinicians evaluated the level of intoxication using five standardized assessment tools in a blinded and randomized fashion: (1) SFST assessment tool (range 0-18), (2) HII assessment tool (range 0-1), (3) St. Elizabeth Alcohol Intoxication Scale (STE, range 0-17), (4) a Visual Analog Scale (VAS, range 0-100), and (5) a Binary Intoxication Question (BIQ). Construct validity was assessed along with inter- and intra-rater reliability. RESULTS: Median scores pre- and post-alcohol challenge were: SFST 6 (interquartile range 5) and 11 (3), respectively; HII 0 (0.05), 0.1 (0.1); STE 0 (1), 1 (2); VAS 10 (22), 33 (31).

Maag_2015_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Positive predictive value of an elevated cardiac troponin for type I myocardial infarction in ED patients based on the chief complaint,"Maag, Ronald and Sun, Susie and Hannon, Michael and Davies, Rhian and Alagona, Peter and Foy, Andrew",The American journal of emergency medicine,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin testing is used to aid the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in the emergency department (ED) for patients who present with a range of symptoms. From a clinical perspective, the distinction between MI due to acute coronary artery thrombosis (type I MI) and other forms of direct and secondary myocardial injury (type II MI) is very important. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) of an elevated troponin for diagnosing type I MI, based on clinical history, has not been described. The objective of this study was to determine the PPV of an elevated troponin for type I MI based on the ED chief complaint. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1772 consecutive patients who had a troponin ordered in the ED at a tertiary care center over the period of March 1, 2013, to April 30, 2013. The chief complaint was based on official ED coding. For patients with a positive troponin, 2 authors independently reviewed the electronic medical record pertaining to the index encounter and subsequent hospitalization to adjudicate the cause. RESULTS: There was a significant association between the PPV of an elevated troponin for type I MI and the chief complaint. Patients with a chief complaint of chest pain were significantly more likely to have a type I MI compared to those without (PPV 84% vs 20%; Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 14.31; P < .0001). There was also a significant association between the rate of type I MI and the chief complaint in all patients who had a troponin drawn.

Davey_2018_Anofemme,JOUR,Application of the Canadian Computed Tomography Head Rule to Patients With Minimal Head Injury,"Davey, Kevin and Saul, Turandot and Russel, Geoffrey and Wassermann, Jonathan and Quaas, Joshua",Annals of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Two clinical decision rules, the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria, set the standard to guide clinicians in determining which patients with minor head trauma need computed tomography (CT) imaging. Both rules were derived with patients with minor head injury who had had a loss of consciousness or witnessed disorientation. No evidence exists for evaluating patients and need for CT imaging with minimal head injury; that is, patients who had a head injury but no loss of consciousness or disorientation and therefore would have been excluded from the Canadian CT Head Rule and New Orleans Criteria trials. We evaluate the Canadian CT Head Rule in patients with head injury without loss of consciousness or witnessed disorientation (minimal head injury). METHODS: We studied a prospective convenience sample of patients with minimal head injury who received head CTs as part of their evaluations in the emergency department (ED). Participants were enrolled after head CT was ordered, but before the physician received the imaging results. Physicians were surveyed on their clinical reasoning for ordering imaging in this low-risk cohort of patients. Physicians surveyed consisted of ED attending physicians and senior-level emergency medicine residents. Final patient disposition was recorded when it became available. Patients with positive CT findings had their medical records reviewed for specific disposition, admission length of stay, ICU stay, and any operative or procedural interventions. RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients with minimal head injury were enrolled. Five patients (2.1%) had head CTs that were positive for intracranial hemorrhage. All instances of intracranial hemorrhage occurred in patients who were at high or moderate risk by the Canadian CT Head Rule (2 high risk [age], 3 moderate risk [mechanism]). No patient with intracranial hemorrhage went to the ICU or underwent any intervention; the average hospital length of stay was 1.25 days. The Canadian CT Head Rule was 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval 40% to 100%) and 29% specific (95% confidence interval 23% to 35%) for the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Physicians listed their own reassurance (24.6%), patient reassurance (24.2%), patient expectation (14.6%), and reduction of legal liability (11.7%) as the rationale for ordering head CT in patients with minimal head injury. Shared decisionmaking was used in 51% of cases. CONCLUSION: Risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with minimal head injury was very low, and even in patients found to have an intracranial hemorrhage, none had any serious adverse outcome (eg, death, intubation, prolonged hospitalization, surgical procedure). The Canadian CT Head Rule was 100% sensitive in this small cohort of patients with minimal head injury. Among our study cohort, which specifically included only patients who had CT scanning, applying the Canadian CT Head Rule may have reduced the need for CT, potentially saving costs and resources. However, because many patients with minimal head injury who present to the ED may not have CTs, it is unclear what effect the broad application of this rule would have on overall CT use. Providers' rationale for obtaining CT was multifactorial. These represent barriers that may need to be overcome before physicians are comfortable changing CT ordering patterns in this group of head injury patients.",2018,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.03.034,72,4,342-350,eng,1097-6760 0196-0644,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prospective Studies and Canada and Decision Support Techniques and Health Plan Implementation and Emergency Medical Services/*standards and Clinical Protocols/*standards and Craniocerebral Trauma/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/nursing and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/standards",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,Ann Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Data from the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Study (January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2002), an Utstein-compliant registry of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from 21 communities, were analyzed. Logistic regression identified factors that were independently associated with survival in consecutive adult, nontraumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients and in the subgroup with return of spontaneous circulation. RESULTS: A total of 18,987 patients met criteria and 15,559 (81.9%) had complete data for analysis (study group). Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 2,299 patients (14.8%), and 689 (4.4%) survived to hospital discharge. Median transport interval was 4.0 minutes (25th quartile 3.0 minutes; 75th quartile 6.2 minutes) for survivors and 4.2 minutes (25th quartile 3.0, 75th quartile 6.2) for nonsurvivors. Logistic regression revealed multiple factors that were independently associated with survival: witnessed arrest (odds ratio 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.05 to 3.34), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio 2.22; 95% CI 1.82 to 2.70), initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (odds ratio 2.22; 95% CI 1.97 to 2.50), and shorter emergency medical services (EMS) response interval (odds ratio 1.26; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.33).

We sought to determine whether selective imaging could decrease scan use without missing clinically important injuries. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 701 patients with blunt trauma at an academic trauma center. Before scanning, the most senior emergency physician and trauma surgeon independently indicated which components of pan-CT were necessary. We calculated the proportion of scans deemed unnecessary that: (a) were abnormal and resulted in a pre-defined critical action or (b) were abnormal. RESULTS: Pan-CT was performed in 600 of the patients; the remaining 101 underwent limited scanning. One or both physicians indicated a willingness to omit 35% of the individual scans. An abnormality was present in 18% of scans, including 22% of desired scans and 10% of undesired scans. Among the 95 patients who had one of the 102 undesired scans with abnormal results, 3 underwent a predefined critical action. There is disagreement among the authors about the clinical significance of the abnormalities found on the 99 undesired scans that did not lead to a critical action. CONCLUSION: Selective scanning could reduce the number of scans, missing some injuries but few critical ones. The clinical importance of injuries missed on undesired scans was subject to individual interpretation, which varied substantially among authors.

Generally, these injuries are thought to be under recognized. This study was done to determine the proportion of patients, who were considered high risk for an mTBI, that had documentation of an mTBI evaluation. METHODS: A prospective cross-section of patients was identified using a 3-question screen at the time of triage: did an injury occur; was the mechanism consistent with mTBI; and was there a period of altered mental status. Chart review was completed for these patients who were thought to meet a minimum threshold warranting an evaluation for mTBI. RESULTS: 38,621 patients were screened over 16<e2><80><af>weeks, of whom 441 (1.14%) were identified as being high risk for having an mTBI and met inclusion criteria. Recommended portions of an mTBI evaluation occurred in fewer than 50% of patients. In total, 98 subjects were diagnosed with an mTBI, and 49 received mTBI discharge instructions. The odds ratio for the subgroup of patients who had documented criteria sufficient for diagnosis revealed that an isolated head injury increased a patient's odds of a documented diagnosis by 2.1 times (95%, 1.3-3.4). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with a possible mTBI did not have significant portions of an mTBI evaluation documented, and roughly half of the patients with a documented mTBI diagnosis did not receive discharge education.

If available as a point-of care test, synovial lactate would be rapidly available to aid the emergency provider in clinical decision making. This study assesses the test characteristics of synovial lactate obtained using an EPOC(C) point-of-care (POC) analyzer to rapidly distinguish septic from aseptic arthritis in the emergency department. METHODS: We enrolled a convenience sample of patients with possible septic arthritis presenting to the emergency department at a large urban academic center between October 2016 and April 2018. Enrolled patients underwent arthrocentesis based on the clinical judgment of the treating provider. We obtained synovial lactate levels (SLL) from the POC device. Standard laboratory analysis, synovial fluid culture, emergency and hospital course, operative procedures, antibiotics, and discharge diagnosis were abstracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients undergoing forty separate arthrocentesis procedures were enrolled in this study over the two-year period. The sensitivity and specificity of SLL<e2><80><af><e2><89><a5><e2><80><af>5<e2><80><af>mmol/L was 0.55 and 0.76 respectively, with +LR 2.3 and -LR 0.6.

Increased adrenergic drive has been postulated as a contributory factor for hyperlactatemia in sepsis. We aim to prospectively evaluate the effect of chronic beta-blocker use on serum lactate levels in sepsis at initial presentation to the ED. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study at the ED of a tertiary care academic medical center in Singapore. One hundred and ninety-five ED patients who fulfilled all of the following: (1) age 45 years and above, (2) tympanic temperature <e2><89><a5> 37.8 <c2><b0>C or clinically suspected to have an infection, and (3) quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score <e2><89><a5> 1 were included in the study. Serum venous lactate was sampled within two hours from presentation to the ED. The primary outcome measure was the difference in initial serum venous lactate concentration at presentation to the ED in patients on chronic beta-blockers versus patients without. RESULTS: Seventy patients (35.9%) were on long-term beta-blocker therapy. The primary outcome of mean initial serum venous lactate concentration was similar between patients prescribed chronic beta-blocker therapy and patients without (1.78 mmol/L versus 1.70 mmol/L, p = .540). Chronic beta-blocker therapy also did not significantly affect mean initial serum venous lactate concentration across all subgroups of sepsis risk stratification.

Long_2020_ThAmjoofemme,JOUR,Emergency medicine misconceptions: Utility of routine coagulation panels in the emergency department setting,"Long, Brit and Long, Drew A. and Koyfman, Alex",The American journal of emergency medicine,"BACKGROUND: Coagulation panels are ordered for a variety of conditions in the emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVE: This narrative review evaluates specific conditions for which a coagulation panel is commonly ordered but has limited utility in medical decision-making. DISCUSSION: Coagulation panels consist of partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR). These tests evaluate the coagulation pathway which leads to formation of a fibrin clot. The coagulation panel can monitor warfarin and heparin therapy, evaluate for vitamin K deficiency, evaluate for malnutrition or severe systemic disease, and assess hemostatic function in the setting of bleeding. The utility of coagulation testing in chest pain evaluation, routine perioperative assessment, prior to initiation of anticoagulation, and as screening for admitted patients is low, with little to no change in patient management based on results of these panels. Coagulation testing should be considered in systemically ill patients, those with a prior history of bleeding or family history of bleeding, patients on anticoagulation, or patients with active hemorrhage and signs of bleeding. Thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry offer more reliable measures of coagulation function. CONCLUSIONS: Little utility for coagulation assessment is present for the evaluation of chest pain, routine perioperative assessment, initiation of anticoagulation, and screening for admitted patients. However, coagulation panel assessment should be considered in patients with hemorrhage, patients on anticoagulation, and personal history or family history of bleeding.",2020,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.01.057,38,6,1226-1232,eng,1532-8171 0735-6757,"Humans and Hemorrhage and Anticoagulation and Coagulation and Bleeding and Laboratory and Emergency Medicine/*methods and Chest pain and Emergency Service, Hospital/organization & administration and Anticoagulants/*analysis/therapeutic use and Blood Coagulation Tests/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Chest Pain/blood/diagnosis and Coagulation panel and Hemophilia and Heparin/analysis/therapeutic use and International Normalized Ratio/methods/standards and Intraoperative Complications/blood/diagnosis and Partial Thromboplastin Time/methods/standards and Perioperative and Preadmission and Prothrombin Time/methods/standards and Warfarin/analysis/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Am J Emerg Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

In both pre- and in-hospital settings, blood lactate measurement is broadly used in combination with the clinical evaluation of patients as the clinical picture alone is not sufficient for assessing disease severity and outcomes. METHODS: From 15th April 2017 to 15th April 2019, patients with SS requiring prehospital mobile Intensive Care Unit intervention (mICU) were prospectively included in this observational study. Prehospital blood lactate clearance was estimated by the difference between prehospital (time of first contact between the patients and the mICU prior to any treatment) and in-hospital (at hospital admission) blood lactate levels divided by prehospital blood lactate. RESULTS: Among the 185 patients included in this study, lactate measurement was missing for six (3%) in the prehospital setting and for four (2%) at hospital admission, thus 175 (95%) were analysed for prehospital blood lactate clearance (mean age 70 <c2><b1> 14 years). Pulmonary, digestive and urinary infections were probably the cause of the SS in respectively 56%, 22% and 10% of the cases. The 30-day overall mortality was 32%. Mean prehospital blood lactate clearance was significantly different between patients who died and those who survived (respectively 0.41 <c2><b1> 2.50 mmol.l(-1) vs 1.65 <c2><b1> 2.88 mmol.l(-1), p = 0.007). Cox regression analysis showed that 30-day mortality was associated with prehospital blood lactate clearance > 10% (HRa [CI95] = 0.49 [0.26-0.92], p = 0.028) and prehospital blood lactate clearance < 10% (HRa [CI95] = 2.04 [1.08-3.84], p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: A prehospital blood lactate clearance < 10% is associated with 30-day mortality increase in patients with SS handled by the prehospital mICU.

Jr",The American journal of emergency medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Simple risk stratification rules are limited in acute asthma. We developed and externally validated a classification tree for asthma hospitalization. METHODS: Data were obtained from 2 large, multicenter studies on acute asthma, the National Emergency Department Safety Study and the Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration cohorts. Both studies involved emergency department (ED) patients aged 18 to 54 years presenting to the ED with acute asthma. Clinical information was obtained from medical record review. The Classification and Regression Tree method was used to generate a simple decision tree. The tree was derived in the National Emergency Department Safety Study cohort and then was validated in the Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration cohort. RESULTS: There were 1825 patients in the derivation cohort and 1335 in the validation cohort. Admission rates were 18% and 21% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The Classification and Regression Tree method identified 4 important variables (CHOP): change [C] in peak expiratory flow severity category, ever hospitalization [H] for asthma, oxygen [O] saturation on room air, and initial peak expiratory flow [P]. In a simple 3-step process, the decision rule risk-stratified patients into 7 groups, with a risk of admission ranging from 9% to 48%. The classification tree performed satisfactorily on discrimination in both the derivation and validation cohorts, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 and 0.65, respectively.

Andrew",Annals of emergency medicine,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to create a predictive, interpretable model of early hospital respiratory failure among emergency department (ED) patients admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective, cohort study from a 9-ED health system of admitted adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and an oxygen requirement less than or equal to 6 L/min. We sought to predict respiratory failure within 24 hours of admission as defined by oxygen requirement of greater than 10 L/min by low-flow device, high-flow device, noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Predictive models were compared with the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment, and the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score. RESULTS: During the study period, from March 1 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19, 620 (35%) of whom had respiratory failure in the ED. Of the remaining 1,172 admitted patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. On the independent test cohort, both a novel bedside scoring system, the quick COVID-19 Severity Index (area under receiver operating characteristic curve mean 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73 to 0.89]), and a machine-learning model, the COVID-19 Severity Index (mean 0.76 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.86]), outperformed the Elixhauser mortality index (mean 0.61 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.70]), CURB-65 (0.50 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.60]), and quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (0.59 [95% CI 0.50 to 0.68]). A low quick COVID-19 Severity Index score was associated with a less than 5% risk of respiratory decompensation in the validation cohort.

The utility of any of these in a particular setting depends on preexisting clinician accuracy. We therefore assess the accuracy of clinician practice in detecting clinically important traumatic brain injury. METHODS: This was a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of children younger than 18 years with head injuries at 10 Australian and New Zealand centers. In a cohort of children with mild head injuries (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13 to 15, presenting in <24 hours) we assessed physician accuracy (computed tomography [CT] obtained in emergency departments [EDs]) for the standardized outcome of clinically important traumatic brain injury and compared this with the accuracy of PECARN, CATCH, and CHALICE. RESULTS: Of 20,137 children, 18,913 had a mild head injury. Of these patients, 1,579 (8.3%) received a CT scan during the ED visit, 160 (0.8%) had clinically important traumatic brain injury, and 24 (0.1%) underwent neurosurgery.

METHODS: At our Emergency Department of the Crema Hospital, from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of June 2020, 54 consecutive patients admitted to ICU suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) attributable to viral SARS - CoV - 2 infection were recruited. The recruitment criterion was based on refractory hypoxia, general condition and clinical impairment, comorbidities and CT images. The incoming parameters of the blood chemistry and radiology investigations and the timing of the gold - tracheal intubation were compared. Medical therapy was based on the application of shared protocols. RESULTS: The onset of symptoms was varyng, i.e. within the range of 1-14 days. The average time from the admission to the emergency room to the admission to intensive care was approximately 120 h. The average number of days of hospitalization in the ICU was 28 days. With a majority of male patients, the most significant age group was between 60 and 69 years. There were 21 deaths and, compared to the survivors, the deceased ones were older at an average age of about 67 years (vs an average age of the survivors of about 59 years). From the available data entering the ICU, the surviving patients presented average better values of oximetry and blood gas analysis, with a lower average dosage of D-Dimer than the deceased. Ones with a presence of bilateral pneumonia in all patients, the worsening of the ARDS occurred in 31 patients. 9 out of 25 patients early intubated died, while 12 out of 23 patients died when intubation was performed after 24 h of non-invasive ventilation. The presence of multiple comorbidities was shown in 17 of 28 patients and revealed an additional adverse prognostic factor. Also, more than one complication in the same patient were detected; after respiratory worsening, renal failure was more frequently found in 16 patients. Some particular complications such as lesions induced by ventilation with barotrauma mechanism (VILI), ischemic heart disease and the appearance of central and peripheral neurological events were detected too. CONSIDERATIONS: SARS - CoV - 2 disease is caused by a new coronavirus that has its main route of transmission through respiratory droplets and close contact, resulting in a sudden onset of the clinical syndrome with acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS). But it can also appear with other symptoms such as gastrointestinal or neurological events, as to be considered as a disease with multisystem phenotype. This pathology evolves towards a serious form of systemic disease from an acute lung damage to venous and arterial thromboembolic complications and multi-organ failure, mostly associated with high mortality. All patients received empirical or targeted antibiotic therapy for prevention and control of infections of potential pathogens, together with low molecular weight heparin therapy. The majority of patients was subjected to the off - label protocol with antivirals and hydroxychloroquine therapy, we used cortisone support therapy under surveillance and in 3 cases the protocol with anti - IL6 monoclonal antibody (Tolicizumab). In a simplified classification of the tomographic examination of the chest, mostly 3D and 2C lesions were found in the deceased patients with a prevalence of severe and moderate forms, whilst in the survivors the distribution appears with a prevalence of medium and moderate forms. Among the intubated patients, 21 patients, all suffering from worsening ARDS, died whilst there was no mortality in patients subjected to non-invasive ventilation it so. The heterogeneity of the respiratory syndromes and the presence of multiple comorbidities represent an unfortunate prognostic factor. Among the complications, besides the respiratory worsening, renal failure, liver failure and the state of sepsis were most frequently found; less frequent complications were lesions induced by ventilation with a barotrauma mechanism, ischemic heart disease, the appearance of central neurological events of sensory alterations, meningo - encephalitis and cerebral hemorrhage, and peripheral neurological events with polyneuro - myopathies. Mechanical ventilation can adversely affect the prognosis due to lung damage induced, protective ventilation remains the necessary treatment during severe hypoxia in patients with SARS - CoV - 2. The essential prerequisite remains the search for optimal 'customized' values since conditions can vary from patient to patient and, in the same patient, during different times of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In these extraordinary circumstances, our reality was among the most affected and was able to hold the impact thanks to the immediate great response set in place by the operators, although it costed us an effort especially the one to try to guarantee a high quality level of assistance and care compared to the huge wave of patients in seriously bad conditions.

We sought to determine whether optimization can improve alignment between AED locations and OHCA counts across levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Methods: All suspected OHCAs and registered AEDs in Scotland between Jan. 2011 and Sept. 2017 were included and mapped to a corresponding socioeconomic deprivation level using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). We used mathematical optimization to determine optimal locations for placing 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% additional AEDs, as well as locations for relocating existing AEDs. For each AED placement policy, we examined the impact on AED distribution and OHCA ""coverage"" (suspected OHCA occurring within 100 m of AED) with respect to SIMD quintiles. Results: We identified 49,432 suspected OHCAs and 1532 AEDs. The distribution of existing AED locations across SIMD quintiles significantly differed from the distribution of suspected OHCAs (P < 0.001). Optimization-guided AED placement increased coverage of suspected OHCAs compared to existing AED locations (all P < 0.001). Optimization resulted in more AED placements and increased OHCA coverage in areas of greater socioeconomic deprivation, such that resulting distributions across SIMD quintiles matched the shape of the OHCA count distribution. Optimally relocating existing AEDs achieved similar OHCA coverage levels to that of doubling the number of total AEDs. Conclusions: Mathematical optimization results in AED locations and suspected OHCA coverage that more closely resembles the suspected OHCA distribution and results in more equitable coverage across levels of socioeconomic deprivation.",2021,NA,166,NA,14-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021///,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
