Schwendicke_2020_Joofdere,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges,"Schwendicke, F. and Samek, W. and Krois, J.",Journal of dental research,"The term ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which ""learns"" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (""explainable AI""). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.",2020,10.1177/0022034520915714,99,7,769-774,eng,1544-0591 0022-0345,"deep learning and machine learning and decision-making and Humans and Forecasting and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted and *Artificial Intelligence and informatics and dental and Dentistry and diagnostic systems",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,J Dent Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shan_2021_Joofdere,JOUR,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry,"Shan, T. and Tay, F. R. and Gu, L.",Journal of dental research,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that utilizes machines to mimic intelligent human behavior. To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena.",2021,10.1177/0022034520969115,100,3,232-244,eng,1544-0591 0022-0345,Software and machine learning and Humans and neural networks and Prospective Studies and big data and clinical decision making and *Algorithms and *Artificial Intelligence and informatics and dental and Dentistry,NA,NA,2021/03//undefined,J Dent Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pain after root canal treatment is a health problem affecting millions of patients. Research in this field has a meaningful impact on quality of lives. The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of research on postoperative pain over the past 50 years. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in Scopus and MEDLINE databases to identify studies on pain after nonsurgical root canal treatments/retreatments. The full texts of eligible articles were reviewed to determine the study category and to extract and analyze the methodological variables. A series of statistical analyses were performed to determine the trend of publications based on the variable of interest over time. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-four articles were included. There was a positive trend for systematic reviews, studies with sample size <200, studies on single-visit treatment, and clinical trials on instrumentation and adjunct treatments (P < .05). There was a negative trend for the use of numeric rating scales, studies on multiple-visit treatments, clinical trials on medication/medicament, and studies on pain in maxillary incisors (P < .05). No trend was observed based on pulpal diagnosis or for studies with longer observation periods (>8 weeks) (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: A paradigm shift is needed toward clinical studies with larger sample sizes, longer observation periods, and more focus on pulpal diagnoses associated with higher rates of postoperative pain.

However, little is known on whether children from different geographical regions and gender are equally reached with current preventive and curative oral health strategies. The aim of our study therefore was to explore regional and gender differences in a population-based oral health dataset of Austrian children up to the age of 14. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted the first electronically available health insurance data of children aged up to 14 years on dental services within a 4-year observation period in Austria and performed a separate analysis in up to 6-year-old children. In addition, we used a smaller randomly selected sample dataset of 3000 children as the large numbers would result in significant, but very small effects. RESULTS: In a total of 130,895 children, of whom 77,173 children (59%) were up to the age of six, we detected an east-west gradient: The eastern regions of Austria showed an older age at first contact and a higher number of dental services. A child aged up to 6 years who needed more than four dental services had a likelihood of 40% to be from Vienna, Austria's capital city located in the east.

METHODS: Scanned periapical radiographs and a leaflet with relevant information of 17 endodontically treated teeth were mailed to 40 undergraduate students, 25 general practitioners, 20 postgraduate students, and 40 endodontists. All teeth were symptom-free. The hypothetical scenario referred to patients who sought treatment for first time and had noncontributory medical history. Five treatment options were given for each situation: (1) Extraction, (2) Surgical Retreatment, (3) Nonsurgical Retreatment, (4) Wait and See, and (5) No Therapy. Statistical analysis was performed by using multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 70.4%, with endodontists exhibiting the lowest response. The undergraduates gave 4 or 5 treatment solutions for all cases, in contrast to endodontists, who gave 2 or 3 treatment solutions in a percentage of 82%. Nonsurgical Retreatment predominated among the participants' choices. Significant differences were detected in (1) Extraction for postgraduate students (P = .008) and endodontists (P = .001), (2) Surgical Retreatment for general practitioners (P = .002), postgraduate students (P = .002), and endodontists (P = .001), and (3) Wait and See for postgraduate students (P = .023).

Skallsjo_2020_Clinoralinve,JOUR,Apical periodontitis as potential source of infection in patients with lymphoma treated with chemotherapy,"Skallsjo, Kristina and Johansson, Jan-Erik and Jonasson, Peter and Hasseus, Bengt",Clinical oral investigations,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate signs of infection and infection-related complications of apical periodontitis (AP) in patients who underwent chemotherapy for lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from the dental and medical records of patients receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma. Based on the findings from a dental evaluation made in conjunction with chemotherapy, the patients were divided into two groups, patients with or without teeth with AP. RESULTS: Eighty-six of the 213 patients had one or more teeth with AP and received no planned dental treatment for this condition, while 127 patients had no AP-affected teeth. During chemotherapy, seven patients (8%) developed local symptoms related to teeth with AP, while no patients in the control group developed symptoms of AP. No significant differences were found with respect to the administration of antibiotics related to dental infection or hospital admission events due to fever or infection, between the group with AP and the group without AP. CONCLUSIONS: AP is a common finding and exacerbation seems more common in patients diagnosed with chronic AP than in patients without chronic AP. The presence of chronic AP in patients treated with chemotherapy for lymphoma is not linked to additional medical complications that require hospital admission owing to fever/infection. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge regarding infection-related complications of AP in patients with lymphoma treated with chemotherapy will guide clinical decision-making by identifying those patients who warrant treatment. This will allow dental interventions to be postponed until completion of chemotherapy, without serious medical complications.

G. and Gaudin, R. and Chaurasia, A. and Gehrung, S. and Krois, J.",Journal of dental research,"Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist dentists in image assessment, for example, caries detection. The wider health and cost impact of employing AI for dental diagnostics has not yet been evaluated. We compared the cost-effectiveness of proximal caries detection on bitewing radiographs with versus without AI. U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, had been trained, validated, and tested on 3,293, 252, and 141 bitewing radiographs, respectively, on which 4 experienced dentists had marked carious lesions (reference test). Lesions were stratified for initial lesions (E1/E2/D1, presumed noncavitated, receiving caries infiltration if detected) and advanced lesions (D2/D3, presumed cavitated, receiving restorative care if detected). A Markov model was used to simulate the consequences of true- and false-positive and true- and false-negative detections, as well as the subsequent decisions over the lifetime of patients. A German mixed-payers perspective was adopted. Our health outcome was tooth retention years. Costs were measured in 2020 euro. Monte-Carlo microsimulations and univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability at different willingness-to-pay thresholds were quantified. AI showed an accuracy of 0.80; dentists' mean accuracy was significantly lower at 0.71 (minimum-maximum: 0.61-0.78, P < 0.05). AI was significantly more sensitive than dentists (0.75 vs. 0.36 [0.19-0.65]; P = 0.006), while its specificity was not significantly lower (0.83 vs. 0.91 [0.69-0.98]; P > 0.05). In the base-case scenario, AI was more effective (tooth retention for a mean 64 [2.5%-97.5%: 61-65] y) and less costly (298 [244-367] euro) than assessment without AI (62 [59-64] y; 322 [257-394] euro). The ICER was -13.9 euro/y (i.e., AI saved money at higher effectiveness). In the majority (>77%) of all cases, AI was less costly and more effective. Applying AI for caries detection is likely to be cost-effective, mainly as fewer lesions remain undetected.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred practitioners with a general dental practice in Ghent were randomly selected. Clinicians were asked to fill in a study form for every single extraction they performed during an 8-week period. The form related to the treatment decision and a number of patient- and clinician-related factors. RESULTS: Ninety-four general dentists (52 men, 42 women; mean age 49; range 24-68) agreed to participate and extracted 1180 single teeth. After exclusion of third molars and cases where the reason for tooth loss would generally prohibit replacement, 900 cases were identified. In 24% of these patients, there was no treatment decision and in 18% replacement was deemed unnecessary. When replacement was necessary (n = 526), removable partial denture (RPD), fixed partial denture (FPD), single implant treatment and resin-bonded bridge were chosen in 54%, 24%, 21% and 1% of the patients, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the decision-making process for single implant treatment against RPD and FPD. In relation to RPD, single implant treatment was more likely in highly educated patients with few missing teeth and no bone loss at adjacent teeth. In relation to FPD, single implant treatment was more likely in patients with intact adjacent teeth and when the tooth was extracted by a female dentist. Experience in implant prosthetics was positively associated with single implant treatment in all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Single implant treatment is not the most common procedure in daily practice to restore a single tooth gap.

Compared with bleeding on probing (BoP), expression of disease activity, periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), incorporates chronic disease parameters. We tested the association of PISA and BoP with blood pressure (BP) in NHANES III. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8,614 subjects (<e2><89><a5>30 years) with complete periodontal and BP examinations were enrolled. PISA was derived from periodontal probing depth and BoP. The association of PISA and BoP with high/uncontrolled BP was examined by multiple-adjusted models. Inflammatory markers were tested as possible mediators. A machine learning (ML) approach was used to define the relative importance of PISA and BoP and estimate the power of BP status prediction. RESULTS: Compared to no inflammation, severe PISA and BoP were associated with 43% (p < .001) and 32% (p = .006) higher odds of high/uncontrolled BP (<e2><89><a5>130/80 mmHg), and with higher systolic BP by <e2><89><88>4 (p < .001) and 5 (p < .001) mmHg, respectively. Inflammatory markers appeared to mediate this association with various extents, without threshold effect. BoP predicted high/uncontrolled BP more efficiently than PISA using ML.

Hoefert_2018_Clinoralinve,JOUR,Change in reimbursement and costs in German oncological head and neck surgery over the last decade: ablative tongue cancer surgery and reconstruction with split-thickness skin graft vs. microvascular radial forearm flap,"Hoefert, Sebastian and Lotter, Oliver",Clinical oral investigations,"OBJECTIVES: Defects after ablative tongue cancer surgery can be reconstructed by split-thickness skin grafts or free microvascular flaps. The different surgical options may influence costs, reimbursement, and therefore possible profits. Our goal was to analyze the development of these parameters for different procedures in head and neck reconstruction in Germany over the last decade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After tumor resection and neck dissection of tongue cancer, three different scenarios were chosen to calculate costs, reimbursement, length of stay (LoS), and profits. Two options considered were reconstruction by split-thickness skin graft with (option Ia) and without (option Ib) tracheotomy. In addition, we analyzed microvascular reconstruction with radial forearm flap (option II). Furthermore, unsatisfactory results after options Ia and Ib may make secondary tongue plastic with split-thickness skin grafting necessary (option I+). The calculations were performed considering the German Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system and compared to the specific DRG cost data of 250 German reference hospitals. RESULTS: The overall average length of stay (aLoS) declined from 16.7 to 12.8 days with a reduction in every option. Until 2011, all options showed similar accumulated DRG reimbursement. From 2012 onwards, earnings almost doubled for option II due to changes in the DRG allocation. As was expected, the highest costs were observed in option II. Profits (reimbursement minus costs) were also highest for option II (mean 2052 <e2><82><ac>, maximum 3630 Euros in 2015) followed by options Ia (765 <e2><82><ac>) and Ib/I+ (681 <e2><82><ac>). Average profits over time would be 17 to 19% higher if adjusted for inflation. CONCLUSIONS: We showed the development of the DRG allocation of two commonly used methods of reconstruction after ablative tongue cancer surgery and the associated LoS, reimbursement, costs, and profits. As expected, the highest values were found for microvascular reconstruction. Microvascular reconstruction may also be the primary choice of treatment from a medical point of view. However, prolonged operation times, intensive care, and hospital stay in connection with complex microvascular operations can easily turn profits into losses as opposed to the results of simple, reliable, and fast split-thickness skin grafting. The inflation rate influences profits in reimbursement systems where costs are based on a previous period of time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons find themselves daily in an area of conflict between economic interests and medical decision-making. Due to its multidimensional aspects, the choice of the reconstructive technique should be primarily based on the best medical care for the patient. But there should also be awareness of the economic risk of all three surgical procedures.",2018,10.1007/s00784-017-2269-x,22,4,1741-1750,eng,1436-3771 1432-6981,Costs and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Reimbursement and Germany and Reimbursement Mechanisms and Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data and Diagnosis Related Groups and Forearm/*blood supply and Glossectomy/methods and Head and neck reconstruction and Neck Dissection and Radial forearm flap and Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*economics/*methods and Skin Transplantation/*economics/*methods and Split-thickness skin graft and Surgical Flaps/*blood supply and Tongue Neoplasms/*surgery and Tracheotomy,NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,Clin Oral Investig,NA,NA,NA,NA

The bacterial and fungal composition of dental plaque and how children's sex is associated with S-ECC are largely unknown. In this study, V4-16S rRNA and ITS1 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to compare the plaque bacteriome and mycobiome of children <72 mo of age: 40 with S-ECC (15 males, 25 females) and 40 caries-free (19 males, 21 females). Health- and nutrition-related questionnaire data were also investigated. This study aimed to analyze potential sex-based differences in the supragingival plaque microbiota of young children with S-ECC and those caries-free. Behavioral and nutritional habit differences were observed between children with S-ECC and those caries-free and between male and female children. Overall, higher levels of Veillonella dispar, Streptococcus mutans, and other bacterial species were found in the S-ECC group as compared with caries-free controls (P < 0.05). A significant difference in the abundance of Neisseria was observed between males and females with S-ECC (P < .05). Fungal taxonomic analysis showed significantly higher levels of Candida dubliniensis in the plaque of children with S-ECC as compared with those caries-free (P < 0.05), but no differences were observed with Candida albicans (P > 0.05). Significant differences in the relative abundance of Mycosphaerella, Cyberlindnera, and Trichosporon fungal species were also observed between the caries-free and S-ECC groups (P < 0.05). Machine learning analysis revealed the most important bacterial and fungal species for classifying S-ECC versus caries-free.

Fontana_2020_Joofdere,JOUR,Improving Caries Risk Prediction Modeling: A Call for Action,"Fontana, M. and Carrasco-Labra, A. and Spallek, H. and Eckert, G. and Katz, B.",Journal of dental research,"Dentistry has entered an era of personalized/precision care in which targeting care to groups, individuals, or even tooth surfaces based on their caries risk has become a reality to address the skewed distribution of the disease. The best approach to determine a patient's prognosis relies on the development of caries risk prediction models (CRPMs). A desirable model should be derived and validated to appropriately discriminate between patients who will develop disease from those who will not, and it should provide an accurate estimation of the patient's absolute risk (i.e., calibration). However, evidence suggests there is a need to improve the methodological standards and increase consistency in the way CRPMs are developed and evaluated. In fact, although numerous caries risk assessment tools are available, most are not routinely used in practice or used to influence treatment decisions, and choice is not commonly based on high-quality evidence. Research will propose models that will become more complex, incorporating new factors with high prognostic value (e.g., human genetic markers, microbial biomarkers). Big data and predictive analytic methods will be part of the new approaches for the identification of promising predictors with the ability to monitor patients' risk in real time. Eventually, the implementation of validated, accurate CRPMs will have to follow a user-centered design respecting the patient-clinician dynamic, with no disruption to the clinical workflow, and needs to operate at low cost. The resulting predictive risk estimate needs to be presented to the patient in an understandable way so that it triggers behavior change and effectively informs health care decision making, to ultimately improve caries outcomes.

Hansen_2013_Clinoralinve,JOUR,Incidence of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) in patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis treatment - a grossly underestimated risk?,"Hansen, Peter Johannes and Knitschke, Michael and Draenert, Florian Guy and Irle, Sebastian and Neff, Andreas",Clinical oral investigations,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to detect the incidence of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) in association with osteoporosis in 2009 in the rural district of Marburg-Biedenkopf, Germany. In addition, the therapeutic regimen of dentists in this area was compared to the treatment guidelines of established international associations. METHODOLOGY: A postal survey including 129 dental offices within the named investigation area was conducted. Additionally, the dentists were asked to contribute to this study during a course of retraining. Ultimately, 107 colleagues participated in this study. RESULTS: A total of 37 BRONJ cases were revealed, 37.4 % of those were linked to malignant diseases, 62.6 % to osteoporosis. Noticeably, 30.1 % of the BRONJ cases linked to osteoporosis were connected with intravenous application. In total, 62.6 % of all cases were associated with intravenous and 37.4 % with oral application. Considering the estimated number of 1.014 patients using bisphosphonates for osteoporosis treatment in Marburg-Biedenkopf in 2009, the specific incidence of BRONJ could be narrowed down to about 2.27 %. In proportion to the increasing risk potential of the three patient groups, participants conducted fewer surgical interventions themselves but tended to refer patients to colleagues. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the incidence of BRONJ in association with osteoporosis as being grossly underrated so far, especially in connection with intravenous bisphosphonate treatment. The therapeutic regimen of the dentists who participated correlated with the established guidelines. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The interface between dentistry and medicine may profit from our study's results which will help to improve interdisciplinary communication. With regard to this, we wish to contribute to an informative discussion since a main focus was to ensure colleagues in their decision making, especially in case of complications after elective dentoalveolar surgery-like implantations. Besides medical there are also economic and political aspects, i.e. the financial responsibility in case of unexpected or inevitable complications, possibly leading to BRONJ, that may become part of future discussions based on this study.",2013,10.1007/s00784-012-0873-3,17,8,1829-1837,eng,1436-3771 1432-6981,Humans and Incidence and Germany and Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw/*drug therapy and Diphosphonates/*adverse effects and Osteoporosis/*drug therapy,NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,Clin Oral Investig,NA,NA,NA,NA
Eick_2018_Clinoralinve,JOUR,Microbiological analysis and the outcomes of periodontal treatment with or without adjunctive systemic antibiotics-a retrospective study,"Eick, Sigrun and Nydegger, Jasmin and Burgin, Walter and Salvi, Giovanni E. and Sculean, Anton and Ramseier, Christoph",Clinical oral investigations,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of microbiological diagnostics on the outcomes of periodontal treatment with or without adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient files were screened for microbiological analysis before (T1) and after non-surgical periodontal therapy (T2). Medical history, diagnosis, clinical data, and results of the microbiological analysis were extracted from the patient's file. After descriptive statistics, logistic regression analysis was performed to model the presence of 90 and 50% reductions of numbers of sites with probing depths (PD) of <e2><89><a5> 5 mm at T2 (90%-PD5 and 50%-PD5), respectively, against the presence of bacterial species, clinical diagnosis, and adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics. RESULTS: Eighteen patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (AP, 17 with adjunctive antibiotics) and 84 with chronic periodontitis (CP, 31 with adjunctive antibiotics) were included in the analysis. Logistic modeling of bacteria at T1 to 90%-PD5 failed to show any statistical significance. Using 50%-PD5, presence of all Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola and in particular of T. denticola at T1 was associated with good response to therapy. Modeling of bacterial presence to 90-%PD5 and to 50-%PD5 at T2 found an association with absence of T. forsythia (90-%PD5 and 50-%PD5) and of T. denticola and Campylobacter rectus (50%-PD5). Modeling bacteria at T1, antibiotic group and oral hygiene at T2 on 50%-PD5 revealed odds ratio (OR) of the adjunctive antibiotic group between 2.70 and 52.4, of the oral hygiene between 3.27 and 4.11, and of the bacteria at T1 up to 28.6 (Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. forsythia, or T. denticola). CONCLUSION: Microbiological analysis of the most important species associated with periodontal diseases appears to support a clinically based decision for the adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The present findings appear to support the use microbiological testing to strengthen the clinical decision making process for either using or not using systemic antibiotics in conjunction with non-surgical periodontal therapy.",2018,10.1007/s00784-018-2392-3,22,9,3031-3041,eng,1436-3771 1432-6981,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Combined Modality Therapy and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage and Antibiotics and Microbiological analysis and Periodontal Diseases/*microbiology/*therapy and Periodontal Index and Periodontitis and Response to treatment",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Clin Oral Investig,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lavigne_2020_Joofdere,JOUR,Critical Issues in Dental and Medical Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Lavigne, G. J. and Herrero Babiloni, A. and Beetz, G. and Dal Fabbro, C. and Sutherland, K. and Huynh, N. and Cistulli, P. A.",Journal of dental research,"This critical review focuses on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its management from a dental medicine perspective. OSA is characterized by <e2><89><a5>10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) <e2><89><a5>5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist's role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",2020,10.1177/0022034519885644,99,1,26-35,eng,1544-0591 0022-0345,"machine learning and precision medicine and Humans and Risk Factors and Sleep and arousal and headache and *Mandibular Advancement and *Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/therapy and Facial Pain and mandibular advancement and sleep bruxism",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Dent Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
