Dimitri_2019_Arofdiinch,JOUR,Child health technology: shaping the future of paediatrics and child health and improving NHS productivity,"Dimitri, Paul",Archives of disease in childhood,"In the last decade, technology has revolutionised the way we deliver healthcare. Smartphones, tablets, personal computers and bespoke devices have provided patients with the means to access health information, manage their healthcare and communicate with health professionals remotely. Advances in technology have the potential to change how acute and long-term conditions are diagnosed and managed and how illness is prevented using technological advances in artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, 3D printing, new materials, biosensor technologies and data analytics. In the future, predictive analytics will help with earlier disease diagnosis in at-risk populations.Historically, development of child health innovation and technology has taken place in a relatively emergent manner with little formal coordination. The aim is to move away from the traditional approach of repurposing adult technologies to provide a large-scale and coordinated approach for the development of bespoke health technology for children that is anatomically, physiologically and developmentally appropriate, versatile and that has been designed with children and young people. The challenge for the National Health Service alongside healthcare systems across the world is to deliver increasingly complex healthcare at lower cost and with better quality of life and greater efficiency.",2019,10.1136/archdischild-2017-314309,104,2,184-188,eng,1468-2044 0003-9888,"innovation and Pediatrics and Humans and Child and Health Priorities and Patient Participation and technology and United Kingdom and Smartphone and digital and *Child Health Services and Wearable Electronic Devices and Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration and *Efficiency, Organizational and *Biomedical Technology and Virtual Reality and child health and device and Printing, Three-Dimensional and State Medicine/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Arch Dis Child,NA,NA,NA,NA
Coates_2020_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Induction of labour: Experiences of care and decision-making of women and clinicians,"Coates, Dominiek and Goodfellow, Alison and Sinclair, Lynn",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: There has been a rise in induction of labour over recent decades. There is some tension in the literature in relation to when induction is warranted and when not, with variability between guidelines and practice. Given these tensions, the importance of shared decision-making between clinicians and women is increasingly highlighted as paramount, but it remains unclear to what extent this occurs in routine care. METHOD: Using a scoping review methodology, quantitative and qualitative evidence were considered to answer the research question ""What are the views, preferences and experiences of women and clinicians in relation to induction of labour more broadly, and practices of decision-making specifically?"" To identify studies, the databases PubMed, Maternity and Infant Care, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched from 2008 to 2018, and reference lists of included studies were examined. FINDINGS: 20 papers met inclusion criteria, in relation to (a) women's preferences, experiences and satisfaction with IOL; (b) women's experience of shared-decision making in relation to induction; (c) interventions that improve shared decision-making and (d) factors that influence decision-making from the perspective of clinicians. Synthesis of the included studies indicates that decision-making in relation to induction of labour is largely informed by medical considerations. Women are not routinely engaged in the decision making process with expectations and preferences largely unmet. CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop strategies such as decision aids, the redesign of antenatal classes, and clinician communication training to improve the quality of information available to women and their capacity for informed decision-making.",2020,10.1016/j.wombi.2019.06.002,33,1,e1-e14,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Satisfaction and Pregnancy and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Decision Making, Shared and *Labor, Induced and Experience of care and Factors that inform decision-making and Induction of labour and Shared decision-making",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johansson_2014_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,'As long as they are safe--birth mode does not matter' Swedish fathers' experiences of decision-making around caesarean section,"Johansson, Margareta and Hildingsson, Ingegerd and Fenwick, Jennifer",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making in childbirth involves considerations about both the mother and her unborn baby's wellbeing. For men the safety of both is paramount. AIM: To explore and describe Swedish fathers' beliefs and attitudes around the decision for a caesarean section. METHODS: Qualitative descriptive study. Twenty one Swedish men whose partners had experienced elective or emergency caesarean participated in a telephone interview. Thematic data analysis was used. FINDINGS: The theme, 'Childbirth is Risky', included ""Caesarean birth has lots of advantages"" and ""Birth mode does not matter"". In the context of having experienced a caesarean section male partners considered birth mode to be irrelevant. The majority considered caesarean to be a quick and efficient way of giving birth which equated to being safer. Most men could articulate some risks associated with caesarean but these were mainly minimised. The second theme, 'Simply a matter of trust: Birth mode is not my decision', reflected men's belief that they had little to contribute to the decisions made around birth mode. The decision for a caesarean section was considered to lie with the medical practitioner. CONCLUSION: Mode of birth was regarded as unimportant. The recommendation for a caesarean section was readily accepted and appreciated, and shifted responsibility for birth to the medical practitioner. Involving men in the decision-making process by means of giving them information was valued. Men's limited knowledge about the risks of a caesarean may contribute to birth mode decisions. Professionals need to provide balanced and correct information within the context of individual circumstances.",2014,10.1016/j.wombi.2014.03.003,27,3,208-213,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Fear and Sweden and *Decision Making and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Fathers and *Cesarean Section and Caesarean section and Decision-making process and Experiences and Fathers/*psychology and Paternal Behavior and Pregnant Women/psychology and Qualitative study",NA,NA,2014/09//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rattray_2011_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Foetal monitoring: a woman-centred decision-making pathway,"Rattray, Janene and Flowers, Karen and Miles, Sandra and Clarke, Jillian",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"PROBLEM: Many midwives continue to use continuous foetal monitoring on low risk women in labour, despite evidence based clinical guidelines to the contrary. Continuous foetal monitoring has been linked to increased rates of medical intervention during labour and birth with no improvement in long term neonatal outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Midwives who used continuous foetal monitoring on low risk women in labour at two regional Queensland hospitals. METHODS: This Grounded Theory study explored midwives' decision-making processes related to the use of continuous electronic foetal monitoring on low risk labouring women. Primary data were gathered in semi-structured interviews with five purposively selected midwives and concurrently analysed using Grounded Theory techniques of theoretical sampling and constant comparison. FINDINGS: The midwives made the decision that led to continuous electronic foetal monitoring on low risk women at two key decision points during labour care; the first during the midwives' initial assessment of the woman and foetus, and the second when the midwives categorised the women as high or low risk. However, various factors impacted on these decisions including trust and staff workloads within a context of risk management and medical dominance. There was limited opportunity for women to be involved in the decision-making process about foetal monitoring and only partial information was provided prior to cardiotocography. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with current clinical guidelines which recommend open, consultative discussion with the woman about foetal monitoring and a partnership approach towards decision-making following informed choice, a woman-centred foetal monitoring decision-making pathway is proposed. This pathway is applicable in midwifery education, research and clinical practice to promote both evidence based practice and woman-centred decision-making.",2011,10.1016/j.wombi.2010.08.003,24,2,65-71,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and *Decision Making and *Patient Participation and *Labor, Obstetric and *Fetal Monitoring/adverse effects/methods and Midwifery/*methods",NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jefford_2010_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,A review of the literature: midwifery decision-making and birth,"Jefford, Elaine and Fahy, Kathleen and Sundin, Deborah",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making was initially studied in medicine where hypothetico-deductive reasoning is the model for decision-making. The nursing perspective on clinical decision-making has largely been shaped by Patricia Benner's ground breaking work. Benner claimed expert nurses use humanistic-intuitive ways of making clinical decisions rather than the 'rational reasoning' as claimed by medicine. Clinical decision-making in midwifery is not the same as either nursing or medical decision-making because of the woman-midwife partnership where the woman is the ultimate decision-maker. METHOD: CINHAL, Medline and Cochrane databases were systematically searched using key words derived from the guiding question. A review of the decision-making research literature in midwifery was undertaken where studies were published in English. The selection criteria for papers were: only research papers of direct relevance to the guiding research question were included in the review. FINDINGS: Decision-making is under-researched in midwifery and more specifically birth, as only 4 research articles met the inclusion criteria in this review. Three of the studies involved qualified midwives, and one involved student midwives. Two studies were undertaken in England, one in Scotland and one in Sweden. The major findings synthesised from this review, are that; (1) midwifery decision-making during birth is socially negotiated involving hierarchies of surveillance and control; (2) the role of the woman in shared decision-making during birth has not been explored by midwifery research; (3) clinical decision-making encompasses clinical reasoning as essential but not sufficient for midwives to actually implement their preferred decision. CONCLUSION: We argue that existing research does not inform the discipline of the complexity of midwifery clinical decision-making during birth. A well-designed study would involve investigating the clinical reasoning skills of the midwife, her relationship with the woman, the context of the particular birthing unit and the employment status of the midwife. The role of the woman as decision-maker in her own care during birth also needs careful research attention.",2010,10.1016/j.wombi.2010.02.001,23,4,127-134,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"England and Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Sweden and Scotland and *Decision Making and Parturition and *Delivery, Obstetric and *Nurse Midwives",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rattray_2020_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Attitudes towards breech management among a team of maternity clinicians in Australia undertaking breech training,"Rattray, Janene and Rigg, Elizabeth and Partridge, Bradley and Taylor, Melissa",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Australian women seeking a vaginal breech birth report limited access to this option due to resistance from clinicians and strict medical criteria. Limited evidence exists to determine the attitudes, knowledge, experience and perceived confidence of Australian maternity clinicians towards the management of a breech presentation at term. AIM: The aim of this study is to identify experience, knowledge and attitudes of birth suite clinicians' before and after training, toward term breech presentation and management practices. METHODS: A mixed methods research design was used that included a survey tool. A survey of 29 midwives and 11 medical professionals who attended an educational course in breech management (""BABE - Becoming a Breech Expert"") was undertaken pre and post BABE training. RESULTS: While participants were experienced in providing maternity services, the results indicated most were inexperienced in facilitating a vaginal breech birth. Prior to training, most participants believed vaginal breech birth had a higher risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to caesarean birth. The prospect of a woman choosing a breech birth outside of medical recommendations made many participants ""nervous"". Despite this, support to ensure there was informed decision-making and respect for a woman's choice was high. Following training, clinician knowledge of assessment of risks for breech birth and intention to discuss breech management options with women increased. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in breech management training is beneficial to increasing clinician knowledge and assessment of risk and confidence towards discussing vaginal breech birth management, respect for women's choice and informed decision-making.",2020,10.1016/j.wombi.2019.08.002,33,4,e348-e356,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Australia and Pregnancy and Delivery, Obstetric and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Parturition/*psychology and Caesarean section and *Breech Presentation/psychology and Breech and External cephalic version and Midwifery/*education and Vaginal breech birth",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hall_2017_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Educating student midwives around dignity and respect,"Hall, Jenny S. and Mitchell, Mary",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"FOCUS: There is currently limited information available on how midwifery students learn to provide care that promotes dignity and respect. BACKGROUND: In recent years the importance of dignity in healthcare and treating people with respect has received considerable emphasis in both a national and international context. AIM: The aim of this discussion paper is to describe an educational workshop that enables learning to promote dignity and respect in maternity care. DISCUSSION: An interactive workshop, using different creative methods as triggers for learning will be described. Provision of learning opportunities for students around dignity and respect is important to ensure appropriate care is provided in practice. The use of creative methods to inspire has contributed to deep learning within participants. An evaluation of the workshop illustrated how learning impacted on participants practice. Data to support this is presented in this paper. CONCLUSION: The use of creative teaching approaches in a workshop setting appears to provide an effective learning opportunity around dignified and respectful care.

Sanders_2019_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Sharing special birth stories. An explorative study of online childbirth narratives,"Sanders, Jose",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Increasingly, pregnant women, as active online media users, incorporate media driven values on childbirth that may not agree with professional midwifery values. In Dutch midwifery practice, online searching for other women's stories is often discouraged. However, online birth stories attract women as a means to learn from one another's experiences of childbirth. AIM: This study aims to explore Dutch women's use of an online social media platform (Instagram) to represent childbirth by analyzing their narrative strategies. METHOD: A collection of 110 Instagram-linked childbirth narratives (2015-2017) were analyzed applying an approach of interpretative repertoires. FINDINGS: The Dutch women in this study linked birth stories on their Instagram accounts that represented impactful experiences of childbirth. In their narratives, three interconnected repertoires are played out: sharing your story, going into details, and doing it yourself. This study highlights that narrative details of the online birth stories illustrate the physical and procedural obstacles that women overcame in giving birth. DISCUSSION: Reporting their emotional experiences in detail, women's online sharing of birth stories puts a focus on their personal preferences and decision making, and may ease the way for medical interventions. Without giving explicit advice, personal online birth stories could be instrumental in reformulating the standards of what childbirth is, or should be, like. CONCLUSION: Social media networks allow women to exchange stories that structure narrating women's childbirth experiences and offer a structure for the lived or future experiences of others. This may have an impact on women's decision-making during pregnancy and childbirth.",2019,10.1016/j.wombi.2018.12.009,32,6,e560-e566,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,Decision making and Humans and Female and Social media and Pregnancy and Netherlands and *Social Media and *Social Support and Preferences and *Narration and *Parturition/ethnology/physiology/psychology and Childbirth stories and Health communication,NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Parizkova_2019_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Women on the move: A search for preferred birth services,"Parizkova, Alena and Clausen, Jette Aaroe",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Women and midwives travel long distances, or abroad, to receive or provide birth services. Travel for birth services is not represented in the existing literature, despite the wide scale research available on medical travel. AIM: We explored the perspectives of women who were seeking better services outside their places of residence and midwives who travel to provide these services. METHOD: We followed a qualitative descriptive approach. We conducted 13 qualitative interviews with women from various European countries, four travelling midwives and one activist. Principles of thematic analysis were used. FINDINGS: Deciding whether to travel is the result of a long-term process, influenced by various push and pull factors. Travelling women and midwives share values; they trust the capacity of women to give birth; they value respect and equality in communication; they search for trusting relationships and friendly environments without unnecessary treatments. Trust and distrust on interpersonal and institutional levels influence women's decisions and frame narratives about their experiences.

Kissler_2020_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,A qualitative meta-synthesis of women's experiences of labor dystocia,"Kissler, Katherine and Jones, Jacqueline and McFarland, A. Kristienne and Luchsinger, Jacalyn",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"PROBLEM: Researchers have prioritized understanding and differentiating the pathophysiologic mechanisms to improve precision in diagnosis and individualization of care, however the experiences of women with labor dystocia have been underexamined. BACKGROUND: Management of labor dystocia has been identified as an opportunity for reducing the rate of unnecessary cesarean births and the associated risks to women and their infants. This meta-synthesis explores women's experiences of labor dystocia to enrich the discussion of care practices and contextualize discussions of shared decision making in what is most meaningful to women. QUESTIONS: How does prolonged labor influence women's experience of birth and motherhood? What are women's experiences with decision-making about labor augmentation during prolonged labor? METHODS: Sandelowski and Barroso's meta-synthesis approach was used to analyze primary qualitative studies of women's experiences of labor dystocia. Through inductive thematic synthesis and reciprocal translation, themes identified in qualitative research, quotations, and coded meaning units were aggregated and interpreted into derived categories and themes. FINDINGS: Fourteen qualitative studies were analyzed. Women experienced labor dystocia as a transition from healthy labor to abnormal labor requiring medical support consistent with Transition Theory by Meleis. Six new categories and thirty themes were identified. Each category and theme reflects a distinct component of the experience of labor dystocia. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in the way women experience labor dystocia. Facilitation of the transition from healthy labor to labor dystocia can be supported by a fluid, adaptable method of caring for women in the face of uncertainty and loss of choice.",2020,10.1016/j.wombi.2019.08.001,33,4,e332-e338,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Qualitative methods and Childbirth and Qualitative Research and Cesarean Section and Parturition/*psychology and Augmentation and Dystocia/*psychology and Labor dystocia and Labor, Obstetric/*psychology and Meta-synthesis and Mothers/*psychology",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Harding_2020_M.cn,JOUR,Breastfeed4Ghana: Design and evaluation of an innovative social media campaign,"Harding, Kassandra and Aryeetey, Richmond and Carroll, Grace and Lasisi, Opeyemi and Perez-Escamilla, Rafael and Young, Marissa",Maternal & child nutrition,"Although targeting health behaviour change through social media campaigns has gained traction in recent years, few studies have focused on breastfeeding social media campaigns. Within the context of rising social media utilization and recent declines in exclusive breastfeeding practices in Ghana, we implemented Breastfeed4Ghana, a Facebook- and Twitter-based breastfeeding social media campaign. This study determined feasibility of implementing Breastfeed4Ghana and evaluated its impact on breastfeeding knowledge in Ghana. Key performance indicators of the campaign were monitored on social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter. An online cross-sectional survey conducted across three time points (n = 451) assessed breastfeeding knowledge, campaign exposure, and understanding and acceptability of Breastfeed4Ghana among Ghanaian adults. Modified Poisson models were used to assess the relationship between campaign exposure and breastfeeding knowledge, adjusting for survey time point, sex, and parenthood status. The campaign acquired 4,832 followers. Based on follower demographics collected from Facebook and Twitter analytics, the target population was successfully reached. Campaign exposure among survey participants was 42.3% and 48.7% at midline and endline, respectively. Campaign acceptability was high (>90%), and >44% of those exposed to the campaign also shared the campaign with others. However, 61.0% of those exposed did not know or could not remember the purpose of the campaign. Campaign exposure was not associated with higher breastfeeding knowledge (APR [95% confidence interval] = 0.96 [0.73, 1.26]). Breastfeed4Ghana was highly feasible. However, campaign understanding yielded mixed findings and may explain the limited impact on breastfeeding knowledge.",2020,10.1111/mcn.12909,16,2,e12909,eng,1740-8709 1740-8695,"social media and Humans and Female and Feasibility Studies and Health Promotion/*methods and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and promotion and Ghana and Breast Feeding/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and breastfeeding and campaign and feasibility",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Matern Child Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA
Scamell_2017_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,"Sarah's birth. How the medicalisation of childbirth may be shaped in different settings: Vignette from a study of routine intervention in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Scamell, Mandie and Altaweli, Roa and McCourt, Christine",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: The expansion of the medicalisation of childbirth has been described in the literature as being a global phenomenon. The vignette described in this paper, selected from an ethnographic study of routine intervention in Saudi Arabian hospitals illustrates how the worldwide spread of the bio-medical model does not take place within a cultural vacuum. AIM: To illuminate the ways in which the medicalisation of birth may be understood and practised in different cultural settings, through a vignette of a specific birth, drawn as a typical case from an ethnographic study that investigated clinical decision-making in the second stage of labour in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Ethnographic data collection methods, including participant observation and interviews. The data presented in this paper are drawn from ethnographic field notes collected during field work in Saudi Arabia, and informed by analysis of a wider set of field notes and interviews with professionals working in this context. FINDINGS: While the medicalisation of care is a universal phenomenon, the ways in which the care of women is managed using routine medical intervention are framed by the local cultural context in which these practices take place. DISCUSSION: The ethnographic data presented in this paper shows the medicalisation of birth thesis to be incomplete. The evidence presented in this paper illustrates how local belief systems are not so much subsumed by the expansion of the bio-medical model of childbirth, rather they may actively facilitate a process of localised reinterpretation of such universalised and standardised practices. In this case, aspects of the social and cultural context of Jeddah operates to intensify the biomedical model at the expense of respectful maternity care. CONCLUSION: In this article, field note data on the birth of one Saudi Arabian woman is used as an illustration of how the medicalisation of childbirth has been appropriated and reinterpreted in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",2017,10.1016/j.wombi.2016.08.002,30,1,e39-e45,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Childbirth and Anthropology, Cultural and Saudi Arabia and Islam and Evidence-based practice and *Medicalization and Attitude of Health Personnel/ethnology and Delivery, Obstetric/*methods and Labor Stage, Second/*drug effects/ethnology and Medicalisation and Parturition/*ethnology",NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seeking women's views can be of help in understanding factors of importance for achieving vaginal birth in countries where the vaginal birth rates after caesarean is low. AIM: To investigate women's views on important factors to improve the rate of vaginal birth after caesareanin countries where vaginal birth rates after previous caesarean are low. METHODS: A qualitative study using content analysis. Data were gathered through focus groups and individual interviews with 51 women, in their native languages, in Germany, Ireland and Italy. The women were asked five questions about vaginal birth after caesarean. Data were translated to English, analysed together and finally validated in each country. FINDINGS: Important factors for the women were that all involved in caring for them were of the same opinion about vaginal birth after caesarean, that they experience shared decision-making with clinicians supportive of vaginal birth, receive correct information, are sufficiently prepared for a vaginal birth, and experience a culture that supports vaginal birth after caesarean. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Women's decision-making about vaginal birth after caesarean in these countries involves a complex, multidimensional interplay of medical, psychosocial, cultural, personal and practical considerations. Further research is needed to explore if the information deficit women report negatively affects their ability to make informed choices, and to understand what matters most to women when making decisions about vaginal birth after a previous caesarean as a mode of birth.",2017,10.1016/j.wombi.2017.04.009,30,6,481-490,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,Humans and Female and Adult and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Content analysis and Focus Groups and Ireland and *Decision Making and *Choice Behavior and Empathy and Caesarean section and Cesarean Section/*psychology and Focus groups and Parturition/psychology and Vaginal birth after caesarean and Vaginal Birth after Cesarean/*psychology and Women's views,NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johansson_2013_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Intrapartum care could be improved according to Swedish fathers: mode of birth matters for satisfaction,"Johansson, Margareta and Hildingsson, Ingegerd",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Intrapartum care is expected to be shaped by parents' need and preferences. AIM: The aim was to explore Swedish fathers' intrapartum care quality experiences, with a specific focus on care deficiencies in relation to birth mode. A secondary aim was to explore which issues of quality that contributed most to dissatisfaction with the overall assessment of the care. METHODS: Cross-sectional design, part of a prospective longitudinal survey in Sweden. A quality of care index was developed, based on perceived reality and subjective importance of given intrapartum care. Two months after birth 827 fathers answered nine questions related to quality of care. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used. RESULTS: Dissatisfaction with overall intrapartum care was related to deficiencies in partner's medical care (OR 5.6; 2.7-11.2), involvement in decision-making during childbirth (OR 2.6; 1.3-4.9), midwives presence in the labour room (OR 2.4; 1.2-4.7), and ability to discuss the birth afterwards (OR 2.0; 1.1-3.8). After emergency caesarean section 46% judged the partner's medical intrapartum care as most deficient (OR 1.73; 1.05-2.86), and after elective caesarean section 40% of the fathers judged involvement in decision-making as deficient (OR 4.07; 1.95-8.50). When the fathers had participated in a spontaneous vaginal birth they were dissatisfied with the presence of the midwife in the labour room (OR 1.72; 1.03-2.87).

Happel.Parkins_2016_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,At pains to consent: A narrative inquiry into women's attempts of natural childbirth,"Happel-Parkins, Alison and Azim, Katharina A.",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: With only 1.2% of all annual U.S. births registered as out-of-hospital births, national trends show an increase in medicalised hospital births. Caesarean sections have become the most common surgical procedure in the U.S.; Caesarean section rates have increased from 20.6% in 1997 to 31.5% in 2009. Furthermore, in 2009, 67% of hospital births utilised epidural analgesia and 26% used oxytocin augmentation. In response to the increased medicalisation of childbirth within the U.S., some women resist standardised medical procedures and instead choose to labour and birth without medical intervention. AIM: The purpose of this study was to understand and contextualise the childbirth experiences of first-time mothers who planned to have a natural childbirth (without medical intervention) in the Midsouthern United States. METHODS: Using narrative inquiry, we collected data from six participants through semi-structured life-story interviews. FINDINGS: Utilising thematic analysis, four recurring themes emerged: (1) benefits and limitations of pre-labour self-education; (2) labouring women's experiences of relationality; (3) the importance of birth stories and expectations; and (4) the creation of false dilemmas and complexities of ""informed choice."" DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The women's stories suggest that U.S. medical establishments, the media, and society need to empower pregnant and birthing women by creating new narratives of labour and positive spaces of relationality. Furthermore, health care professionals need to critically examine their usage of the medical model of care while respecting women's choices and agency.",2016,10.1016/j.wombi.2015.11.004,29,4,310-320,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"United States and Humans and Female and Adult and Pregnancy and Qualitative research and Attitude to Health and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Empowerment and Mothers/*psychology and Cesarean Section/psychology and Delivery, Obstetric/*psychology and Narrative inquiry and Natural childbirth and Natural Childbirth/psychology",NA,NA,2016/08//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA

E.",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"INTRODUCTION: This study seeks to explore midwives' perceptions about childbirth and in particular their beliefs about normality and risk. In the current climate of increasing interventions during labour, it is important to understand the thought processes that impact on midwifery care in order to examine whether these beliefs influence midwifery clinical decision-making. METHOD: 12 Midwives who worked in a variety of metropolitan hospitals in Sydney, Australia were interviewed about how they care for women during labour. The study utilised an inductive qualitative design using photo elicitation during the interview process. RESULTS: Six themes emerged from the data that clearly indicated midwives felt challenged by working in a system dominated by an obstetric model of care that undermined midwifery autonomy in maintaining normal birth. These themes were: desiring normal, scanning the environment, constructing the context, navigating the way, relinquishing desire and reflecting on reality. Most midwives felt they were unable to practice in the manner they were philosophically aligned to, that is, promoting normal birth, as the medical model restricted their practice. DISCUSSION: The polarised views of childbirth held by midwives and obstetricians do little to enhance normal birth outcomes. Midwives in this study expressed frustration that they were unable to practice midwifery in a way that reflected their belief in normal birth. This, they cite is a result of the oppressive obstetric model prevalent in maternity care facilities in Sydney and the over use of technological interventions during childbirth.",2014,10.1016/j.wombi.2013.11.004,27,2,126-131,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Perception and Australia and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Hospitals, Urban and Professional Autonomy and Nurse's Role and Nurse-Patient Relations and Delivery, Obstetric and Perceptions and Midwifery and *Photography and *Nurse Midwives and *Parturition and Normal birth and Obstetric Dominance and Photo elicitation and Risk and normality",NA,NA,2014/06//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA

This important decision to undergo an elective caesarean versus VBAC is ultimately a decision of the mother. The purpose of our study was to assess the quality of online information in relation to VBAC collected using the most common search engine: Google. METHODS: The 10 most common hit sites for the keywords ""VBAC"" and ""Vaginal birth after caesarean"" were evaluated using the search engine Google. The quality of websites was rated based on the Silberg scale for accountability, the modified Abbott's criteria for presentation and the SMOG index for readability. The content of each website was compared to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines for VBAC. FINDINGS: 13 out of 20 identified websites met the adequate criteria for accountability, with 85% of the websites indicating authorship. 11 websites were deemed aesthetically agreeable. The target audience, assessed by the readability score, was notably above the non-medical population with an average SMOG index score of 14.75. Only half of the websites contained recommendations, as detailed by the SOGC guidelines.

AIM: To map attitudes and knowledge of maternity care professionals regarding indications for planned birth, and assess inter-professional (midwifery versus medical) and intra-professional variation. METHODS: A custom-created survey of medical and midwifery staff at eight Sydney hospitals. Staff were asked to rate their level of agreement with 45 ""evidence-based"" statements regarding caesareans and inductions on a five-point Likert scale. Responses were grouped by profession, and comparisons made of inter- and intra-professional responses. FINDINGS: Total 275 respondents, 78% midwifery and 21% medical. Considerable inter- and intra-professional variation was noted, with midwives generally less likely to consider any of the planned birth indications ""valid"" compared to medical staff. Indications for induction with most variation in midwifery responses included maternal characteristics (age<e2><89><a5>40, obesity, ethnicity) and fetal macrosomia; and for medical personnel in-vitro fertilisation, maternal request, and routine induction at 39 weeks gestation. Indications for caesarean with most variation in midwifery responses included previous lower segment caesarean section, previous shoulder dystocia, and uncomplicated breech; and for medical personnel uncomplicated dichorionic twins. Indications with most inter-professional variation were induction at 41+ weeks versus 42+ weeks and cesarean for previous lower segment caesarean section. DISCUSSION: Both inter- and intra-professional variation in what were considered valid indications reflected inconsistency in underlying evidence and/or guidelines.

Jouhki_2012_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Choosing homebirth--the women's perspective,"Jouhki, Maija-Riitta",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the decision-making process and birth experience of ten women in Finland who had planned to have a home birth. METHOD: The data were collected by means of in-depth interviews in 2008 and were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Several reasons led to a decision to give birth at home. The main reasons were: previous birth experience, considering birth to be a natural process, increased autonomy, the home environment, intuition, the desire to choose the birth attendant, mistrust of the medical establishment and the opportunity to have the baby's siblings present at the birth. There were inhibiting and facilitating factors which influenced the women's decisions, and before making their decisions women sought out information about home birth. Home birth was an extremely positive experience and women highlighted their desire for the development of parent education to empower women in their preparations for birth. Full autonomy, the participation of family members, trust in one's ability to give birth and the absence of pharmacological pain relief were major contributors to the positive birth experience. The need for empowerment through parent education was highlighted in the interviews. CONCLUSION: To the women of this study home birth was very positive experience in which the autonomy was the important factor. According to this study maternity care services do not respond to women's individual wishes and services should be offer more alternatives and should be more empowering.",2012,10.1016/j.wombi.2011.10.002,25,4,61-e56,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Finland and Personal Autonomy and *Home Childbirth and Maternal Health Services/organization & administration",NA,NA,2012/12//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to explore factors that influence clinical decision-making for IOL that may be contributing to the variation in IOL rates between hospitals. METHODS: We undertook a qualitative study involving semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with obstetricians and midwives. Using purposive sampling, participants known to have diverse opinions on IOL were selected from ten Australian maternity hospitals (based on differences in hospital IOL rate, size, location and case-mix complexities). Transcripts were indexed, coded, and analysed using the Framework Approach to identify main themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Forty-five participants were interviewed (21 midwives, 24 obstetric medical staff). Variations in decision-making for IOL were based on the obstetrician's perception of medical risk in the pregnancy (influenced by the obstetrician's personality and knowledge), their care relationship with the woman, how they involved the woman in decision-making, and resource availability. The role of a 'gatekeeper' in the procedural aspects of arranging an IOL also influenced decision-making. There was wide variation in the clinical decision-making practices of obstetricians and less accountability for decision-making in hospitals with a high IOL rate, with the converse occurring in hospitals with low IOL rates. CONCLUSION: Improved communication, standardised risk assessment and accountability for IOL offer potential for reducing variation in hospital IOL rates.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1518-y,17,1,317,eng,1471-2393,"Decision-making and Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Female and Risk Assessment and Patient Participation and Physician-Patient Relations and Risk assessment and Australia and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Referral and Consultation and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Obstetrics and *Labor, Induced and *Midwifery and Doctor-patient relationship and Labour induction and Variation",NA,NA,2017/09/22/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gibson_2014_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Women's expectations and experiences with labour pain in medical and midwifery models of birth in the United States,"Gibson, Erica",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: This research focuses on how women understand and experience labour as related to two competing views of childbirth pain. The biomedical view is that labour pain is abnormal and anaesthesia/analgesia use is encouraged to relieve the pain. The midwifery view is that pain is a normal part of labour that should be worked with instead of against. AIMS: To determine differences in the preparation for and experiences with labour pain by women choosing midwives versus obstetricians. METHODS: Prenatal and postpartum in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 80 women in Florida (United States): 40 who had chosen an obstetrician and 40 who had chosen a licensed midwife as their birth practitioner. FINDINGS: Women in both groups were concerned with the pain of childbirth before and after their labour experiences. Women choosing midwives discussed preparing for pain through various non-pharmaceutical coping methods, while women choosing physicians discussed pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical pain relief. CONCLUSIONS: Equal numbers of women expressed concerns with childbirth pain during the prenatal interviews, while more women choosing doctors spoke about pain after their births. Women had negative experiences when their planned pain relief method, either natural or medical, did not occur. The quandary facing women when it comes to labour pain relief is not choosing what they desire, but rather preparing themselves for the possibility that they may have to accept alternatives to their original preferences.",2014,10.1016/j.wombi.2014.05.002,27,3,185-189,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Decision Making and Socioeconomic Factors and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Qualitative research and Childbirth and Florida and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Pain Measurement and *Patient Satisfaction and *Patient Participation and Parturition/*psychology and Midwifery and Analgesics/administration & dosage and Labor, Obstetric/*psychology and Mothers/*psychology and Analgesia, Obstetrical/psychology and Labor Pain/*psychology/therapy and Labour pain and Midwifery/standards",NA,NA,2014/09//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Basic beliefs about birth as a natural and as a medical process are both predictive factors for childbirth preferences. Studies investigating birth beliefs, preferences, and actual birth are rare. AIM: To test a predictive model of how these beliefs translate into birth preferences and into actual birth related-options. METHODS: Longitudinal observational study including 342 first-time expectant mothers recruited at women's health centres and natural birth communities in Israel. All women filled out questionnaires including basic birth beliefs and preferred birth options. Two months postpartum, they filled out a questionnaire including detailed questions regarding actual birth. FINDINGS: Stronger beliefs about birth being natural were related to preferring a more natural place and mode of birth and preferring more natural birth-related options. Stronger beliefs about birth being medical were associated with opposite options. The preferences mediated the association between the birth beliefs and actual birth. The beliefs predicted the preferences better than they predicted actual birth. DISCUSSION: Birth beliefs are pivotal in the decision-making process regarding preferred and actual birth options. In a medicalized obstetric system, where natural birth is something women need to actively seek out and insist on, the predictive powers of beliefs and of preferences decrease.

Yevoo_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Mothers' reproductive and medical history misinformation practices as strategies against healthcare providers' domination and humiliation in maternal care decision-making interactions: an ethnographic study in Southern Ghana,"Yevoo, Linda L. and Agyepong, Irene A. and Gerrits, Trudie and van Dijk, Han",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women can misinform or withhold their reproductive and medical information from providers when they interact with them during care decision-making interactions, although, the information clients reveal or withhold while seeking care plays a critical role in the quality of care provided. This study explored 'how' and 'why' pregnant women in Ghana control their past obstetric and reproductive information as they interact with providers at their first antenatal visit, and how this influences providers' decision-making at the time and in subsequent care encounters. METHODS: This research was a case-study of two public hospitals in southern Ghana, using participant observation, conversations, interviews and focus group discussions with antenatal, delivery, and post-natal clients and providers over a 22-month period. The Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee gave ethical approval for the study (Ethical approval number: GHS-ERC: 03/01/12). Data analysis was conducted according to grounded theory. RESULTS: Many of the women in this study selectively controlled the reproductive, obstetric and social history information they shared with their provider at their first visit. They believed that telling a complete history might cause providers to verbally abuse them and they would be regarded in a negative light. Examples of the information controlled included concealing the actual number of children or self-induced abortions. The women adopted this behaviour as a resistance strategy to mitigate providers' disrespectful treatment through verbal abuses and questioning women's practices that contradicted providers' biomedical ideologies. Secondly, they utilised this strategy to evade public humiliation because of inadequate privacy in the hospitals. The withheld information affected quality of care decision-making and care provision processes and outcomes, since misinformed providers were unaware of particular women's risk profile. CONCLUSION: Many mothers in this study withhold or misinform providers about their obstetric, reproductive and social information as a way to avoid receiving disrespectful maternal care and protect their privacy. Improving provider client relationship skills, empowering clients and providing adequate infrastructure to ensure privacy and confidentiality in hospitals, are critical to the provision of respectful maternal care.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1916-9,18,1,274,eng,1471-2393,"Communication and Power and Humans and Female and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Anthropology, Cultural and Mothers and Health Personnel and *Professional-Patient Relations and Empowerment and Ethnography and Ghana and Attitude of Health Personnel/*ethnology and Care decision-making and Health Behavior/*ethnology and Maternal Health Services/*statistics & numerical data and Medical History Taking/statistics & numerical data and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*ethnology and Pregnant women and Respectful maternal care",NA,NA,2018/07/03/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Professional guidance for midwives and obstetricians emphasises informed consent and respect for patient autonomy, but there is little guidance available to clinicians about the appropriate clinical responses when women decline recommended care. OBJECTIVES: We propose a comprehensive, woman-centred, systems-level framework for documentation and communication with the goal of supporting women, clinicians and health services in situations of maternal refusal. We term this the Personalised Alternative Care and Treatment framework. DISCUSSION: The Personalised Alternative Care and Treatment framework addresses Australian policy, practice, education and professional issues to underpin woman-centred care in the context of maternal refusal. It embeds Respectful Maternity Care in system-level maternity care policy; highlights the woman's role as decision maker about her maternity care; documents information exchanged with women; creates a 'living' plan that respects the woman's birth intentions and can be reviewed as circumstances change; enables communication between clinicians; permits flexible initiation pathways; provides for professional education for clinicians, and incorporates a mediation role to act as a failsafe.

While retrieval of most of the information in the birth records is mandatory, mothers may refrain to provide information on her smoking status. The proportion of women with unknown smoking status varied greatly over time, between hospitals, and by demographic groups. We investigated if incomplete data on smoking in the MBRN may have contributed to a biased smoking prevalence. METHODS: In a study population of all 904,982 viable and singleton births during 1999-2014, we investigated main predictor variables influencing the unknown smoking status of the mothers' using linear multivariable regression. Thereafter, we applied machine learning to predict annual smoking prevalence (95% CI) in the same group of unknown smoking status, assuming missing-not-at-random. RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of women with unknown smoking status was 14.4%. Compared to the Nordic country region of origin, women from Europe outside the Nordic region had 15% (95% CI 12-17%) increased adjusted risk to have unknown smoking status. Correspondingly, the increased risks for women from Asia was 17% (95% CI 15-19%) and Africa 26% (95% CI 23-29%). The most important machine learning prediction variables regarding maternal smoking were education, ethnic background, marital status and birth weight. We estimated a change from the annual observed smoking prevalence among the women with known smoking status in the range of - 5.5 to 1.1% when combining observed and predicted smoking prevalence. CONCLUSION: The predicted total smoking prevalence was only marginally modified compared to the observed prevalence in the group with known smoking status.

Semenic_2015_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Decision-making and evidence use during the process of prenatal record review in Canada: a multiphase qualitative study,"Semenic, Sonia and Edwards, Nancy and Premji, Shahirose and Olson, Joanne and Williams, Beverly and Montgomery, Phyllis",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal records are potentially powerful tools for the translation of best-practice evidence into routine prenatal care. Although all jurisdictions in Canada use standardized prenatal records to guide care and provide data for health surveillance, their content related to risk factors such as maternal smoking and alcohol use varies widely. Literature is lacking on how prenatal records are developed or updated to integrate research evidence. This multiphase project aimed to identify key contextual factors influencing decision-making and evidence use among Canadian prenatal record committees (PRCs), and formulate recommendations for the prenatal record review process in Canada. METHODS: Phase 1 comprised key informant interviews with PRC leaders across 10 Canadian jurisdictions. Phase 2, was a qualitative comparative case study of PRC factors influencing evidence-use and decision-making in five selected jurisdictions. Interview data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Phase 3 involved a dissemination workshop with key stakeholders to review and refine recommendations derived from Phases 1 and 2. RESULTS: Prenatal record review processes differed considerably across Canadian jurisdictions. PRC decision-making was complex, revealing the competing functions of the prenatal record as a clinical guide, documentation tool and data source. Internal contextual factors influencing evidence use included PRC resources to conduct evidence reviews; group composition and dynamics; perceived function of the prenatal record; and expert opinions. External contextual factors included concerns about user buy-in; health system capacities; and pressures from public health stakeholders. Our recommendations highlight the need for: broader stakeholder involvement and explicit use of decision-support strategies to support the revision process; a national template of evidence-informed changes that can be used across jurisdictions; consideration of both clinical and surveillance functions of the prenatal record; and dissemination plans to communicate prenatal record modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making related to prenatal record content involves a negotiated effort to balance research evidence with the needs and preferences of prenatal care providers, health system capacities as well as population health priorities. The development of a national template for prenatal records would reduce unnecessary duplication of PRC work and enhance the consistency of prenatal care delivery and perinatal surveillance data across Canada.",2015,10.1186/s12884-015-0503-6,15,NA,78,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Adult and Canada and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Medical Records/*standards and *Decision Making and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Advisory Committees and *Prenatal Care,NA,NA,2015/03/31/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Maternal requests that go against medical advice,"Hollander, Martine and Holten, Lianne and Leusink, Annemieke and van Dillen, Jeroen and de Miranda, Esteriek",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"PROBLEM AND BACKGROUND: This study explores the experiences of Dutch midwives and gynaecologists with pregnant women who request more, less or no care during pregnancy and/or childbirth. METHODS: All Dutch midwives and (trainee) gynaecologists were invited to fill out a questionnaire specifically designed for the purposes of this study. Holistic midwives were analysed separately from regular community midwives. FINDINGS: Most maternity care providers in the Netherlands receive requests for less care than recommended at least once a year. The most frequently maternal requests were declining testing for gestational diabetes (66.3%), opting for a home birth in case of a high risk pregnancy (65.3%), and declining foetal monitoring during labour (39.6%). Holistic midwives are more convinced of an increasing demand for less care than community midwives (73.1% vs. 35.2%, p=<0.001). More community midwives than hospital staff reported to have declined one or more request for less care than recommended (48.6% vs. 27.9%, p=<0.001). The majority of hospital staff also receive at least one request for an elective caesarean section every year. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Requests for more and less care than indicated during pregnancy and childbirth are equally prevalent in this study. However, a request for less care is more likely to be declined than a request for more care. Counselling women who disagree with their care provider demands time. In case of requests for less care, second best care should be considered.",2018,10.1016/j.wombi.2018.01.010,31,6,505-512,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pregnancy and Counseling and Netherlands and *Physicians and Labor, Obstetric and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Choice Behavior and Patient Preference/*psychology and Cesarean Section/*psychology and *Parturition and *Midwifery and *Gynecology/standards and Caesarean section at maternal request and Delivery, Obstetric/psychology/*standards and Elective Surgical Procedures/psychology and Home birth in high risk pregnancy and Home Childbirth and Pregnancy, High-Risk and Refusal of recommended care and Unassisted childbirth",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Park_2009_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Women's decisions about maternal serum screening testing: a qualitative study exploring what they learn and the role prenatal care providers play,"Park, Amanda and Mathews, Maria",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Maternal serum screening (MSS) is a blood screening test that detects fetuses with an increased risk for open neural tube defects, Down syndrome and Trisomy 18. Although most physicians offer MSS to their patients, discussions about the test are brief, usually lasting less than 5min. RESEARCH PROBLEM: The short duration of these discussions raises questions about the quality of information women receive and whether their screening decisions were well informed. This article describes what women learn about MSS and from which sources, and the role of their physician in their decision to have MSS. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with nine pregnant women from Newfoundland and Labrador. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic coding. MAIN FINDINGS: Women rely on multiple sources of information to learn about MSS, including prenatal health care workers, the Internet, and other mothers. Although physicians are influential in women's MSS decisions, they may not provide vital information about options in the event of a positive test. DISCUSSION: Unlike the scientific and medical communities which place greater value on rigorous, peer-previewed evidence based on research, women place greater value on information gleaned from more informal, accessible sources such as family, friends and the Internet. Prenatal care providers can aid women by directing them to credible sources of information and engaging in timely discussions about MSS.

Prior studies evaluating NIPT decision-making have focused on the clinical encounter as the primary environment for acquisition of biomedical information and decision formation. While important, this conceptualization fails to consider how additional sources of knowledge, including embodied and empathetic experiential knowledge, shape perceptions of risk and the societal use of NIPT. METHODS: In order to address this issue, qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 25 women who had been offered NIPT were performed. Participants came from a well-resourced, rural setting near a major academic medical center in the US. Women were categorized by NIPT use/non-use as well as whether their described decision-making process was perceived as making a significant decision requiring contemplation (""significant"") versus a rapid or immediate decision (""routinized""). A constructivist general inductive approach was used to explore themes in the data, develop a framework of NIPT decision-making, and compare the perceptions of women with differential decision-making processes and outcomes. RESULTS: A framework for decision-making regarding NIPT was developed based on three emergent factors: perceptions of the societal use of NIPT, expected emotional impact of genetic information, and perceived utility of genetic information. Analysis revealed that perceptions of widespread use of NIPT, pervasive societal narratives of NIPT use as ""forward-thinking,"" and a perception of information as anxiety-relieving contributed to routinized uptake of NIPT. In contrast, women who displayed a lack of routinization expressed fewer stereotypes regarding the audience for NIPT and relied on communication with their social networks to consider how they might use the information provided by NIPT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study reveal the societal narratives and perceptions that shape differential decision-making regarding NIPT in the U.S. CONTEXT: Understanding and addressing these perceptions that influence NIPT decision-making, especially routinized uptake of NIPT, is important as the use and scope of this technology increases.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-03203-4,20,1,630,eng,1471-2393,"Decision-making and Humans and Female and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Choice Behavior and Informed consent and Pregnant Women/*psychology and *Social Norms and Cell-Free Nucleic Acids/blood/genetics and Chromosome Aberrations and Experiential knowledge and Genetic Testing/methods and Non-invasive prenatal testing and Prenatal Diagnosis/adverse effects/methods/*psychology and Prenatal genetic testing and Routinization",NA,NA,2020/10/19/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Though access to medical care is considered to be life-saving during obstetric emergencies, data on the factors associated with health care decision-making during obstetric emergencies are lacking. We aim to describe the health care decision-making process during severe acute obstetric complications among women and their families in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: Using the pregnancy surveillance infrastructure from a large community trial in northwest rural Bangladesh, we nested a qualitative study to document barriers to timely receipt of medical care for severe obstetric complications. We conducted 40 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women reporting severe acute obstetric complications and purposively selected for conditions representing the top five most common obstetric complications. The interviews were transcribed and coded to highlight common themes and to develop an overall conceptual model. RESULTS: Women attributed their life-threatening experiences to societal and socioeconomic factors that led to delays in seeking timely medical care by decision makers, usually husbands or other male relatives. Despite the dominance of male relatives and husbands in the decision-making process, women who underwent induced abortions made their own decisions about their health care and relied on female relatives for advice. The study shows that non-certified providers such as village doctors and untrained birth attendants were the first-line providers for women in all categories of severe complications. Coordination of transportation and finances was often arranged through mobile phones, and referrals were likely to be provided by village doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to increase timely and appropriate care seeking for severe obstetric complications may consider targeting of non-certified providers for strengthening of referral linkages between patients and certified facility-based providers. Future research may characterize the treatments and appropriateness of emergency care provided by ubiquitous village doctors and other non-certified treatment providers in rural South Asian settings. In addition, future studies may explore the use of mobile phones in decreasing delays to certified medical care during obstetric emergencies.",2011,10.1186/1471-2393-11-76,11,NA,76,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pregnancy and Interviews as Topic and Rural Population and Emergency Medical Services and *Patient Acceptance of Health Care and Maternal Health Services and Bangladesh/epidemiology and Obstetric Labor Complications/*epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control and Rural Health Services,NA,NA,2011/10/21/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, 70% of all births occur outside the healthcare system under the care of unskilled birth attendants, family members, or without any assistance at all. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the reasons for choosing homebirth and the role of traditional birth attendants in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory study was carried out between May and June 2017. Twenty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with various respondent groups such as traditional birth attendants, pregnant women, skilled birth attendants, and health extension workers. Data were transcribed and for analysis, structured as per the participants' responses, sorted and categorized as per the topic guide, and presented in narrative form. FINDINGS: The study revealed that traditional birth attendants are actively engaged in assisting homebirths in the selected area. It was also found that many women still prefer traditional birth attendants for childbirth assistance. Reasons for choosing homebirth included lack of transport to health care facilities, distance to health care facilities, lack of respectful care at health care facilities, and the friendliness of traditional birth attendants. Lack of formal partnerships between traditional birth attendants and the health system was also observed.

Taiwan has one of the highest caesarean rates in the world, but little attention has been paid to this issue. This study aimed to describe the rate of caesarean delivery before 39 weeks gestation among women who did not have labour signs and had a non-emergency caesarean delivery in Taiwan and to examine whether the phenomenon was associated with the Chinese cultural practice of selecting an auspicious time for birth. METHODS: We recruited women at 15-28 weeks of pregnancy at 5 hospitals in northern Taiwan and followed them at 4 or 5 weeks after delivery using structured questionnaires. This analysis included 150 primiparous mothers with a singleton pregnancy who had a non-emergency caesarean delivery without the presence of labour signs. RESULTS: Ninety-three of these women (62.0%) had caesarean deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression analysis showed that women who had selected an auspicious time for delivery (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 1.15-6.95) and delivered in medical centres (OR=5.26, 95% CI: 2.25-12.26) were more likely to deliver before 39 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: Non-emergency caesarean delivery before 39 weeks of gestation was common among the study women, and was related to the Chinese cultural practice of selecting an auspicious time for birth. Further studies are needed to examine the risks and benefits associated with timing of caesarean delivery in Taiwan in order to generate a consensus among obstetricians and give pregnant women appropriate information.",2015,10.1016/j.wombi.2015.02.007,28,3,56-e52,eng,1878-1799 1871-5192,"Culture and Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Childbirth and Taiwan/epidemiology and Parturition and Gestational Age and Caesarean delivery and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and Delivery, Obstetric/statistics & numerical data and Elective Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data and Gestational age and Obstetric deliveries and Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,Women Birth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Camacho.Morell_2020_Wab.jotACoM,JOUR,Influence and use of information sources about childbearing among Spanish pregnant women,"Camacho-Morell, Francisca and Esparcia, Javier",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women create their childbirth expectations from their available information. Therefore, they should have access to reliable and quality medical information. However, the literature points a knowledge gap with respect to the sources of information used by them. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to analyse the most influential and widely used sources of information about childbearing in Spanish pregnant women. The secondary objectives were to assess the quality and usefulness of the information sources, to identify those regarded as deficient by pregnant women and to discover differences in information use related to parity. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken involving the administration of questionnaires to 40 primiparous and 40 multiparous (taking into account their first and second pregnancy). Social Network Analysis was used, as well as descriptive and inferential statistics for secondary objectives. RESULTS: Midwives were the most widely used (degree 0.988) and influential source of information (degree 0.600). Although the Internet was very much used (degree 0.738), its influence was very limited (degree 0.050). Healthcare professionals provided the most useful and highest quality information. Statistically significant differences have been found between first and second pregnancy of multiparous women in relation to the utilisation of some sources of information. CONCLUSIONS: Midwives were identified as the key professionals for informing pregnant women. The most influential sources were always people (this underscoring the importance of the face-to-face contact in the search for information).

Chen_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Women's decision-making processes and the influences on their mode of birth following a previous caesarean section in Taiwan: a qualitative study,"Chen, Shu-Wen and Hutchinson, Alison M. and Nagle, Cate and Bucknall, Tracey K.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is an alternative option for women who have had a previous caesarean section (CS); however, uptake is limited because of concern about the risks of uterine rupture. The aim of this study was to explore women's decision-making processes and the influences on their mode of birth following a previous CS. METHODS: A qualitative approach was used. The research comprised three stages. Stage I consisted of naturalistic observation at 33-34 weeks' gestation. Stage II involved interviews with pregnant women at 35-37 weeks' gestation. Stage III consisted of interviews with the same women who were interviewed postnatally, 1 month after birth. The research was conducted in a private medical centre in northern Taiwan. Using a purposive sampling, 21 women and 9 obstetricians were recruited. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, observation and field notes. Constant comparative analysis was employed for data analysis. RESULTS: Ensuring the safety of mother and baby was the focus of women's decisions. Women's decisions-making influences included previous birth experience, concern about the risks of vaginal birth, evaluation of mode of birth, current pregnancy situation, information resources and health insurance. In communicating with obstetricians, some women complied with obstetricians' recommendations for repeat caesarean section (RCS) without being informed of alternatives. Others used four step decision-making processes that included searching for information, listening to obstetricians' professional judgement, evaluating alternatives, and making a decision regarding mode of birth. After birth, women reflected on their decisions in three aspects: reflection on birth choices; reflection on factors influencing decisions; and reflection on outcomes of decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The health and wellbeing of mother and baby were the major concerns for women. In response to the decision-making influences, women's interactions with obstetricians regarding birth choices varied from passive decision-making to shared decision-making. All women have the right to be informed of alternative birthing options. Routine provision of explanations by obstetricians regarding risks associated with alternative birth options, in addition to financial coverage for RCS from National Health Insurance, would assist women's decision-making. Establishment of a website to provide women with reliable information about birthing options may also assist women's decision-making.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1661-0,18,1,31,eng,1471-2393,"Decision-making and Humans and Female and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Taiwan and Parturition/*psychology and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology and Vaginal Birth after Cesarean/*psychology and Cesarean Section, Repeat/*psychology and Mode of birth and Repeat caesarean section (RCS) and Risk evaluation and Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC)",NA,NA,2018/01/17/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Thompson_2012_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Delivering information: a descriptive study of Australian women's information needs for decision-making about birth facility,"Thompson, Rachel and Wojcieszek, Aleena M.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Little information is known about what information women want when choosing a birth facility. The objective of this study was to inform the development of a consumer decision support tool about birth facility by identifying the information needs of maternity care consumers in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: Participants were 146 women residing in both urban and rural areas of Queensland, Australia who were pregnant and/or had recently given birth. A cross-sectional survey was administered in which participants were asked to rate the importance of 42 information items to their decision-making about birth facility. Participants could also provide up to ten additional information items of interest in an open-ended question. RESULTS: On average, participants rated 30 of the 42 information items as important to decision-making about birth facility. While the majority of information items were valued by most participants, those related to policies about support people, other women's recommendations about the facility, freedom to choose one's preferred position during labour and birth, the aesthetic quality of the facility, and access to on-site neonatal intensive care were particularly widely valued. Additional items of interest frequently focused on postnatal care and support, policies related to medical intervention, and access to water immersion. CONCLUSIONS: The women surveyed had significant and diverse information needs for decision-making about birth facility. These findings have immediate applications for the development of decision support tools about birth facility, and highlight the need for tools which provide a large volume of information in an accessible and user-friendly format.

We aimed to determine the association between interventions introduced during labour with interventions in the birth process amongst women of low medical risk. METHODS: We undertook a population-based descriptive study of all low risk women amongst the 753,895 women who gave birth in Australia during 2000-2002. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated using multinomial logistic regression to describe the association between mode of birth and each of four labour intervention subgroups separately for primiparous and multiparous women. RESULTS: We observed increased rates of operative birth in association with each of the interventions offered during the labour process. For first time mothers the association was particularly strong. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the need for better clinical evidence of the effects of epidurals and pharmacological agents introduced in labour. At a population level it demonstrates the magnitude of the fall in rates of unassisted vaginal birth in association with a cascade of interventions in labour and interventions at birth particularly amongst women with no identified risk markers and having their first baby.

The intervention initiative was a decision-making framework called Intelligent Structured Intermittent Auscultation (ISIA) introduced through an education session. RESULTS: Following the intervention, medical records review revealed an increase in the use of IA during labour represented by a relative change of 12%, with improved documentation of clinical findings from assessments, and a significant reduction in the risk of receiving an admission CTG (RR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.60-0.95, p = 0.016).

Wang_2017_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Large reductions in cesarean delivery rates in China: a qualitative study on delivery decision-making in the era of the two-child policy,"Wang, Eileen and Hesketh, Therese",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: In 2010, China's cesarean delivery (CD) rates increased to one of the highest in the world, a significant proportion of which were without medical indication. However, recent studies have indicated some declines, coinciding with national and local efforts to promote vaginal birth, as well as the relaxation of the one-child policy. Considering these trends, we aimed to qualitatively explore attitudes towards childbirth and experiences of delivery decision-making among women and physicians. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 postpartum women and 7 healthcare providers at one county-level and one provincial-level maternity hospital in Zhejiang Province. We also collected routine data from 2007 to 2016 and observed doctor-patient interactions and hospital facilities as context for the interviews. Interviews were recorded, translated and transcribed into English, and then analyzed using a framework approach. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, cesarean delivery rates at the county-level and provincial-level hospital decreased from 46% to 32% and 68% to 44%, respectively. For low-risk women, vaginal birth was the primary choice of delivery method, encouraged by doctors and nurse-midwives. Elective CD was not as widely accepted, in contrast to previous years. Women were aware of and took into consideration the consequences of CD for future pregnancies. Among those who delivered vaginally, women viewed the existing pain relief methods, epidurals and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, with caution or uncertainty. Even when requested, epidurals were only given under certain circumstances. For multiparas with previous CD, repeat CD remains the norm. Both women and professionals were cautious about vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) given the associated risks. CONCLUSION: In China, changes in family planning policy and efforts to promote vaginal birth have greatly changed the culture of delivery decision-making, leading to decreased CD rates. This demonstrates the powerful role social factors and public policy can play, and provides a model for other countries with high CD rates. Further research should explore changes in other reproductive decisions during this new multiparous era, particularly across provinces.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1597-9,17,1,405,eng,1471-2393,"China and Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cesarean delivery and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and *Decision Making and *Choice Behavior and *Family Characteristics and Cesarean Section/*psychology and Parturition/psychology and Delivery, Obstetric/methods/*psychology and *Family Planning Policy and Delivery decision-making and Two-child policy",NA,NA,2017/12/04/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hollowell_2016_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Women's birth place preferences in the United Kingdom: a systematic review and narrative synthesis of the quantitative literature,"Hollowell, Jennifer and Li, Yangmei and Malouf, Reem and Buchanan, James",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines and national policy in England support offering 'low risk' women a choice of birth setting, but despite an increase in provison of midwifery units in England the vast majority of women still give birth in obstetric units and there is uncertainty around how best to configure services. There is therefore a need to better understand women's birth place preferences. The aim of this review was to summarise the recent quantitative evidence on UK women's birth place preferences with a focus on identifying the service attributes that 'low risk' women prefer and on identifying which attributes women prioritise when choosing their intended maternity unit or birth setting. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, Social Science Index, CINAHL and ASSIA to identify quantitative studies published in scientific journals since 1992 and designed to describe and explore women's preferences in relation to place of birth. We included experimental stated preference studies, surveys and mixed-methods studies containing relevant quantitative data, where participants were 'low risk' or 'unselected' groups of women with experience of UK maternity services. RESULTS: We included five experimental stated preference studies and four observational surveys, including a total of 4201 respondents. Most studies were old with only three conducted since 2000. Methodological quality was generally poor. The attributes and preferences most commonly explored related to pain relief, continuity of midwife, involvement/availability of medical staff, 'homely' environment/atmosphere, decision-making style, distance/travel time and need for transfer. Service attributes that were almost universally valued by women included local services, being attended by a known midwife and a preference for a degree of control and involvement in decision-making. A substantial proportion of women had a strong preference for care in a hospital setting where medical staff are not necessarily involved in their care, but are readily available. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women appear to value some service attributes while preferences differ for others. Policy makers, commissioners and service providers might usefully consider how to extend the availability of services that most women value while offering a choice of options that enable women to access services that best fit their needs and preferences.",2016,10.1186/s12884-016-0998-5,16,1,213,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Decision Making and United Kingdom and Pregnancy and Systematic review and Narration and Choice Behavior and *Patient Preference and Preferences and Parturition/*psychology and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Midwifery and Low-risk pregnancy and Place of birth choice,NA,NA,2016/08/08/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Baijens_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,"Improving shared decision-making in a clinical obstetric ward by using the three questions intervention, a pilot study","Baijens, S. W. E. and Huppelschoten, A. G. and Van Dillen, J. and Aarts, J. W. M.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is an important aspect of modern health care. Many studies evaluated different interventions to improve SDM, however, none in an inpatient clinical setting. A tool that has been proven effective in an outpatient department is the three questions intervention. These questions are created for patients to get optimal information from their medical team and to make an informed medical decision. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of this simple intervention on SDM in the obstetric inpatient department of a university hospital in the Netherlands. METHOD: This is a clinical pilot before and after study, using mixed methods with quantitative and qualitative data collection. The three questions were stated on a card; (i.e. 1) What are my options; 2) What are the possible benefits and harms of those options; 3) How likely are each of those benefits and harms to happen to me?). The study period lasted 6 weeks in which all patients admitted to the obstetric ward were asked to participate in the study. In the first 3 weeks patients did not receive the three questions intervention (pre-intervention group). In the final 3 weeks all patients included received the intervention (intervention group). The main quantitative outcome measure was the level of SDM measured using the SDM-Q9 questionnaire at discharge (range 0-100). In addition, interviews with four patients of the intervention group were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included in the pre-intervention group, 29 patients in the intervention group. The mean score of the SDM-Q9 in the pre-intervention group was 65.5 (SD 22.83) and in the intervention group 63.2 (SD 20.21), a not statistically significant difference. In the interviews, patients reported the three questions to be very useful. They used the questions mainly as a prompt and encouragement to ask more specific questions. DISCUSSION: No difference in SDM was found between the two groups, possibly because of a small sample size. Yet the intervention appeared to be feasible and simple to use in an inpatient department. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of implementation of these three questions on a larger scale.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1921-z,18,1,283,eng,1471-2393,"Shared decision making and Humans and Female and Adult and Quality Improvement and Pilot Projects and Feasibility Studies and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Information Seeking Behavior and Netherlands and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and *Surveys and Questionnaires and Consumer Health Information/*methods and Patient Participation/*methods and Inpatients/psychology and *Delivery, Obstetric/methods/psychology/standards and Inpatient department and Three questions intervention",NA,NA,2018/07/04/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until now there were no qualitative data on women's motivations for these choices in the Dutch maternity care system where integrated midwifery care and home birth are regular options in low risk pregnancies. We aimed to examine women's motivations for birthing outside the system in order to provide medical professionals with insight and recommendations regarding their interactions with women who have birth wishes that go against medical advice. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and a grounded theory method were used. In-depth interviews were performed with 28 women on their motivations for going against medical advice in choosing a high risk childbirth setting. Open, axial and selective coding of the interview data was done in order to generate themes. A focus group was held for a member check of the findings. RESULTS: Four main themes were found: 1) Discrepancy in the definition of superior knowledge, 2) Need for autonomy and trust in the birth process, 3) Conflict during negotiation of the birth plan, and 4) Search for different care. One overarching theme emerged that covered all other themes: Fear. This theme refers both to the participants' fear (of interventions and negative consequences of their choices) and to the providers' fear (of a bad outcome). Where for some women it was a positive choice, for the majority of women in this study the choice for a home birth in a high risk pregnancy or an unassisted childbirth was a negative one. Negative choices were due to previous or current negative experiences with maternity care and/or conflict surrounding the birth plan. CONCLUSIONS: The main goal of working with women whose birthing choices do not align with medical advice should not be to coerce them into the framework of protocols and guidelines but to prevent negative choices. Recommendations for maternity caregivers can be summarized as: 1) Rethink risk discourse, 2) Respect a woman's trust in the birth process and her autonomous choice, 3) Have a flexible approach to negotiating the birth plan using the model of shared decision making, 4) Be aware of alternative delivery care providers and other sources of information used by women, and 5) Provide maternity care without spreading or using fear.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1621-0,17,1,423,eng,1471-2393,"Risk and Patient satisfaction and Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Grounded Theory and Focus Groups and Netherlands and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Choice Behavior and *Motivation and Parturition/psychology and Delivery, Obstetric/*psychology and Unassisted childbirth and Trust/psychology and Care provison and Fear/psychology and Freebirth and Home birth and Midwives and Obstetricians and Pregnancy, High-Risk/*psychology",NA,NA,2017/12/16/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grigg_2014_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,An exploration of influences on women's birthplace decision-making in New Zealand: a mixed methods prospective cohort within the Evaluating Maternity Units study,"Grigg, Celia and Tracy, Sally K. and Daellenbach, Rea and Kensington, Mary and Schmied, Virginia",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: There is worldwide debate surrounding the safety and appropriateness of different birthplaces for well women. One of the primary objectives of the Evaluating Maternity Units prospective cohort study was to compare the clinical outcomes for well women, intending to give birth in either an obstetric-led tertiary hospital or a free-standing midwifery-led primary maternity unit. This paper addresses a secondary aim of the study--to describe and explore the influences on women's birthplace decision-making in New Zealand, which has a publicly funded, midwifery-led continuity of care maternity system. METHODS: This mixed method study utilised data from the six week postpartum survey and focus groups undertaken in the Christchurch area in New Zealand (2010-2012). Christchurch has a tertiary hospital and four primary maternity units. The survey was completed by 82% of the 702 study participants, who were well, pregnant women booked to give birth in one of these places. All women received midwifery-led continuity of care, regardless of their intended or actual birthplace. RESULTS: Almost all the respondents perceived themselves as the main birthplace decision-makers. Accessing a 'specialist facility' was the most important factor for the tertiary hospital group. The primary unit group identified several factors, including 'closeness to home', 'ease of access', the 'atmosphere' of the unit and avoidance of 'unnecessary intervention' as important. Both groups believed their chosen birthplace was the right and 'safe' place for them. The concept of 'safety' was integral and based on the participants' differing perception of safety in childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Birthplace is a profoundly important aspect of women's experience of childbirth. This is the first published study reporting New Zealand women's perspectives on their birthplace decision-making. The groups' responses expressed different ideologies about childbirth. The tertiary hospital group identified with the 'medical model' of birth, and the primary unit group identified with the 'midwifery model' of birth. Research evidence affirming the 'clinical safety' of primary units addresses only one aspect of the beliefs influencing women's birthplace decision-making. In order for more women to give birth at a primary unit other aspects of women's beliefs need addressing, and much wider socio-political change is required.",2014,10.1186/1471-2393-14-210,14,NA,210,eng,1471-2393,"Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Prospective Studies and Pregnancy and Health Care Surveys and Focus Groups and Patient Care Planning and Prenatal Care and Continuity of Patient Care and New Zealand and *Decision Making and *Safety and *Birthing Centers and *Hospitals, Maternity and *Tertiary Care Centers and Midwifery/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2014/06/20/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Begum_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,A qualitative study to explore the attitudes of women and obstetricians towards caesarean delivery in rural Bangladesh,"Begum, Tahmina and Ellis, Cathryn and Sarker, Malabika and Rostoker, Jean-Francois and Rahman, Aminur and Anwar, Iqbal and Reichenbach, Laura",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Caesarean section is a lifesaving surgical intervention for women and their newborns, though overutilization is a public health concern. The caesarean rate in Bangladesh is approximately 23% overall, and in private facilities it is over 70%. It is essential to know both the supply side (obstetricians) and demand side (parturient women) views on caesarean birth in order to formulate specific interventions to address the escalating rate of caesareans. METHODS: This qualitative study took place in Matlab, a rural sub-district in Bangladesh. We interviewed women attending their 3rd antenatal visit, those with recent caesareans, and obstetricians from both public and private health facilities. In total there were twenty in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions. Study participants were asked about their preferences on birthing mode and knowledge of the caesarean section process. Thematic data analysis was done following a deductive approach. RESULTS: Women from this rural community had a strong preference for normal vaginal birth. However, they were willing to accept the attending health care provider's decision for caesarean birth. Antenatal care sessions did not provide information on the medical indications for caesarean section. Furthermore, some women had the misconception that episiotomy itself is a 'small caesarean.' Primary health care providers and clinic agents (brokers) had a strong influence on women's decision to choose a health facility for giving birth. However, obstetricians, having a preference for caesarean section, were receiving more patients from these brokers which may be an important reason for the high rate of clinically non-indicated caesareans at private hospitals in Bangladesh. Improper labour monitoring and inadequate staffing at health facilities were additional influences on the preference for caesarean section. However, critical knowledge gaps were also observed among study obstetricians, particularly with regards to the indications for and timing of elective caesarean sections. CONCLUSION: There is a need to educate women about the advantages and disadvantages of different birthing modes to ensure their active participation in the decision making process. Strong policy regulations are needed to ensure legitimate decision making by obstetricians regarding mode of birthing.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1993-9,18,1,368,eng,1471-2393,"Physicians and Decision-making and Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Perception and Attitude and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Rural Population and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Attitude to Health and Bangladesh and Qualitative study and Caesarean delivery and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and Rural Bangladesh",NA,NA,2018/09/12/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gebrehiwot_2012_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Making pragmatic choices: women's experiences of delivery care in Northern Ethiopia,"Gebrehiwot, Tesfay and Goicolea, Isabel and Edin, Kerstin and San Sebastian, Miguel",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: In 2003, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health launched the Health Extension Programme (HEP), which was intended to increase access to reproductive health care. Despite enormous effort, utilization of maternal health services remains limited, and the reasons for the low utilization of the services offered through the HEP previously have not been explored in depth.This study explores women's experiences and perceptions regarding delivery care in Tigray, a northern region of Ethiopia, and enables us to make suggestions for better implementation of maternal health care services in this setting. METHODS: We used six focus group discussions with 51 women to explore perceptions and experiences regarding delivery care. The data were analysed by means of grounded theory. RESULTS: One core category emerged, 'making pragmatic choices', which connected the categories 'aiming for safer deliveries', 'embedded in tradition', and 'medical knowledge under constrained circumstances'. In this setting, women - aiming for safer deliveries - made choices pragmatically between the two available models of childbirth. On the one hand, choice of home delivery, represented by the category 'embedded in tradition', was related to their faith, the ascendancy of elderly women, the advantages of staying at home and the custom of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). On the other, institutional delivery, represented by the category 'medical knowledge under constrained circumstances', and linked to how women appreciated medical resources and the support of health extension workers (HEWs) but were uncertain about the quality of care, emphasized the barriers to transportation.In Tigray women made choices pragmatically and seemed to not feel any conflict between the two available models, being supported by traditional birth attendants, HEWs and husbands in their decision-making. Representatives of the two models were not as open to collaboration as the women themselves, however. CONCLUSIONS: Although women did not see any conflict between traditional and institutional maternal care, the gap between the models remained and revealed a need to reconcile differing views among the caregivers. The HEP would benefit from an approach that incorporates all the actors involved in maternal care, at institutional, community and family levels alike. Reconsideration is required of the role of TBAs, and a well-designed, community-inclusive, coordinated and feasible referral system should be maintained.",2012,10.1186/1471-2393-12-113,12,NA,113,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Patient Participation and Pregnancy and Focus Groups and Choice Behavior and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Ethiopia and Midwifery and Delivery, Obstetric/*psychology and Home Childbirth/psychology and Prenatal Care/psychology",NA,NA,2012/10/19/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because of labor pain, the decision of receiving epidural analgesia would often be made by the family members, instead of the parturient herself. We aimed to test whether earlier prenatal shared decision-making (SDM) interventions increase parturient's comprehension and satisfaction of epidural labor analgesia, compared to conventional explanation after labor pain begun. METHODS: During the 28th week of gestation, we provided the SDM parturient health education as well as a leaflet with quick response codes. Scanning the code would link to education videoclips which explained what epidural analgesia is and its advantages and disadvantages. Original routine practice group parturients received explanation of analgesia after admission for delivery. To measure the satisfaction of labor pain service, the accessibility of information, and the communication with medical staff, we designed a questionnaire with reference to (1) Pregnancy and Maternity Care Patients' Experiences Questionnaire (PreMaPEQ), (2) Preterm Birth Experience and Satisfaction Scale (P-BESS), and (3) Women's Views of Birth Labor Satisfaction Questionnaire (WOMBLSQ). The questionnaire was amended after a pretest involving 30 parturients who had received epidural analgesia. Scree test analysis and exploratory factor analysis were performed; then, the questionnaire was revised again. A total of 200 valid questionnaires were collected-100 each from the original routine practice group and the SDM group. RESULTS: The SDM group reported significantly higher satisfaction with and understanding of epidural analgesia, and a significantly higher satisfaction with the information received, and the quality of pain relief. After SDM intervention, significant increasement of the average satisfaction scores in question ""my epidural is effective"" (9.10%; mean difference: 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.17 ~ 0.59; p < 0.001) and ""The effect of epidural is just as what I have expected"" (10.41%; mean difference: 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 ~ 0.64; p < 0.001) was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: An earlier prenatal SDM intervention with sufficient information through videoclips increased parturients' comprehensions and satisfaction of epidural analgesia service.

Figueroa.Gray_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy,"Figueroa Gray, Marlaine and Hsu, Clarissa and Kiel, Linda and Dublin, Sascha",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Nausea during pregnancy affects 80% of pregnant women and can severely affect women's functioning and quality of life. Women often have difficulty deciding whether to take anti-nausea medications due to concern about medication risks. This paper foregrounds U.S. women's voices as they share their experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication use. METHODS: As a pilot study, we conducted two focus groups including 20 women who had filled at least one prescription for an anti-nausea medication during pregnancy. Topics included deciding about and taking anti-nausea medications. Transcripts were analyzed by two medical anthropologists using an inductive or open coding approach. RESULTS: Women in our pilot study carefully considered whether to take anti-nausea medications. Most women preferred not to take medications, in general, but were willing to do so for severe symptoms. When considering medications, they expressed concerns about risks to fetal health. They considered information from internet research, their health care provider, and the experiences of friends and family. While some women in our study decided against taking medications, many did take a prescription medication, and they reported substantial improvement in their symptoms and sense of well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Women weighed various sources of evidence to assess the risks and benefits of taking anti-nausea medication and ultimately made a range of choices. More research is needed about the effectiveness and risks of anti-nausea medication, to help support women in their decision-making process, and also about the best methods to communicate scientific evidence to women.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-2093-6,18,1,475,eng,1471-2393,Decision making and United States and Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Risk Assessment and Pilot Projects and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Severity of Illness Index and Nausea and Vomiting and Medication and *Decision Making and Ondansetron/therapeutic use and Focus group and Qualitative and Anti-emetic and Antiemetics/*therapeutic use and Morning Sickness/*drug therapy and Ondansetron,NA,NA,2018/12/04/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dekker_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Caesarean section audit to improve quality of care in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania,"Dekker, Luuk and Houtzager, Tessa and Kilume, Omary and Horogo, John and van Roosmalen, Jos and Nyamtema, Angelo Sadock",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Caesarean section (CS) is often a life-saving procedure, but can also lead to serious complications, even more so in low-resource settings. Therefore unnecessary CS should be avoided and optimal circumstances for vaginal delivery should be created. In this study, we aim to audit indications for Caesarean sections and improve decision-making and obstetric management. METHODS: Audit of all cases of CS performed from January to August 2013 was performed in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania. The study period was divided in three audit blocks; retrospective (before auditing), prospective 1 and prospective 2. A local audit panel (LP) and an external auditor (EA) judged if obstetric management was adequate and indications were appropriate or if CS could have been prevented and yet retain good pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, changes in modes of deliveries, overall pregnancy outcome and decision-to-delivery interval were monitored. RESULTS: During the study period there were 1868 deliveries. Of these, 403 (21.6%) were Caesarean sections. The proportions of unjustified CS prior to introduction of audit were as high as 34 and 75%, according to the respective judgments of LP and EA. Following introduction of audit, the proportions of unjustified CS decreased to 23% (p = 0.29) and 52% (p = 0.01) according to LP and EA respectively. However, CS rate did not change (20.2 to 21.7%), assisted vacuum delivery rate did not increase (3.9 to 1.8%) and median decision-to-delivery interval was 83 min (range 10 - 390 min). CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a single center study, these findings suggest that unnecessary Caesarean sections exist at an alarming rate even in referral hospitals and suggest that a vast number can be averted by introducing a focused CS audit system. Our findings indicate that CS audit is a useful tool and, if well implemented, can enhance rational use of resources, improve decision-making and harmonise practice among care providers.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1814-1,18,1,164,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Quality Improvement and Prospective Studies and Tanzania and Pregnancy and Audit and Referral and Consultation/*standards and Caesarean section and Assisted vaginal delivery and Cesarean Section/*standards and Decision-to-delivery interval and Hospitals, Rural/*standards and Maternal Health Services/*standards and Medical Audit/*methods and Vacuum delivery",NA,NA,2018/05/15/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aborigo_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Male involvement in maternal health: perspectives of opinion leaders,"Aborigo, Raymond A. and Reidpath, Daniel D. and Oduro, Abraham R. and Allotey, Pascale",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Twenty years after acknowledging the importance of joint responsibilities and male participation in maternal health programs, most health care systems in low income countries continue to face challenges in involving men. We explored the reasons for men's resistance to the adoption of a more proactive role in pregnancy care and their enduring influence in the decision making process during emergencies. METHODS: Ten focus group discussions were held with opinion leaders (chiefs, elders, assemblymen, leaders of women groups) and 16 in-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare workers (District Directors of Health, Medical Assistants in-charge of health centres, and district Public Health Nurses and Midwives). The interviews and discussions were audio recorded, transcribed into English and imported into NVivo 10 for content analysis. RESULTS: As heads of the family, men control resources, consult soothsayers to determine the health seeking or treatment for pregnant women, and serve as the final authority on where and when pregnant women should seek medical care. Beyond that, they have no expectation of any further role during antenatal care and therefore find it unnecessary to attend clinics with their partners. There were conflicting views about whether men needed to provide any extra support to their pregnant partners within the home. Health workers generally agreed that men provided little or no support to their partners. Although health workers had facilitated the formation of father support groups, there was little evidence of any impact on antenatal support. CONCLUSIONS: In patriarchal settings, the role of men can be complex and social and cultural traditions may conflict with public health recommendations. Initiatives to promote male involvement should focus on young men and use chiefs and opinion leaders as advocates to re-orient men towards more proactive involvement in ensuring the health of their partners.",2018,10.1186/s12884-017-1641-9,18,1,3,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Leadership and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and Maternal health and Pregnancy and Focus Groups and Family Characteristics and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Prenatal Care/*psychology and Health Personnel/*psychology and Ghana and Midwifery and Gender Identity and Fathers/psychology and Male involvement and Maternal morbidity and Men/*psychology and Near miss and Role of men and Safe motherhood and Sexual Partners/psychology",NA,NA,2018/01/02/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aminu_2014_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Reasons for performing a caesarean section in public hospitals in rural Bangladesh,"Aminu, Mamuda and Utz, Bettina and Halim, Abdul and van den Broek, Nynke",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 18.5 million Caesarean Sections (CS) are conducted annually worldwide and about one-third of them are done without medical indications and described as ""unnecessary"". Although developed countries account for most of the rise in the trend of unnecessary CS, more studies report a similar trend in developing countries, putting a strain on existing but limited healthcare resources, jeopardizing families' financial security and presenting a barrier to equitable universal coverage. We examined indications for CS in public hospitals of one district in Bangladesh and explored factors influencing decision to perform the procedure. METHODS: Retrospective review of case notes of 530 women who had CS in 5 public hospitals in Thakurgaon District of Bangladesh. Key Informant Interviews (KII) with 18 service providers to explore factors associated with the decision to perform a CS. RESULTS: The commonest recorded indications for CS were: previous CS (29.4%), fetal distress (15.7%), cephalo-pelvic disproportion (10.2%), prolonged obstructed labor (8.3%) and post-term dates (7.0%). The majority (68%) of CS were performed as emergency; mainly during daytime working hours. Previous CS and ""post-term dates"" were common indications for elective CS with ""post dates"" - the commonest indication for CS in primiparous women. 16.0% of all CS were conducted for cases where alternative forms of care might have been more appropriate. Providers reported not using protocols and evidence based guidelines even though these are available. Pressure from patients and relatives to deliver by CS strongly influenced decision making. External agents from private hospitals receive a financial reward for every CS performed and are present in public hospitals to ""lobby"" for CS. CONCLUSION: Factors other than evidence based practice or the presence of a clear medical indication influence providers' decision to perform both elective and emergency CS in public hospitals in Bangladesh.",2014,10.1186/1471-2393-14-130,14,NA,130,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Pregnancy and Incidence and Rural Population and *Decision Making and *Hospitals, Public and Bangladesh/epidemiology and Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data and *Hospitals, Rural and Obstetric Labor Complications/epidemiology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2014/04/05/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Perinatal experiences of men of color whose partners were at risk for preterm birth, a qualitative study","Edwards, Brittany N. and McLemore, Monica R. and Baltzell, Kimberly and Hodgkin, Allen and Nunez, Olga and Franck, Linda S.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth in the United States is associated with maternal clinical factors such as diabetes, hypertension and social factors including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In California, 8.7% of all live births are preterm, with African American and Black families experiencing the greatest burden. The impact of paternal factors on birth outcomes has been studied, but little is known about the experience of men of color (MOC). The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of MOC who are partners to women at medical and social risk for preterm birth. METHODS: This study used a qualitative research design and focus group methods. The research was embedded within an existing study exploring experiences of women of color at risk for preterm birth conducted by the California Preterm Birth Initiative. RESULTS: Twelve MOC participated in the study and among them had 9 preterm children. Four themes emerged from thematic analysis of men's experiences: (1) ""Being the Rock"": Providing comfort and security; (2) ""It's a blessing all the way around"": Keeping faith during uncertainty; (3) ""Tell me EVERYTHING"": Unmet needs during pregnancy and delivery; (4) ""Like a guinea pig"": Frustration with the healthcare system. Participants identified many barriers to having a healthy pregnancy and birth including inadequate support for decision making, differential treatment, and discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows novel and shared narratives regarding MOC experiences during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum periods. Healthcare providers have an essential role to acknowledge MOC, their experience of discrimination and mistrust, and to assess needs for support that can improve birth outcomes. As MOC and their families are at especially high social and medical risk for preterm birth, their voice and experience should be central in all future research on this topic.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-2785-6,20,1,91,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Discrimination and Trust and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Infant, Newborn and Fathers and Fathers/*psychology and Social Discrimination and African Americans/*psychology and Fatherhood and Men of color and Neonatal intensive care unit and Parental role and Patient-provider communication and Peripartum Period/*psychology and Premature Birth/*psychology and Preterm birth",NA,NA,2020/02/10/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Eze_2017_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Evaluation of obstetricians' surgical decision making in the management of uterine rupture,"Eze, Justus Ndulue and Anozie, Okechukwu Bonaventure and Lawani, Osaheni Lucky and Ndukwe, Emmanuel Okechukwu and Agwu, Uzoma Maryrose and Obuna, Johnson Akuma",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Uterine rupture is an obstetric calamity with surgery as its management mainstay. Uterine repair without tubal ligation leaves a uterus that is more prone to repeat rupture while uterine repair with bilateral tubal ligation (BTL) or (sub)total hysterectomy predispose survivors to psychosocial problems like marital disharmony. This study aims to evaluate obstetricians' perspectives on surgical decision making in managing uterine rupture. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study of obstetricians at the 46th annual scientific conference of Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria in 2012. Data was analysed by descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Seventy-nine out of 110 obstetricians (71.8%) responded to the survey, of which 42 (53.2%) were consultants, 60 (75.9%) practised in government hospitals and 67 (84.8%) in urban hospitals, and all respondents managed women with uterine rupture. Previous cesarean scars and injudicious use of oxytocic are the commonest predisposing causes, and uterine rupture carries very high incidences of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Uterine repair only was commonly performed by 38 (48.1%) and uterine repair with BTL or (sub) total hysterectomy by 41 (51.9%) respondents. Surgical management is guided mainly by patients' conditions and obstetricians' surgical skills. CONCLUSION: Obstetricians' distribution in Nigeria leaves rural settings starved of specialist for obstetric emergencies. Caesarean scars are now a rising cause of ruptures. The surgical management of uterine rupture and obstetricians' surgical preferences vary and are case scenario-dependent. Equitable redistribution of obstetricians and deployment of medical doctors to secondary hospitals in rural settings will make obstetric care more readily available and may reduce the prevalence and improve the outcome of uterine rupture. Obstetrician's surgical decision-making should be guided by the prevailing case scenario and the ultimate aim should be to avert fatality and reduce morbidity.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1367-8,17,1,179,eng,1471-2393,"Mortality and Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Clinical Competence and Nigeria and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and *Clinical Decision-Making and Hysterectomy/methods/statistics & numerical data and Maternal and Obstetrician and Obstetrics/*statistics & numerical data and Perinatal and Rupture and Sterilization, Tubal/statistics & numerical data and Surgical option and Uterine and Uterine Rupture/etiology/*surgery and Uterus/surgery",NA,NA,2017/06/08/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to describe the experience of rural health facility managers in ensuring the timely availability of drugs and medical supplies for emergency obstetric care (EmOC). METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 17 health facility managers: 14 from dispensaries and three from health centers. Two members of the Council Health Management Team and one member of the Council Health Service Board were also interviewed. A survey of health facilities was conducted to supplement the data. All the materials were analysed using a qualitative thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Participants reported on the unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies for EmOC; this was supported by the absence of essential items observed during the facility survey. The unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies was reported to result in the provision of untimely and suboptimal EmOC services. An insufficient budget for drugs from central government, lack of accountability within the supply system and a bureaucratic process of accessing the locally mobilized drug fund were reported to contribute to the current situation. CONCLUSION: The unreliability of obtaining drugs and medical supplies compromises the timely provision of quality EmOC. Multiple approaches should be used to address challenges within the health system that prevent access to essential drugs and supplies for maternal health. There should be a special focus on improving the governance of the drug delivery system so that it promotes the accountability of key players, transparency in the handling of information and drug funds, and the participation of key stakeholders in decision making over the allocation of locally collected drug funds.",2014,10.1186/1471-2393-14-108,14,NA,108,eng,1471-2393,Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Retrospective Studies and Tanzania and Pregnancy and Emergencies and *Obstetrics and *Rural Health and Durable Medical Equipment/*supply & distribution and Emergency Medical Services/*supply & distribution and Maternal Health Services/*supply & distribution and Pharmaceutical Preparations/*supply & distribution and Rural Health Services/*supply & distribution,NA,NA,2014/03/19/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Firdous_2020_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Muslim women's experiences of maternity services in the UK: qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis,"Firdous, Tasneema and Darwin, Zoe and Hassan, Shaima M.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: This review aimed to identify and synthesise evidence of Muslim women's experiences of maternity services in the UK. A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative evidence, unrestricted by type of publication was conducted. Muslim women who had accessed maternity services in the UK, regardless of obstetric or medical history were included. METHOD: Databases were searched from 2001 to 2019 and screened for inclusion using pre-determined criteria. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist was used to assess study quality and findings were synthesised using thematic synthesis, as described by Thomas and Harden. RESULTS: Six studies were included. The following five themes were identified: Islamic practices and Individualised care; Talk, Teach and Translate; Injustice, Inequity and Intolerance; If Allah wills; and, 'It's not all that bad'. Synthesis highlighted the significance of Islam in shaping many of the women's decision-making relating to antenatal screening and medication, which was contrasted with healthcare professionals' limited awareness of the importance of Islam for motherhood. The majority of women experienced poor maternity care which at times indicated stereotypical and discriminatory behaviour.

Carlsson_2019_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Written narratives from immigrants following a prenatal diagnosis: qualitative exploratory study,"Carlsson, Tommy and Balbas, Banaz and Mattsson, Elisabet",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Expectant parents often have optimistic expectations of the obstetric ultrasound examination and are unprepared for a diagnosis of foetal anomaly. Research that gives voice to the experiences of immigrants faced with a prenatal diagnosis is scarce, and there is a need for more exploratory research that provides insights into the experiences of these persons. The aim of this study was to explore narratives of experiences of immigrants with Arabic or Sorani interpreter needs when presented with a prenatal diagnosis of foetal anomaly. METHODS: A web-based tool with open-ended questions was distributed via Arabic and Kurdish non-profit associations and general women's associations in Sweden. Responses were received from six women and analysed with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in three themes: (1) an unexpected hurricane of emotions, (2) trying to understand the situation though information in an unfamiliar language, and (3) being cared for in a country with accessible obstetric care and where induced abortion is legal. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant women described an unexpected personal tragedy when faced with a prenatal diagnosis of foetal anomaly, and emphasised the importance of respectful and empathic psychological support. Their experiences of insufficient and incomprehensible information call attention to the importance of tailored approaches and the use of adequate medical interpreting services. There is a need for more descriptive studies that investigate decision-making and preparedness for induced abortion among immigrants faced with a prenatal diagnosis.",2019,10.1186/s12884-019-2292-9,19,1,154,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Sweden and Narration and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Consumer health information and Prenatal diagnosis and Counselling and Support and Prenatal Diagnosis/*psychology and Abortion, Induced/psychology and Arabs/psychology and Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology and Ethnicity/*psychology and Fetal Diseases/diagnosis/*psychology and Immigrants",NA,NA,2019/05/06/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kruske_2013_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Maternity care providers' perceptions of women's autonomy and the law,"Kruske, Sue and Young, Kate and Jenkinson, Bec and Catchlove, Ann",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Like all health care consumers, pregnant women have the right to make autonomous decisions about their medical care. However, this right has created confusion for a number of maternity care stakeholders, particularly in situations when a woman's decision may lead to increased risk of harm to the fetus. Little is known about care providers' perceptions of this situation, or of their legal accountability for outcomes experienced in pregnancy and birth. This paper examined maternity care providers' attitudes and beliefs towards women's right to make autonomous decisions during pregnancy and birth, and the legal responsibility of professionals for maternal and fetal outcomes. METHODS: Attitudes and beliefs around women's autonomy and health professionals' legal accountability were measured in a sample of 336 midwives and doctors from both public and private health sectors in Queensland, Australia, using a questionnaire available online and in paper format. Student's t-test was used to compare midwives' and doctors' responses. RESULTS: Both maternity care professionals demonstrated a poor understanding of their own legal accountability, and the rights of the woman and her fetus. Midwives and doctors believed the final decision should rest with the woman; however, each also believed that the needs of the woman may be overridden for the safety of the fetus. Doctors believed themselves to be ultimately legally accountable for outcomes experienced in pregnancy and birth, despite the legal position that all health care professionals are responsible only for adverse outcomes caused by their own negligent actions. Interprofessional differences were evident, with midwives and doctors significantly differing in their responses on five of the six items. CONCLUSIONS: Maternity care professionals inconsistently supported women's right to autonomous decision making during pregnancy and birth. This finding is further complicated by care providers' poor understanding of legal accountability for outcomes experienced in pregnancy and birth. The findings of this study support the need for guidelines on decision making in pregnancy and birth for maternity care professionals, and for recognition of interprofessional differences in beliefs around the rights of the woman, her fetus and health professionals in order to facilitate collaborative practice.",2013,10.1186/1471-2393-13-84,13,NA,84,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Perception and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Pregnancy and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Autonomy and Queensland and Fetus and Obstetrics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Patient Rights/*legislation & jurisprudence and Patient Preference/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Liability, Legal and Midwifery/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2013/04/04/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 2015-2017, our team conducted the first community-based study of maternal rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in sub-Saharan Africa and identified RHD in 88% of those with pre-existing heart disease. Here we conducted a follow up investigation of women previously identified with RHD, describing clinical and echocardiographic outcomes, identifying barriers to medical adherence and evaluating the personal impact of RHD. METHODS: A 2 week prospective follow up was completed at sites in Central and Eastern Uganda. Participants underwent a three-step mixed methods study comprising of 1) direct structured interview targeting clinical history and medication adherence, 2) echocardiogram to evaluate left-sided heart valves, and 3) semi-structured guideline interview to elicit personal impacts of RHD. RESULTS: The team evaluated 40 (80%) of the original 51 mothers with RHD at a median post-partum time of 2.5 years after delivery (IQR 0.5). Echocardiographic data showed improvement in nine women with the remaining 31 women showing stable echocardiographic findings. Adherence to Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) prophylaxis was poor, with 70% of patients either poorly adherent or non-adherent. Three major themes emerged from interviews: 1) social determinants of health (World Health Organization, Social determinants of health, 2019) negatively affecting healthcare, 2) RHD diagnosis negatively affecting female societal wellbeing, 3) central role of spouse in medical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Screening echocardiography can identify women with pre-existing rheumatic heart disease during pregnancy, but long-term follow-up in Uganda reveals adherence to medical care following diagnosis, including BPG, is poor. Additionally, mothers diagnosed with RHD may experience unintended consequences such as social stigmatization. As identification of occult RHD is critical to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, further research is needed to determine how to best support women who face a new diagnosis of RHD, and to determine the role of screening echocardiography in high-risk settings.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-03189-z,20,1,611,eng,1471-2393,"Screening and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Maternal health and Health disparities and Pregnancy and Follow-Up Studies and Severity of Illness Index and Postpartum Period and *Social Stigma and Maternal Age and Uganda and Uganda/epidemiology and Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data and Decision Making, Shared and Antibiotic Prophylaxis/statistics & numerical data and Echocardiography and Echocardiography/statistics & numerical data and Mass Screening/methods/*statistics & numerical data and Medication Adherence/psychology/statistics & numerical data and Mothers/psychology/statistics & numerical data and Penicillin G Benzathine/therapeutic use and Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology and Rheumatic heart disease and Rheumatic Heart Disease/*diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology and Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data and Spouses/psychology",NA,NA,2020/10/09/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We used a qualitative phenomenological approach. A total of 10 mothers and 8 fathers from a fishing village in Karachi, Pakistan were purposefully sampled and interviewed individually. A focus group was undertaken with four grandmothers (primary decision makers). Transcripts were independently reviewed using interpretive thematic analysis. RESULTS: A multigenerational approach was used in infant care, but mothers did not have a voice in decision-making. Parents connected breast milk to infant health, and crying was used as cue to initiate feeding. Participants perceived that newborns required early supplementation, given poor milk supply and to improve health. There were tensions between traditional (i.e., home) remedies and current medical practices. Equal importance was given to sons and daughters. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that social and cultural influences within families and the community must be considered in developing interventions to improve newborn health. Introducing non-breast milk substances into newborn diets may reduce the duration of exclusive or partial breastfeeding and increase risks to infant health.",2014,10.1186/1471-2393-14-232,14,NA,232,eng,1471-2393,"Culture and Poverty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Infant and Decision Making and Food and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Mothers and Focus Groups and Infant, Newborn and Social Environment and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/*ethnology and *Breast Feeding and Pakistan and *Family Characteristics/ethnology and *Infant Care and *Intergenerational Relations/ethnology and Medicine, Traditional and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/ethnology",NA,NA,2014/07/16/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Birchley_2017_Arofdiinch,JOUR,'Best interests' in paediatric intensive care: an empirical ethics study,"Birchley, Giles and Gooberman-Hill, Rachael and Deans, Zuzana and Fraser, James and Huxtable, Richard",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVE: In English paediatric practice, English law requires that parents and clinicians agree the 'best interests' of children and, if this is not possible, that the courts decide. Court intervention is rare and the concept of best interests is ambiguous. We report qualitative research exploring how the best interests standard operates in practice, particularly with decisions related to planned non-treatment. We discuss results in the light of accounts of best interests in the medical ethics literature. DESIGN: We conducted 39 qualitative interviews, exploring decision making in the paediatric intensive care unit, with doctors, nurses, clinical ethics committee members and parents whose children had a range of health outcomes. Interviews were audio-recorded and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Parents and clinicians indicated differences in their approaches to deciding the child's best interests. These were reconciled when parents responded positively to clinicians' efforts to help parents agree with the clinicians' view of the child's best interests. Notably, protracted disagreements about a child's best interests in non-treatment decisions were resolved when parents' views were affected by witnessing their child's physical deterioration. Negotiation was the norm and clinicians believed avoiding the courts was desirable. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity to the long-term interests of parents of children with life-limiting conditions is defensible but must be exercised proportionately. Current approaches emphasise negotiation but offer few alternatives when decisions are at an impasse. In such situations, the instrumental role played by a child's deterioration and avoidance of the courts risks giving insufficient weight to the child's interests. New approaches to decision making are needed.",2017,10.1136/archdischild-2016-312076,102,10,930-935,eng,1468-2044 0003-9888,"Physicians and Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Child, Preschool and Infant and Decision Making and Law and Parents and Qualitative Research and Infant, Newborn and *Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and Terminal Care/*ethics/methods and Intensive Care Units, Pediatric/*ethics and End-of-Life-Care and Paediatric Intensive Care Units",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,Arch Dis Child,NA,NA,NA,NA
McLelland_2015_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Victorian paramedics' encounters and management of women in labour: an epidemiological study,"McLelland, Gayle and Morgans, Amee and McKenna, Lisa",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Although it is generally accepted that paramedics attend unexpected births, there is a paucity of literature about their management of women in labour. This study aimed to investigate the caseload of women in labour attended by a statewide ambulance service in Australia during one year and the management provided by paramedics. METHODS: Retrospective clinical data collected on-scene by paramedics via in-field electronic patient care records were provided by Ambulance Victoria. Patient case reports were electronically extracted from the Ambulance Victoria's Clinical Data Warehouse via comprehensive filtering followed by manual sorting. Descriptive statistics were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v.19). RESULTS: Over a 12-month period, paramedics were called to 1517 labouring women. Two thirds of women were at full-term gestation, and 40% of pre-term pregnancies were less than 32 weeks gestation. Paramedics documented 630 case reports of women in early labour and a further 767 in established labour. There were 204 women thought to be second stage labour, including 134 who progressed to childbirth under paramedic care. When paramedics assisted with births, the on-scene time was significantly greater than those patients transported in labour. Pain relief was provided significantly more often to women in established labour than in early labour. Oxygen was given to significantly more women in preterm labour. While paramedics performed a range of procedures including intravenous cannulation, administration of analgesia and oxygen, most women required minimal intervention. Paramedics needed to manage numerous obstetric and medical complications during their management. CONCLUSIONS: Paramedics provide emergency care and transportation for women in labour. Most of the women were documented to be at term gestation with minimal complications. To enable appropriate decision making about management and transportation, paramedics require a range of clinical assessment skills comprising essential knowledge about antenatal and intrapartum care.",2015,10.1186/s12884-015-0430-6,15,NA,13,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Cohort Studies and Pregnancy and Epidemiologic Studies and Pain Management and Gestational Age and Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data and *Labor, Obstetric and *Delivery, Obstetric and Victoria/epidemiology and *Emergency Medical Technicians and *Ambulances and Allied Health Personnel and Analgesia, Obstetrical/*statistics & numerical data and Labor Stage, Second and Obstetric Labor, Premature/*epidemiology and Premature Birth/*epidemiology",NA,NA,2015/02/05/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sullivan_2014_Arofdiinch,JOUR,What parents want from doctors in end-of-life decision-making for children,"Sullivan, J. and Monagle, P. and Gillam, L.",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVE: End-of-life decision-making is difficult for everyone involved, as many studies have shown. Within this complexity, there has been little information on how parents see the role of doctors in end-of-life decision-making for children. This study aimed to examine parents' views and experiences of end-of-life decision-making. DESIGN: A qualitative method with a semistructured interview design was used. SETTING: Parent participants were living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five bereaved parents. MAIN OUTCOMES: Parents reported varying roles taken by doctors: being the provider of information without opinion; giving information and advice as to the decision that should be taken; and seemingly being the decision maker for the child. The majority of parents found their child's doctor enabled them to be the ultimate decision maker for their child, which was what they very clearly wanted to be, and consequently enabled them to exercise their parental autonomy. Parents found it problematic when doctors took over decision-making. A less frequently reported, yet significant role for doctors was to affirm decisions after they had been made by parents. Other important aspects of the doctor's role were to provide follow-up support and referral. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the role that doctors take in end-of-life decisions, and the subsequent impact of that role from the perspective of parents can form the basis of better informed clinical practice.",2014,10.1136/archdischild-2013-304249,99,3,216-220,eng,1468-2044 0003-9888,"Physicians and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Palliative Care and Medical Education and *Decision Making and *Terminal Care and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and Evidence Based Medicine and Paediatric Practice",NA,NA,2014/03//undefined,Arch Dis Child,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chin_2011_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Patients' perceptions of safety and quality of maternity clinical handover,"Chin, Georgiana S. M. and Warren, Narelle and Kornman, Louise and Cameron, Peter",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Maternity clinical handover serves to address the gaps in knowledge existing when transitions between individuals or groups of clinicians occur throughout the antenatal, intra-partum and postnatal period. There are limited published studies on maternity handover and a paucity of information about patients' perceptions of the same. This paper reports postnatal patients' perceptions of how maternity handover contributes to the quality and safety of maternity care. METHODS: This paper reports on a mixed-methods study consisting of qualitative interviews and quantitative medical record analysis. Thirty English-speaking postnatal patients who gave birth at an Australian tertiary maternity hospital participated in a semi-structured interview prior to discharge from hospital. Interview data were coded thematically using the constant comparative method and managed via NVivo software; this data set was supplemented by medical record data analysed using STATA. RESULTS: Almost half of the women were aware of a handover process. Clinician awareness of patient information was seen as evidence that handover had taken place and was seen as representing positive aspects of teamwork, care and communication by participants, all important factors in the perception of quality health care. Collaborative cross-checking, including the use of cognitive artefacts such as hand held antenatal records and patient-authored birth plans, and the involvement of patients and their support people in handover were behaviours described by participants to be protective mechanisms that enhanced quality and safety of care. These human factors also facilitated team situational awareness (TSA), shared decision making and patient motivation in labour. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that many patients are aware of handover processes. For some patients, evidence of handover, through clinician awareness of information, represented positive aspects of teamwork, care and communication. Cross-checking and cognitive artefacts were observed to support handover. Patient-authored birth plans were described by some to enhance the quality and safety of the handover by providing a 'voice' to the patient in this process. This was a novel and potentially important perspective.

This study investigated trends in IOL and associated factors among NT Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal mothers between 2001 and 2012. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all NT resident women who birthed in the NT between 2001 and 2012 at <e2><89><a5>32 weeks gestation. Demographic, medical and obstetric data were obtained from the NT Midwives' Collection. The prevalence of IOL was calculated by Aboriginal status and parity of the mother and year of birth. The prevalence of each main indication for induction among women was compared for 2001-2003 and 2010-2012. Linear and logistic regression was used to test for association between predictive factors and IOL in bivariate and multivariate analysis, separately for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal mothers. RESULTS: A total of 42,765 eligible births between 2001 and 2012 were included. IOL was less common for Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal mothers in 2001 (18.0 % and 25.1 %, respectively), but increased to be similar to non-Aboriginal mothers in 2012 (22.6 % and 24.8 %, respectively). Aboriginal primiparous mothers demonstrated the greatest increase in IOL. The most common indication for IOL for both groups was post-dates, which changed little over time. Medical and obstetric complications were more common for Aboriginal mothers except late-term pregnancy. Prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy increased considerably among both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal mothers, but was responsible for only a small proportion of IOLs. Increasing prevalence of risk factors did not explain the increased IOL prevalence for Aboriginal mothers. CONCLUSIONS: IOL is now as common for Aboriginal as non-Aboriginal mothers, though their demographic, medical and obstetric profiles are markedly different. Medical indications did not explain the recent increase in IOL among Aboriginal mothers; changes in maternal or clinical decision-making may have been involved.",2016,10.1186/s12884-016-0899-7,16,1,126,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Multivariate Analysis and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and Prevalence and Indigenous and Induction of labour and Labor, Induced/*trends and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander/*statistics & numerical data and Northern Territory/epidemiology/ethnology and Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology/*ethnology",NA,NA,2016/05/31/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Olander_2015_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Person-centred care in interventions to limit weight gain in pregnant women with obesity - a systematic review,"Olander, Ellinor K. and Berg, Marie and McCourt, Christine and Carlstrom, Eric and Dencker, Anna",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Person-centred care, asserting that individuals are partners in their care, has been associated with care satisfaction but the value of using it to support women with obesity during pregnancy is unknown. Excessive gestational weight gain is associated with increased risks for both mother and baby and weight gain therefore is an important intervention target. The aims of this review was to 1) explore to what extent and in what manner interventions assessing weight in pregnant women with obesity use person-centred care and 2) assess if interventions including aspects of person-centred care are more effective at limiting weight gain than interventions not employing person-centred care. METHODS: Ten databases were systematically searched in January 2014. Studies had to report an intervention offered to pregnant women with obesity and measure gestational weight gain to be included. All included studies were independently double coded to identify to what extent they included three defined aspects of person-centred care: 1) ""initiate a partnership"" including identifying the person's circumstances and motivation; 2) ""working the partnership"" through sharing the decision-making regarding the planned action and 3) ""safeguarding the partnership through documentation"" of care preferences. Information on gestational weight gain, study quality and characteristics were also extracted. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the review, of which five were randomised controlled trials (RCT), and the remaining observational studies. Four interventions included aspects of person-centred care; two observational studies included both ""initiating the partnership"", and ""working the partnership"". One observational study included ""initiating the partnership"" and one RCT included ""working the partnership"". No interventions included ""safeguarding the partnership through documentation"". Whilst all studies with person-centred care aspects showed promising findings regarding limiting gestational weight gain, so did the interventions not including person-centred care aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an identified person-centred care approach is presently limited in interventions targeting gestational weight gain in pregnant women with obesity. Hence to what extent person-centred care may improve health outcomes and care satisfaction in this population is currently unknown and more research is needed. That said, our findings suggest that use of routines incorporating person-centredness are feasible to include within these interventions.",2015,10.1186/s12884-015-0463-x,15,NA,50,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Infant and Quality Improvement and Pregnancy and Early Diagnosis and Motor Activity and Health Promotion/methods and Patient-Centered Care/methods and *Obesity/diagnosis/therapy and *Perinatal Care/methods/standards and *Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis/therapy and *Weight Gain and Early Medical Intervention/methods/standards,NA,NA,2015/02/27/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bertschy_2016_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Delivering care under uncertainty: Swiss providers' experiences in caring for women with spinal cord injury during pregnancy and childbirth - an expert interview study,"Bertschy, Sue and Pannek, Jurgen and Meyer, Thorsten",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: When different health problems such as pregnancy and spinal cord injury (SCI) occur together, providing adequate care becomes even more challenging. Women with SCI may encounter a variety of specific problems and symptoms during pregnancy and childbirth, including urinary tract infections, pressure ulcers, constipation, autonomic dysreflexia, and preterm labour. Therefore, expertise from different medical specialties, especially spinal cord medicine and gynaecology are required. What is totally normal for experts of one specialty could cause a problem for experts from another specialty. Therefore, this study aimed to reconstruct the perceptions and experiences of healthcare providers in Switzerland in caring for women with SCI during pregnancy and childbirth. METHODS: The perception and experience of healthcare professionals toward providing care for women with SCI during pregnancy and labour were elicited using qualitative expert interviews and analysed using grounded theory techniques. Fifteen health professionals were interviewed, including gynaecologists (n = 4), midwives (n = 3), physical medicine and rehabilitation professionals (n = 4), urologists (n = 3), and a peer counselor (n = 1). RESULTS: Care delivery experiences of health professionals could be described as a forced reaction to decision making under uncertainty. However, health professionals seemed to express three different attitudes while handling the situation: (i) protective concerned attitude, (ii) 'no big deal' attitude, or (iii) precautionary attitude. The applied strategies were influenced by the conditions of the healthcare system, policies in place, and health professionals' behaviours. Consequently, health professionals faced with uncertainty felt like actors in a fragmented treatment process and called for interdisciplinary collaborations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the diversity of perspectives among different healthcare professionals with respect to the approach to care and delivery services for pregnant women with SCI. A need for more specific services, information, guidance, and guidelines for health professionals caring for woman with SCI during pregnancy and childbirth was identified. We strongly recommend further research on the development of integrated care concepts as well as clinical studies for establishing a more profound knowledge base.",2016,10.1186/s12884-016-0976-y,16,1,181,eng,1471-2393,Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Cooperative Behavior and Urology and Pregnancy and Childbirth and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Prenatal Care and Switzerland and Interdisciplinary Communication and Gynecology and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Decision-Making and Parturition and Midwifery and Spinal Cord Injuries/*therapy and Spinal cord injury and Pregnancy Complications/*therapy and Care provider and Health professionals and Interdisciplinary collaboration and Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine and Rare event and Woman,NA,NA,2016/07/22/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Khan_2012_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Making birthing safe for Pakistan women: a cluster randomized trial,"Khan, Muhammad Amir and Mirza, Shirin and Ahmed, Maqsood and Rasheed, Akhtar and Khan, Amanullah and Walley, John and Nisar, Nailah",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Two out of three neonatal deaths occur in just 10 countries and Pakistan stands third among them. Maternal mortality is also high with most deaths occurring during labor, birth, and first few hours after birth. Enhanced access and utilization of skilled delivery and emergency obstetric care is the demonstrated strategy in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. This trial aims to compare reduction in neonate mortality and utilization of available safe birthing and Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care services among pregnant mothers receiving 'structured birth planning', and/or 'transport facilitation' compared to routine care. METHODS: A pragmatic cluster randomized trial, with qualitative and economic studies, will be conducted in Jhang, Chiniot and Khanewal districts of Punjab, Pakistan, from February 2011 to May 2013. At least 29,295 pregnancies will be registered in the three arms, seven clusters per arm; 1) structured birth planning and travel facilitation, 2) structured birth planning, and 3) control arm. Trial will be conducted through the Lady Health Worker program. Main outcomes are difference in neonatal mortality and service utilization; maternal mortality being the secondary outcome. Cluster level analysis will be done according to intention-to-treat. DISCUSSION: A nationwide network of about 100,000 lady health workers is already involved in antenatal and postnatal care of pregnant women. They also act as ""gatekeepers"" for the child birthing services. This gate keeping role mainly includes counseling and referral for skill birth attendance and travel arrangements for emergency obstetric care (if required). The review of current arrangements and practices show that the care delivery process needs enhancement to include adequate information provision as well as informed ""decision"" making and planned ""action"" by the pregnant women. The proposed three-year research is to develop, through national technical working group process, and then test a set of arrangements for achieving the enhanced utilization of safe birthing services.

Lubbe_2017_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide,"Lubbe, Welma and Ten Ham-Baloyi, Wilma",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: The use of pacifiers is an ancient practice, but often becomes a point of debate when parents and professionals aim to protect and promote breastfeeding as most appropriately for nurturing infants. We discuss the current literature available on pacifier use to enable critical decision-making regarding justifiable use of pacifiers, especially in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative context, and we provide practical guidelines for clinicians. DISCUSSION: Suck-swallow-breathe coordination is an important skill that every newborn must acquire for feeding success. In most cases the development and maintenance of the sucking reflex is not a problem, but sometimes the skill may be compromised due to factors such as mother-infant separation or medical conditions. In such situations the use of pacifiers can be considered therapeutic and even provide medical benefits to infants, including reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The argument opposing pacifier use, however, is based on potential risks such as nipple confusion and early cessation of breastfeeding. The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding as embedded in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative initially prohibited the use of pacifiers in a breastfeeding friendly environment to prevent potential associated risks. This article provides a summary of the evidence on the benefits of non-nutritive sucking, risks associated with pacifier use, an identification of the implications regarded as 'justifiable' in the clinical use of pacifiers and a comprehensive discussion to support the recommendations for safe pacifier use in healthy, full-term, and ill and preterm infants. The use of pacifiers is justifiable in certain situations and will support breastfeeding rather than interfere with it. Justifiable conditions have been identified as: low-birth weight and premature infants; infants at risk for hypoglyceamia; infants in need of oral stimulation to develop, maintain and mature the sucking reflex in preterm infants; and the achievement of neurobehavioural organisation. Medical benefits associated with the use of pacifiers include providing comfort, contributing towards neurobehavioural organisation, and reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Guidelines are presented for assessing and guiding safe pacifier use, for specific design to ensure safety, and for cessation of use to ensure normal childhood development.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1306-8,17,1,130,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Male and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Infant, Newborn and Breast Feeding and Child Development/*physiology and Hospitals/*standards and Breastfeeding and Neonatal intensive care unit and Baby-friendly hospital initiative and Clinician's guide and Justifiable pacifier use and Pacifier and Pacifier risks and Pacifiers/*standards and Recommendations for pacifier use and Sucking Behavior/*physiology",NA,NA,2017/04/27/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Maru_2017_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Impact of the roll out of comprehensive emergency obstetric care on institutional birth rate in rural Nepal,"Maru, Sheela and Bangura, Alex Harsha and Mehta, Pooja and Bista, Deepak and Borgatta, Lynn and Pande, Sami and Citrin, David and Khanal, Sumesh and Banstola, Amrit and Maru, Duncan",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Increasing institutional births rates and improving access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care are central strategies for reducing maternal and neonatal deaths globally. While some studies show women consider service availability when determining where to deliver, the dynamics of how and why institutional birth rates change as comprehensive emergency obstetric care availability increases are unclear. METHODS: In this pre-post intervention study, we surveyed two exhaustive samples of postpartum women before and after comprehensive emergency obstetric care implementation at a hospital in rural Nepal. We developed a logistic regression model of institutional birth factors through manual backward selection of all significant covariates within and across periods. Qualitatively, we analyzed birth stories through immersion crystallization. RESULTS: Institutional birth rates increased after comprehensive emergency obstetric care implementation (from 30 to 77%, OR 7.7) at both hospital (OR 2.5) and low-level facilities (OR 4.6, p < 0.01 for all). The logistic regression indicated that comprehensive emergency obstetric care availability (OR 5.6), belief that the hospital is the safest birth location (OR 44.8), safety prioritization in decision-making (OR 7.7), and higher income (OR 1.1) predict institutional birth (p <e2><89><a4> 0.01 for all). Qualitative analysis revealed comprehensive emergency obstetric care awareness, increased social expectation for institutional birth, and birth planning as important factors. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive emergency obstetric care expansion appears to have generated significant demand for institutional births through increased safety perceptions and birth planning. Increasing comprehensive emergency obstetric care availability increases birth safety, but it may also be a mechanism for increasing the institutional birth rate in areas of under-utilization.",2017,10.1186/s12884-017-1267-y,17,1,77,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Adult and Logistic Models and Global health and Nepal and Socioeconomic Factors and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Maternal mortality and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Health Facilities/statistics & numerical data and Rural Population/statistics & numerical data and Implementation research and Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data and Maternal Health Services/*statistics & numerical data and Rural Health Services/statistics & numerical data and *Birth Rate and Emergency Medical Services/methods/*statistics & numerical data and Institutional birth rate,NA,NA,2017/03/04/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kjaergaard_2007_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Experiences of non-progressive and augmented labour among nulliparous women: a qualitative interview study in a Grounded Theory approach,"Kjaergaard, Hanne and Foldgast, Anne Maria and Dykes, Anna-Karin",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Non-progressive labour is the most common complication in nulliparas and is primarily treated by augmentation. Augmented labour is often terminated by instrumental delivery. Little qualitative research has addressed experiences of non-progressive and augmented deliveries. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the experience of non-progressive and augmented labour among nulliparas and their experience of the care they received. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using individual interviews. Data was collected and analysed according to the Grounded Theory method. The participants were a purposive sample of ten women. The interviews were conducted 4-15 weeks after delivery. RESULTS: The women had contrasting experiences during the birth process. During labour there was a conflict between the expectation of having a natural delivery and actually having a medical delivery. The women experienced a feeling of separation between mind and body. Interacting with the midwife had a major influence on feelings of losing and regaining control. Reconciliation between the contrasting feelings during labour was achieved. The core category was named Dialectical Birth Process and comprised three categories: Balancing natural and medical delivery, Interacting, Losing and regaining control. CONCLUSION: A dialectical process was identified in these women's experiences of non-progressive labour. The process is susceptible to interaction with the midwife; especially her support to the woman's feeling of being in control. Midwives should secure that the woman's recognition of the fact that the labour is non-progressive and augmentation is required is handled with respect for the dialectical process. Augmentation of labour should be managed as close to the course of natural labour and delivery as possible.",2007,10.1186/1471-2393-7-15,7,NA,15,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Psychological Theory and Pregnancy and Patient Satisfaction and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Nurse-Patient Relations and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Midwifery/*methods and Models, Nursing and Labor Pain/nursing/psychology and Natural Childbirth/nursing/psychology and Obstetric Labor Complications/diagnosis/*nursing/*psychology and Parity/*physiology",NA,NA,2007/07/28/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Geelhoed_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,"Improving emergency obstetric care and reversing the underutilisation of vacuum extraction: a qualitative study of implementation in Tete Province, Mozambique","Geelhoed, D. and de Deus, V. and Sitoe, M. and Matsinhe, O. and Lampiao Cardoso, M. I. and Manjate, C. V. and Pinto Matsena, P. I. and Mosse Lazaro, C.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Maternal and perinatal mortality in Mozambique were declining at a slow pace, despite progress in coverage of institutional childbirth. Implementation of quality emergency obstetric care including vacuum extraction remained inadequate. In 2015-2017, Tete Province achieved remarkable progress in improving emergency obstetric care and reversing the underutilisation of vacuum extraction, with encouraging results for maternal and perinatal outcomes, despite severe resource constraints. This paper presents the experience of Tete Province, generating a rich, contextualised understanding, which might provide generalizable insights and lessons. METHODS: This qualitative study design is used to present Tete's experience in improving emergency obstetric care and reversing the underutilisation of vacuum extraction, drawing on principles from implementation science and applying a systems thinking approach. Sources include routine data, documents, social media messages, and the lived experience of the authors, all intimately involved in the implementation process during 2014-2017. Iterative learning and analysis, involving all authors, led to the final interpretations. RESULTS: Within a context of severe resource constraints, Tete applied 4 interventions (training, accreditation, audit, monitoring and evaluation with feedback) to improve the implementation of emergency obstetric care. Considerable progress was achieved in vacuum extraction and other signal functions of emergency obstetric care and in the decision-making process for caesarean sections, contributing to important reductions in the provincial institutional maternal mortality and stillbirth rates. Facilitating factors include attributes of the vacuum extraction itself, of the structural and organisational environments in which it was introduced, of the people involved in implementation, and of the process through which the implementation was rolled-out. CONCLUSIONS: The lessons from implementation science and systems thinking can contribute to surprising results in the improvement of emergency obstetric care including the use of vacuum extraction, even in a severely resource-constrained setting. The creation of conditions for real change, with empowerment of the staff and managers at the front-line of day-to-day practice in Tete may inspire others in similar conditions and circumstances. The underutilisation of vacuum extraction in middle- and low-income countries is indeed a missed opportunity. Its reversion is possible and provides a good chance to make considerable difference in maternal and perinatal outcomes.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1901-3,18,1,266,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Maternal mortality and Infant, Newborn and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and Quality of Health Care/*standards and Emergency obstetric care and Mozambique and Delivery, Obstetric/standards/statistics & numerical data and Emergency Medical Services/methods/*standards and Maternal Health Services/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Perinatal Mortality and Stillbirth and Vacuum extraction and Vacuum Extraction, Obstetrical/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/06/27/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Women's awareness regarding the use of epidurals is increasing. As the decision to use epidural analgesia during labour is affected by many social, personal and medical factors, this study aimed to explore the factors contributing to a pregnant women's decision to use epidurals and to understand the benefit of implementing a health education program regarding epidural analgesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with primigravid women visiting the Obstetric Clinics for their routine antenatal care at King Abdul-Aziz Medical City in Riyadh from October 2014 to December 2016. The participating pregnant women were educated on the use of epidural analgesia during labour by a professional health educator utilizing specially designed educational materials. We assessed the relationship between the women's decision to request epidural analgesia and their age, place of residence, occupation, income and education level using a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 81 primigravid women were included in the study. Employed pregnant women were more likely to request epidural analgesia than non-employed women (46.7% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.019). After education, significantly more pregnant women were planning to request epidurals (mean score for answers before education was 2.12 <c2><b1> 0.578 vs. 2.27 <c2><b1> 0.592 after education, P = 0.013). Other variables, such as age, level of education, income and place of residence were not significantly associated with the participants' decision to request epidural analgesia. CONCLUSION: Health education on epidural analgesia is an important factor in increasing primigravid women's desire to request epidural analgesia.

Flanagan_2019_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,"Listening to women's voices: the experience of giving birth with paramedic care in Queensland, Australia","Flanagan, Belinda and Lord, Bill and Reed, Rachel and Crimmins, Gail",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Unplanned out-of-hospital birth is generally assumed to occur for women who are multiparous, have a history of a short pushing phase of labour or are experiencing a precipitate birth. However, there is little research that examines the woman's perspective regarding factors that influenced their decision on when to access care. This research aimed to explore women's experience of unplanned out-of-hospital birth in paramedic care. Due to the size of the data in the larger study of 'Women's experience of unplanned out-of-hospital birth in paramedic care' [1], this paper will deal directly with the women's narrative concerning her decision to access care and how previous birth experience and interactions with other healthcare professionals influenced her experience. METHOD: Narrative inquiry, underpinned from a feminist perspective, was used to guide the research. Twenty-two women who had experienced an unplanned out-of-hospital birth within the last 5 years in Queensland, Australia engaged in this research. RESULTS: The decision of a woman in labour to attend hospital to birth her baby is influenced by information received from healthcare providers, fear of unnecessary medical intervention in birth, and previous birth experience. All themes and subthemes that emerged in the women's narratives relate to the notion of birth knowledge. These specifically include perceptions of what constitutes authoritative knowledge, who possesses the authoritative knowledge on which actions are based, and when and how women use their own embodied knowledge to assess the validity of healthcare workers' advice and the necessity for clinical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The women interviewed communicated a tension between women's knowledge, beliefs and experience of the birth process, and the professional models of care traditionally associated with the hospital environment. It is essential that information provided to women antenatally is comprehensive and comprehensible. The decisions women make concerning their birth plan represent the women's expectations for their birth and this should be used as a means to openly communicate issues that may impact the birth experience.",2019,10.1186/s12884-019-2613-z,19,1,490,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Time Factors and Geography and Trust and Pregnancy and Parity and Qualitative Research and Organizational Policy and Patient Acceptance of Health Care and Narration and Labor, Obstetric and *Decision Making and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Emergency Medical Services and Queensland and Midwifery and *Parturition and Narrative inquiry and *Birth Setting and Birth before arrival and Help-Seeking Behavior and Unplanned and women's perspective",NA,NA,2019/12/20/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Declercq_2020_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Maternal perceptions of the experience of attempted labor induction and medically elective inductions: analysis of survey results from listening to mothers in California,"Declercq, Eugene and Belanoff, Candice and Iverson, Ronald",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: The rate of induction of labor in the U.S. has risen from 9.6% in 1990 to 25.7% in 2018, including 31.7% of first-time births. Recent studies that have examined inductions have been small qualitative studies or relied on either medical records or administrative data. This study examines induction from the perspective of those women who experienced it, with a particular focus on the prevalence and predictors of inductions for nonmedical indications, women's experience of pressure to induce labor and the relationship between the attempt to medically initiate labor and cesarean section. METHODS: Study data are drawn from the 2119 respondents to the Listening to Mothers in California survey who were planning to have a vaginal birth in 2016. Mothers were asked if there had been an attempt to medically initiate labor, if it actually started labor, if they felt pressured to have the induction, if they had a cesarean and the reason for the induction. Reasons for induction were classified as either medically indicated or elective. RESULTS: Almost half (47%) of our respondents indicated an attempt was made to medically induce their labor, and 71% of those attempts initiated labor. More than a third of the attempts (37%) were elective. Attempted induction overall was most strongly associated with giving birth at 41+ weeks (aOR 3.28; 95% C.I. 2.21-4.87). Elective inductions were more likely among multiparous mothers and in pregnancies at 39 or 40 weeks. The perception of being pressured to have labor induced was related to higher levels of education, maternal preference for less medical intervention in birth, having an obstetrician compared to a midwife and gestational ages of 41+ weeks. Cesarean birth was more likely in the case of overall induction (aOR 1.51; 95% C.I. 1.11-2.07) and especially following a failed attempt at labor induction (aOR 4.50; 95% C.I. 2.93-6.90). CONCLUSION: Clinicians counselling mothers concerning the need for labor induction should be aware of mothers' perceptions about birth and engage in true shared decision making in order to avoid the maternal perception of being pressured into labor induction.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-03137-x,20,1,458,eng,1471-2393,"California and Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Cesarean section and Pregnancy and Self Report and *Attitude to Health and Mothers/*psychology and Cesarean Section/*psychology and Elective induction and Labor induction and Labor, Induced/*psychology and Listening to mothers",NA,NA,2020/08/12/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

The tools available for simulation-based training have developed rapidly over the past 15 years. There is an increasing range of manikins and part-task trainers - devices that permit selected elements of a skill or task to be practised independently of a whole-body manikin. Those interested in simulation have also focused significantly on adult learning theory to ensure that the training offered through simulation is appropriate, effective and complementary to other educational approaches. By mapping simulated scenarios to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Curriculum for General Paediatric Training at Level 1, the authors have developed two complementary courses aimed at preparing the general paediatric trainee for progression to the middle grade role.

METHODS: In this register-based descriptive study, we used patient administration systems to identify women who had given birth at two Danish hospitals between March 2013 and January 2015. We then linked this information with the hospital database for fetal medicine (Astraia) to identify women who did not attend the malformation scan at week 18-20. We reviewed the medical records of these women to validate the data and to identify the reason for non-participation. RESULTS: Of 7690 births, 153 (2%) women did not attend the malformation scan. The main reason for non-participation was a passive deselection (81%). Most of these women were not present in Denmark at the time of the malformation scan (61%) and few women declined (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Less than 2% of a birth cohort in two major hospitals in Denmark did not attend the free offer of a malformation scan. Most of these women (81%) did not actively decide against the malformation scan. Very few (0.2%) declined the malformation scan.

Milne_2009_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Developing and pre-testing a decision board to facilitate informed choice about delivery approach in uncomplicated pregnancy,"Milne, Jill and Gafni, Amiram and Lu, Diane and Wood, Stephen and Sauve, Reg and Ross, Sue",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: The rate of caesarean sections is increasing worldwide, yet medical literature informing women with uncomplicated pregnancies about relative risks and benefits of elective caesarean section (CS) compared with vaginal delivery (VD) remains scarce. A decision board may address this gap, providing systematic evidence-based information so that patients can more fully understand their treatment options. The objective of our study was to design and pre-test a decision board to guide clinical discussions and enhance informed decision-making related to delivery approach (CS or VD) in uncomplicated pregnancy. METHODS: Development of the decision board involved two preliminary studies to determine women's preferred mode of risk presentation and a systematic literature review for the most comprehensive presentation of medical risks at the time (VD and CS). Forty women were recruited to pre-test the tool. Eligible subjects were of childbearing age (18-40 years) but were not pregnant in order to avoid raising the expectation among pregnant women that CS was a universally available birth option. Women selected their preferred delivery approach and completed the Decisional Conflict Scale to measure decisional uncertainty before and after reviewing the decision board. They also answered open-ended questions reflecting what they had learned, whether or not the information had helped them to choose between birth methods, and additional information that should be included. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse sample characteristics and women's choice of delivery approach pre/post decision board. Change in decisional conflict was measured using Wilcoxon's sign rank test for each of the three subscales. RESULTS: The majority of women reported that they had learned something new (n = 37, 92%) and that the tool had helped them make a hypothetical choice between delivery approaches (n = 34, 85%). Women wanted more information about neonatal risks and personal experiences. Decisional uncertainty decreased (p < 0.001) and perceived effectiveness of decisions increased (p < 0.001) post-intervention. CONCLUSION: Non-pregnant women of childbearing age were positive about the decision board and stated their hypothetical delivery choices were informed by risk presentation, but wanted additional information about benefits and experiences.

Shimoda_2015_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Midwives' intrapartum monitoring process and management resulting in emergency referrals in Tanzania: a qualitative study,"Shimoda, Kana and Leshabari, Sebalda and Horiuchi, Shigeko and Shimpuku, Yoko and Tashiro, Junko",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: In the United Republic of Tanzania, the maternal mortality ratio, and neonatal mortality rate have remained high for the last 10 years. It is well documented that many complications of pregnancy are avoidable by providing skilled midwifery care during and immediately after childbirth. However, there have been delays in providing timely and necessary obstetric interventions, most likely due to lack of proper monitoring during labor. Yet, there has been little research concerning how midwives monitor the process of childbirth. Therefore, this study aimed to describe how midwives monitored and managed the process of childbirth to achieve early consulting and timely referral to obstetricians. METHODS: The design was qualitative and descriptive, using data from comprehensive semi-structured interviews of midwives. The interviews were conducted at one hospital and one health center in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. Eleven participants were purposively recruited and interviewed about their experiences managing complicated intrapartum cases. After the interviews, data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Derived from the data were three activity phases: initial encounter, monitoring, and acting. During these phases, midwives noticed danger signs, identified problems, revised and confirmed initial problem identification, and organized for medical intervention or referral. The timing of taking action was different for each midwife and depended on the nature of the prolonged and obstructed labor case. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of midwives, the processing of assessments and judgments was brief and without reflection, and only a few midwives took time to continue to monitor the labor after the initial identification of problems and before taking actions. To make a final judgment that the labor was becoming prolonged or obstructed, midwives should consider taking time to review and synthesize all their findings.",2015,10.1186/s12884-015-0691-0,15,NA,248,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Decision Making and Tanzania and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Referral and Consultation and Monitoring, Physiologic and Emergencies and *Developing Countries and Midwifery/*methods and Heart Rate, Fetal and Dystocia/*diagnosis/therapy and Fetal Monitoring and Labor Stage, First/*physiology and Parturition/*physiology and Pelvis/anatomy & histology",NA,NA,2015/10/08/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nahar_2011_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Women-focused development intervention reduces delays in accessing emergency obstetric care in urban slums in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study,"Nahar, Shamsun and Banu, Morsheda and Nasreen, Hashima E.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Recognizing the burden of maternal mortality in urban slums, in 2007 BRAC (formally known as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) has established a woman-focused development intervention, Manoshi (the Bangla abbreviation of mother, neonate and child), in urban slums of Bangladesh. The intervention emphasizes strengthening the continuum of maternal, newborn and child care through community, delivery centre (DC) and timely referral of the obstetric complications to the emergency obstetric care (EmOC) facilities. This study aimed to assess whether Manoshi DCs reduces delays in accessing EmOC. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during October 2008 to January 2009 in the slums of Dhaka city among 450 obstetric complicated cases referred either from DCs of Manoshi or from their home to the EmOC facilities. Trained female interviewers interviewed at their homestead with structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square test, t-test and Mann-Whitney test were performed. RESULTS: The median time for making the decision to seek care was significantly longer among women who were referred from home than referred from DCs (9.7 hours vs. 5.0 hours, p < 0.001). The median time to reach a facility and to receive treatment was found to be similar in both groups. Time taken to decide to seek care was significantly shorter in the case of life-threatening complications among those who were referred from DC than home (0.9 hours vs.2.3 hours, p = 0.002). Financial assistance from Manoshi significantly reduced the first delay in accessing EmOC services for life-threatening complications referred from DC (p = 0.006). Reasons for first delay include fear of medical intervention, inability to judge maternal condition, traditional beliefs and financial constraints. Role of gender was found to be an important issue in decision making. First delay was significantly higher among elderly women, multiparity, non life-threatening complications and who were not involved in income-generating activities. CONCLUSIONS: Manoshi program reduces the first delay for life-threatening conditions but not non-life-threatening complications even though providing financial assistance. Programme should give more emphasis on raising awareness through couple/family-based education about maternal complications and dispel fear of clinical care to accelerate seeking EmOC.",2011,10.1186/1471-2393-11-11,11,NA,11,eng,1471-2393,"Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Developing Countries and Cross-Sectional Studies and Time Factors and Pregnancy and Program Evaluation and Interviews as Topic and Referral and Consultation and Chi-Square Distribution and Community Health Workers and Statistics, Nonparametric and Urban Population and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Bangladesh and Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data and Midwifery and Maternal Health Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data and *Poverty Areas and House Calls/statistics & numerical data and Obstetric Labor Complications/therapy and Office Visits/statistics & numerical data and Pregnancy Complications/therapy",NA,NA,2011/01/30/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Anonymous population-based postmortem physician survey. SETTING: Flanders, Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians signing death certificates of all patients aged 1-17 years who died between June 2007 and November 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attitudes towards physician-assisted death in minors and actual end-of-life practices in the deaths concerned. RESULTS: 124 physicians for 70.5% of eligible cases (N=149) responded. 69% favour an extension of the Belgian law on euthanasia to include minors, 26.6% think this should be done by establishing clear age limits and 61% think parental consent is required before taking life-shortening decisions. Cluster analysis yielded a cluster (67.7% of physicians) accepting of, and a cluster (32.2% of physicians) reluctant towards physician-assisted death in minors. Controlling for physician specialty and patient characteristics, acceptant physicians were more likely to engage in practices with the intention of shortening a patient's life than were reluctant physicians. CONCLUSION: A majority of surveyed Flemish physicians appear to accept physician-assisted dying in children under certain circumstances and favour an amendment to the euthanasia law to include minors. The approach favoured is one of assessing decision-making capacity rather than setting arbitrary age limits.

RESULTS: When compared by specialty, paediatricians' models for decision 1 were more likely to include level of alertness as a cue (54% vs 16%); for decision 2 they were more likely to include presence of crepitations (49% vs 16%) and less likely to include inhaled CS (8% vs 40%), respiratory rate (0% vs 24%) and air entry (70% vs 100%). When compared to other grades, the models derived for decision 3 by consultants/general practitioners were more likely to include wheeze severity as a cue (39% vs 6%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians differed in their use of individual cues and the number included in their models. Patient safety and quality of care will benefit from clarification of decision-making strategies as general learning points during medical training, in the development of guidelines and care pathways, and by clinicians developing self-awareness of their own preferences.",2007,10.1136/adc.2007.117424,92,8,672-677,eng,1468-2044 0003-9888,"Humans and Adolescent and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Attitude of Health Personnel and Linear Models and *Decision Making and *Judgment and Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use and Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data and Cues and Northern Ireland and Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use and Asthma/diagnosis/*therapy and Pediatrics/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2007/08//undefined,Arch Dis Child,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 550 EPs who had taken the course during the previous 6 years; the EPs were also asked to give a copy of the questionnaire to nurses on their staff. Data were collected on experience of parental presence during child CPR, opinions on the practice, arguments for and against parental presence, and the moral positions of respondents regarding their perception of life and the sharing of medical/parental power in the decision-making process. RESULTS: 343 responses were analysed, 47% from EPs (29% response rate) and 53% from nurses. 52% of respondents had experienced parental presence during child CPR, but it had been the physician's wish on only 6% of these occasions. Only 17% of respondents favoured parental presence, with EPs (27%) being favourable more often than nurses (12%). The reasons against parental presence were psychological trauma for the parents, risk of interference with medical management, and care team stress. Respondents not in favour of parental presence expressed this view more for medical reasons than for parent-related reasons. The physicians not in favour of parental presence espoused a moral position predicated on medical power. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of EPs and nurses were reluctant to have parents present during child CPR.

Monteiro_2019_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Reasons given by pregnant women for participating in a clinical trial aimed at preventing premature delivery: a qualitative analysis,"Monteiro, Thais M. and Katz, Leila and Bento, Silvana F. and Amorim, Melania M. and Moriel, Patricia C. and Pacagnella, Rodolfo C.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: In clinical trials, pregnant women are potentially vulnerable, and the fetus is exposed to the intervention. This study aimed to identify the reasons that led pregnant women at a high risk of premature delivery to participate in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: The women participating in the main trial were contacted by telephone postpartum and invited to answer an open questionnaire in a cross-sectional study. Data were collected by telephone and analyzed using thematic analysis. After the analysis categories were defined, all the answers were reviewed, categorized and grouped. A descriptive summary of the content of each category was then made. RESULTS: Overall, 208 women from different geographical regions of the country agreed to participate. Four categories were identified: 1) The risk of losing the baby; 2) A previous experience of premature delivery; 3) The role of the doctor and other health professionals, and 4) The availability of quality medical care and free medication. The main reason given for agreeing to participate was to reduce the risks associated with the baby being born prematurely, particularly when the woman herself or someone close to her had already experienced premature delivery. Other reasons were having received clear guidance and explanations from the doctor regarding prematurity and about the study and being given the opportunity to receive free treatment with greater access to the public healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to participate in a clinical trial is not easy, particularly when the individual is vulnerable and in a critical situation as in the case of a pregnant woman at a high risk of delivering prematurely. Fears and uncertainties regarding the pregnancy outcome, as well as the woman's previous experiences and her awareness of the actual risks she faces will affect her decision regarding whether or not to participate. Recruitment challenges could be overcome by ensuring that the research team provides adequate information and support, thus creating a bond with participants that would foster a sense of safety and trust in the study proposals.",2019,10.1186/s12884-019-2240-8,19,1,97,eng,1471-2393,Humans and Female and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Clinical trial and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Research Subjects/*psychology and Clinical Trials as Topic/*psychology and Premature Birth/prevention & control/*psychology and Premature delivery,NA,NA,2019/03/20/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Prentice_2016_Arofdiinch,JOUR,Moral distress within neonatal and paediatric intensive care units: a systematic review,"Prentice, Trisha and Janvier, Annie and Gillam, Lynn and Davis, Peter G.",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on moral distress experienced by nursing and medical professionals within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs). DESIGN: Pubmed, EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and Medline) and Scopus were searched using the terms neonat*, infant*, pediatric*, prematur* or preterm AND (moral distress OR moral responsibility OR moral dilemma OR conscience OR ethical confrontation) AND intensive care. RESULTS: 13 studies on moral distress published between January 1985 and March 2015 met our inclusion criteria. Fewer than half of those studies (6) were multidisciplinary, with a predominance of nursing staff responses across all studies. The most common themes identified were overly 'burdensome' and disproportionate use of technology perceived not to be in a patient's best interest, and powerlessness to act. Concepts of moral distress are expressed differently within nursing and medical literature. In nursing literature, nurses are often portrayed as victims, with physicians seen as the perpetrators instigating 'aggressive care'. Within medical literature moral distress is described in terms of dilemmas or ethical confrontations. CONCLUSIONS: Moral distress affects the care of patients in the NICU and PICU. Empirical data on multidisciplinary populations remain sparse, with inconsistent definitions and predominantly small sample sizes limiting generalisability of studies.

Prosser_2018_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Factors promoting or inhibiting normal birth,"Prosser, Samantha J. and Barnett, Adrian G. and Miller, Yvette D.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: In response to rising rates of medical intervention in birth, there has been increased international interest in promoting normal birth (without induction of labour, epidural/spinal/general anaesthesia, episiotomy, forceps/vacuum, or caesarean section). However, there is limited evidence for how best to achieve increased rates of normal birth. In this study we examined the role of modifiable and non-modifiable factors in experiencing a normal birth using retrospective, self-reported data. METHODS: Women who gave birth over a four-month period in Queensland, Australia, were invited to complete a questionnaire about their preferences for and experiences of pregnancy, labour, birth, and postnatal care. Responses (N = 5840) were analysed using multiple logistic regression models to identify associations with four aspects of normal birth: onset of labour, use of anaesthesia, mode of birth, and use of episiotomy. The probability of normal birth was then estimated by combining these models. RESULTS: Overall, 28.7% of women experienced a normal birth. Probability of a normal birth was reduced for women who were primiparous, had a history of caesarean, had a multiple pregnancy, were older, had a more advanced gestational age, experienced pregnancy-related health conditions (gestational diabetes, low-lying placenta, high blood pressure), had continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour, and knew only some of their care providers for labour and birth. Women had a higher probability of normal birth if they lived outside major metropolitan areas, did not receive private obstetric care, had freedom of movement throughout labour, received continuity of care in labour and birth, did not have an augmented labour, or gave birth in a non-supine position. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight several relevant modifiable factors including mobility, monitoring, and care provision during labour and birth, for increasing normal birth opportunity. An important step forward in promoting normal birth is increasing awareness of such relationships through patient involvement in informed decision-making and implementation of this evidence in care guidelines.",2018,10.1186/s12884-018-1871-5,18,1,241,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Retrospective Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Risk Factors and Australia and Pregnancy and Queensland and *Labor, Obstetric and Normal birth and Delivery, Obstetric/*statistics & numerical data and Midwifery-led care and Patient-reported data and Perinatal Care/statistics & numerical data and Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology and Spontaneous labour and Vaginal birth",NA,NA,2018/06/18/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Case notes for 318 children with joint hypermobility attending a rheumatology clinic were reviewed for clinical presentation, medical history, psychosocial factors and physical examination findings. Seven key variables were extracted and used as indicator variables in a latent class analysis to estimate the presence and number of subgroups of children with symptomatic joint hypermobility. RESULTS: Two subgroups with differing clinical presentations were identified accounting for age and gender: an 'athletic-persistent' class (62%) characterised by higher probabilities for recurrent and chronic musculoskeletal pain, and less severe hypermobility; and a 'systemic-profound' class (38%) characterised by generalised hypermobility, recurrent musculoskeletal pain, gastro-oesophageal reflux and motor delay.

Cunningham_2017_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Expect With Me: development and evaluation design for an innovative model of group prenatal care to improve perinatal outcomes,"Cunningham, Shayna D. and Lewis, Jessica B. and Thomas, Jordan L. and Grilo, Stephanie A. and Ickovics, Jeannette R.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Despite biomedical advances and intervention efforts, rates of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes in the United States have remained relatively intransigent. Evidence suggests that group prenatal care can reduce these risks, with implications for maternal and child health as well as substantial cost savings. However, widespread dissemination presents challenges, in part because training and health systems have not been designed to deliver care in a group setting. This manuscript describes the design and evaluation of Expect With Me, an innovative model of group prenatal care with a strong integrated information technology (IT) platform designed to be scalable nationally. METHODS/DESIGN: Expect With Me follows clinical guidelines from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Expect With Me incorporates the best evidence-based features of existing models of group care with a novel integrated IT platform designed to improve patient engagement and support, enhance health behaviors and decision making, connect providers and patients, and improve health service delivery. A multisite prospective longitudinal cohort study is being conducted to examine the impact of Expect With Me on perinatal and postpartum outcomes, and to identify and address barriers to national scalability. Process and outcome evaluation will include quantitative and qualitative data collection at patient, provider, and organizational levels. Mixed-method data collection includes patient surveys, medical record reviews, patient focus groups; provider surveys, session evaluations, provider focus groups and in-depth interviews; an online tracking system; and clinical site visits. A two-to-one matched cohort of women receiving individual care from each site will provide a comparison group (n = 1,000 Expect With Me patients; n = 2,000 individual care patients) for outcome and cost analyses. DISCUSSION: By bundling prevention and care services into a high-touch, high-tech group prenatal care model, Expect With Me has the potential to result in fundamental changes to the health care system to meet the ""triple aim:"" better healthcare quality, improved outcomes, and lower costs. Findings from this study will be used to optimize the dissemination and effectiveness of this model. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02169024 .

Carbillon_2020_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: a proposal for overcoming some of the controversies,"Carbillon, Lionel and Benbara, Amelie and Tigaizin, Ahmed and Murtada, Rouba and Fermaut, Marion and Belmaghni, Fatma and Bricou, Alexandre and Boujenah, Jeremy",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: The debate surrounding the management of term breech presentation has excessively focused on the mode of delivery. Indeed, a steady decline in the rate of vaginal breech delivery has been observed over the last three decades, and the soundness of the vaginal route was seriously challenged at the beginning of the 2000s. However, associations between adverse perinatal outcomes and antenatal risk factors have been observed in foetuses that remain in the breech presentation in late gestation, confirming older data and raising the question of the role of these antenatal risk factors in adverse perinatal outcomes. Thus, aspects beyond the mode of delivery must be considered regarding the awareness and adequate management of such situations in term breech pregnancies. MAIN BODY: In the context of the most recent meta-analysis and with the publication of large-scale epidemiologic studies from medical birth registries in countries that have not abruptly altered their criteria for individual decision-making regarding the breech delivery mode, the currently available data provide essential clues to understanding the underlying maternal-foetal conditions beyond the delivery mode that play a role in perinatal outcomes, such as foetal growth restriction and gestational diabetes mellitus. In view of such data, an accurate evaluation of these underlying conditions is necessary in cases of persistent term breech presentation. Timely breech detection, estimated foetal weight/growth curves and foetal/maternal well-being should be considered along with these possible antenatal risk factors; a thorough analysis of foetal presentation and an evaluation of the possible benefit of external cephalic version and pelvic adequacy in each specific situation of persistent breech presentation should be performed. CONCLUSION: The adequate management of term breech pregnancies requires screening and the efficient identification of breech presentation at 36 weeks of gestation, followed by thorough evaluations of foetal weight, growth and mobility, while obstetric history, antenatal gestational disorders and pelvis size/conformation are considered. The management plan, including external cephalic version and follow-up based on the maternal/foetal condition and potentially associated disorders, should be organized on a case-by-case basis by a skilled team after the woman is informed and helped to make a reasoned decision regarding delivery route.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-2831-4,20,1,263,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Infant, Newborn and Cesarean Section and Infant, Small for Gestational Age and Delivery, Obstetric/*methods and Perinatal mortality and Breech Presentation/*therapy and Delivery route and Foetal growth restriction and Oligohydramnios and Pelvimetry and Perinatal morbidity and Pregnancy Trimester, Third and Severe maternal morbidity and Small-for-gestational-age and Term breech delivery and Version, Fetal",NA,NA,2020/05/03/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yount_2020_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,The Reproductive Agency Scale (RAS-17): development and validation in a cross-sectional study of pregnant Qatari and non-Qatari Arab Women,"Yount, Kathryn M. and James-Hawkins, Laurie and Abdul Rahim, Hanan F.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 prioritizes women's empowerment and gender equality, alone and as drivers of other SDGs. Efforts to validate universal measures of women's empowerment have eclipsed efforts to develop refined measures in local contexts and lifecycle stages. Measures of women's empowerment across the reproductive lifecycle remain limited, including in the Arab Middle East. METHODS: In this sequential, mixed-methods study, we developed and validated the Reproductive Agency Scale 17 (RAS-17) in 684 women having a normal pregnancy and receiving prenatal care at Hamad Medical Corporation in Doha, Qatar. Participants varied in age (19-46 years), trimester, gravidity (M3.3[SD2.1], range 1-14), and parity (M2.1[SD1.5], range 0-7). Using qualitative research and questionnaire reviews, we developed 44 pregnancy-specific and non-pregnancy-specific agency items. We performed exploratory then confirmatory factor analyses (EFA/CFA) in random split-half samples and multiple-group CFA to assess measurement invariance of the scale across Qatari (n = 260) and non-Qatari Arab (n = 342) women. RESULTS: Non-Qatari women agreed more strongly than Qatari women that every woman should have university education, and working outside home benefitted women. Qatari women agreed more strongly than non-Qatari women that a woman should be free to sell her property. Qatari women reported more influence than non-Qatari women in decisions about spending their money (M4.6 versus M4.4), food they can eat (M4.4 versus M4.2), and rest during pregnancy (M4.5 versus M4.2). Qatari and non-Qatari women typically reported going most places with permission if accompanied. A 17-item, three-factor model measuring women's intrinsic agency or awareness of economic rights (5 items) and instrumental agency in decision-making (5 items) and freedom of movement (7 items) had good fit and was partially invariant across groups. CONCLUSIONS: The RAS-17 is a contextual, multidimensional measure of women's reproductive agency validated in pregnant Qatari and non-Qatari Arab women. This scale integrates pregnancy-specific and non-pregnancy-specific items in dimensions of intrinsic agency and instrumental agency relevant to Arab women of reproductive age. The RAS-17 may be useful to screen for low reproductive agency as a predictor of maternal and perinatal outcomes. The RAS-17 should be validated in other samples to assess its full applicability across the reproductive life cycle.",2020,10.1186/s12884-020-03205-2,20,1,503,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Pregnancy and Self Report and Qatar and Pregnant Women/*psychology and *Empowerment and *Maternal Behavior and Arabs and Factor analysis, measurement invariance and Perinatal period and Scale validation, women's empowerment and women's agency",NA,NA,2020/09/01/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

SETTING: Tertiary care facilities for childhood cancer. RESULTS: Families are generally supportive of tissue banking, although they report that it may be difficult for them to consider all the implications when asked for consent. They typically do not want detailed information when consent is sought close to diagnosis, preferring to see tissue banking as part of routine practice. Families often recognise that their consent may not be fully informed, but are content to give consent based on their understanding at the time. Some may want a chance to go over the information and revisit their decision when things have settled.

Alavifard_2019_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Derivation and validation of a model predicting the likelihood of vaginal birth following labour induction,"Alavifard, Sepand and Meier, Kennedy and Shulman, Yonatan and Tomlinson, George and D'Souza, Rohan",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: There is high-quality evidence supporting induction of labour (IOL) for a number of maternal and fetal indications. However, one fifth of inductions fail to result in vaginal births, requiring cesarean deliveries. This has negative clinical, emotional and resource implications. The importance of predicting the success of labour induction to enable shared decision-making has been recognized, but existing models are limited in scope and generalizability. Our objective was to derive and internally validate a clinical prediction model that uses variables readily accessible through maternal demographic data, antenatal history, and cervical examination to predict the likelihood of vaginal birth following IOL. METHODS: Data was extracted from electronic medical records of consecutive pregnant women who were induced between April and December 2016, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed using 16 readily accessible variables identified through literature review and expert opinion, as predictors of vaginal birth after IOL. The final model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Of the 1123 cases of IOL, 290 (25.8%) resulted in a cesarean delivery. The multivariable logistic regression model found maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and weight, weight at delivery, and cervical dilation at time of induction as significant predictors of vaginal delivery following IOL. The prediction model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow <cf><87>2 = 5.02, p = 0.76) and demonstrated good discriminatory ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, 0.81 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.83)). Finally, the model showed good internal validity [AUROC 0.77 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.82)]. CONCLUSIONS: We have derived and internally validated a well-performing clinical prediction model for IOL in a large and diverse population using variables readily accessible through maternal demographic data, antenatal history, and cervical examination. Once prospectively validated in diverse settings, and if shown to be acceptable to pregnant women and healthcare providers as well as clinically and cost-effective, this model has potential for widespread use in clinical practice and research for enhancing patient autonomy, improving induction outcomes, and optimizing allocation of resources.",2019,10.1186/s12884-019-2232-8,19,1,130,eng,1471-2393,"Humans and Female and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Logistic Models and Multivariate Analysis and Pregnancy and Parity and Body Mass Index and Predictive Value of Tests and Area Under Curve and ROC Curve and Likelihood Functions and *Models, Statistical and Maternal Age and Obstetrics/*methods and Induction of labour and Labor Stage, First and Vaginal birth and Delivery, Obstetric/methods/*statistics & numerical data and Labor, Induced/*statistics & numerical data and Prediction tool and Successful induction",NA,NA,2019/04/16/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Not all are approached for donation, and experiences of those parents are not well understood. The objective was to investigate to what extent organ and tissue donation (OTD) is discussed as part of end-of-life care and to explore parents' and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences. DESIGN: A retrospective qualitative study. SETTING: Multicentre study with participants recruited through two neonatal intensive care units (ICUs), two paediatric ICUs, a cardiac ICU and a children's hospice. PATIENTS: Bereaved parents, parents of a child with a long-term condition (LTC) and HCPs. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents' and HCPs' views and experiences of discussions about OTD. RESULTS: 24 parents of 20 children were interviewed: 21 bereaved parents and 3 parents of a child with a LTC. Seven parents were asked about donation (13 not asked), four agreed and two donated. 41 HCPs were interviewed. Themes: complexity of donation process, OTD as a coping strategy, the importance of asking, difficulty of raising the topic,\ and parents' assumptions about health of organs (when donation is not discussed). CONCLUSIONS: The findings add new knowledge about parents' assumptions about the value of their child's organs when discussions about OTD are not raised, and that HCPs do not routinely ask, are sometimes hesitant to ask in fear of damaging relationships, and the reality of the complexity of the donation process.

Sutherland_2019_Arofdiinch,JOUR,Exploring the human factors of prescribing errors in paediatric intensive care units,"Sutherland, Adam and Ashcroft, Darren M. and Phipps, Denham L.",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the factors contributing to prescribing error in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) using a human factors approach based on Reason's theory of error causation to support planning of interventions to mitigate slips and lapses, rules-based mistakes and knowledge-based mistakes. METHODS: A hierarchical task analysis (HTA) of prescribing was conducted using documentary analysis. Eleven semistructured interviews with prescribers were conducted using vignettes and were analysed using template analysis. Contributory factors were identified through the interviews and were related to tasks in the HTA by an expert panel involving a PICU clinician, nurse and pharmacist. RESULTS: Prescribing in PICU is composed of 30 subtasks. Our findings indicate that cognitive burden was the main contributory factor of prescribing error. This manifested in two ways: physical, associated with fatigue, distraction and interruption, and poor information transfer; and psychological, related to inexperience, changing workload and insufficient decision support information. Physical burden was associated with errors of omission or selection; psychological burden was linked to errors related to a lack of knowledge and/or awareness. Social control through nursing staff was the only identified control step. This control was dysfunctional at times as nurses were part of an informal mechanism to support decision making, was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive burden on prescribers is the principal latent factor contributing to prescribing error. This research suggests that interventions relating to skill mix, and communication and presentation of information may be effective at mitigating rule and knowledge-based mistakes.

Children with a chronic illness had a better understanding of the concept of dosing of medicines (40% vs 23%) and placebo (34% vs 20%). They were more likely to support children's involvement in clinical trials (51% vs 37%). The altruistic nature of children in both groups was similar. It was of concern, however, that 57-63% children would participate as healthy volunteers in a cancer drug trial. Both groups were able to differentiate between the different types of illnesses where it is appropriate to study medicines in children (86-89% for illness where there is no treatment; 34-40% for 'me-too' drugs).

Yakoob_2009_BMCpreandchi,JOUR,Reducing stillbirths: behavioural and nutritional interventions before and during pregnancy,"Yakoob, Mohammad Yawar and Menezes, Esme V. and Soomro, Tanya and Haws, Rachel A. and Darmstadt, Gary L. and Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"BACKGROUND: The vast majority of global stillbirths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and in many settings, the majority of stillbirths occur antenatally, prior to the onset of labour. Poor nutritional status, lack of antenatal care and a number of behaviours increase women's risk of stillbirth in many resource-poor settings. Interventions to reduce these risks could reduce the resulting burden of stillbirths, but the evidence for the impact of such interventions has not yet been comprehensively evaluated. METHODS: This second paper of a systematic review of interventions that could plausibly impact stillbirth rates covers 12 different interventions relating to behavioural and socially mediated risk factors, including exposures to harmful practices and substances, antenatal care utilisation and quality, and maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy. The search strategy reviewed indexed medical journals on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. If any eligible randomised controlled trials were identified that were published after the most recent Cochrane review, they were added to generate new meta-analyses. Interventions covered in this paper have a focus on low- and middle-income countries, both because of the large burden of stillbirths and because of the high prevalence of risk factors including maternal malnutrition and harmful environmental exposures. The reviews and studies belonging to these interventions were graded and conclusions derived about the evidence of benefit of these interventions. RESULTS: From a programmatic perspective, none of the interventions achieved clear evidence of benefit. Evidence for some socially mediated risk factors were identified, such as exposure to indoor air pollution and birth spacing, but still require the development of appropriate interventions. There is a need for additional studies on culturally appropriate behavioural interventions and clinical trials to increase smoking cessation and reduce exposure to smokeless tobacco. Balanced protein-energy supplementation was associated with reduced stillbirth rates, but larger well-designed trials are required to confirm findings. Peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation significantly reduces neural tube defects, yet no significant associated reductions in stillbirth rates have been documented. Evidence for other nutritional interventions including multiple micronutrient and Vitamin A supplementation is weak, suggesting the need for further research to assess potential of nutritional interventions to reduce stillbirths. CONCLUSION: Antenatal care is widely used in low- and middle-income countries, and provides a natural facility-based contact through which to provide or educate about many of the interventions we reviewed. The impact of broader socially mediated behaviors, such as fertility decision-making, access to antenatal care, and maternal diet and exposures like tobacco and indoor air pollution during pregnancy, are poorly understood, and further research and appropriate interventions are needed to test the association of these behaviours with stillbirth outcomes. For most nutritional interventions, larger randomised controlled trials are needed which report stillbirths disaggregated from composite perinatal mortality. Many antepartum stillbirths are potentially preventable in low- and middle-income countries, particularly through dietary and environmental improvement, and through improving the quality of antenatal care - particularly including diagnosis and management of high-risk pregnancies - that pregnant women receive.",2009,10.1186/1471-2393-9-S1-S3,9 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,S3,eng,1471-2393,"Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and Causality and Pregnancy and Dietary Supplements and Global Health and Stillbirth/*epidemiology and *Risk Reduction Behavior and Air Pollution, Indoor/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data and Birth Intervals/statistics & numerical data and Circumcision, Female/statistics & numerical data and Fetal Death/epidemiology/*prevention & control and Pregnancy Complications/prevention & control and Prenatal Care/*methods/*statistics & numerical data and Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Tobacco Use Cessation/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2009/05/07/,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NA,NA,NA,NA

PATIENTS AND METHOD: The authors carried out a prospective study. The authors included all parents whose consent was sought for their child to participate in the FRALLE 2000A protocol (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) at two centres. The parents were questioned twice by a qualified psychologist using a semidirected interview, 1 and 6 months after consent was sought. RESULTS: 43 first interviews were carried out. All the parents declared they were satisfied with the explanations provided by the physician. 35 (81%) parents felt that the information provided with the request for consent was appropriate. Eight (19%) parents did not realise that their child had been included in a research protocol. 16 (39%) parents did not understand the concept of randomisation. Half the parents could explain neither the aim of the clinical trial nor the potential benefit of inclusion to their child. Only one third of the parents were aware that they had an alternative. The principal factor underlying their decision, as stated by 29 parents (67%), was confidence in the medical team.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK National Health Service. PATIENTS: 3897 children with CHD requiring intervention, or resulting in death, before they were 1-year-old (1993-1995). MAIN OUTCOMES: Impact on study protocol, timeliness and findings of a multicentre study of survival and quality of life. RESULTS: The peer-reviewed study protocol was altered to accommodate ethics committee stipulations that researchers should not approach families directly with a request to participate and that the general practitioner's (GP) permission be sought before the local clinician could do so. Individual consent was required to confirm the vital status of participants and for future tracing of public death registrations. Local study registration took a median of 40 weeks (IQR 25-57). 180 (24%) of 739 surviving children (five centres) could not be contacted because their GP was untraceable (32), had changed (128) or considered contact inappropriate (20). Invitations could not be sent to 31% from the most deprived compared with 17% from the least deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS: Decision making concerning childhood interventions should be influenced by evidence on long-term outcomes. However, current UK research regulations hinder follow-up in multicentre studies. Stipulations preventing researchers contacting families directly with research invitations appear disproportionate to the risks, impede equitable access to research opportunities and introduce bias.

METHOD: A convenience sample of patients' prescribed at least one new long-term (>6 weeks) medicine were recruited from a single UK paediatric hospital out-patient pharmacy.A face-to-face semi-structured questionnaire was administered to participants when they presented with their prescription. The questionnaire included the following themes: names of the medicines, therapeutic indication, dose regimen, duration of treatment and adverse effects.The results were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2013. RESULTS: One hundred participants consented and were included in the study. One hundred and forty-five medicines were prescribed in total. Participants were able to recall the names of 96 (66%) medicines and were aware of the therapeutic indication for 142 (97.9%) medicines. The dose regimen was accurately described for 120 (82.8%) medicines with the duration of treatment known for 132 (91%). Participants mentioned that they had been advised about side effects for 44 (30.3%) medicines. Specific counselling points recommended by the BNFc1, were either omitted or not recalled by participants for the following systemic treatments: cetirizine (1), chlorphenamine (1), desmopressin (2), hydroxyzine (2), itraconazole (1), piroxicam (2), methotrexate (1), stiripentol (1) and topiramate (1). CONCLUSION: Following an out-patient consultation, where a new medicine is prescribed, children and their parents/carers are usually able to recall the indication, dose regimen and duration of treatment. Few were able to recall, or were told about, possible adverse effects. This may include some important drug specific effects that require vigilance during treatment.Patients, along with families and carers, should be involved in the decision to prescribe a medicine.2 This includes a discussion about the benefits of the medicine on the patient's condition and possible adverse effects.2 Treatment side effects have been shown to be a factor in treatment non-adherence in paediatric long-term medical conditions.3 Practitioners should explain to patients, and their family members or carers where appropriate, how to identify and report medicines-related patient safety incidents.4 However, this study suggests that medical staff may not be comfortable discussing the adverse effects of medicines with patients or their parents/carers.Further research in to the shared decision making process in the paediatric out-patient clinic when a new long-term medicine is prescribed is required to further support medicines adherence and the patient safety agenda.",2016,10.1136/archdischild-2016-311535.53,101,9,e2,eng,1468-2044 0003-9888,Abstract and Oral,NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,Arch Dis Child,NA,NA,NA,NA
Stickland_2016_Arofdiinch,JOUR,A qualitative study of sleep quality in children and their resident parents when in hospital,"Stickland, Alice and Clayton, Esther and Sankey, Ruth and Hill, Catherine M.",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVE: Poor sleep quality impairs immune responses and pain tolerance, both key to recovery from acute illness. Hospitalised children and their co-sleeping parents also risk emotional lability and impaired coping skills when sleep-deprived. We aimed to study the experiences of children and parents during hospital admissions. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents within a week of their child's discharge. Questions explored parent and child sleep quality, factors contributing to this, perceived impact on day-time functioning and suggested improvements to ward sleep environment. SETTING: Southampton Children's Hospital, UK. PATIENTS: 17 co-sleeping parents of 16 children aged 3-12 years completed interviews. Children admitted for surgical procedures and those with established sleep disorders or nocturnal seizures were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Constant comparative methods identified themes within the data using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Parents reported that they, and to a lesser extent their children, experienced reduced sleep quality. Noise and light as well as ward schedules were identified as key factors disrupting sleep. Parents reported that lack of sleep caused difficulties with their own emotional regulation and that of their child, affecting daytime parent-child relationships. Furthermore, they reported a negative impact of sleep deprivation on decision-making about their child's medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Parents identified poor sleep in hospital as a significant additional burden to their child's hospital admission. Importantly, they identified potential improvements to the ward sleep environment.

It aims to assist in safe admission and discharge decision making in environments such as emergency departments and urgent care centres. Determining the inter-rater reliability of scoring tools such as PAGE can be difficult. The aim of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability of seven clinical components of the PAGE Score. DESIGN: Inter-rater reliability was measured by each patient having their clinical components recorded by two separate raters in succession. The first rater was the assessing nurse, and the second rater was a research nurse. SETTING: Two emergency departments and one urgent care centre in the North West of England. Measurements were recorded over 1 week; data were collected for half a day at each of the three sites. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 90 paediatric attendees (aged 0-16 years), 30 from each of the three sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two independent measures for each child were compared using kappa or prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Bland-Altman plots were also constructed for continuous measurements. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability ranged from moderate (0.62 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.74) weighted kappa) to very good (0.98 (95% CI 95 to 0.99) weighted kappa) for all measurements except 'nurse judgement' for which agreement was fair (0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.50 PABAK). Complete information from both raters on all the clinical components of the PAGE score were available for 73 children (81%). These total scores showed good' inter-rater reliability (0.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.74) weighted kappa). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest different nurses would demonstrate good inter-rater reliability when collecting acute assessments needed for the PAGE score, reinforcing the applicability of the tool.

Lefevre_2018_Arofdiinch,JOUR,HPV vaccination rate in French adolescent girls: an example of vaccine distrust,"Lefevre, Herve and Schrimpf, Cecile and Moro, Marie Rose and Lachal, Jonathan",Archives of disease in childhood,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the clinical issues of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to develop explanatory hypotheses for the low level of vaccination among adolescent girls in France where the full course coverage is low (<15%). DESIGN: We used semistructured interviews. Our qualitative and phenomenological procedure applied interpretative phenomenological analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 16 physicians regularly faced with the prescription of HPV vaccine, represented several medical specialties (paediatrics, general practice, internal medicine, gynaecology), with hospitalist or private practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The results connect three superordinate themes grouping three concentric levels: within society, during the consultation and in the individual doctor's feelings. RESULTS: The modalities and contents of the information about HPV vaccination raise questions about the limitations of the information doctors receive. The ineluctable association between sexuality and HPV vaccination explains their reluctance to raise topics considered to be private. The reasons for HPV vaccination illustrate the difficulty of arguing in favour of it. In view of the frequent parental reluctance, which weakens the parent-physician alliance, physicians must take responsibility for defending the benefits of vaccination. They nonetheless remain citizens whose opinions may implicitly echo the general reluctance, promoted by disinformation. In delaying or avoiding the subject of vaccination, they involuntarily become an instrument of anti-vaccination discourse.

K.",Archives of disease in childhood,"BACKGROUND: There are widely discrepant views on the respiratory management of infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type I. Typically, management is palliative. DESIGN: A descriptive study of interventions and investigations is reported that were offered to a cohort of 13 children with SMA type I referred to our centre. Interventions and investigations included sleep studies, provision of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for ventilatory support/dependency and for physiotherapy and the use of mechanical insufflation/exsufflation (MI-E). RESULTS: NIPPV was provided for the following indications: continuous positive airways pressure flow driver dependency (n=3), nocturnal hypoventilation (n=3), to enable successful extubation (n=2), in anticipation of respiratory decompensation (n=3), and oxygen dependency/decompensation (n=2). NIPPV and MI-E were used for successful protocol-led extubations (n=9) but not non protocol-led successes (n=3). NIPPV was essential for discharge home in patients with ventilatory dependency (n=7) and was used for palliation of respiratory symptoms (n=4). Chest wall shape improved with NIPPV. The parents of children who died (n=5) were positive about the use of these techniques. CONCLUSION: NIPPV can be used to facilitate discharge home, and MI-E is helpful in this group.

METHODS: This was a qualitative study involving semistructured interviews with parents. Twenty-one parents were recruited to the study. Parents all had a child who had congenital heart surgery in their first year of life between September 2009 and October 2013 at one of three UK cardiac centres; the children had either died or were readmitted as an emergency following initial discharge. RESULTS: Some parents were unable to identify any early warning signs. Others described symptoms of deterioration including changes in feeding and appearance, respiratory distress and subtle behavioural changes that may not be routinely highlighted to parents at discharge. Several barriers to accessing prompt medical assistance were identified including parents feeling that their concerns were not taken seriously, long wait times and lack of protocols at A&E. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights behavioural symptoms as being a potentially underemphasised sign of deterioration and identifies a number of barriers to parents accessing support when they are concerned. It is important that parents are encouraged to seek advice at the earliest opportunity and that those health professionals at the front line have access to the information they need in order to respond in an appropriate and timely way.

METHODS: IVMP was administered to patients with KD who had persistent or recurrent fever after a single dose of IVIG, at Juntendo University Hospital and affiliated medical institutions between May 2003 and March 2006. The effectiveness of the treatment and the incidence of coronary lesions in patients who received IVMP and those who received additional IVIG were retrospectively analysed and compared by chart review. RESULTS: 411 patients with KD were treated with a single dose of IVIG. Of the 63 IVIG-resistant patients, 44 were then given IVMP and 19 were given additional IVIG. Treatment was successful in 34 (77%) of the patients who received IVMP and 12 (63%) who received additional IVIG. Five of the 10 patients who did not respond to IVMP and two of the seven who did not respond to additional IVIG developed coronary artery aneurysms. Although fever initially resolved faster in the IVMP-resistant group, there was a delay in fever recurrence, which ultimately delayed the final resolution of fever.
