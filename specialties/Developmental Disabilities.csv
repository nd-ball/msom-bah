A sample of 205 parents completed an online survey about the use of autism spectrum disorder services for their children. The results revealed that on average, children began services by 3.3 years. Most parents reported utilizing non-medical treatments followed by biomedical treatments and cultural and religious treatment. The age at the initiation of services and the type of treatments used differed by parent's income, educational attainment, the extent of knowledge about autism spectrum disorders, and geographic location. Some child characteristics also influenced the use of services. The disparities in service utilization in Saudi Arabia point to the need to develop policy and interventions that can mitigate the paucity of services for children with autism spectrum disorders. More research is needed to better understand service use and the decision-making processes that underlie treatment selection by parents of children with autism spectrum disorders in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",2017,10.1177/1362361316664868,21,5,592-602,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Socioeconomic Factors and Parents and services and disability and Saudi Arabia and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*therapy and autism and Health Care Surveys/*statistics & numerical data and Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data and parents and treatments,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bowden_2020_A.tijorap,JOUR,Autism spectrum disorder/Takiwatanga: An Integrated Data Infrastructure-based approach to autism spectrum disorder research in New Zealand,"Bowden, Nicholas and Thabrew, Hiran and Kokaua, Jesse and Audas, Richard and Milne, Barry and Smiler, Kirsten and Stace, Hilary and Taylor, Barry and Gibb, Sheree",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,"New Zealand has few estimates of the prevalence autism spectrum disorder and no national registry or data set to identify and track cases. This hinders the ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions relating to autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we utilised linked health and non-health data to develop a method for identifying cases of autism spectrum disorder among children and young people in New Zealand. In addition, we examined rates of co-occurring mental health, neurodevelopmental and related conditions among this cohort and compared these to the general population. The method identified almost 10,000 children and young people with autism spectrum disorder in New Zealand. Co-occurring mental health or related problems were found in over 68% of this group (nearly seven times higher than the general population), and around half were identified with multiple co-occurring conditions. The most frequently identified conditions were intellectual disability, disruptive behaviours and emotional problems. We have developed a useful method for monitoring service and treatment-related trends, number and types of co-occurring conditions and examining social outcomes among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. While the method may underestimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in New Zealand, it provides a significant step towards establishing a more comprehensive evidence base to inform autism spectrum disorder-related policy.",2020,10.1177/1362361320939329,24,8,2213-2227,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,mental health and Humans and Adolescent and Child and big data and Tanzania and Prevalence and Mental Health and autism spectrum disorder and *Autism Spectrum Disorder/epidemiology and case identification and Integrated Data Infrastructure and New Zealand/epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA
Molloy_2011_A.tijorap,JOUR,Use of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in a clinical setting,"Molloy, Cynthia A. and Murray, Donna S. and Akers, Rachel and Mitchell, Terry and Manning-Courtney, Patricia",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,"The aim of this study was to examine the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) as it is commonly used in clinical practice. ADOS classifications were compared to final diagnoses given by a multidisciplinary team to 584 children referred for evaluation for possible autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. A total of 177 children were evaluated with a Module 1 (87 No Words), 198 with a Module 2 (90 < 5 years) and 209 with a Module 3. Of these, 142 (26%) were diagnosed with autism, 185 (32%) with non-autism ASD, and 257 (44%) with non-spectrum disorders. Sensitivities were moderate to high on both original and revised algorithms, while specificities were substantially lower than those previously reported. This difference is likely attributable to the composition of the sample that included many children with a broad array of developmental and behavioral disorders. The clinical impression of the team member who administered the ADOS was critical to the accuracy of the overall diagnosis. Using numeric scores alone resulted in misclassification from false positive results. The study highlights the importance of the qualitative interactions of the ADOS activities as well as the score in diagnostic decision making.",2011,10.1177/1362361310379241,15,2,143-162,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,"Humans and Female and Male and Child and Child, Preschool and Sex Factors and Algorithms and Sensitivity and Specificity and Age Factors and Psychiatric Status Rating Scales and Asperger Syndrome/diagnosis and Autistic Disorder/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2011/03//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA

Estimating the proportion of evidence-based interventions engaged, identifying the agencies influencing parental decisions, and elucidating the barriers or reasons leading to intervention rejection or discontinuation can result in better service provision. New Zealand parents (n = 570) of a child with autism reported what interventions were being engaged, and why some interventions were engaged but not others. Funding was a major determinant of intervention engagement, while medical professionals exerted the most influence. Sources of support were not related to intervention engagement, but parental perceptions of their child's symptom severity were. Finally, non-engagement does not necessarily reflect parental opposition to an intervention, but rather the existence of barriers.",2018,10.1007/s10803-017-3395-7,48,4,1001-988,eng,1573-3432 0162-3257,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Autism and New Zealand and *Decision Making and *Choice Behavior and Parents/*psychology and ASD and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*psychology/*therapy and Intervention choice and Parent decision making,NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Autism Dev Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a matched case control design with 3911 ASD cases and 38,609 controls, we found that 38 out of 79 medical conditions were associated with increased ASD risk. Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0-23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1-3.2). Using machine learning methods, we clustered children based on their medical conditions prior to ASD diagnosis and demonstrated ASD risk stratification.

The current study examined diagnostic certainty, or how sure clinicians were that their diagnosis was accurate, among 478 toddler and preschool-aged children referred for possible ASD to academic medical specialty clinics. Overall, 60 percent of diagnoses were made with complete certainty. Clinicians were more certain when positively identifying ASD than ruling it out. Children presenting with a moderate (vs high or low) level of observable ASD symptoms were less likely to have a certain diagnosis. Further, clinicians rated less diagnostic certainty for older children, those with public insurance, and those with higher IQ and adaptive behavior abilities.",2019,10.1007/s10803-018-3831-3,49,4,1391-1401,eng,1573-3432 0162-3257,"Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Child and Child, Preschool and Diagnosis, Differential and *Clinical Decision-Making and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*diagnosis and Autism spectrum disorder and Diagnostic certainty and Differential diagnosis",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Autism Dev Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Levy_2017_Moleauti,JOUR,Sparsifying machine learning models identify stable subsets of predictive features for behavioral detection of autism,"Levy, Sebastien and Duda, Marlena and Haber, Nick and Wall, Dennis P.",Molecular autism,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis can be delayed due in part to the time required for administration of standard exams, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Shorter and potentially mobilized approaches would help to alleviate bottlenecks in the healthcare system. Previous work using machine learning suggested that a subset of the behaviors measured by ADOS can achieve clinically acceptable levels of accuracy. Here we expand on this initial work to build sparse models that have higher potential to generalize to the clinical population. METHODS: We assembled a collection of score sheets for two ADOS modules, one for children with phrased speech (Module 2; 1319 ASD cases, 70 controls) and the other for children with verbal fluency (Module 3; 2870 ASD cases, 273 controls). We used sparsity/parsimony enforcing regularization techniques in a nested cross validation grid search to select features for 17 unique supervised learning models, encoding missing values as additional indicator features. We augmented our feature sets with gender and age to train minimal and interpretable classifiers capable of robust detection of ASD from non-ASD. RESULTS: By applying 17 unique supervised learning methods across 5 classification families tuned for sparse use of features and to be within 1 standard error of the optimal model, we find reduced sets of 10 and 5 features used in a majority of models. We tested the performance of the most interpretable of these sparse models, including Logistic Regression with L2 regularization or Linear SVM with L1 regularization. We obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for ADOS Module 3 and 0.93 for ADOS Module 2 with less than or equal to 10 features. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting models provide improved stability over previous machine learning efforts to minimize the time complexity of autism detection due to regularization and a small parameter space. These robustness techniques yield classifiers that are sparse, interpretable and that have potential to generalize to alternative modes of autism screening, diagnosis and monitoring, possibly including analysis of short home videos.",2017,10.1186/s13229-017-0180-6,8,NA,65,eng,2040-2392,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Logistic Models and Algorithms and Autism and Models, Psychological and ROC Curve and Supervised Machine Learning and ASD and Autism spectrum disorder and Autism diagnosis and Autism screening and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*diagnosis/*psychology and Sparse machine learning",NA,NA,2017///,Mol Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bailey_2011_Reindedi,JOUR,A visual aid to decision-making for people with intellectual disabilities,"Bailey, Rebecca and Willner, Paul and Dymond, Simon",Research in developmental disabilities,"Previous studies have shown that people with mild intellectual disabilities have difficulty in 'weighing-up' information, defined as integrating information from two different sources for the purpose of reaching a decision. This was demonstrated in two very different procedures, temporal discounting and a scenario-based financial decision-making task. In the present study, both tasks were presented to 24 participants who attended day services for people with learning disabilities (mean Full-Scale IQ = 59.8), half of whom were trained to use a visual aid to support decision-making. Performance of control participants did not change over repeated testing, but use of the visual aid substantially improved the quality of decision-making on both tasks: temporal discounting performance became more orderly, and participants were able to provide more information to justify their decisions in the financial decision-making task. The visual aid also substantially improved participants' ability to justify decisions they made about their own lives. We suggest that, while the visual aid was designed and evaluated as a means of increasing the quality of reasoning that supports a decision, it may also have potential as an aid to therapeutic interventions aimed at encouraging wiser decision-making.",2011,10.1016/j.ridd.2010.08.008,32,1,37-46,eng,1873-3379 0891-4222,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Socioeconomic Factors and Feedback and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Computer-Assisted Instruction/*methods and *Reinforcement, Psychology and *Audiovisual Aids and Day Care, Medical/methods and Intellectual Disability/psychology/*rehabilitation",NA,NA,2011/02//Jan undefined,Res Dev Disabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and van Goudoever, J. B. and Willems, D. L.",Research in developmental disabilities,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The objectives of this integrative review were to understand how parents of children with severe developmental disorders experience their involvement in end-of-life decision-making, how they prefer to be involved and what factors influence their decisions. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The search was limited to articles in English or Dutch published between January 2004 and August 2014. We included qualitative and quantitative original studies that directly investigated the experiences of parents of children aged 0-18 years with severe developmental disorders for whom an end-of-life decision had been considered or made. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: We identified nine studies that met all inclusion criteria. Reportedly, parental involvement in end-of-life decision-making varied widely, ranging from having no involvement to being the sole decision-maker. Most parents preferred to actively share in the decision-making process regardless of their child's specific diagnosis or comorbidity. The main factors that influenced parents in their decision-making were: their strong urge to advocate for their child's best interests and to make the best (possible) decision. In addition, parents felt influenced by their child's visible suffering, remaining quality of life and the will they perceived in their child to survive. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Most parents of children with severe developmental disorders wish to actively share in the end-of-life decision-making process. An important emerging factor in this process is the parents' feeling that they have to stand up for their child's interests in conversations with the medical team.",2016,10.1016/j.ridd.2015.12.006,49-50,NA,235-246,eng,1873-3379 0891-4222,Decision-making and Humans and Quality of life and Parents and Quality of Life and Severity of Illness Index and *Decision Making and *Terminal Care and *Parents and End-of-life and *Developmental Disabilities and Critical treatment decision and Integrative review and Severe developmental disorder and To advocate,NA,NA,2016/03//Feb undefined,Res Dev Disabil,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIMS: The influence of such a training program on the clinical practices and professional activities of these residents once they are established in their careers as physicians, however, has not been studied; this was the aim of the present study. METHODS: An anonymous follow-up survey was designed and disseminated to physicians who participated in Project DOCC during their one-month developmental disabilities rotation as part of their pediatrics or medicine/pediatric residency between 2002 and 2010. Fifty-eight physicians completed the survey. RESULTS: The findings suggest that participation in a parent led curriculum during medical residency had a lasting impact on physicians' relationships with families. Specifically, a majority of the physicians espoused a family-centered approach to care, a sensitivity to the interactional effect that caring for a Child with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) has on family members, the need for physicians to have a prominent role in community resource coordination, and the importance of an integrated approach to health care provision.
