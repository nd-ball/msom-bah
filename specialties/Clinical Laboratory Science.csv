Jorgensen_2019_Clicheandlabmed,JOUR,What is happening to laboratory medicine in Denmark?,"Jorgensen, Per E.",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"A number of current trends will affect and probably change laboratory medicine, as we know it. Scientific and technological developments, digital health with big data and artificial intelligence, and centralization will change the interfaces among the specialties of laboratory medicine. They might even challenge the identity of some specialties. Other trends such as demographic changes, increased complexity of health care, digital health with electronic health records, and more demanding and well-informed patients will change the way laboratory medicine specialties deliver their services. This paper discusses the possible changes of laboratory medicine in Denmark - a Scandinavian country where almost all hospitals are public. If Danish laboratories grasp the new possibilities instead of trying to avoid them, laboratory medicine is likely to prosper. Such a positive development will call upon good leadership and a genuine willingness among laboratory specialist to adapt to a future where their own specialty might be very different from today.",2019,10.1515/cclm-2018-0590,57,3,349-352,eng,1437-4331 1434-6621,artificial intelligence and Denmark and Humans and big data and *Delivery of Health Care and digital health and *Medical Laboratory Science and disruption and laboratory medicine,NA,NA,2019/02/25/,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gopal_2019_Clicheandlabmed,JOUR,Digital transformation in healthcare - architectures of present and future information technologies,"Gopal, Gayatri and Suter-Crazzolara, Clemens and Toldo, Luca and Eberhardt, Werner",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"Healthcare providers all over the world are faced with a single challenge: the need to improve patient outcomes while containing costs. Drivers include an increasing demand for chronic disease management for an aging population, technological advancements and empowered patients taking control of their health experience. The digital transformation in healthcare, through the creation of a rich health data foundation and integration of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is recognized as a key component to tackle these challenges. It can lead to improvements in diagnostics, prevention and patient therapy, ultimately empowering care givers to use an evidence-based approach to improve clinical decisions. Real-time interactions allow a physician to monitor a patient 'live', instead of interactions once every few weeks. Operational intelligence ensures efficient utilization of healthcare resources and services provided, thereby optimizing costs. However, procedure-based payments, legacy systems, disparate data sources with the limited adoption of data standards, technical debt, data security and privacy concerns impede the efficient usage of health information to maximize value creation for all healthcare stakeholders. This has led to a highly-regulated, constrained industry. Ultimately, the goal is to improve quality of life and saving people's lives through the creation of the intelligent healthcare provider, fully enabled to deliver value-based healthcare and a seamless patient experience. Information technologies that enable this goal must be extensible, safe, reliable and affordable, and tailored to the digitalization maturity-level of the individual organization.",2019,10.1515/cclm-2018-0658,57,3,328-335,eng,1437-4331 1434-6621,Humans and Machine Learning and advanced analytics and digital transformation and healthcare and Artificial Intelligence and Quality of Life and *Artificial Intelligence and *Machine Learning and *Delivery of Health Care and Internet of Things (IoT) and *Information Technology and big data platform,NA,NA,2019/02/25/,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the 21st century the digital age heralds opportunities for information-led technology providers to become healthcare providers when algorithm driven care can support patients' needs at the point of care close to or in their homes. For Specialists in Laboratory Medicine the opportunity arises for working beyond the laboratory in partnership with the emerging providers. The challenge to specialists is to extend their skill and competence to leadership roles that (a) determine clinical need and strategic direction for local environments, (b) ensure technology solutions are cost-effective, safe and reliable, (c) assume the business acumen to market, negotiate and manage change in services, (d) expect understanding of the clinical bioinformatics that underpin genomics, health information science (data mining and health economics) and physical sciences (e) expect knowledge and skills in the provision of direct clinical care in the face of staffing shortfalls experienced by many healthcare systems and (f) enhance their communication and interactive skills.

From these changes we may extrapolate the developments that digitization of health care will bring to medicine in general and laboratory medicine in particular. Disruptive technologies will fundamentally change the way laboratory tests are going to be ordered, carried out and interpreted in the future, and test results from various sources need to be curated to be of added value for the patient's condition. Wearables and implantables will quantify the concentrations for an unknown number of laboratory parameters, and the data will be stored in cloud services at the fingertips of the patient as the sovereign of his/her health care data. A 24/7 online availability of health services will strengthen predictive medicine and may enable a vastly improved preventive health care that is supported by deep-learning algorithms for clinical decision-making not only on behalf of the physician, but also the empowered patient (e.g. health bots). This will likely shift the current role of Laboratory Medicine as a central provider of diagnostic information from a ""hidden champion"" towards a higher visibility redefining the patient-physician-laboratory relationship.

This data can serve as ""clearinghouse"" for electronic health record applications, e.g., use of laboratory data for global health-care research. METHODS: Participants send their daily outpatient medians to the Percentiler application. After 6 to 8weeks, the laboratory receives its login information, which gives access to the user interface. Data is assessed by peer group, i.e., 10 or more laboratories using the same test system. Participation is free of charge. RESULTS: Participation is global with, to date, >120 laboratories and >250 instruments. Up to now, several reports have been produced that address i) the general features of the project, ii) peer group observations; iii) synergisms between ""The Percentiler"" and dedicated external quality assessment surveys. Reasons for long-term instability and bias (calibration- or lot-effects) have been observed for the individual laboratory and manufacturers.

Pneumonia cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Inoculation of respiratory samples into human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines, led to the isolation of a novel respiratory virus whose genome analysis showed it to be a novel coronavirus related to SARS-CoV, and therefore named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty.

This paradigm shift is being driven by administrators and payers seeking to achieve resource efficiencies and to conform practice to the requirements of computerization as well as the adoption of electronic medical records. Although standardization and harmonization of practice improves patient care outcomes and operational efficiencies, administratively driven practice conformity (conformity to opinion) also has serious drawbacks and may lead to significant system failure. Juxtaposition of the distinct philosophical approaches of physicians and scientists (i.e. ""professionalism"") versus administrators and managers (i.e. ""managerialism"") towards bringing about conformity of the laboratory system inherently creates conflict. Despite an administrative edict to ""perform all tests using the same methods"" regardless of available ""best practice"" evidence to do so, medical/scientific input on these decisions is critical to ensure quality and safety of patient care.

The goal of personalized laboratory medicine is to use advanced technologies in the process of preventive, curative or palliative patient management.

Patel_2019_Crreincllasc,JOUR,Implementation of point-of-care testing in a pediatric healthcare setting,"Patel, Khushbu and Suh-Lailam, Brenda B.",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,"Point-of-care testing (POCT) refers to testing performed outside the clinical laboratory near the patient or at the site of patient care. This could be in critical care settings like the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency department (ED) or primary care settings like physician offices where testing is performed by nonlaboratory personnel. POCT circumvents several steps in central laboratory testing including specimen transportation and processing resulting in faster turnaround times. Provider access to rapid test results at the site of patient care allows for prompt medical decision making which can lead to improved patient outcomes, operational efficiencies, patient satisfaction, and even cost savings in some cases. In addition to providing results rapidly, POCT devices have small specimen volume requirements compared to central laboratory tests making POCT particularly attractive for pediatric healthcare settings. The availability of published reports on the impact of POCT implementation in pediatric care are helpful resources when evaluating the clinical necessity of POCT prior to implementation. Even though several studies have shown advantages to implementing POCT in different pediatric settings, it is important to note that limitations exist that might limit the utilization of certain POCTs in some pediatric populations. So, it is important that these limitations and the analytical performance of a test are considered while keeping the target patient population in mind. Since POCTs are performed by non-laboratory staff who are not trained laboratory personnel, one challenge with POCT is maintaining regulatory compliance and quality assurance. It is therefore important that regulatory and quality assurance programs be put in place prior to implementing POCT in the pediatric hospital. With advances in POCT technology, most POCT devices have the capability to interface to the laboratory information system (LIS) and electronic medical record (EMR). POCT device interfacing allows for improved compliance to regulatory and quality assurance standards. Maintaining a cost efficient POCT program is becoming increasingly important as hospitals and healthcare systems are undergoing consolidation and harmonization. This includes assessing the clinical and operational benefit of POCT before implementation and inventory management to ensure minimal reagent wastage.

Gonzalez.Irazabal_2021_Crreincllasc,JOUR,Identifying and overcoming barriers to harmonize newborn screening programs through consensus strategies,"Gonzalez-Irazabal, Yolanda and Hernandez de Abajo, Guillermo and Martinez-Morillo, Eduardo",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,"The benefits of newborn screening (NBS) programs have been widely demonstrated after more than 50 years since first established. NBS enables the detection of the disease before the child shows clinical symptoms, allowing clinicians to act early and facilitating appropriate interventions to prevent or improve adverse outcomes. Delay or lack of medical intervention in these infants may lead to developmental delay, severe disability, or premature death. NBS programs have grown exponentially both in the number of diseases screened and in complexity, creating controversy. New technological advances, as well as the emergence of new therapies that require early disease detection, have allowed for the inclusion of new diseases in NBS screening programs. However, different countries and even different regions have in turn adopted very diverse strategies and diagnostic algorithms when it comes to NBS. There are many factors responsible for these differences, such as the health care system, available funds, local politics, professional groups, and others that depend on the position taken by policymakers. These differences in NBS have led to discrepancies in detection opportunities between countries or regions, which has led to many varied attempts to harmonize NBS programs but not all have been equally satisfactory. Some countries have achieved good results, but always within their borders. Therefore, there are still many differences between NBS programs at the international level that must be overcome. These advances have also brought considerable uncertainty regarding ethical aspects and balance between benefits and harms. For this reason, and so that the situation of disparity in the global NBS programs can be minimized, health authorities must work to develop uniform criteria for decision-making and to take a further step toward harmonization. To do so, it is necessary to identify the crucial factors that lead to the adoption of different NBS programs worldwide, in order to analyze their influence and find ways to overcome them.",2021,10.1080/10408363.2020.1781778,58,1,29-48,eng,1549-781X 1040-8363,"Humans and Child and Infant and Consensus and Infant, Newborn and harmonization and *Neonatal Screening and metabolic disorder and Newborn screening and policy-making",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA
Piva_2014_Clinbioc,JOUR,Laboratory critical values: automated notification supports effective clinical decision making,"Piva, Elisa and Pelloso, Michela and Penello, Laura and Plebani, Mario",Clinical biochemistry,"OBJECTIVE: Failure to adequately communicate a laboratory critical value (CV) is a potential cause of adverse events. The harmonization of CV reporting is increasingly recognized as a key issue in ensuring patient care and minimizing harm. With ongoing improvements in CV reporting, the patient's outcome should be audited to assess the effectiveness of CV notification. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the data audited throughout a six month-period during which an analysis was made of CVs, and we describe the approach of clinicians and general practitioners (GPs), and their decision making following CV reporting. RESULTS: CV notification led to a change of treatment in 98.0% of patients admitted to surgical and in 90.6% of those admitted to medical wards. Clinicians made a further evaluation of new complications in patients in 70.0% and 60.4% of cases, in surgical and medical wards respectively. In more than 40.0% of cases, CVs were unexpected findings. In the primary care setting, critical hyperkalemia was managed by GPs in 55% of patients, thus sparing patient's hospitalization. For all outpatients with critical INR (international normalized ratio), the GPs changed or stopped warfarin dosage.

Kozinski_2017_Crreincllasc,JOUR,High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: From improved analytical performance to enhanced risk stratification,"Kozinski, Marek and Krintus, Magdalena and Kubica, Jacek and Sypniewska, Grazyna",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,"Implementation of cardiac troponin (cTn) assays has revolutionized the diagnosis, risk stratification, triage and management of patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI). The Universal Definition of MI brought about a shift in the diagnostics of MI, from an approach primarily based on electrocardiography (ECG) to one primarily based on biomarkers. Currently, detection of a rise and/or fall in concentration or activity of myocardial necrosis biomarkers, preferentially cTns, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), is the essential component for the diagnosis of MI. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays with their superior analytical performance were designed to further facilitate clinical decision making. The ability of hs-cTn assays to detect measurable cTn concentrations in at least 50% of healthy individuals, along with their improved precision (expressed as coefficient of variation <e2><89><a4>10% at the 99th percentile URL) associated with increased recognition of changing values, leads to enhanced risk stratification of patients with suspected MI, and also enables them to be used as prognostic tools potentially useful in other patient subsets. In this comprehensive review, we aim to integrate updated laboratory and clinical knowledge regarding hs-cTn assays in order to promote their optimal use in daily practice. We primarily focus on the role of hs-cTn assays in patients with suspected MI, discussing recommended diagnostic algorithms and result interpretation. Emphasis is also placed on the release of cTns following myocardial injury, the characteristics of antibodies used in available cTn immunoassays, and analytical performance of hs-cTn assays. In this paper, we also review potential challenges related to the selection of a healthy reference population in determining 99th percentile values, biological variation of hs-cTns, inequality between hs-cTn assays, and outline the current status of cTnI standardization. Finally, we discuss in detail the diagnostic and prognostic value of hs-cTn assays, including non-coronary causes of cTn elevation, the potential benefits and risks of point-of-care testing, and the unjustified skepticism of some clinicians regarding implementation of hs-cTn assays. In everyday clinical practice, hs-cTn assays are an important diagnostic advance, predominantly for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), with suspected non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the NSTE-ACS setting, recently introduced short diagnostic algorithms using hs-cTn assays integrated with careful clinical and ECG assessment were found to substantially reduce the time to final diagnosis, shorten visits to the emergency department and allow earlier safe discharge of low risk subjects. Hs-cTn assays have significantly higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for NSTEMI in comparison to contemporary cTn tests, particularly in early NSTE-ACS presenters. However, due to frequently occurring mild hs-cTn elevations, they are also associated with lower specificity and reduced positive predictive value when compared to previous generations of assays. Our review underscores the need for the education of clinicians and medical laboratory professionals regarding appropriate use and interpretation of hs-cTn assays. Adequate training and clinical experience in using these tests are essential to translate the improved analytical performance of hs-cTn assays into enhanced risk stratification and hopefully better patient outcomes.",2017,10.1080/10408363.2017.1285268,54,3,143-172,eng,1549-781X 1040-8363,Humans and risk stratification and myocardial infarction and Reference Standards and Biomarkers/*blood and *Blood Chemical Analysis/methods/standards and *Myocardial Infarction/classification/diagnosis and Cardiac troponins and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and Limit of Detection and Troponin/*blood,NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA

Consolidation, merger, and laboratory downsizing have been driven by the need to deliver economies of scale and cut costs per test while boosting productivity. Distorted economics, based on payment models rewarding volume and efficiency rather than quality and clinical effectiveness, have underpinned the entrance of clinical laboratories into the production industry thus forcing them to relinquish their original mission of providing medical services. The sea change in laboratory medicine in recent years, with the introduction of ever newer and ever more complex tests, including 'omics', which impact on clinical decision-making, should encourage clinical laboratories to return to their original mission as long as payments models are changed. Rather than being considered solely in terms of costs, diagnostic testing must be seen in the context of an entire hospital stay or an overall payment for a care pathway: the testing process should be conceived as a part of the patient's entire journey.",2015,10.1515/cclm-2014-1007,53,7,1004-995,eng,1437-4331 1434-6621,Hospitals and Humans and *Clinical Laboratory Services/economics and *Industry/economics,NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Witteman_2019_Clicheandlabmed,JOUR,Communicating laboratory results to patients and families,"Witteman, Holly O. and Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J.",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"People are increasingly able to access their laboratory results via patient portals. The potential benefits provided by such access, such as reductions in patient burden and improvements in patient satisfaction, disease management, and medical decision making, also come with potentially valid concerns about such results causing confusion or anxiety among patients. However, it is possible to clearly convey the meaning of results and, when needed, indicate required action by designing systems to present laboratory results adapted to the people who will use them. Systems should support people in converting the potentially meaningless data of results into meaningful information and actionable knowledge. We offer 10 recommendations toward this goal: (1) whenever possible, provide a clear takeaway message for each result. (2) Signal whether differences are meaningful or not. (3) When feasible, provide thresholds for concern and action. (4) Individualize the frame of reference by allowing custom reference ranges. (5) Ensure the system is accessible. (6) Provide conversion tools along with results. (7) Design in collaboration with users. (8) Design for both new and experienced users. (9) Make it easy for people use the data as they wish.

Among these, the ever increasing use of stat ordering, involving labour intensive phlebotomy,warrants explanation, especially for a phlebotomy service organised by the laboratory, not by those responsible for and/or carrying out the requests, such as doctors and nurses. METHODS: To explore the possibilities to reduce the number of stat phlebotomy requests, we conducted a survey among nurses and doctors of their motives in requesting 109 randomly selected stat orders. RESULTS: Fifty-fi ve percent of all stat phlebotomy orders were requested for immediate decision-making with respect to urgently required diagnosis and patient care, defined by us as medical reasons. The other 45 % of the stat orders were made for logistical reasons relating to the patient care or the hospital organisation. In total, 19 phlebotomy requests(17 % ) were unnecessary and could have been avoided.For most of the stat phlebotomy orders alternatives were not possible, as only 2 % of the requests could have been replaced by analysis in material that had been withdrawn earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the stat orders for phlebotomy were requested for good reasons, about equally distributed among the medical and logistical needs.

The release of such results may be to the harm of the patient by triggering wrong clinical decision making in monitoring or treatment. On the other hand, their deletion also might be to the harm of the patient by delaying the time to decision making as the exact value sometimes is not even necessary but rather an answer to the question ""Is it raised or lowered"". Based on this dilemma and forced to produce laboratory values without any clinical information on the respective patient, laboratories have developed their own preferred way on how to deal with preanalytically altered test results. Some release the value with a comment, some reject the value with or without a comment and others again provide only general information about the hemolytic sample. To date there is no guideline or standardization to this postanalytical topic. Therefore, with this opinion paper, we want to start the scientific discussion on this important issue by providing one possible method to overcome the lack of clinical information which the laboratory would need to correctly decide whether or not to release an altered test result. We suggest providing the clinician with all the information on the hemolytic sample and its impact on the respective parameter needed to make his/her own decision on the usage of the respective test result.

In Laboratory Medicine, QIs should cover all steps of the testing process, as error studies have confirmed that most errors occur in the pre- and post-analytical phase of testing. Aim of the present study is to provide preliminary results on QIs and related performance criteria in the post-analytical phase. METHODS: This work was conducted according to a previously described study design based on the voluntary participation of clinical laboratories in the project on QIs of the Working Group ""Laboratory Errors and Patient Safety"" (WG-LEPS) of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC). RESULTS: Overall, data collected highlighted an improvement or stability in performances over time for all reported indicators thus demonstrating that the use of QIs is effective in the quality improvement strategy. Moreover, QIs data are an important source for defining the state-of-the-art concerning the error rate in the total testing process. The definition of performance specifications based on the state-of-the-art, as suggested by consensus documents, is a valuable benchmark point in evaluating the performance of each laboratory.

Although MU reporting is not required, its inclusion in medical reports is of potential assistance to physicians in results interpretation. METHODS: MU reporting was evaluated with respect to different test purposes, namely comparison with reference intervals (RI), patient monitoring or comparison with clinical decision limits. Clinical Biochemistry, Hematology, Coagulation and Clinical Immunology measurands were used as examples. Assuming Gaussian RI distribution, the probability of retesting due to MU was determined by simulations. Significant MU variations were compared against the reference change value (RCV) and clinical decision limits. RESULTS: Three potential scenarios emerged for RI. For 12 measurands, depending on the MU interval, a potential change in results interpretation was found only for Sodium and S-Protein. On considering only the results within RI, simulations confirmed that up to 8.6% of MU intervals encompassed the RI limits, thus potentially leading to retesting. For tests used in patient monitoring, significant MU variations were comparable to those calculated by RCV, with the exception of CEA. For tests results evaluated with respect to clinical decision limits, on including MU, the clinical interpretation may be improved (e.g. for tPSA). CONCLUSION: The findings made in the present study, which considers real MU data and hypothetical results obtained for a series of measurands, support the concept that MU may aid the physician's interpretation thus ensuring reliable clinical decision making.",2018,10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.03.009,57,NA,41-47,eng,1873-2933 0009-9120,"Humans and Reference Values and Quality Control and Measurement uncertainty and Clinical Decision-Making and *Data Interpretation, Statistical and *Uncertainty and Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*standards and Clinical decision point and ISO15189:2012 and Laboratory reports and Reference change value and Reference intervals",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,Clin Biochem,NA,NA,NA,NA

The problems of the patient are expressed by symptoms or signs or abnormal test results, requested for a variety of reasons. The entire scientific, as well as diagnostic approach, is based on three steps: to stumble in a problem; to try a solution through a hypothesis; to disprove or to prove the hypothesis by a process of criticism. Clinicians use the information obtained from the history and physical examination to estimate initial (or pre-test) probability and then use the results from tests and other diagnostic procedures to modify this probability until the post-test probability is such that the suspected diagnosis is either confirmed or ruled out. When the pre-test probability of disease is high, tests characterized by high specificity will be preferred, in order to confirm the diagnostic suspect. When the pre-test probability of disease is low, a test with high sensitivity is advisable to exclude the hypothetical disease.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate seasonal variations and the association between TSH and lipid profiles based on clinical big data. METHOD: This observational, retrospective big data study enrolled a total of 20,192 individuals who visited Peking Union Medical College Hospital for routine health check-ups from 2014 to 2018. Demographic, medical history, common biochemical analytes, and thyroid related test data were obtained. A Kruskal-wallis analysis was used to compare the differences in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by TSH quartiles. Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between TSH and lipid profiles as well as temperature. RESULTS: TC and LDL did not vary significantly with TSH concentration; however, TG and HDL-C did. TSH concentration showed weak positive correlation with serum TC, TG, and HDL-C but not with LDL-C. Serum TC concentration was positively correlated with TG and LDL-C. TG was positively correlated with LDL-C but negatively correlated with HDL-C. HDL-C was negatively correlated with LDL-C. TSH and lipid profiles showed seasonal fluctuations. Monthly median TSH, TC, and LDL-C peaked in winter and dropped to a minimum in summer. The correlation coefficient (r) between the average monthly temperature and TSH, TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C was -0.424 (p = 0.001), -0.539 (p < 0.001), -0.020 (p = 0.880), -0.199 (p = 0.127), and -0.442 (p < 0.001), respectively.

Whether or not laboratory test results obtained by measuring unsuitable specimens should be made available to the clinicians has been the matter of fierce debates over the past decades.

This approach carries some advantages, namely the timely communication of potentially life-threatening laboratory values, but also some drawbacks. These especially include the challenging definition of validated performance specifications for hemolyzed samples, the need to producing reliable data with the lowest possible uncertainty, the short turnaround time for repeating most laboratory tests, the risk that the comments may be overlooked in short-stay and frequently overcrowded units (e.g. the emergency department), as well as the many clinical advantages of a direct communication with the physician in charge of the patient.

According to the George Lundberg definition the result becomes ""critical"" when, exceeding actionable thresholds, it suggests imminent danger for the patient, unless appropriate therapy is initiated promptly. As required in most important accreditation standards, such as the ISO:15,189 or the Joint Commission standards, a quality reporting system should deliver the correct result to the appropriate clinician in a time-frame that ensures patient safety. From this point of view, medical laboratories should implement a process that assures the most effective communication in a timely manner, to the referring physician or care team member. Failure in communication, particularly in this type of situation, continues to be one of the most common factors contributing to the occurrence of adverse events. In the last few decades, Information Technology (IT) in Health Care has become increasingly important. The ability to interface radiology, anatomic pathology or laboratory information systems with electronic medical records is now a real opportunity, offering much safer communication than in the past. Future achievements on performance criteria and quality indicators for the notification of CRs, should ensure a comparable examination across different institutions, adding value to clinical laboratories in controlling post-analytical processes that concern patient safety. Therefore, the novel approach to CRs should combine quality initiatives, IT solutions and a culture to strengthen professional interaction.",2017,10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2017.05.010,50,10-11,617-621,eng,1873-2933 0009-9120,Clinical outcomes and Patient safety and Health Information Exchange/*standards and Clinical decision-making and *Health Communication/methods/standards and *Clinical Laboratory Techniques/methods/standards and *Delivery of Health Care/methods/standards and *Electronic Health Records/organization & administration/standards and Critical result management and Performance specifications,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Clin Biochem,NA,NA,NA,NA

Laboratories in the hospital setting can face this challenge by changing their organization from a compartmentalized laboratory department toward a decision making-based laboratory department. This requires the implementation of a core laboratory, that exploits total laboratory automation (TLA) using technological innovation in analytical platforms, track systems and information technology, including middleware, and a number of satellite specialized laboratory sections cooperating with care teams for specific medical conditions. In this laboratory department model, the short TAT for all first-line tests performed by TLA in the core laboratory represents the key paradigm, where no more stat testing is required because all samples are handled in real-time and (auto)validated results dispatched in a time that fulfills clinical needs. To optimally reach this goal, laboratories should be actively involved in managing all the steps covering the total examination process, speeding up also extra-laboratory phases, such sample delivery. Furthermore, to warrant effectiveness and not only efficiency, all the processes, e.g. specimen integrity check, should be managed by middleware through a predefined set of rules defined in light of the clinical governance.",2017,10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2017.04.002,50,10-11,605-611,eng,1873-2933 0009-9120,"Humans and *Automation, Laboratory/instrumentation/methods/standards and *Clinical Laboratory Techniques/instrumentation/methods/standards/trends and *Laboratories, Hospital/organization & administration/standards/trends and Clinical governance and Core-lab and Stat testing and Total laboratory automation",NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Clin Biochem,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until now, no reliable information has been published addressing to which extent laboratory results are actually used for clinical decision-making. Therefore, we aimed to close this gap using a novel retrospective approach including a survey of clinicians and nurses. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the number of re-orders for potassium (K), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), activated partial thromboplastin-time (APTT) and prothrombin-time/INR (PT/INR), after the initial order had to be cancelled due to preanalytical non-conformities. We analyzed subgroups regarding time to re-order, ward and sample priority (urgent vs. routine). Subsequently, we surveyed clinicians and nurses, asking for their estimate of the amount of failed re-orders as well as for possible reasons. RESULTS: From initially cancelled tests, only ~20% of K, LD, AST and ~30% of APTT and PT/INR tests were re-ordered within 24<e2><80><af>h. 70% of the investigated clinical chemistry and 60% of coagulation tests were re-ordered one week after cancellation or not at all. Survey participants quite accurately estimated these numbers. Routine laboratory panels, short stay of out-patients, obsolete test results and avoiding additional phlebotomies were the main reasons for not re-ordering cancelled tests. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 60-70% of test results in the investigated assays ordered in a high throughput laboratory are potentially inappropriate or of doubtful clinically importance.

Haeckel_2011_Clicheandlabmed,JOUR,A new concept to derive permissible limits for analytical imprecision and bias considering diagnostic requirements and technical state-of-the-art,"Haeckel, Rainer and Wosniok, Werner",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: Permissible limits of analytical imprecision and bias are usually derived either from biological variability or from the state of the art. Both concepts require information from external sources which often lack transparency and are difficult to integrate in medical decision-making. Additionally, physicians may be interested in knowing the probability of decision errors due to analytical uncertainty. Therefore, an approach was developed which combines all three concepts. METHODS: The empirical (observed) biological variation was derived from reference ranges used by the laboratory (CV(E)). CV(E) was corrected to get the biological variation in the theoretical absence of analytical imprecision (CV(C)). Relatively simple equations were derived from the relationship between biological variation and the analytical imprecision (CV(A)) to calculate permissible imprecision and bias. Five quality classes are proposed for the various analytes reflecting the false-positive error rates (FPR). These classes characterize analytical procedures according to their theoretical specificity (FPR). Thus, the new approach combines the theoretical base of biological variation with the technical state-of-the-art. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As practical examples, the permissible imprecision and bias limits were estimated for a selection of quantities. The limits found were more realistic than present proposals based on Cotlove's rule (fixed fraction of biological variation), but slightly more stringent than national consensus values based on the state-of-the-art. Imprecision and bias do not affect FPR equally, and, therefore, should be assessed separately. It is proposed to insert monthly imprecision and bias results calculated after each control cycle in a table with five quality classes. This table provides a simple overview of the analytical quality performance of the entire laboratory with one glance and can be handled on the Excel platform.",2011,10.1515/CCLM.2011.116,49,4,623-635,eng,1437-4331 1434-6621,Humans and Feasibility Studies and Sensitivity and Specificity and Bias and False Positive Reactions and Reference Values and Quality Control and *Diagnostic Errors and Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*standards,NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lippi_2007_Clicheandlabmed,JOUR,Diagnostic approach to inherited bleeding disorders,"Lippi, Giuseppe and Franchini, Massimo and Guidi, Gian Cesare",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,"The appropriate development of hemostasis encompasses a delicate equilibrium between anti- and prothrombotic forces developing during three distinct phases (primary hemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis) that are closely linked to each other and precisely regulated to close vessel wounds, promote vascular healing and maintain vessel patency. Imbalance in each of these systems produces either hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. Inherited bleeding disorders, caused by quantitative or qualitative alterations of either platelets or plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, may lead to serious and lifelong bleeding conditions, the severity of which is inversely associated with the degree of the underlying defect. Rapid and reliable identification of these pathologies is worthy of focus to allow the adoption of appropriate substitutive or supportive antihemorrhagic therapies. Evaluation of the hemorrhage-prone patient requires careful recording of the medical history, attention to pertinent physical findings and the discretionary use of laboratory resources. Owing to the low diagnostic efficiency of clinical history and examination, an appropriate and reliable laboratory approach, encompassing first- and second-line testing, is essential to screen, diagnose and monitor patients with bleeding diatheses. As both the analytical sensitivity and responsiveness of traditional coagulation assays to different abnormalities differ widely, each laboratory should establish individual guidelines based on field experience and on reagent and instrument characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that the implementation of global coagulation tests, such as the thrombin generation assay and clot waveform analysis, would provide additional information for clinical decision-making for patients with inherited bleeding disorders.",2007,10.1515/CCLM.2007.006,45,1,12-2,eng,1434-6621,"Humans and Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited/*diagnosis/therapy and Hemorrhagic Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy",NA,NA,2007///,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. METHOD: We developed a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory testing results obtained within 2 days before the release of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,356 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,402 positive and 1,954 negative) evaluated at a metropolitan hospital. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within 2 days. CONCLUSION: This model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available.

Consequently, the influence of analytical performance is more critical than for other diagnostic decisions where much other information is included. The aim of this opinion paper is to investigate consequences of analytical quality and other circumstances for the outcome of ""Guideline-Driven Medical Decision Limits"". TERMS: Effects of analytical bias and imprecision should be investigated separately and analytical quality specifications should be estimated accordingly. BIOLOGICAL VARIATION AND ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE: Use of sharp decision limits doesn't consider biological variation and effects of this variation are closely connected with the effects of analytical performance. Such relationships are investigated for the guidelines for HbA1c in diagnosis of diabetes and in risk of coronary heart disease based on serum cholesterol. The effects of a second sampling in diagnosis give dramatic reduction in the effects of analytical quality showing minimal influence of imprecision up to 3 to 5% for two independent samplings, whereas the reduction in bias is more moderate and a 2% increase in concentration doubles the percentage of false positive diagnoses, both for HbA1c and cholesterol. FREQUENCY OF FOLLOW-UP LABORATORY TESTS: An alternative approach comes from the current application of guidelines for follow-up laboratory tests according to clinical procedure orders, e.g. frequency of parathyroid hormone requests as a function of serum calcium concentrations. Here, the specifications for bias can be evaluated from the functional increase in requests for increasing serum calcium concentrations.

Guidelines on test selection are often considered a useful adjunct to aid clinical decision-making, as test selection is a complex process that is influenced by many patient, clinician and laboratory factors. However, it is important to carefully evaluate several aspects of these guidelines, which include the context of the test in the guideline, the quality of the studies underpinning recommendations, the extent of the evaluation of effectiveness (or performance) of the specific test and in the clinical pathway, its applicability and ease of implementation. A robust evaluation of a diagnostic test should incorporate several stages including evaluation in healthy, symptomatic but unaffected and affected populations, and importantly a measurement of impact on patient outcomes. Few diagnostic studies meet these criteria, and therefore crucial aspects of test evaluation are overlooked prior to incorporation into clinical guidelines.

The first movement, allegro con fuoco, played from 1960 to 1980: a mix of themes devoted to the study of biological variability (intra-, inter-individual, short- and long-term), preanalytical conditions, standardization of analytical methods, quality control, statistical tools for deriving reference limits, all of them complex variations developed on a central melody: the new concept of reference values that would replace the notion of normality whose definition was unclear. Additional contributions (multivariate reference values, use of reference limits from broad sets of patient data, drug interferences) conclude the movement on the variability of laboratory tests. The second movement, adagio, from 1980 to 2000, slowly develops and implements initial works. International and national recommendations were published by the IFCC-LM (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) and scientific societies [French (SFBC), Spanish (SEQC), Scandinavian societies...]. Reference values are now topics of many textbooks and of several congresses, workshops, and round tables that are organized all over the world. Nowadays, reference values are part of current practice in all clinical laboratories, but not without difficulties, particularly for some laboratories to produce their own reference values and the unsuitability of the concept with respect to new technologies such as HPLC, GCMS, and PCR assays. Clinicians through consensus groups and practice guidelines have introduced their own tools, the decision limits, likelihood ratios and Reference Change Value (RCV), creating confusion among laboratorians and clinicians in substituting reference values and decision limits in laboratory reports. The rapid development of personalized medicine will eventually call for the use of individual reference values. The beginning of the second millennium is played allegro ma non-troppo from 2000 to 2012: the theory of reference values is back into fashion. The need to revise the concept is emerging. The manufacturers make a friendly pressure to facilitate the integration of Reference Intervals (RIs) in their technical documentation. Laboratorians are anxiously awaiting the solutions for what to do. The IFCC-LM creates Reference Intervals and Decision Limits Committee (C-RIDL) in 2005. Simultaneously, a joint working group IFCC-CLSI is created on the same topic. In 2008 the initial recommendations of IFCC-LM are revised and new guidelines are published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI C28-A3). Fundamentals of the theory of reference values are not changed, but new avenues are explored: RIs transference, multicenter reference intervals, and a robust method for deriving RIs from small number of subjects. Concomitantly, other statistical methods are published such as bootstraps calculation and partitioning procedures. An alternative to recruiting healthy subjects proposes the use of biobanks conditional to the availability of controlled preanalytical conditions and of bioclinical data. The scope is also widening to include veterinary biology! During the early 2000s, several groups proposed the concept of 'Universal RIs' or 'Global RIs'. Still controversial, their applications await further investigations. The fourth movement, finale: beyond the methodological issues (statistical and analytical essentially), important questions remain unanswered. Do RIs intervene appropriately in medical decision-making? Are RIs really useful to the clinicians? Are evidence-based decision limits more appropriate? It should be appreciated that many laboratory tests represent a continuum that weakens the relevance of RIs. In addition, the boundaries between healthy and pathological states are shady areas influenced by many biological factors. In such a case the use of a single threshold is questionable. Wherever it will apply, individual reference values and reference change values have their place. A variation on an old theme! It is strange that in the period of personalized medicine (that is more stratified medicine), the concept of reference values which is based on stratification of homogeneous subgroups of healthy people could not be discussed and developed in conjunction with the stratification of sick patients. That is our message for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. Prospects are broad, enthusiasm is not lacking: much remains to be done, good luck for the new generations!",2013,10.1515/cclm-2012-0682,51,1,47-64,eng,1437-4331 1434-6621,"Humans and History, 21st Century and Reference Values and History, 20th Century and *Chemistry, Clinical/history/standards and *Clinical Laboratory Techniques/standards and *Clinical Medicine/history/standards",NA,NA,2013/01//undefined,Clin Chem Lab Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Modur_2013_Clinchem,JOUR,Evidence-based laboratory medicine in oncology drug development: from biomarkers to diagnostics,"Modur, Vijay and Hailman, Eric and Barrett, J. C.",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: The promise of targeted therapies in molecularly defined subsets of cancer has led to a transformation of the process of drug development in oncology. To target cancer successfully and precisely requires high-quality translational data. Such data can be generated by the use of biomarkers that answer key questions in drug development. CONTENT: Translational data for aiding in decision-making and driving cancer drug development can be generated by systematic assessments with biomarkers. Types of biomarkers that support decisions include: pharmacodynamic assessments for selecting the best compound or dosage; assessment of early tumor response with tissue biomarkers and imaging, mutation, and other assessment strategies for patient selection; and the use of markers of organ injury to detect toxicity and improve safety. Tactics used to generate biomarker data include fit-for-purpose assay validation and real-time biomarker assessments. Successfully translated and clinically informative biomarkers can mature into novel companion diagnostic tests that expand the practice of laboratory medicine. SUMMARY: Systematic biomarker assessments are a key component of the clinical development of targeted therapies for cancer. The success of these biomarker assessments requires applying basic principles of laboratory medicine to generate the data required to make informed decisions. Successful biomarkers can transition into diagnostic tests that expand the laboratory medicine armamentarium.",2013,10.1373/clinchem.2012.191072,59,1,102-109,eng,1530-8561 0009-9147,"Humans and *Drug Design and *Evidence-Based Medicine and Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use and *Medical Laboratory Science and Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis and Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy",NA,NA,2013/01//undefined,Clin Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bachmann_2017_Clinchem,JOUR,State of Harmonization of 24 Serum Albumin Measurement Procedures and Implications for Medical Decisions,"Bachmann, Lorin M. and Yu, Min and Boyd, James C. and Bruns, David E. and Miller, W. Greg",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: Measurements of serum and plasma albumin are widely used in medicine, including as indicators of quality of patient care in renal dialysis centers. METHODS: Pools were prepared from residual patient serum (n = 50) and heparin plasma (n = 48) from patients without renal disease, and serum from patients with kidney failure before hemodialysis (n = 53). Albumin was measured in all samples and in ERM-DA470k/IFCC reference material (RM) by 3 immunochemical, 9 bromcresol green (BCG), and 12 bromcresol purple (BCP) methods. RESULTS: Two of 3 immunochemical procedures, 5 of 9 BCG, and 10 of 12 BCP methods recovered the RM value within its uncertainty. One immunochemical and 3 BCG methods were biased vs the RM value. Random error components were small for all measurement procedures. The Tina-quant immunochemical method was chosen as the reference measurement procedure based on recovery and results of error analyses. Mean biases for BCG vs Tina-quant were 1.5% to 13.9% and were larger at lower albumin concentrations. BCP methods' mean biases were -5.4% to 1.2% irrespective of albumin concentration. Biases for plasma samples were generally higher than for serum samples for all method types. For most measurement procedures, biases were lower for serum from patients on hemodialysis vs patients without kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences among immunochemical, BCG, and BCP methods compromise interpretation of serum albumin results. Guidelines and calculations for clinical management of kidney and other diseases must consider the method used for albumin measurement until harmonization can be achieved.",2017,10.1373/clinchem.2016.262899,63,3,770-779,eng,1530-8561 0009-9147,Humans and Reference Standards and *Clinical Decision-Making and Serum Albumin/*analysis and Immunochemistry and Kidney Diseases/*blood and Renal Dialysis/standards,NA,NA,2017/03//undefined,Clin Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA
Smith_2019_Clinchem,JOUR,Toward a Framework for Outcome-Based Analytical Performance Specifications: A Methodology Review of Indirect Methods for Evaluating the Impact of Measurement Uncertainty on Clinical Outcomes,"Smith, Alison F. and Shinkins, Bethany and Hall, Peter S. and Hulme, Claire T. and Messenger, Mike P.",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: For medical tests that have a central role in clinical decision-making, current guidelines advocate outcome-based analytical performance specifications. Given that empirical (clinical trial-style) analyses are often impractical or unfeasible in this context, the ability to set such specifications is expected to rely on indirect studies to calculate the impact of test measurement uncertainty on downstream clinical, operational, and economic outcomes. Currently, however, a lack of awareness and guidance concerning available alternative indirect methods is limiting the production of outcome-based specifications. Therefore, our aim was to review available indirect methods and present an analytical framework to inform future outcome-based performance goals. CONTENT: A methodology review consisting of database searches and extensive citation tracking was conducted to identify studies using indirect methods to incorporate or evaluate the impact of test measurement uncertainty on downstream outcomes (including clinical accuracy, clinical utility, and/or costs). Eighty-two studies were identified, most of which evaluated the impact of imprecision and/or bias on clinical accuracy. A common analytical framework underpinning the various methods was identified, consisting of 3 key steps: (a) calculation of ""true"" test values; (b) calculation of measured test values (incorporating uncertainty); and (c) calculation of the impact of discrepancies between (a) and (b) on specified outcomes. A summary of the methods adopted is provided, and key considerations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Various approaches are available for conducting indirect assessments to inform outcome-based performance specifications. This study provides an overview of methods and key considerations to inform future studies and research in this area.",2019,10.1373/clinchem.2018.300954,65,11,1363-1374,eng,1530-8561 0009-9147,"Humans and Bias and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and *Uncertainty and Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,Clin Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pantel_2019_Clinchem,JOUR,Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer: From Discovery to Clinical Utility,"Pantel, Klaus and Hille, Claudia and Scher, Howard I.",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer represents the most common non-skin cancer type in men. Unmet needs include understanding prognosis to determine when intervention is needed and what type, prediction to guide the choice of a systemic therapy, and response indicators to determine whether a treatment is working. Over the past decade, the ""liquid biopsy,"" characterized by the analysis of tumor cells and tumor cell products such as cell-free nucleic acids (DNA, microRNA) or extracellular vesicles circulating in the blood of cancer patients, has received considerable attention. CONTENT: Among those biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been most intensively analyzed in prostate cancer. Here we discuss recent studies on the enumeration and characterization of CTCs in peripheral blood and how this information can be used to develop biomarkers for each of these clinical contexts. We focus on clinical applications in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, in whom CTCs are more often detected and at higher numbers, and clinical validation for different contexts of use is most mature. SUMMARY: The overall goal of CTC-based liquid biopsy testing is to better inform medical decision-making so that patient outcomes are improved.",2019,10.1373/clinchem.2018.287102,65,1,87-99,eng,1530-8561 0009-9147,"Humans and Male and Reproducibility of Results and Early Detection of Cancer and Survival Analysis and Monitoring, Physiologic and Neoplasm Metastasis and Biomarkers, Tumor/blood and *Neoplastic Cells, Circulating and Antigens, Surface/blood and Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II/blood and Liquid Biopsy and Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/*blood/diagnosis/pathology and Theranostic Nanomedicine",NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,Clin Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schneiderhan_2013_Clinchem,JOUR,Work flow analysis of around-the-clock processing of blood culture samples and integrated MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections,"Schneiderhan, Wilhelm and Grundt, Alexander and Worner, Stefan and Findeisen, Peter and Neumaier, Michael",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: Because sepsis has a high mortality rate, rapid microbiological diagnosis is required to enable efficient therapy. The effectiveness of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis in reducing turnaround times (TATs) for blood culture (BC) pathogen identification when available in a 24-h hospital setting has not been determined. METHODS: On the basis of data from a total number of 912 positive BCs collected within 140 consecutive days and work flow analyses of laboratory diagnostics, we evaluated different models to assess the TATs for batch-wise and for immediate response (real-time) MALDI-TOF MS pathogen identification of positive BC results during the night shifts. The results were compared to TATs from routine BC processing and biochemical identification performed during regular working hours. RESULTS: Continuous BC incubation together with batch-wise MALDI-TOF MS analysis enabled significant reductions of up to 58.7 h in the mean TATs for the reporting of the bacterial species. The TAT of batch-wise MALDI-TOF MS analysis was inferior by a mean of 4.9 h when compared to the model of the immediate work flow under ideal conditions with no constraints in staff availability. CONCLUSIONS: Together with continuous cultivation of BC, the 24-h availability of MALDI-TOF MS can reduce the TAT for microbial pathogen identification within a routine clinical laboratory setting. Batch-wise testing of positive BC loses a few hours compared to real-time identification but is still far superior to classical BC processing.

Price_2007_Clinchem,JOUR,Improving healthcare accessibility through point-of-care technologies,"Price, Christopher P. and Kricka, Larry J.",Clinical chemistry,"BACKGROUND: The NIH is committed to improving healthcare quality in the US and has set up initiatives to address problems such as the fragmented nature of healthcare provision. A hypothesis has been developed that testing closer to the point at which care is delivered may reduce fragmentation of care and improve outcomes. METHODS: The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the National Science Foundation sponsored a workshop, ""Improving Health Care Accessibility through Point-of-Care Technologies,"" in April 2006. The workshop assessed the clinical needs and opportunities for point-of-care (POC) technologies in primary care, the home, and emergency medical services and reviewed minimally invasive and noninvasive testing, including imaging, and conventional testing based on sensor and lab-on-a-chip technologies. Emerging needs of informatics and telehealth and healthcare systems engineering were considered in the POC testing context. Additionally, implications of evidence-based decision-making were reviewed, particularly as it related to the challenges in producing reliable evidence, undertaking regulation, implementing evidence responsibly, and integrating evidence into health policy. RESULTS: Many testing procedures were considered to be valuable in the clinical settings discussed. Technological solutions were proposed to meet these needs, as well as the practical requirements around clinical process change and regulation. From these considerations, a series of recommendations was formulated for development of POC technologies based on input from the symposium attendees. CONCLUSION: NIBIB has developed a funding initiative to establish a Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network that will work to bridge the technology/clinical gap and provide the partnerships necessary for the application of technologies to pressing clinical needs in POC testing.",2007,10.1373/clinchem.2006.084707,53,9,1665-1675,eng,0009-9147,United States and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and *Health Services Accessibility and *Clinical Laboratory Techniques and *Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures and *National Institutes of Health (U.S.) and Biomedical Technology/trends and Computational Biology/trends and Point-of-Care Systems/*organization & administration and Telemedicine/trends,NA,NA,2007/09//undefined,Clin Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA
