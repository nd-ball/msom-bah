CAD uses machine learning methods to analyze imaging and/or nonimaging patient data and makes assessment of the patient's condition, which can then be used to assist clinicians in their decision-making process. The recent success of the deep learning technology in machine learning spurs new research and development efforts to improve CAD performance and to develop CAD for many other complex clinical tasks. In this paper, we discuss the potential and challenges in developing CAD tools using deep learning technology or artificial intelligence (AI) in general, the pitfalls and lessons learned from CAD in screening mammography and considerations needed for future implementation of CAD or AI in clinical use.

Mahadevaiah_2020_Mediphys,JOUR,"Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support in modern medical physics: Selection, acceptance, commissioning, and quality assurance","Mahadevaiah, Geetha and Rv, Prasad and Bermejo, Inigo and Jaffray, David and Dekker, Andre and Wee, Leonard",Medical physics,"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in machine and deep learning based on an increased availability of clinical data have fueled renewed interest in computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). CDSSs have shown great potential to improve healthcare, increase patient safety and reduce costs. However, the use of CDSSs is not without pitfalls, as an inadequate or faulty CDSS can potentially deteriorate the quality of healthcare and put patients at risk. In addition, the adoption of a CDSS might fail because its intended users ignore the output of the CDSS due to lack of trust, relevancy or actionability. AIM: In this article, we provide guidance based on literature for the different aspects involved in the adoption of a CDSS with a special focus on machine and deep learning based systems: selection, acceptance testing, commissioning, implementation and quality assurance. RESULTS: A rigorous selection process will help identify the CDSS that best fits the preferences and requirements of the local site. Acceptance testing will make sure that the selected CDSS fulfills the defined specifications and satisfies the safety requirements. The commissioning process will prepare the CDSS for safe clinical use at the local site. An effective implementation phase should result in an orderly roll out of the CDSS to the well-trained end-users whose expectations have been managed. And finally, quality assurance will make sure that the performance of the CDSS is maintained and that any issues are promptly identified and solved. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a systematic approach to the adoption of a CDSS will help avoid pitfalls, improve patient safety and increase the chances of success.",2020,10.1002/mp.13562,47,5,e228-e235,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"machine learning and artificial intelligence and clinical decision support and Humans and *Quality Assurance, Health Care and *Artificial Intelligence and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Physics",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Eighty simultaneous [(18)F]florbetaben PET/MRI studies were acquired, split equally between two sites (site 1: Signa PET/MRI, GE Healthcare, 39 participants, 67 <c2><b1> 8 years, 23 females; site 2: mMR, Siemens Healthineers, 64 <c2><b1> 11 years, 23 females) with different MRI protocols. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET data (90-110 min post-injection) were reconstructed as ground-truth. Ultra-low-count data obtained from undersampling by a factor of 100 (site 1) or the first minute of PET acquisition (site 2) were reconstructed for ultra-low-dose/ultra-short-time (1% dose and 5% time, respectively) PET images.

We investigate the use of machine learning (ML) methods for possible visualization, automation, and targeting of QA, and assess its performance using multi-institutional data. METHODS: To enable automated analysis of QA data given its higher dimensional nature, we used nonlinear kernel mapping with support vector data description (SVDD) driven approaches. Instead of using labeled data as in typical support vector machine (SVM) applications, which requires exhaustive annotation, we applied a clustering extension of SVDD, which identifies the minimal enclosing hypersphere in the feature space defined by a kernel function separating normal operations from possible failures (i.e., outliers). In our case, QA test data are mapped by a Gaussian kernel to a higher dimensional feature space and then the minimal enclosing sphere was identified. This sphere, when mapped back to the input data space along the principal components, can separate the data into several components, each enclosing a separate cluster of QA points that could be used to evaluate tolerance boundaries and test reliability. We evaluated this approach for gantry sag, radiation field shift, and [multileaf collimator (MLC)] offset data acquired using electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), as representative examples. RESULTS: Data from eight LINACS and seven institutions (n = 119) were collected. A standardized EPID image of a phantom with fiducials provided deviation estimates between the radiation field and phantom center at four cardinal gantry angles. Deviation measurements in the horizontal direction (0<c2><b0>, 180<c2><b0>) were used to determine the gantry sag and deviations in the vertical direction (90<c2><b0>, 270<c2><b0>) were used to determine the field shift. These measurements were fed into the SVDD clustering algorithm with varying hypersphere radii (Gaussian widths). For gantry sag analysis, two clusters were identified one of which contained 2.5% of the outliers and also exceeded the 1 mm tolerance set by TG-142. In the case of field shifts, SVM clustering identified two distinct classes of measurements primarily driven by variations in the second principal component at 270<c2><b0>. Results from MLC analysis identified one outlier cluster (0.34%) along Leaf offset Constancy (LoC) axis that coincided with TG-142 limits.

With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security measures and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity. METHODS: In this paper, we implement cyclic weight transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multisite learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions. RESULTS: The MSL model attains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0.914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0.646 and average correlation of 0.871.

Zhuge_2020_Mediphys,JOUR,Automated glioma grading on conventional MRI images using deep convolutional neural networks,"Zhuge, Ying and Ning, Holly and Mathen, Peter and Cheng, Jason Y. and Krauze, Andra V. and Camphausen, Kevin and Miller, Robert W.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: Gliomas are the most common primary tumor of the brain and are classified into grades I-IV of the World Health Organization (WHO), based on their invasively histological appearance. Gliomas grading plays an important role to determine the treatment plan and prognosis prediction. In this study we propose two novel methods for automatic, non-invasively distinguishing low-grade (Grades II and III) glioma (LGG) and high-grade (grade IV) glioma (HGG) on conventional MRI images by using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). METHODS: All MRI images have been preprocessed first by rigid image registration and intensity inhomogeneity correction. Both proposed methods consist of two steps: (a) three-dimensional (3D) brain tumor segmentation based on a modification of the popular U-Net model; (b) tumor classification on segmented brain tumor. In the first method, the slice with largest area of tumor is determined and the state-of-the-art mask R-CNN model is employed for tumor grading. To improve the performance of the grading model, a two-dimensional (2D) data augmentation has been implemented to increase both the amount and the diversity of the training images. In the second method, denoted as 3DConvNet, a 3D volumetric CNNs is applied directly on bounding image regions of segmented tumor for classification, which can fully leverage the 3D spatial contextual information of volumetric image data. RESULTS: The proposed schemes were evaluated on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) low grade glioma (LGG) data, and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) Benchmark 2018 training datasets with fivefold cross validation. All data are divided into training, validation, and test sets. Based on biopsy-proven ground truth, the performance metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are measured on the test sets. The results are 0.935 (sensitivity), 0.972 (specificity), and 0.963 (accuracy) for the 2D Mask R-CNN based method, and 0.947 (sensitivity), 0.968 (specificity), and 0.971 (accuracy) for the 3DConvNet method, respectively. In regard to efficiency, for 3D brain tumor segmentation, the program takes around ten and a half hours for training with 300 epochs on BraTS 2018 dataset and takes only around 50 s for testing of a typical image with a size of 160 * 216 * 176. For 2D Mask R-CNN based tumor grading, the program takes around 4 h for training with around 60 000 iterations, and around 1 s for testing of a 2D slice image with size of 128 * 128. For 3DConvNet based tumor grading, the program takes around 2 h for training with 10 000 iterations, and 0.25 s for testing of a 3D cropped image with size of 64 * 64 * 64, using a DELL PRECISION Tower T7910, with two NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs. CONCLUSIONS: Two effective glioma grading methods on conventional MRI images using deep convolutional neural networks have been developed. Our methods are fully automated without manual specification of region-of-interests and selection of slices for model training, which are common in traditional machine learning based brain tumor grading methods. This methodology may play a crucial role in selecting effective treatment options and survival predictions without the need for surgical biopsy.",2020,10.1002/mp.14168,47,7,3044-3053,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"deep learning and Humans and Machine Learning and convolutional neural networks and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted and Neural Networks, Computer and brain tumor and *Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging and *Glioma/diagnostic imaging and Glioma grading and MRI image",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

D. and Hirata, E. and Valdes, G. and Witztum, A.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics","PURPOSE: Our purpose was to assess the use of machine learning methods and Mobius 3D (M3D) dose calculation software to reduce the number of physical ion chamber (IC) dose measurements required for patient-specific quality assurance during corona virus disease 2019. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, 1464 inversely planned treatments using Pinnacle or Raystation treatment planning software (TPS) were delivered using Elekta Versa HD and Varian Truebeam and Truebeam STx linear accelerators between June 2018 and November 2019. For each plan, an independent dose calculation was performed using M3D, and an absolute dose measurement was taken using a Pinpoint IC inside the Mobius phantom. The point dose differences between the TPS and M3D calculation and between TPS and IC measurements were calculated. Agreement between the TPS and IC was used to define the ground truth plan failure. To reduce the on-site personnel during the pandemic, 2 methods of receiver operating characteristic analysis (n = 1464) and machine learning (n = 603) were used to identify patient plans that would require physical dose measurements. RESULTS: In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, a predelivery M3D difference threshold of 3% identified plans that failed an IC measurement at a 4% threshold with 100% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity. This indicates that fewer than 25% of plans required a physical dose measurement. A threshold of 1% on a machine learning model was able to identify plans that failed an IC measurement at a 3% threshold with 100% sensitivity and 54.3% specificity, leading to fewer than 50% of plans that required a physical dose measurement.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred three VMAT plans, including 176 gynecologic cancer and 127 head and neck cancer plans, were chosen in this study. Fifty-four complexity metrics were extracted from the QA plans and considered as inputs. Patient-specific QA was performed, and gamma passing rates (GPRs) were used as outputs. One Poisson lasso (PL) regression model was developed, aiming to predict individual GPR, and 1 random forest (RF) classification model was developed to classify QA results as ""pass"" or ""fail."" Both technical validation (TV) and clinical validation (CV) were used to evaluate the model reliability. GPR prediction accuracy of PL and classification performance of PL and RF were evaluated. RESULTS: In TV, the mean prediction error of PL was 1.81%, 2.39%, and 4.18% at 3%/3 mm, 3%/2 mm, and 2%/2 mm, respectively. No significant differences in prediction errors between TV and CV were observed. In QA results classification, PL had a higher specificity (accurately identifying plans that can pass QA), whereas RF had a higher sensitivity (accurately identifying plans that may fail QA). By using 90% as the action limit at a 3%/2 mm criterion, the specificity of PL and RF was 97.5% and 87.7% in TV and 100% and 71.4% in CV, respectively. The sensitivity of PL and RF was 31.6% and 100% in TV and 33.3% and 100% in CV, respectively. With 100% sensitivity, the QA workload of 81.2% of plans in TV and 62.5% of plans in CV could be reduced by RF. CONCLUSIONS: The PL model could accurately predict GPR for most VMAT plans.

This process can be time-consuming and not altogether instructive due to the myriad sources that may produce a failing result. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm capable of predicting IMRT QA passing rates a priori. METHODS: From all treatment, 498 IMRT plans sites were planned in eclipse version 11 and delivered using a dynamic sliding window technique on Clinac iX or TrueBeam Linacs. 3%/3 mm local dose/distance-to-agreement (DTA) was recorded using a commercial 2D diode array. Each plan was characterized by 78 metrics that describe different aspects of their complexity that could lead to disagreements between the calculated and measured dose. A Poisson regression with Lasso regularization was trained to learn the relation between the plan characteristics and each passing rate. RESULTS: Passing rates 3%/3 mm local dose/DTA can be predicted with an error smaller than 3% for all plans analyzed. The most important metrics to describe the passing rates were determined to be the MU factor (MU per Gy), small aperture score, irregularity factor, and fraction of the plan delivered at the corners of a 40 * 40 cm field. The higher the value of these metrics, the worse the passing rates.

Although the definite diagnosis is routinely made ex vivo by histopathologic and molecular examination, diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected glioma is mainly done using MRI. Nevertheless, l-S-methyl-(11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET holds great potential in the characterization of gliomas. The aim of this study was to establish machine-learning-driven survival models for glioma built on in vivo (11)C-MET PET characteristics, ex vivo characteristics, and patient characteristics. Methods: The study included 70 patients with a treatment-naive glioma that was (11)C-MET-positive and had histopathology-derived ex vivo feature extraction, such as World Health Organization 2007 tumor grade, histology, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H mutational status. The (11)C-MET-positive primary tumors were delineated semiautomatically on PET images, followed by the extraction of tumor-to-background-based general and higher-order textural features by applying 5 different binning approaches. In vivo and ex vivo features, as well as patient characteristics (age, weight, height, body mass index, Karnofsky score), were merged to characterize the tumors. Machine-learning approaches were used to identify relevant in vivo, ex vivo, and patient features and their relative weights for predicting 36-mo survival. The resulting feature weights were used to establish 3 predictive models per binning configuration: one model based on a combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and clinical patient information (M36(IEP)); another based on in vivo and patient information only (M36(IP)); and a third based on in vivo information only (M36(I)). In addition, a binning-independent model based on ex vivo and patient information only (M36(EP)) was created. The established models were validated in a Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme. Results: The most prominent machine-learning-selected and -weighted features were patient-based and ex vivo-based, followed by in vivo-based.

Patient safety issues are forcing us to, not only acknowledge that incidents do occur, but also actively develop the means for assessing and managing the risks of such incidents. To do this, we ideally need to know the probability of an incident's occurrence, the consequences or severity for the patient should it occur, and the basic causes of the incident. A structured approach to the description of failure modes is helpful in terms of communication, avoidance of ambiguity, and, ultimately, decision making for resource allocation. In this report, several classification schemes or taxonomies for use in risk assessment and management are discussed. In particular, a recently developed approach that reflects the activity domains through which the patient passes and that can be used as a basis for quantifying incident severity is described.

Therefore, adopting low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) technology has become a major focus in the CT imaging field. One of these LDCT technologies is downsampling data acquisition during low-dose x-ray imaging processes. However, reducing the radiation dose can adversely affect CT image quality by introducing noise and artifacts in the resultant image that can compromise diagnostic information. In this paper, we propose an artifact correction method for downsampling CT reconstruction based on deep learning. METHOD: We used clinical dental CT data with low-dose artifacts reconstructed by conventional filtered back projection (FBP) as inputs to a deep neural network and corresponding high-quality labeled normal-dose CT data during training. We trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) with Wasserstein distance (WGAN) and mean squared error (MSE) loss, called m-WGAN, to remove artifacts and obtain high-quality CT dental images in a clinical dental CT examination environment. RESULTS: The experimental results confirmed that the proposed algorithm effectively removes low-dose artifacts from dental CT scans. In addition, we showed that the proposed method is efficient for removing noise from low-dose CT scan images compared to existing approaches. We compared the performances of the general GAN, convolutional neural networks, and m-WGAN. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results, we concluded that the proposed m-WGAN method resulted in better artifact correction performance preserving the texture in dental CT scanning. CONCLUSIONS: The image quality evaluation metrics indicated that the proposed method effectively improves image quality when used as a postprocessing technique for dental CT images. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning architecture used with a commercial cone-beam dental CT scanner.

Kertzscher_2014_Mediphys,JOUR,Adaptive error detection for HDR/PDR brachytherapy: guidance for decision making during real-time in vivo point dosimetry,"Kertzscher, Gustavo and Andersen, Claus E. and Tanderup, Kari",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: This study presents an adaptive error detection algorithm (AEDA) for real-time in vivo point dosimetry during high dose rate (HDR) or pulsed dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy (BT) where the error identification, in contrast to existing approaches, does not depend on an a priori reconstruction of the dosimeter position. Instead, the treatment is judged based on dose rate comparisons between measurements and calculations of the most viable dosimeter position provided by the AEDA in a data driven approach. As a result, the AEDA compensates for false error cases related to systematic effects of the dosimeter position reconstruction. Given its nearly exclusive dependence on stable dosimeter positioning, the AEDA allows for a substantially simplified and time efficient real-time in vivo BT dosimetry implementation. METHODS: In the event of a measured potential treatment error, the AEDA proposes the most viable dosimeter position out of alternatives to the original reconstruction by means of a data driven matching procedure between dose rate distributions. If measured dose rates do not differ significantly from the most viable alternative, the initial error indication may be attributed to a mispositioned or misreconstructed dosimeter (false error). However, if the error declaration persists, no viable dosimeter position can be found to explain the error, hence the discrepancy is more likely to originate from a misplaced or misreconstructed source applicator or from erroneously connected source guide tubes (true error). RESULTS: The AEDA applied on two in vivo dosimetry implementations for pulsed dose rate BT demonstrated that the AEDA correctly described effects responsible for initial error indications. The AEDA was able to correctly identify the major part of all permutations of simulated guide tube swap errors and simulated shifts of individual needles from the original reconstruction. Unidentified errors corresponded to scenarios where the dosimeter position was sufficiently symmetric with respect to error and no-error source position constellations. The AEDA was able to correctly identify all false errors represented by mispositioned dosimeters contrary to an error detection algorithm relying on the original reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the AEDA error identification during HDR/PDR BT relies on a stable dosimeter position rather than on an accurate dosimeter reconstruction, and the AEDA's capacity to distinguish between true and false error scenarios. The study further shows that the AEDA can offer guidance in decision making in the event of potential errors detected with real-time in vivo point dosimetry.",2014,10.1118/1.4870438,41,5,052102,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"Uncertainty and Decision Making and *Algorithms and Medical Errors/*prevention & control and Radiotherapy Dosage and Brachytherapy/instrumentation/*methods and Radiometry/*methods and Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods",NA,NA,2014/05//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dimitrios and van den Berg, Nynke S. and Rosenthal, Eben L.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Although surgical resection has been the primary treatment modality of solid tumors for decades, surgeons still rely on visual cues and palpation to delineate healthy from cancerous tissue. This may contribute to the high rate (up to 30%) of positive margins in head and neck cancer resections. Margin status in these patients is the most important prognostic factor for overall survival. In addition, second primary lesions may be present at the time of surgery. Although often unnoticed by the medical team, these lesions can have significant survival ramifications. We hypothesize that real-time fluorescence imaging can enhance intraoperative decision making by aiding the surgeon in detecting close or positive margins and visualizing unanticipated regions of primary disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical utility of real-time fluorescence imaging for intraoperative decision making. Methods: Head and neck cancer patients (n = 14) scheduled for curative resection were enrolled in a clinical trial evaluating panitumumab-IRDye800CW for surgical guidance (NCT02415881). Open-field fluorescence imaging was performed throughout the surgical procedure. The fluorescence signal was quantified as signal-to-background ratios to characterize the fluorescence contrast of regions of interest relative to background.

Kalet_2017_Mediphys,JOUR,Developing Bayesian networks from a dependency-layered ontology: A proof-of-concept in radiation oncology,"Kalet, Alan M. and Doctor, Jason N. and Gennari, John H. and Phillips, Mark H.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical representations of probabilistic knowledge that offer normative reasoning under uncertainty and are well suited for use in medical domains. Traditional knowledge-based network development of BN topology requires that modeling experts establish relevant dependency links between domain concepts by searching and translating published literature, querying domain experts, or applying machine learning algorithms on data. For initial development these methods are time-intensive and this cost hinders the growth of BN applications in medical decision making. Further, this approach fails to utilize knowledge representation in medical fields to automate network development. Our research alleviates the challenges surrounding BN modeling in radiation oncology by leveraging an ontology based hub and spoke system for BN construction. METHODS: We implement a hub and spoke system by developing (a) an ontology of knowledge in radiation oncology (the hub) which includes dependency semantics similar to BN relations and (b) a software tool that operates on ontological semantics using deductive reasoning to create BN topologies (the spokes). We demonstrate that network topologies built using the software are terminologically consistent and form networks that are topologically compatible with existing ones. We do this first by merging two different BN models for prostate cancer radiotherapy prediction which contain domain cross terms. We then use the logic to perform discovery of new causal chains between radiation oncology concepts. RESULTS: From the radiation oncology (RO) ontology we successfully reconstructed a previously published prostate cancer radiotherapy Bayes net using up-to-date domain knowledge. Merging this model with another similar prostate cancer model in the RO domain produced a larger, highly interconnected model representing the expanded scope of knowledge available regarding prostate cancer therapy parameters, complications, and outcomes. The causal discovery resulted in an automatically-built causal network model of all ontologized radiotherapy concepts between a 'Mucositis' complication and anatomic tumor location. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model building approach lowers barriers to developing probabilistic models relevant to real-world clinical decision making, and offers a solution to the consistency and compatibility problems. Further, the knowledge representation in this work demonstrates potential for broader radiation oncology applications outside of Bayes nets.",2017,10.1002/mp.12340,44,8,4350-4359,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,Software and Humans and Male and Bayesian and ontology and *Algorithms and *Bayes Theorem and Neoplasms/radiotherapy and informatics and machine-learning and *Radiation Oncology,NA,NA,2017/08//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

The currently licensed imaging modalities are limited by lack of specificity or sensitivity for the extent of cancer and for predicting outcome in response to therapy. Clinicians want molecular imaging that-by being more reliable in tailoring treatment and monitoring response for each patient-will become a key facet of precision medicine, surgery, and radiation therapy. Identifying patients who are candidates for specific or novel treatments is important, but equally important is the finding that a given patient may not be a good candidate for single-modality therapy. This article presents prostate cancer scenarios in which managing clinicians would welcome molecular imaging innovations to help with decision making.

Ma_2021_Mediphys,JOUR,The structural similarity index for IMRT quality assurance: radiomics-based error classification,"Ma, Chaoqiong and Wang, Ruoxi and Zhou, Shun and Wang, Meijiao and Yue, Haizhen and Zhang, Yibao and Wu, Hao",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: The implementation of radiomics and machine learning (ML) techniques on analyzing two-dimensional gamma maps has been demonstrated superior to the conventional gamma analysis for error identification in intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA). Recently, the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) sub-index maps were shown to be able to reveal the error types of the dose distributions. In this study, we aimed to apply radiomics analysis on SSIM sub-index maps and develop ML models to classify delivery errors in patient-specific dynamic IMRT QA. METHODS: Twenty-one sliding-window IMRT plans of 180 beams for three treatment sites were involved in this study. Four types of machine-related errors of various magnitudes were simulated for each beam at each control point, including the monitor unit (MU) variations, same-directional and opposite-directional shifts of the multileaf collimators (MLCs) and random mispositioning of the MLCs. In the QA process, a total of 1620 portal dose (PD) images were acquired for the beams with and without errors. The predicted PD images of the original beams were set as references. To quantify the agreement between a measured PD image and the corresponding predicted PD image, four difference maps including three SSIM sub-index maps, and one dose difference-derived map were calculated. Then, radiomic features were extracted from the four difference maps of each measured PD image. We tested four typical classifiers including linear discriminant classifier (LDC), two supporting vector machine (SVM) classifiers, and random forest (RF) for this multiclass classification task. A nested cross-validation scheme was used for model evaluations, where the SVM recursive feature elimination method was applied for feature selection. Finally, the performance of the ML model on identifying the error-free and the erroneous cases was compared to that of the conventional gamma analysis. RESULTS: The statistics of the selected features showed that all of the difference maps and the feature categories made balanced contributions to solve this classification task. Best performance was achieved by the Linear-SVM model with average overall classification accuracy of 0.86. Specifically, the average classification accuracies of the shift, opening, and the random errors were around 0.9. Moreover, ~80% of error-free and MU errors were correctly classified. Using gamma analysis, the 3 mm/3% criterion was found insensitive to errors (sensitivity was only 0.33). Although the sensitivity to errors with the 2 mm/2% criterion increased to 0.79, still 8% worse than that of the ML model. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed an ML-based method for machine-related error identification in patient-specific dynamic IMRT QA, where radiomic analysis on SSIM sub-index maps were used for feature extraction. With extensive validation to select the best features and classifiers, high accuracies in error classification were achieved. Compared with the conventional gamma threshold method, this approach has great potential in error identification for the patient-specific IMRT QA process.",2021,10.1002/mp.14559,48,1,80-93,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"machine learning and Humans and Machine Learning and Gamma Rays and *Quality Assurance, Health Care and Radiotherapy Dosage and quality assurance and radiomics and *Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated and IMRT QA and Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted and SSIM analysis",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nakajima_2015_Jonm.opSoNM,JOUR,Cardiac 123I-MIBG Imaging for Clinical Decision Making: 22-Year Experience in Japan,"Nakajima, Kenichi and Nakata, Tomoaki","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Cardiac neuroimaging with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) has been officially used in clinical practice in Japan since 1992. The nuclear cardiology guidelines of the Japanese Circulation Society, revised in 2010, recommended cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging for the management of heart failure (HF) patients, particularly for the assessment of HF severity and prognosis of HF patients. Consensus in North American and European countries regarding incorporation into clinical practice, however, has not been established yet. This article summarizes 22 y of clinical applications in Japan of (123)I-MIBG imaging in the field of cardiology; these applications are reflected in cardiology guidelines, including recent methodologic advances. A standardized cardiac (123)I-MIBG parameter, the heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR), is the basis for clinical decision making and enables common use of parameters beyond differences in institutions and studies. Several clinical studies unanimously demonstrated its potent independent roles in prognosis evaluation and risk stratification irrespective of HF etiologies. An HMR of less than 1.6-1.8 and an accelerated washout rate are recognized as high-risk indicators of pump failure death, sudden cardiac death, and fatal arrhythmias and have independent and incremental prognostic values together with known clinical variables, such as left ventricular ejection fraction and brain natriuretic peptide. Another possible use of this imaging technique is the selection of therapeutic strategy, such as pharmacologic treatment and nonpharmacologic treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization device; however, this possibility remains to be investigated. Recent multiple-cohort database analyses definitively demonstrated that patients who were at low risk for lethal events and who were defined by an HMR of greater than 2.0 on (123)I-MIBG studies had a good long-term prognosis. Future investigations of cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging will contribute to better risk stratification of low-risk and high-risk populations, to the establishment of cost-effective use of this imaging technique for the management of HF patients, and to worldwide acceptance of this imaging technique in clinical cardiology practice.",2015,10.2967/jnumed.114.142794,56 Suppl 4,NA,11S-19S,eng,1535-5667 0161-5505,"Humans and Decision Making and Prognosis and risk stratification and heart failure and Societies, Medical and Japan and Phantoms, Imaging and Radionuclide Imaging and prognosis and Radiopharmaceuticals and *3-Iodobenzylguanidine and 123I-MIBG and Cardiology/methods/standards and Heart Failure/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging and Heart Transplantation and Heart/*diagnostic imaging and scintigraphic technique and Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,J Nucl Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

SBME is used in radiation oncology, although the type and extent are not clear. This study reports a systematic literature review designed to clarify the type and extent of radiation oncology SBME. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The systematic review focused on radiation oncology SBME literature. The methods followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The inclusion criteria were identified according to the PICOS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and setting) framework. The population included undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education learners. Studies were limited to English-language studies published on or after January 1, 1990, in peer-reviewed journals. PubMed, MedEdPORTAL, and in-press articles were searched. The PubMed search was conducted using predefined search terms. References and similar articles were examined. Medical Subject Headings terms in selected articles were reviewed to ensure relevant terms were included. RESULTS: Fifty-four SBME publications met the inclusion criteria. Only 9 of 54 studies (17%) self-identified as SBME. SBME types included screen-based simulators (56%), simulated environments (13%), virtual reality and haptic systems (13%), simulated patients (11%), part-task trainers (6%), and computer-based systems with mannequins (2%).

Little is known, however, about the factors considered when selecting visiting professors (VPs) or whether this practice reflects objective criteria. We sought to characterize the process and diversity of participants in visiting professorships within academic radiation oncology (RO) to determine whether opportunities are equitably distributed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surveys were distributed to program directors (PDs) of every 2018 RO residency program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. PDs were asked to identify all VPs over the past 2 years and to describe their departments' decision-making processes. Publicly available demographic and academic characteristics were obtained for each VP, and results were compared by VP gender and hosting program (HP) 2019 Doximity rank using the <cf><87>(2) test for categorical data and t test for continuous data. RESULTS: The PD response rate was 60 of 93 (65%); 6 surveys were <e2><89><a5>50% incomplete and were excluded. Over a 2-year timeframe, 51 of 54 departments hosted 233 VPs, of whom 29% were women. The mean number of hosted VPs (5; range, 1-19) and gender distribution (35% women; range, 0-100%) did not significantly differ by HP rank (P = .17 and 0.65, respectively), nor did the selection criteria by which VPs were primarily chosen (subject matter expertise, teaching reputation, and resident interest). Women received significantly lower honoraria amounts than men (P = .035) despite no significant differences by gender in academic rank (P = .71), VP department rank (0.19), or M-index (0.83). CONCLUSION: Although sample size is limited, this study suggests that academic RO programs have a relatively equitable approach to selecting VPs that emphasizes trainee education and reflects the gender diversity of RO faculty more generally.

However, changes in clinical practice over time can affect the measures and patient outcomes and, hence, the collected data. We hypothesize that regular prediction model updates and continuous prospective data collection are important to prevent the degradation of a model's predication accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Clinical and dosimetric data from head and neck patients receiving intensity modulated radiation therapy from 2008 to 2015 were prospectively collected as a routine clinical workflow and anonymized for this analysis. Prediction models for grade <e2><89><a5>2 xerostomia at 3 to 6 months of follow-up were developed by bivariate logistic regression using the dose-volume histogram of parotid and submandibular glands. A baseline prediction model was developed with a training data set from 2008 to 2009. The selected predictor variables and coefficients were updated by 4 different model updating methods. (A) The prediction model was updated by using only recent 2-year data and applied to patients in the following test year. (B) The model was updated by increasing the training data set yearly. (C) The model was updated by increasing the training data set on the condition that the area under the curve (AUC) of the recent test year was less than 0.6. (D) The model was not updated. The AUC of the test data set was compared among the 4 model updating methods. RESULTS: Dose to parotid and submandibular glands and grade of xerostomia showed decreasing trends over the years (2008-2015, 297 patients; P < .001). The AUC of predicting grade <e2><89><a5>2 xerostomia for the initial training data set (2008-2009, 41 patients) was 0.6196. The AUC for the test data set (2010-2015, 256 patients) decreased to 0.5284 when the initial model was not updated (D). However, the AUC was significantly improved by model updates (A: 0.6164; B: 0.6084; P < .05). When the model was conditionally updated, the AUC was 0.6072 (C). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrate that updating prediction models with prospective data collection is effective for maintaining the performance of xerostomia prediction.

Blanco and Olszanski, Arthur and Both, Stefan and Low, Daniel A. and White, Benjamin M.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: To develop a quantitative early decision making metric for prediction of breathing pattern and irregular breathing and validate the metric in a large patient population receiving clinical phase-sorted four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). METHODS: This study employed three patient cohorts. The first cohort contained 47 patients, imaged with a nonclinical tidal volume metric. The second cohort contained a sample of 256 patients who received a clinical 4DCT. The third cohort contained 86 patients who received three 4DCT scans at 1-week increment during the course of radiotherapy. The second and third cohorts did not have tidal volume measurements, as per standard radiation oncology clinical practice. Based on a previously published technique that used a single abdominal surrogate, the ratio of extreme inhalation tidal volume to normal inhalation tidal volume (<ce><ba>) metric was calculated and the patient breathing pattern was characterized. The use of a single surrogate precluded the use of a <ce><ba> determined by tidal volume, so a <ce><ba>(rel) was defined based on the amplitude of the surrogate. Patients were classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on a previously published technique, where Type 1 patients were apneic at end of exhalation and Type 2 patients exhibited forced respiration. The Ansari-Bradley test was used to determine the statistical similarity between the Type 1 and Type 2 distributions. A Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical similarities among the classified breathing types, <ce><ba>(rel), and the qualified medical physicist denoted breathing classification (regular or irregular). Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to quantitatively determine optimal cutoff value j(<ce><ba>) and efficiency cutoff value (<cf><84>(<ce><ba>)) <ce><ba>(rel) to provide a quantitative early warning of irregular breathing during 4DCT procedures. RESULTS: The statistical tests show a significant consistency for the breathing pattern classifications between the physiologically measured cohort #1 and the remaining cohorts. The classification types were statistically different between Type 1 and Type 2 patients over all cohorts. Values of <ce><ba>(rel) in excess of 1.72 indicated a substantial presence of irregular breathing that could negatively affect the quality of a 4DCT image dataset. Values of <ce><ba>(rel) in lower than 1.45 indicated minimal presence of irregular breathing. For values of <ce><ba>(rel) such that j(<ce><ba>) <e2><89><a4> <ce><ba>(rel) <e2><89><a4> <cf><84>(<ce><ba>), the decision to reacquire the 4DCT would be at the discretion of the physician. This accounted for only 11.9% of the patients in this study. The magnitude of <ce><ba>(rel) held consistent over three weeks of treatment for 73% of the patients in cohort #3. CONCLUSIONS: The decision making metric based on <ce><ba> was shown to be an accurate classifier of regular and irregular breathing patterns in a large patient population. Breathing type, as defined in a previous published work, was accurately classified by <ce><ba>(rel) with the use of a single respiratory surrogate compared to the physiological use of multiple respiratory surrogates.

METHODS: This study reviewed 89 (11)C-MET PET scans for 80 patients (20 scans for initial diagnosis of brain tumor and 69 scans for differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis). Final diagnosis and the effect on the intended management were obtained from the questionnaire to the referring physicians or directly from the medical records. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the (11)C-MET PET were evaluated. Regarding the management impact, the rate of scans that caused changes in intended management was also evaluated. Moreover, the occurrence of scans having detrimental diagnostic impact (DDI) and beneficial diagnostic impact (BDI) were evaluated. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of (11)C-MET PET was 87.8, 80.0, and 85.9%. The intended management was changed in 50.0% of the scans.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cohort of 333 patients with mainly stage III/IV melanoma having a PET/CT for clinical reasons was prospectively enrolled in our oncologic PET/CT registry between 2013 and 2015. Referring physicians completed questionnaires regarding their intended management for each patient before and after PET/CT. Management changes after PET/CT were classified as major and minor changes. A subgroup of 107 patients (stage I, N = 5; stage II, N = 3; stage III, N = 42; stage IV, N = 57) was planned for complete metastasectomy initially, based on conventional imaging. Management changes and outcome were evaluated by linkage with the information obtained from patients' medical records. RESULTS: In 28 of 107 patients (26%), the surgical treatment plan remained unchanged after PET/CT. In 24 patients (22%), minor changes were performed, such as enlargement or reduction of the surgical field. In 55 patients (51%, 95% CI 42%-61%) major changes of the intended treatment plan occurred; of those, 20 patients (19%) were classified to be tumor-free with PET/CT, 32 patients (30%) were found to have multiple previously unrecognized metastases and had to be treated by systemic therapy, three patients (3%) had to be changed to palliative radiotherapy or isolated extremity perfusion. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) in patients with complete metastasectomy (N = 52) was 90% and 79%, respectively.

METHODS: Data from 1967 consecutive breast radiotherapy (RT) courses at one institution between 2008 and 2015 were automatically extracted from EMRs and oncology information systems using extraction software. Over 230 variables were extracted spanning the following variable segments: patient demographics, medical/surgical history, tumor characteristics, RT treatment history, and AEs tracked using CTCAEv4.0. Treatment failure was extracted algorithmically by searching posttreatment encounters for evidence of local, nodal, or distant failure. Individual models were trained using decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, and boosted decision trees to predict treatment failures and AEs. Models were fit on 75% of the data and evaluated for probability calibration and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on the remaining test set. The impact of each variable segment was assessed by retraining without the segment and measuring change in AUC (<ce><94>AUC). RESULTS: All AUC values were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Ensemble methods outperformed single-model methods across all outcomes. The best ensemble method outperformed decision trees and logistic regression by an average AUC of 0.053 and 0.034, respectively. Model probabilities were well calibrated as evidenced by calibration curves. Excluding the patient medical history variable segment led to the largest AUC reduction in all models (Average <ce><94>AUC = -0.025), followed by RT treatment history (-0.021) and tumor information (-0.015).

Eric and Sung, Kisuk and Aleman, Dionne M. and Moreno-Centeno, Erick and Purdie, Thomas G. and McIntosh, Chris J.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: To test the use of well-studied and widely used classification methods alongside newly developed data-filtering techniques specifically designed for imbalanced-data classification in order to demonstrate proof of principle for an automated radiation therapy (RT) quality assurance process on prostate cancer treatment. METHODS: A series of acceptable (majority class, n = 61) and erroneous (minority class, n = 12) RT plans as well as a disjoint set of acceptable plans used to develop features (n = 273) were used to develop a dataset for testing. A series of five widely used imbalanced-data classification algorithms were tested with a modularized guided undersampling procedure that includes ensemble-outlier filtering and normalized-cut sampling. RESULTS: Hybrid methods including either ensemble-outlier filtering or both filtering and normalized-cut sampling yielded the strongest performance in identifying unacceptable treatment plans. Specifically, five methods demonstrated superior performance in both area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and false positive rate when the true positive rate is equal to one. Furthermore, ensemble-outlier filtering significantly improved results in all but one hybrid method (p < 0.01). Finally, ensemble-outlier filtering methods identified four minority instances that were considered outliers in over 96% of cross-validation iterations. Such instances may be considered distinct planning errors and merit additional inspection, providing potential areas of improvement for the planning process.

Effective communication skills are increasingly emphasized by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and are critical for a successful clinical practice. We present the design of a novel, pilot standardized patient (SP) program and the evaluation of communication skills among radiation oncology residents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two case scenarios were developed to challenge residents in the delivery of ""bad news"" to patients: one scenario regarding treatment failure and the other regarding change in treatment plan. Eleven radiation oncology residents paired with 6 faculty participated in this pilot program. Each encounter was scored by the SPs, observing faculty, and residents themselves based on the Kalamazoo guidelines. RESULTS: Overall resident performance ratings were ""good"" to ""excellent,"" with faculty assigning statistically significant higher scores and residents assigning lower scores. We found inconsistent inter rater agreement among faculty, residents, and SPs. SP feedback was also valuable in identifying areas of improvement, including more collaborative decision making and less use of medical jargon. CONCLUSIONS: The program was well received by residents and faculty and regarded as a valuable educational experience that could be used as an annual feedback tool. Poor inter rater agreement suggests a need for residents and faculty physicians to better calibrate their evaluations to true patient perceptions. High scores from faculty members substantiate the concern that resident evaluations are generally positive and nondiscriminating.

METHODS: A retrospective review of 77 patients undergoing hepatic chemoembolization between 1/2010-10/2010 was performed. Variables included: Radiation dose metrics[DAP, CD, number of cone beam CT and fluoroscopy time] and clinical parameters(BMI, session number, extrahepatic embolization, lesion number, chemoembolization regimen and lobe(s) treated). CD was the primary outcome measurement used for the dose model. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the association between dose metrics and predictive variables and assess the relative impact of each variable on dose. Variables were considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. Coefficient of determination(R2)and root mean square error(RMSE) were calculated for CD. R2 was used to evaluate goodness of fit and RMSE was used to establish a measurement of the typical size of the error in predicting the cumulative dose. RESULTS: Based on the multivariate analysis: higher BMI, regimen, single lesions, 1<c2><b0> tumor and initial session were statistically significant and incorporated into the following dose prediction model: Predicted Dose(mGy)= -672+BMI(56.3)+558(session #1)+1789(extrahepatic a. embolized)+232(1<c2><b0>tumor)+[-667(2-4 lesions)or - 12(>5 lesions)]+[370(dox-bead regimen)or 1618(ethiodol based regimen)]. Plots of the predicted vs actual CD were performed and the adjusted R2 for CD is 52.9%(RMSE = 697). The model is accurate at predicting 52% of the variation. When the model predicts a dosage of 1000 or 2000 mGy the actual dose interval ranges from 519-2519 mGy or 384-3616 mGy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Creating a radiation dose prediction model is feasible. This is the first known attempt at creating a dose model for image guided intervention and refinements to the model will be required to improve its accuracy.

METHODS: A systematic search of the indexed medical literature was done using appropriate keywords to identify relevant studies. Metrics of diagnostic test accuracy, viz. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were extracted from individual studies and combined using a random effects model to yield weighted mean pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The impact of timing of post-treatment scan, study quality and advancements in PET technology was explored through meta-regression. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies involving 2,335 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The weighted mean (95% CI) pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of post-treatment FDG PET(CT) for the primary site was 79.9% (73.7-85.2%), 87.5% (85.2-89.5%), 58.6% (52.6-64.5%) and 95.1% (93.5-96.5%), respectively.

METHODS: Detectability (d') was evaluated in phantom studies across a range of conditions. Images were generated using a numerical CT simulator. Trained observers performed 4-alternative forced choice (4-AFC) experiments across dose (1.3, 2.7, 4.0 mGy), pin size (4, 6, 8 mm), contrast (0.3%, 0.5%, 1.0%), and reconstruction (FBP, IMR), at fixed display window. A five-channel Laguerre-Gauss channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) was developed with internal noise added to the decision variable and/or to channel outputs, creating six different internal noise models. Semianalytic internal noise computation was tested against Monte Carlo and used to accelerate internal noise parameter optimization. Model parameters were estimated from all experiments at once using maximum likelihood on the probability correct, PC. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare models of different orders. The best model was selected according to AIC and used to predict detectability in blended FBP-IMR images, analyze trends in IMR detectability improvements, and predict dose savings with IMR. Predicted dose savings were compared against 4-AFC study results using physical CT phantom images. RESULTS: Detection in IMR was greater than FBP in all tested conditions. The CHO with internal noise proportional to channel output standard deviations, Model-k4, showed the best trade-off between fit and model complexity according to AICc. With parameters fixed, the model reasonably predicted detectability of human observers in blended FBP-IMR images. Semianalytic internal noise computation gave results equivalent to Monte Carlo, greatly speeding parameter estimation. Using Model-k4, the authors found an average detectability improvement of 2.7 <c2><b1> 0.4 times that of FBP. IMR showed greater improvements in detectability with larger signals and relatively consistent improvements across signal contrast and x-ray dose. In the phantom tested, Model-k4 predicted an 82% dose reduction compared to FBP, verified with physical CT scans at 80% reduced dose. CONCLUSIONS: IMR improves detectability over FBP and may enable significant dose reductions. A channelized Hotelling observer with internal noise proportional to channel output standard deviation agreed well with human observers across a wide range of variables, even across reconstructions with drastically different image characteristics. Utility of the model observer was demonstrated by predicting the effect of image processing (blending), analyzing detectability improvements with IMR across dose, size, and contrast, and in guiding real CT scan dose reduction experiments. Such a model observer can be applied in optimizing parameters in advanced iterative reconstruction algorithms as well as guiding dose reduction protocols in physical CT experiments.",2015,10.1118/1.4929973,42,10,6098-6111,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"Humans and Observer Variation and Quality Control and *Machine Learning and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods and *Tomography, X-Ray Computed and *Computer Simulation and Phantoms, Imaging and *Radiation Dosage",NA,NA,2015/10//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wunderlich_2013_Mediphys,JOUR,Utility as a rationale for choosing observer performance assessment paradigms for detection tasks in medical imaging,"Wunderlich, Adam and Abbey, Craig K.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: Studies of lesion detectability are often carried out to evaluate medical imaging technology. For such studies, several approaches have been proposed to measure observer performance, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the localization ROC (LROC), the free-response ROC (FROC), the alternative free-response ROC (AFROC), and the exponentially transformed FROC (EFROC) paradigms. Therefore, an experimenter seeking to carry out such a study is confronted with an array of choices. Traditionally, arguments for different approaches have been made on the basis of practical considerations (statistical power, etc.) or the gross level of analysis (case-level or lesion-level). This article contends that a careful consideration of utility should form the rationale for matching the assessment paradigm to the clinical task of interest. METHODS: In utility theory, task performance is commonly evaluated with total expected utility, which integrates the various event utilities against the probability of each event. To formalize the relationship between expected utility and the summary curve associated with each assessment paradigm, the concept of a ""natural"" utility structure is proposed. A natural utility structure is defined for a summary curve when the variables associated with the summary curve axes are sufficient for computing total expected utility, assuming that the disease prevalence is known. RESULTS: Natural utility structures for ROC, LROC, FROC, AFROC, and EFROC curves are introduced, clarifying how the utilities of correct and incorrect decisions are aggregated by summary curves. Further, conditions are given under which general utility structures for localization-based methodologies reduce to case-based assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings reveal how summary curves correspond to natural utility structures of diagnostic tasks, suggesting utility as a motivating principle for choosing an assessment paradigm.",2013,10.1118/1.4823755,40,11,111903,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"Humans and Decision Making and Algorithms and Probability and Predictive Value of Tests and ROC Curve and Software Design and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Observer Variation and Diagnostic Imaging/*methods/*standards",NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wu_2007_Mediphys,JOUR,Novel image registration quality evaluator (RQE) with an implementation for automated patient positioning in cranial radiation therapy,"Wu, Jian and Samant, Sanjiv S.",Medical physics,"In external beam radiation therapy, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and portal images are used to verify patient setup based either on a visual comparison or, less frequently, with automated registration algorithms. A registration algorithm can be trapped in local optima due to irregularity of patient anatomy, image noise and artifacts, and/or out-of-plane shifts, resulting in an incorrect solution. Thus, human observation, which is subjective, is still required to check the registration result. We propose to use a novel image registration quality evaluator (RQE) to automatically identify misregistrations as part of an algorithm-based decision-making process for verification of patient positioning. A RQE, based on an adaptive pattern classifier, is generated from a pair of reference and target images to determine the acceptability of a registration solution given an optimization process. Here we applied our RQE to patient positioning for cranial radiation therapy. We constructed two RQEs-one for the evaluation of intramodal registrations (i.e., portal-portal); the other for intermodal registrations (i.e., portal-DRR). Mutual information, because of its high discriminatory ability compared with other measures (i.e., correlation coefficient and partitioned intensity uniformity), was chosen as the test function for both RQEs. We adopted 1 mm translation and 1 degree rotation as the maximal acceptable registration errors, reflecting desirable clinical setup tolerances for cranial radiation therapy. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the RQE, including computations of sensitivity and specificity. The RQEs showed very good performance for both intramodal and intermodal registrations using simulated and phantom data. The sensitivity and the specificity were 0.973 and 0.936, respectively, for the intramodal RQE using phantom data. Whereas the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.961 and 0.758, respectively, for the intermodal RQE using phantom data. Phantom experiments also indicated our RQEs detected out-of-plane deviations exceeding 2.5 mm and 2.50. A preliminary retrospective clinical study of the RQE on cranial portal imaging also yielded good sensitivity > or = 0.857) and specificity (> or = 0.987). Clinical implementation of a RQE could potentially reduce the involvement of the human observer for routine patient positioning verification, while increasing setup accuracy and reducing setup verification time.",2007,10.1118/1.2736783,34,6,2099-2112,eng,0094-2405,"Humans and Algorithms and Sensitivity and Specificity and Reproducibility of Results and Quality Assurance, Health Care/*methods and *Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Posture and Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods and Subtraction Technique and Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods and Radiographic Image Enhancement/methods and Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy and Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods",NA,NA,2007/06//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

The classification of white blood cell images is crucial for leukemia diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to classify white blood cells by extracting discriminative information from cell segmentation and combining it with the fine-grained features. We propose a hybrid adversarial residual network with support vector machine (SVM), which utilizes the extracted features to improve the classification accuracy for human peripheral white cells. METHODS: Firstly, we segment the cell and nucleus by utilizing an adversarial residual network, which contains a segmentation network and a discriminator network. To extract features that can handle the inter-class consistency problem effectively, we introduce the adversarial residual network. Then, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) features and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, which can extract discriminative features from images of segmented cell nuclei. To utilize the representative features fully, a discriminative network is introduced to deal with neighboring information at different scales. Finally, we combine the vectors of HOG features with those of CNN features and feed them into a linear SVM to classify white blood cells into six types. RESULTS: We used three methods to evaluate the effect of leukocyte classification based on 5000 leukocyte images acquired from a local hospital. The first approach is to use the CNN features as the input of SVM to classify leukocytes, which achieved 94.23% specificity, 95.10% sensitivity, and 94.41% accuracy.

However, reading prostatectomy histopathology slides, which is basically for staging, is usually time consuming and differs from reading small biopsy specimens, which is mainly used for diagnosis. Generally, each prostatectomy specimen generates tens of large tissue sections and for each section, the malignant region needs to be delineated to assess the amount of tumor and its burden. With the aim of reducing the workload of pathologists, in this study, we focus on developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on a densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for whole-slide histopathology images to outline the malignant regions. METHODS: We use an efficient color normalization process based on ranklet transformation to automatically correct the intensity of the images. Additionally, we use spatial probability to segment the tissue structure regions for different tissue recognition patterns. Based on the segmentation, we incorporate a multidimensional structure into DenseNet to determine if a particular prostatic region is benign or malignant. RESULTS: As demonstrated by the experimental results with a test set of 2,663 images from 32 whole-slide prostate histopathology images, our proposed system achieved 0.726, 0.6306, and 0.5209 in the average of the Dice coefficient, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and Boundary F1 score measures, respectively.

It appears to be quite sensitive and effective for clinical management decision making. This metaanalysis summarizes the efficacy of (68)Ga-DOTATOC for several distinct indications and is intended to support approval of this agent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Methods: The major electronic medical databases were searched for relevant papers over the period from January 2001 to November 2015. Papers were selected for review in 3 categories: clinical trials that reported sensitivity and specificity, comparison studies with (111)In-octreotide, and change of management studies. All the eligible papers underwent Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) assessment, which was useful in the final selection of papers for review. Results: The initial search yielded 468 papers. After detailed evaluation, 17 papers were finally selected. Five types of studies emerged: workup of patients with symptoms and biomarker findings suggestive of NET, but with negative conventional imaging (3 papers, yield was only 13%); sensitivity (12 papers; sensitivity, 92%) and specificity (7 papers; specificity, 82%); identification of site of unknown primary in patients with metastatic NET (4 papers, yield was 44%); impact on subsequent NET patient management (4 papers, change in management in 51%); and comparison with (111)In-octreotide (2 papers, sensitivity of DOTATOC on a per-lesion basis was 100%, for (111)In-octreotide it was 78.2%; specificity was not available). Safety was not explicitly addressed in any study, but there were no reports of adverse events. Conclusion:(68)Ga-DOTATOC is useful for evaluating the presence and extent in disease for staging and restaging and for assisting in treatment decision making for patients with NET. It is also effective in locating the site of an unknown primary in NET patients who present with metastatic NET, but no known primary tumor. It also appears to be more accurate than (111)In-octreotide. Although (68)Ga-DOTATOC would seem to be useful in evaluating patients with suggestive symptoms and biomarker findings, it does not perform well in this setting and has low yield. Overall, it appears to be an excellent imaging agent to assess patients with known NET and frequently leads to a change in management.",2017,10.2967/jnumed.117.191197,58,9,1452-1458,eng,1535-5667 0161-5505,Humans and Sensitivity and Specificity and metaanalysis and systematic review and Diagnostic Imaging/*methods and *Organometallic Compounds and DOTATOC and neuroendocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumors/*diagnostic imaging and octreotide and Octreotide/*analogs & derivatives and pentetreotide,NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,J Nucl Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Radiomics is an emerging field that promises to improve on conventional imaging. In this study, we sought to apply a radiomics-based prediction model to the problem of diagnosing treatment effect after SRS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We included patients in the Johns Hopkins Health System who were treated with SRS for brain metastases who subsequently underwent resection for symptomatic growth. We also included cases of likely treatment effect in which lesions grew but subsequently regressed spontaneously. Lesions were segmented semiautomatically on preoperative T1 postcontrast and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging, and radiomic features were extracted with software developed in-house. Top-performing features on univariate logistic regression were entered into a hybrid feature selection/classification model, IsoSVM, with parameter optimization and further feature selection performed using leave-one-out cross-validation. Final model performance was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation with 100 repeats. All cases were independently reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist for comparison. RESULTS: We identified 82 treated lesions across 66 patients, with 77 lesions having pathologic confirmation. There were 51 radiomic features extracted per segmented lesion on each magnetic resonance imaging sequence. An optimized IsoSVM classifier based on top-ranked radiomic features had sensitivity and specificity of 65.38% and 86.67%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.81 on leave-one-out cross-validation. Only 73% of cases were classifiable by the neuroradiologist, with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 19%. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics holds promise for differentiating between treatment effect and true progression in brain metastases treated with SRS. A predictive model built on radiomic features from an institutional cohort performed well on cross-validation testing. These results warrant further validation in independent datasets.

Two major types of segmentation failures are observed in clinical practices: incorrect LV shape determination and incorrect valve-plane (VP) positioning. We have developed a technique to automatically detect these failures for both nongated and gated studies. METHODS: A standard Cedars-Sinai perfusion SPECT (quantitative perfusion SPECT [QPS]) algorithm was applied to derive LV contours in 318 consecutive (99m)Tc-sestamibi rest/stress MPS studies consisting of stress/rest scans with or without attenuation correction and gated stress/rest images (1,903 scans total). Two numeric parameters, shape quality control (SQC) and valve-plane quality control, were derived to categorize the respective contour segmentation failures. The results were compared with the visual classification of automatic contour adequacy by 3 experienced observers. RESULTS: The overall success of automatic LV segmentation in the 1,903 scans ranged from 66% on nongated images (incorrect shape, 8%; incorrect VP, 26%) to 87% on gated images (incorrect shape, 3%; incorrect VP, 10%). The overall interobserver agreement for visual classification of automatic LV segmentation was 61% for nongated scans and 80% for gated images; the agreement between gray-scale and color-scale display for these scans was 86% and 91%, respectively. To improve the reliability of visual evaluation as a reference, the cases with intra- and interobserver discrepancies were excluded, and the remaining 1,277 datasets were considered (101 with incorrect LV shape and 102 with incorrect VP position). For the SQC, the receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) was 1.0 +/- 0.00 for the overall dataset, with an optimal sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98%. The ROC-AUC was 1.0 in all specific datasets. The algorithm was also able to detect the VP position errors: VP overshooting with ROC-AUC, 0.91 +/- 0.01; sensitivity, 100%; and specificity, 70%; and VP undershooting with ROC-AUC, 0.96 +/- 0.01; sensitivity, 100%; and specificity, 70%.

In this work, we determined the optimum penalization factor (beta) for clinical use of Q.Clear and compared Q.Clear with standard PET reconstructions. METHODS: A National Electrical Manufacturers Association image-quality phantom was scanned on a time-of-flight PET/CT scanner and reconstructed using ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM), OSEM with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, and the Q.Clear algorithm (which also includes PSF modeling). Q.Clear was investigated for <ce><b2> (B) values of 100-1,000. Contrast recovery (CR) and background variability (BV) were measured from 3 repeated scans, reconstructed with the different algorithms. Fifteen oncology body (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were reconstructed using OSEM, OSEM PSF, and Q.Clear using B values of 200, 300, 400, and 500. These were visually analyzed by 2 scorers and scored by rank against a panel of parameters (overall image quality; background liver, mediastinum, and marrow image quality; noise level; and lesion detectability). RESULTS: As <ce><b2> is increased, the CR and BV decreases; Q.Clear generally gives a higher CR and lower BV than OSEM. For the smallest sphere reconstructed with Q.Clear B400, CR is 28.4% and BV 4.2%, with corresponding values for OSEM of 24.7% and 5.0%. For the largest hot sphere, Q.Clear B400 yields a CR of 75.2% and a BV of 3.8%, with corresponding values for OSEM of 64.4% and 4.0%. Scorer 1 and 2 ranked B400 as the preferred reconstruction in 13 of 15 (87%) and 10 of 15 (73%) cases. The least preferred reconstruction was OSEM PSF in all cases. In most cases, lesion detectability was highest ranked for B200, in 9 of 15 (67%) and 10 of 15 (73%), with OSEM PSF ranked lowest. Poor lesion detectability on OSEM PSF was seen in cases of mildly (18)F-FDG-avid mediastinal nodes in lung cancer and small liver metastases due to background noise. Conversely, OSEM PSF was ranked second highest for lesion detectability in most pulmonary nodule evaluation cases. The combined scores confirmed B400 to be the preferred reconstruction. CONCLUSION: Our phantom measurement results demonstrate improved CR and reduced BV when using Q.Clear instead of OSEM.

Mohan_2009_Jonm.opSoNM,JOUR,Cost-effectiveness of 99mTc-sestamibi in predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mohan, Hosahalli K. and Miles, Kenneth A.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in lung cancer. (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) has been demonstrated to be a noninvasive marker for the diagnosis of MDR-related P glycoprotein and MDR-associated protein expression in various solid tumors. Studies have shown that (99m)Tc-MIBI could play a significant role in the management of lung cancer; for example, it could be used in the selection of patients for chemotherapy or radiotherapy or in combined protocols before the start of treatment. Accurate selection of chemosensitive patients with (99m)Tc-MIBI would result not only in effective treatment of patients but also in significant cost savings for health care providers. There is increasing pressure on health care providers to consider costs in medical decision making, particularly in the last decade, as several economic evaluations have appeared in the medical literature. The aims of this study were to undertake a systematic review of the performance of (99m)Tc-MIBI imaging in the assessment of treatment resistance in lung cancer and to use the findings of the review in a decision tree analysis of the potential cost-effectiveness of (99m)Tc-MIBI imaging in selecting lung cancer patients for chemotherapy. METHODS: This study included a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis together with a cost-effectiveness analysis of studies with a decision tree analysis model. RESULTS: Analysis of the studies revealed that the overall sensitivity of (99m)Tc-MIBI in identifying responders to chemotherapy was 94%, the specificity was 90%, and the accuracy was 92%. The sensitivity analysis revealed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of greater than pound30,000 ( approximately $42,900) for the strategy of treating all patients to recover the small loss of life expectancy (7.5 d) associated with the use of (99m)Tc-MIBI to preselect patients for chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT can accurately predict which patients with lung cancer will respond to chemotherapy.

METHODS: A cohort of 176 patients was studied. The localization rate, accuracy, therapeutic impact on the presurgical decision-making process, and correlation with the postsurgical outcome were assessed for the tests commonly performed for seizure localization. Decision tree sensitivity analysis compared 3 imaging strategies with a baseline strategy of medical therapy for all: video-electroencephalography monitoring (VEM)/MRI strategy, in which patients underwent VEM and brain MRI only, and +SPECT and +PET strategies, in which patients with an indeterminate VEM/MRI result underwent ictal SPECT or interictal 18F-FDG PET, respectively. RESULTS: The localization rates for VEM, MRI, 18F-FDG PET, ictal SPECT, and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) were 62.2%, 35.8%, 75.0%, 60.0%, and 93.8%. The VEM/MRI strategy had the lowest cost per class I/II outcome, but the additional costs per class I/II outcome for the +PET and +SPECT strategies were always below the minimum reported cost savings for a class I/II outcome. There were no valid conditions in which the +SPECT strategy had a lower cost per class I/II outcome than the +PET strategy. Within the range of cost savings estimated to be associated with a class I/II outcome, all decision strategies produced net cost savings; however, these were significantly higher for the +PET and the +SPECT strategies.

Endometrium segmentation in transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) images is very challenging due to ambiguous boundaries and heterogeneous textures. In this study, we developed a new segmentation framework which provides robust segmentation against ambiguous boundaries and heterogeneous textures of TVUS images. METHODS: To achieve endometrium segmentation from TVUS images, we propose a new segmentation framework with a discriminator guided by four key points of the endometrium (namely, the endometrium cavity tip, the internal os of the cervix, and the two thickest points between the two basal layers on the anterior and posterior uterine walls). The key points of the endometrium are defined as meaningful points that are related to the characteristics of the endometrial morphology, namely the length and thickness of the endometrium. In the proposed segmentation framework, the key-point discriminator distinguishes a predicted segmentation map from a ground-truth segmentation map according to the key-point maps. Meanwhile, the endometrium segmentation network predicts accurate segmentation results that the key-point discriminator cannot discriminate. In this adversarial way, the key-point information containing endometrial morphology characteristics is effectively incorporated in the segmentation network. The segmentation network can accurately find the segmentation boundary while the key-point discriminator learns the shape distribution of the endometrium. Moreover, the endometrium segmentation can be robust to the heterogeneous texture of the endometrium. We conducted an experiment on a TVUS dataset that contained 3,372 sagittal TVUS images and the corresponding key points. The dataset was collected by three hospitals (Ewha Woman's University School of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, and Yonsei University College of Medicine) with the approval of the three hospitals' Institutional Review Board. For verification, fivefold cross-validation was performed. RESULT: The proposed key-point discriminator improved the performance of the endometrium segmentation, achieving 82.67 % for the Dice coefficient and 70.46% for the Jaccard coefficient. In comparison, on the TVUS images UNet, showed 58.69 % for the Dice coefficient and 41.59 % for the Jaccard coefficient. The qualitative performance of the endometrium segmentation was also improved over the conventional deep learning segmentation networks. Our experimental results indicated robust segmentation by the proposed method on TVUS images with heterogeneous texture and unclear boundary. In addition, the effect of the key-point discriminator was verified by an ablation study. CONCLUSION: We proposed a key-point discriminator to train a segmentation network for robust segmentation of the endometrium with TVUS images. By utilizing the key-point information, the proposed method showed more reliable and accurate segmentation performance and outperformed the conventional segmentation networks both in qualitative and quantitative comparisons.",2019,10.1002/mp.13677,46,9,3974-3984,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"Humans and Female and Ultrasonography and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods and adversarial learning and endometrial region and Endometrium/*diagnostic imaging and key-point-guided discriminator and medical image segmentation and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) image",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current methods are inadequate for the task, so we are developing gene expression profiles for radiation biodosimetry. This approach could provide both an estimate of physical radiation dose and an indication of the extent of individual injury or future risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to predict radiation dose across an exposure range relevant for medical decision making in a radiologic emergency. Human peripheral blood from 10 healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and global gene expression was measured both 6 and 24 h after exposure. RESULTS: A 74-gene signature was identified that distinguishes between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5, and 8 Gy) and controls. More than one third of these genes are regulated by TP53. A nearest centroid classifier using these same 74 genes correctly predicted 98% of samples taken either 6 h or 24 h after treatment as unexposed, exposed to 0.5, 2, or > or =5 Gy. Expression patterns of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3, and PHPT1) from this signature were also confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

As demand increases for improved robustness and conformality, next-generation secondary dose calculation engines are needed to verify treatment plans independently and provide estimates for clinical decision-making factors, such as dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET(d) ) and relative biological effectiveness (RBE). METHOD: FRoG (Fast dose Recalculation on GPU) has been installed and commissioned at the Danish Centre for Particle Therapy (DCPT). FRoG was developed for synchrotron-based facilities and has previously demonstrated good agreement with gold-standard Monte Carlo simulations and measurements. In this work, additions and modifications to FRoG's pencil beam algorithm to support the ion beam delivery with cyclotron-based technology as used at the DCPT, range shifter (RS) implementation, and robustness analysis methods are presented. FRoG dose predictions are compared to measurements and predictions of the clinical treatment planning system (TPS) Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, United States of America, CA, v.13.7.16) in both homogenous and heterogeneous scenarios using a solid-water/water and a half-head anthropomorphic phantom, respectively. Additional capabilities of FRoG are explored by performing a plan robustness analysis, analyzing dose and LET(d) for ten patients. RESULTS: Mid-target measurements in spread-out Bragg Peaks (SOBP) were on average within -0.19% <c2><b1> 0.30% and <e2><89><a4>0.5% of FRoG predictions for irradiations without and with RS, respectively. Average 3%/2mm 3D <ce><b3>-analysis passing rates were 99.1% for ~200 patient plan QA comparisons. Measurement with an anthropomorphic head-phantom yielded a <ce><b3>-passing rate >98%. Overall, maximum target differences in D(02%) of <2% between the TPS and FRoG were observed for patient plans. The robustness analysis study accounting for range, delivery, and positioning uncertainties revealed small differences in target dose and a maximum LET(d) VH(02%) (LET(d) received by 2% of the volume having dose larger than 1% of maximum dose) values below 10.1 keV/<c2><b5>m to the brain stem. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that auxiliary dose calculation systems like FRoG can yield excellent agreement to measurements comparable to clinical beam models.

METHODS: This IRB approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant retrospective study consisted of 31 patients (mean age and serum prostate specific antigen of 60.4 and 6.62 ng/ml, respectively) who had MP-MRI at 3 T followed by radical prostatectomy. Seven patients were excluded due to technical issues with their MP-MRI (e.g., motion artifact, failure to perform all sequences). Cancer and normal regions were identified in the peripheral zone by correlating them to whole mount histology slides of the excised prostatectomy specimens. To facilitate the correlation, tissue blocks matching the MR slices were obtained using a MR-based patient-specific mold. Segmented regions on the MP-MRI were correlated to histopathology and used as training sets for the learning system that generated the cancer probability maps. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation on the cancer and normal regions was performed to determine the learning system's efficacy, an evolutionary strategies approach (also known as a genetic algorithm) was used to find the optimal values for a set of parameters, and finally a cancer probability map was generated. RESULTS: For the 24 patients that were used in the study, 225 cancer and 264 noncancerous regions were identified from the region maps. The efficacy of DSS was first determined without optimizing support vector machines (SVM) parameters, where a region having a cancer probability greater than or equal to 50% was considered as a correct classification. The nonoptimized system had an f-measure of 85% and the Kappa coefficient of 71% (Rater's agreement, where raters are DSS and ground truth histology). The efficacy of the DSS after optimizing SVM parameters using a genetic algorithm had an f-measure of 89% and a Kappa coefficient of 80%. Thus, after optimization of the DSS there was a 4% increase in the f-measure and a 9% increase in the Kappa coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: This DSS provides a cancer probability map for peripheral zone prostate tumors based on endorectal MP-MRI. These cancer probability maps can potentially aid radiologists in accurately localizing peripheral zone prostate cancers for planning targeted biopsies, focal therapy, and follow up for active surveillance.",2012,10.1118/1.4722753,39,7,4093-4103,eng,0094-2405,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Reproducibility of Results and *Algorithms and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods and Image Enhancement/methods",NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the present data regarding the PG of GS7 CaP refer to surgical specimens. Our goal was to determine whether the biopsy GS used at the time of medical decision making predicted for the biochemical outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the data from 705 patients with biopsy GS7 CaP, from a prospectively maintained database, who had been treated at our institution between September 1996 and March 2005 with radical prostatectomy (n = 310), external beam radiotherapy (n = 268), or prostate radioactive seed implantation (n = 127). The bRFS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analyses examining these factors in relation to bRFS: PG of biopsy GS, initial prostate-specific antigen level, clinical T stage, use of androgen deprivation, risk group (high or intermediate), and treatment modality. RESULTS: The 5-year bRFS rate was 78% and 71% (p = 0.0108) for biopsy GS7 PG3 CaP and biopsy GS7 PG4 CaP, respectively. Comparing PG3 and PG4 within treatment modalities, only prostate implantation patients had a significant difference in the 5-year bRFS rate, 88% vs. 76%, respectively (p = 0.0231). On multivariate analysis, the PG of biopsy GS remained an independent predictor of bRFS, with PG3 having better bRFS than PG4 (relative risk, 0.655; 95% confidence interval, 0.472-0.909; p = 0.0113).

M.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Clarifying the diagnosis of clinically suspected recurrence of cervical cancer can be challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of (18)F-FDG PET in this context. METHODS: The medical records of a cohort of 40 (18)F-FDG PET referrals in whom recurrence of cervical cancer was clinically suspected were reviewed. Two expert gynecologic oncologists assessed the level of pre-PET clinical doubt, quality of pre-PET work-up, and impact of (18)F-FDG PET on diagnostic understanding and management using questionnaires. RESULTS: In patients with clinically equivocal recurrence, (18)F-FDG PET had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93% (prevalence, 65%). Before (18)F-FDG PET, there was high disagreement about the adequacy of the conventional work-up (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.25) and the presence of recurrence (ICC, 0.24). (18)F-FDG PET increased experts' confidence (median increase, 14% and 25%; P < 0.0001) and diagnostic agreement (from 68% to 98%; ICC, from 0.24 to 0.95). When (18)F-FDG PET was positive for recurrence, the median overall survival was 13 mo. For patients with negative (18)F-FDG PET findings, the median survival was not reached (log rank, 15.50, P = 0.0001). When the treatment plan was categorized as local therapy, systemic therapy, and expectative management, (18)F-FDG PET changed the treatment plan in half of all cases. The 2 experts reported that (18)F-FDG PET led to a better diagnosis and a beneficial change in management in, respectively, 60% and 65% of cases. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET can help to clarify the diagnosis of clinically suspected recurrence of cervical cancer. In this patient population, (18)F-FDG PET had significant value in diagnostic understanding and management of recurrent cervical cancer, facilitating decision making and treatment planning. Therefore, (18)F-FDG PET should be part of the diagnostic work-up in detection of recurrent cervical cancer. The high positive predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET in these patients suggests that inclusion in intervention trials might be based on a positive (18)F-FDG PET scan.",2008,10.2967/jnumed.108.055046,49,12,1936-1943,eng,0161-5505,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Sensitivity and Specificity and Risk Factors and Reproducibility of Results and Prevalence and Survival Analysis and Survival Rate and Risk Assessment/*methods and Radiopharmaceuticals and *Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 and Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnostic imaging/*mortality and Positron-Emission Tomography/*statistics & numerical data and Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*mortality",NA,NA,2008/12//undefined,J Nucl Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grewal_2010_Jonm.opSoNM,JOUR,The effect of posttherapy 131I SPECT/CT on risk classification and management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer,"Grewal, Ravinder K. and Tuttle, R. Michael and Fox, Joseph and Borkar, Sunita and Chou, Joanne F. and Gonen, Mithat and Strauss, H. William and Larson, Steven M. and Schoder, Heiko","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","The objective of this study was to determine whether posttherapy (131)I SPECT/CT changed the need for additional cross-sectional imaging or modified the American Thyroid Association risk of recurrence classification. We performed planar imaging and SPECT/CT in a consecutive series of patients after (131)I therapy. METHODS: Planar imaging and SPECT/CT were performed on 148 consecutive patients with thyroid carcinoma (125 papillary, 2 follicular, 8 Hurthle cell, and 13 poorly differentiated) approximately 5 d after the therapeutic administration of 1,739-8,066 MBq (47-218 mCi) of (131)I. The indication for treatment was postsurgical ablation (n = 109) or recurrent or metastatic disease with rising thyroglobulin levels (n = 39). SPECT/CT scans were obtained for all subjects for 1 bed position (38 cm), which included the neck and upper chest. Additional SPECT/CT scans of the abdomen or pelvis were acquired if suggestive findings were noted on planar images. All patients were treated in real time, according to the standard of care in our practice. At that time, clinical decisions regarding thyroid tumor classification were made by our multidisciplinary group based on all data, including operative findings, pathology, imaging, and thyroglobulin levels. In a retrospective analysis, planar and SPECT/CT images were interpreted independently, and sites of uptake were categorized as likely benign, malignant, or equivocal. An experienced thyroid endocrinologist used a combination of surgical histopathology and scan findings to determine whether additional cross-sectional imaging was required and determined if the imaging findings changed the patient's risk category. RESULTS: In 29 patients, 61 additional cross-sectional imaging studies were avoided using SPECT/CT, compared with medical decision making based on the planar images alone. In 7 of 109 postsurgical patients, SPECT/CT findings changed the initial American Thyroid Association risk of recurrence classification. The sensitivity of planar imaging and SPECT/CT for identification of focal (131)I uptake in the thyroid bed was similar in the postsurgical and recurrence cohorts. For metastatic disease in the neck, characterization of (131)I uptake by SPECT/CT in the postsurgical group was significantly better than that by planar scanning (P < 0.01). Among the 109 postsurgical patients, the characterization of iodine uptake in the lung, liver, and bone was also more accurate using SPECT/CT than planar scanning (P < 0.01). The CT portion of SPECT/CT demonstrated non-iodine-avid lesions in 32 of 148 patients. CONCLUSION: SPECT/CT data provided information that reduced the need for additional cross-sectional imaging in 29 patients (20%) and significantly altered the initial risk of recurrence estimates in 7 of 109 patients (6.4%), thereby altering patient management recommendations with regard to frequency and intensity of follow-up studies.",2010,10.2967/jnumed.110.075960,51,9,1361-1367,eng,1535-5667 0161-5505,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Time Factors and Recurrence and Lymphatic Metastasis and Risk Assessment/*methods and *Tomography, X-Ray Computed and *Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon and Thyroidectomy and Biological Transport and *Cell Differentiation and Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism/therapeutic use and Thyroid Gland/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy",NA,NA,2010/09//undefined,J Nucl Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Steer_2013_Injoofraonbiph,JOUR,Decision regret in men undergoing dose-escalated radiation therapy for prostate cancer,"Steer, Anna N. and Aherne, Noel J. and Gorzynska, Karen and Hoffman, Matthew and Last, Andrew and Hill, Jacques and Shakespeare, Thomas P.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics","PURPOSE: Decision regret (DR) is a negative emotion associated with medical treatment decisions, and it is an important patient-centered outcome after therapy for localized prostate cancer. DR has been found to occur in up to 53% of patients treated for localized prostate cancer, and it may vary depending on treatment modality. DR after modern dose-escalated radiation therapy (DE-RT) has not been investigated previously, to our knowledge. Our primary aim was to evaluate DR in a cohort of patients treated with DE-RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We surveyed 257 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer who had previously received DE-RT, by means of a validated questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 220 responses (85.6% response rate). Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy was given in 85.0% of patients and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in 15.0%. Doses received included 73.8 Gy (34.5% patients), 74 Gy (53.6%), and 76 Gy (10.9%). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation (AD) was given in 51.8% of patients and both neoadjuvant and adjuvant AD in 34.5%. The median follow-up time was 23 months (range, 12-67 months). In all, 3.8% of patients expressed DR for their choice of treatment. When asked whether they would choose DE-RT or AD again, only 0.5% probably or definitely would not choose DE-RT again, compared with 8.4% for AD (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Few patients treated with modern DE-RT express DR, with regret appearing to be lower than in previously published reports of patients treated with radical prostatectomy or older radiation therapy techniques. Patients experienced more regret with the AD component of treatment than with the radiation therapy component, with implications for informed consent.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a longitudinal, prospective study of 614 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (134), three-dimensional external conformal radiotherapy (205), and brachytherapy (275). The HRQL questionnaires administered before and after treatment (months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24) were the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (General and Prostate Specific), the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), and the American Urological Association Symptom Index. Differences between groups were tested by analysis of variance and within-group changes by univariate repeated-measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were constructed to assess between-group differences in HRQL at 2 years of follow-up after adjusting for clinical variables. RESULTS: In each treatment group, HRQL initially deteriorated after treatment with subsequent partial recovery. However, some dimension scores were still significantly lower after 2 years of treatment. The GEE models showed that, compared with the brachytherapy group, radical prostatectomy patients had worse EPIC sexual summary and urinary incontinence scores (-20.4 and -14.1; p < 0.001), and external radiotherapy patients had worse EPIC bowel, sexual, and hormonal summary scores (-3.55, -5.24, and -1.94; p < 0.05). Prostatectomy patients had significantly better EPIC urinary irritation scores than brachytherapy patients (+4.16; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Relevant differences between treatment groups persisted after 2 years of follow-up. Radical prostatectomy had a considerable negative effect on sexual functioning and urinary continence. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy had a moderate negative impact on bowel functioning, and brachytherapy caused moderate urinary irritation.

Bai_2019_Mediphys,JOUR,Body region localization in whole-body low-dose CT images of PET/CT scans using virtual landmarks,"Bai, Peirui and Udupa, Jayaram K. and Tong, Yubing and Xie, ShiPeng and Torigian, Drew A.",Medical physics,"PURPOSE: Radiological imaging and image interpretation for clinical decision making are mostly specific to each body region such as head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities. In this study, we present a new solution to trim automatically the given axial image stack into image volumes satisfying the given body region definition. METHODS: The proposed approach consists of the following steps. First, a set of reference objects is selected and roughly segmented. Virtual landmarks (VLs) for the objects are then identified by using principal component analysis and recursive subdivision of the object via the principal axes system. The VLs can be defined based on just the binary objects or objects with gray values also considered. The VLs may lie anywhere with respect to the object, inside or outside, and rarely on the object surface, and are tethered to the object. Second, a classic neural network regressor is configured to learn the geometric mapping relationship between the VLs and the boundary locations of each body region. The trained network is then used to predict the locations of the body region boundaries. In this study, we focus on three body regions - thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, and predict their superior and inferior axial locations denoted by TS(I), TI(I), AS(I), AI(I), PS(I), and PI(I), respectively, for any given volume image I. Two kinds of reference objects - the skeleton and the lungs and airways, are employed to test the localization performance of the proposed approach. RESULTS: Our method is tested by using low-dose unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images of 180 near whole-body (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans (including 34 whole-body scans) which are randomly divided into training and testing sets with a ratio of 85%:15%. The procedure is repeated six times and three times for the case of lungs and skeleton, respectively, with different divisions of the entire data set at this proportion. For the case of using skeleton as a reference object, the overall mean localization error for the six locations expressed as number of slices (nS) and distance (dS) in mm, is found to be nS: 3.4, 4.7, 4.1, 5.2, 5.2, and 3.9; dS: 13.4, 18.9, 16.5, 20.8, 20.8, and 15.5 mm for binary objects; nS: 4.1, 5.7, 4.3, 5.9, 5.9, and 4.0; dS: 16.2, 22.7, 17.2, 23.7, 23.7, and 16.1 mm for gray objects, respectively. For the case of using lungs and airways as a reference object, the corresponding results are, nS: 4.0, 5.3, 4.1, 6.9, 6.9, and 7.4; dS: 15.0, 19.7, 15.3, 26.2, 26.2, and 27.9 mm for binary objects; nS: 3.9, 5.4, 3.6, 7.2, 7.2, and 7.6; dS: 14.6, 20.1, 13.7, 27.3, 27.3, and 28.6 mm for gray objects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Precise body region identification automatically in whole-body or body region tomographic images is vital for numerous medical image analysis and analytics applications. Despite its importance, this issue has received very little attention in the literature. We present a solution to this problem in this study using the concept of virtual landmarks. The method achieves localization accuracy within 2-3 slices, which is roughly comparable to the variation found in localization by experts. As long as the reference objects can be roughly segmented, the method with its learned VLs-to-boundary location relationship and predictive ability is transferable from one image modality to another.",2019,10.1002/mp.13376,46,3,1286-1299,eng,2473-4209 0094-2405,"Humans and Case-Control Studies and Models, Statistical and *Algorithms and principal component analysis and *Disease and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods and *Radiography, Thoracic and computed tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/*methods and Abdomen/*diagnostic imaging and Anatomic Landmarks/diagnostic imaging and body region identification and neural network learning and Pelvis/*diagnostic imaging and virtual landmarks and Whole Body Imaging/*methods",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Med Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The medical records of 421 consecutive patients over the age of 50 years treated at a single institution between April 2011 and June 2016 for stage III/IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were reviewed. The primary treatment approach was compared using a t test statistic among 3 age cohorts: 50 to 59 years (118 patients); 60 to 69 years (152 patients); and 70 years and older (151 patients). Logistical regression was used to determine variables that influenced the likelihood of receiving surgery versus nonsurgical treatment, as well as radiation alone versus chemoradiation. RESULTS: There was no difference in sex, T stage, N stage, Karnofsky performance status, or the number of chronic comorbid conditions among the 3 age cohorts (P>.05 for all). A greater proportion of elderly patients aged <e2><89><a5>70 years were treated by radiation alone compared with those aged 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years (44% vs 16% and 24%, P=.01). Increasing age was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving primary nonsurgical versus surgical treatment (odds ratio 1.023, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.042) and radiation alone compared with chemoradiation (odds ratio 1.054; 95% confidence interval 1.034-1.075).
