Rocklov_2019_Emerinfedise,JOUR,"Using Big Data to Monitor the Introduction and Spread of Chikungunya, Europe, 2017","Rocklov, Joacim and Tozan, Yesim and Ramadona, Aditya and Sewe, Maquines O. and Sudre, Bertrand and Garrido, Jon and de Saint Lary, Chiara Bellegarde and Lohr, Wolfgang and Semenza, Jan C.",Emerging infectious diseases,"With regard to fully harvesting the potential of big data, public health lags behind other fields. To determine this potential, we applied big data (air passenger volume from international areas with active chikungunya transmission, Twitter data, and vectorial capacity estimates of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) to the 2017 chikungunya outbreaks in Europe to assess the risks for virus transmission, virus importation, and short-range dispersion from the outbreak foci. We found that indicators based on voluminous and velocious data can help identify virus dispersion from outbreak foci and that vector abundance and vectorial capacity estimates can provide information on local climate suitability for mosquitoborne outbreaks. In contrast, more established indicators based on Wikipedia and Google Trends search strings were less timely. We found that a combination of novel and disparate datasets can be used in real time to prevent and control emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.",2019,10.3201/eid2506.180138,25,6,1041-1049,eng,1080-6059 1080-6040,"social media and data science and Humans and Europe and big data and Animals and Climate and Data Mining and History, 21st Century and Disease Outbreaks and Seasons and Public Health Surveillance and Population Dynamics and Geography, Medical and *Big Data and Europe/epidemiology and Aedes/virology and Mosquito Vectors/virology and *Chikungunya virus and Aedes albopictus and arbovirus and chikungunya and Chikungunya Fever/*epidemiology/history/*transmission/virology and Communicable Diseases, Emerging/epidemiology/history/transmission/virology and human mobility and vector-borne infections and vectorial capacity and viruses",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Emerg Infect Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA
Han_2020_Joofmevi,JOUR,A comparative-descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics in 2019-coronavirus-infected children and adults,"Han, Ya-Nan and Feng, Zhan-Wei and Sun, Li-Na and Ren, Xiao-Xia and Wang, Hua and Xue, Yong-Ming and Wang, Yi and Fang, Ying",Journal of medical virology,"Acute respiratory disease caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China. Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%), and 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (ranged, 3-12 days) and 4 days (ranged, 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were demic by World Health Organiza more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5%, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20%, 80%). A total of 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs 4%, P=.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019-nCoV disease, but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.",2020,10.1002/jmv.25835,92,9,1596-1602,eng,1096-9071 0146-6615,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Risk Factors and Comorbidity and Disease Management and Symptom Assessment and Environmental Exposure and Clinical Decision-Making and 2019 novel coronavirus and clinical manifestations and comparative analysis and COVID-19/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy/*virology and differences between children and adults and laboratory parameters and SARS-CoV-2/*physiology",NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,J Med Virol,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand the psychological stress status of medical staffs during the outbreak of COVID-19, random sample questionnaire survey was conducted among 2110 medical staffs and 2158 college students in all provinces of China through a questionnaire, which was compiled and completed through the Questionnaire Star platform relying on Wechat, QQ, and other social software. The differences in psychological stress status of different groups were compared through the analysis of the questionnaire. Results revealed that in all provinces of China, medical staffs scored significantly higher on all items of psychological stress than college students (P < .001). In Wuhan, medical staffs scored significantly higher than college students in all items of psychological stress (P < .001).

We fitted 8 hierarchical Bayesian Poisson joint models of relative risk for dengue and Zika, including area- and disease-specific random effects accounting for several spatial patterns of disease risk (clustered or uncorrelated heterogeneity) within and between both diseases. Most of the dengue and Zika high-risk municipalities varied in their risk distribution; those for Zika were in the northern part of the department and dengue in the southern to northeastern parts. At city level, spatially clustered patterns of dengue high-risk census sections indicated Zika high-risk areas.

Risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients, especially detailed self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators, have not been well described. In this paper, a total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included. Self-evaluation indicators including demographics, baseline characteristics, and symptoms and detailed lab-examination indicators were extracted. Data were first compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed to identify possible risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients. MVPA achieved a relatively high classification accuracy of 93% when using both self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators. Several self-evaluation factors related to COVID-19 were highly associated with mortality, including age, duration (time from illness onset to admission), and the Barthel index (BI) score. When the duration, age increased by 1 day, 1 year, BI decreased by 1 point, the mortality increased by 3.6%, 2.4%, and 0.9% respectively. Laboratory-examination indicators including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelet count, fibrin degradation products, oxygenation index, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer were also risk factors. Among them, duration was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Several self-evaluation indicators that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without clinical examination were the risk factors of all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The prediction model can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by clinicians to identify high-risk individuals.",2021,10.1002/jmv.26572,93,4,2046-2055,eng,1096-9071 0146-6615,"machine learning and China and COVID-19 and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Multivariate Analysis and Risk Factors and Prognosis and Aged, 80 and over and COVID-19/*mortality and Critical Illness/*mortality and risk factor and *Diagnostic Self Evaluation and clinical indicators and self-evaluation",NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Med Virol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Huang_2020_Joofmevi,JOUR,The impact of hepatitis B virus infection status on the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A population-based study,"Huang, Jiaofeng and Jing, Mengli and Wang, Ciyang and Wang, Mingfang and You, Shunjie and Lin, Su and Zhu, Yueyong",Journal of medical virology,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) based on clinical big data. METHODS: Data were collected from the health examination center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to investigate the relationship between HBV and NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 14 452 patients were included, with an average age of 43.84 <c2><b1> 13.03 years. Cases of HBV current infection, past infection, and noninfection were 21 102 110 (14.6%), 90 039 003 (62.3%), and 33 393 339 (23.1%), respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD was significantly lower in the current infection group (29.9%) than in the past infection group (35.8%) and noninfection group (31.9%) (P < .001). After adjusting for age, the prevalence of NAFLD in the current infection group remained the lowest across all of the age groups. Multivariate analysis showed that current infection was at a lower risk of NAFLD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.717, 95% CI: 0.608-0.846), whereas past infection had no effect on NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Current HBV infection may lower the risk of NAFLD. This effect becomes insignificant when the patient is no longer infected.",2020,10.1002/jmv.25621,92,8,1191-1197,eng,1096-9071 0146-6615,Hepatitis B virus and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Prevalence and Odds Ratio and China/epidemiology and hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis B/*complications/epidemiology and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/*epidemiology/*virology and nonalcoholic fatty liver,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,J Med Virol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shang_2013_Joofmevi,JOUR,Predicting the presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen in Chinese patients by pathology data mining,"Shang, Guifang and Richardson, Alice and Gahan, Michelle E. and Easteal, Simon and Ohms, Stephen and Lidbury, Brett A.",Journal of medical virology,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pathogen of worldwide health significance, associated with liver disease. A vaccine is available, yet HBV prevalence remains a concern, particularly in developing countries. Pathology laboratories have a primary role in the diagnosis and monitoring of HBV infection, through hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) immunoassay and associated tests. Analysis of HBsAg immunoassay and associated pathology data from 821 Chinese patients applied 10-fold cross-validation to establish classification decision trees (CDTs), with CDT results used subsequently to develop a logistic regression model. The robustness of logistic regression model was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, Pseudo-R(2) and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) result that showed the logistic regression model was capable of accurately discriminating the HBsAg positive from HBsAg negative patients at 95% accuracy. Overall CDT sensitivity and specificity was 94.7% (<c2><b1> 5.0%) and 89.5% (<c2><b1> 5.7%), respectively, close to the sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay, providing an alternative to predict HBsAg status. Both the CDT and logistic regression modeling demonstrated the importance of the routine pathology variables alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum albumin (ALB), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to accurately predict HBsAg status in a Chinese patient cohort. The study demonstrates that CDTs and a linked logistic regression model applied to routine pathology data were an effective supplement to HBsAg immunoassay, and a possible replacement method where immunoassays are not requested or not easily available for the laboratory diagnosis of HBV infection.",2013,10.1002/jmv.23609,85,8,1334-1339,eng,1096-9071 0146-6615,China and Humans and Sensitivity and Specificity and Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and *Decision Support Techniques and Alanine Transaminase/*blood and Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood and Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*blood and Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification and Hepatitis B/*diagnosis/pathology/virology and Serum Albumin/*analysis,NA,NA,2013/08//undefined,J Med Virol,NA,NA,NA,NA
