DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future.

Adversarial explanation generates adversarial examples (AEs), or images that have been changed to gain or lose pathologic characteristic-specific traits, to explain the DLM's rationale. DESIGN: Evaluation of explanation methods for DLMs. PARTICIPANTS: Health screening participants (n = 1653) at the Seoul National University Hospital Health Promotion Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea. METHODS: We trained DLMs for referable glaucoma (RG), increased cup-to-disc ratio (ICDR), disc rim narrowing (DRN), and retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) using 6430 retinal fundus images. Surveys consisting of explanations using AE and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM), a conventional heatmap-based explanation method, were generated for 400 pathologic and healthy patient eyes. For each method, board-trained glaucoma specialists rated location explainability, the ability to pinpoint decision-relevant areas in the image, and rationale explainability, the ability to inform the user on the model's reasoning for the decision based on pathologic features. Scores were compared by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivities, and specificities of DLMs; visualization of clinical pathologic changes of AEs; and survey scores for locational and rationale explainability. RESULTS: The AUCs were 0.90, 0.99, 0.95, and 0.79 and sensitivities were 0.79, 1.00, 0.82, and 0.55 at 0.90 specificity for RG, ICDR, DRN, and RNFLD DLMs, respectively. Generated AEs showed valid clinical feature changes, and survey results for location explainability were 3.94 <c2><b1> 1.33 and 2.55 <c2><b1> 1.24 using AEs and GradCAMs, respectively, of a possible maximum score of 5 points. The scores for rationale explainability were 3.97 <c2><b1> 1.31 and 2.10 <c2><b1> 1.25 for AEs and GradCAM, respectively. Adversarial example provided significantly better explainability than GradCAM. CONCLUSIONS: Adversarial explanation increased the explainability over GradCAM, a conventional heatmap-based explanation method.

We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the reference standard. METHODS: Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with non-referable retinopathy. CONCLUSION: The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with specificity that could halve the workload for human graders.

DESIGN: Retrospective literature review. METHODS: To review the studies of both prospective and retrospective (post hoc) analyses of nutrition, genetic variants, and deep learning in AMD in both the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2. RESULTS: In addition to demonstrating the beneficial effects of the AREDS and AREDS2 supplements of antioxidant vitamins and zinc (plus copper) for reducing the risk of progression to late AMD, these 2 studies also confirmed the importance of high adherence to Mediterranean diet in reducing progression of AMD in persons with varying severity of disease. In persons with the protective genetic alleles of complement factor H (CFH), the Mediterranean diet had further beneficial effect. However, despite the genetic association with AMD progression, prediction models found genetic information added little to the high predictive value of baseline severity of AMD for disease progression. The technique of deep learning, an arm of artificial intelligence, using color fundus photographs from AREDS/AREDS2 was superior in some cases and noninferior in others to clinical human grading (retinal specialists) and to the gold standard of the certified reading center graders. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling individuals affected with AMD regarding the use of the AREDS2 supplements and the beneficial association of the Mediterranean diet is an important public health message. Although genetic testing is important in research, it is not recommended for prediction of disease or to guide therapies and/or dietary interventions in AMD. Techniques in deep learning hold great promise, but further prospective research is required to validate the use of this technique to provide improvement in accuracy and sensitivity/specificity in clinical research and medical management of patients with AMD.",2020,10.1016/j.ajo.2020.05.042,217,NA,335-347,eng,1879-1891 0002-9394,Humans and Disease Progression and *Deep Learning and Genetic Testing/*methods and *Dietary Supplements and *Visual Acuity and Macular Degeneration/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Am J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: This retrospective hospital-based study included 2 408 819 patients presenting between August 2010 and February 2020. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of EKC in at least one eye with a recent onset (<e2><89><a4>1 week) were included as cases. The data were collected using the eyeSmart electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Overall, 21 196 (0.9%) new patients were diagnosed with EKC, of which 19 203 (90.6%) patients reported a recent onset (<e2><89><a4>1 week) and were included for analysis. The median age was 32 (IQR: 22-45) years and adults (84.5%) were commonly affected. Most of the patients were male (62.1%) and unilateral (53.4%) affliction was commoner. The most common presenting symptom was redness (63.7%), followed by watering (42.1%). Preauricular lymphadenopathy or tenderness was documented in 1406 (7.3%) cases at presentation. A minority of the eyes had visual impairment worse than 20/200 (7.8%) due to associated ocular comorbidities.

METHODS: The average mean deviation (MD) measurement on the visual field (VF) test for 250 patients attending a GMS were compared with a 'big data' repository of patients attending a standard glaucoma care service (reference database). In addition, the speed of VF progression between GMS patients and reference database patients was compared. Reference database patients were used to create expected outcomes that GMS patients could be compared with. For GMS patients falling outside of the expected limits, further analysis was carried out on the clinical management decisions for these patients. RESULTS: The average MD of patients in the GMS ranged from +1.6dB to -18.9dB between two consecutive appointments at the clinic. In the first analysis, 12 (4.8%; 95% CI 2.5% to 8.2%) GMS patients scored outside the 90% expected values based on the reference database.

METHODS: Social media posts (from Twitter, and from online forums and blogs) were classified by age and by conjunctivitis type (allergic or infectious) using Boolean and machine learning methods. Based on spline smoothing, we estimated the circular mean occurrence time (a measure of central tendency for occurrence) and the circular variance (a measure of uniformity of occurrence throughout the year, providing an index of seasonality). Clinical records from a large tertiary care provider were analyzed in a similar way for comparison. RESULTS: Social media posts machine-coded as being related to infectious conjunctivitis showed similar times of occurrence and degree of seasonality to clinical infectious cases, and likewise for machine-coded allergic conjunctivitis posts compared to clinical allergic cases. Allergic conjunctivitis showed a distinctively different seasonal pattern than infectious conjunctivitis, with a mean occurrence time later in the spring. Infectious conjunctivitis for children showed markedly greater seasonality than for adults, though the occurrence times were similar; no such difference for allergic conjunctivitis was seen.

Here we assess the screening potential of this scoring system by determining its ability to detect all components of ROP diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical examination and fundus photography were performed at seven participating centres. A deep learning system was trained to detect plus disease, generating a quantitative assessment of retinal vascular abnormality (the i-ROP plus score) on a 1-9 scale. Overall ROP disease category was established using a consensus reference standard diagnosis combining clinical and image-based diagnosis. Experts then ranked ordered a second data set of 100 posterior images according to overall ROP severity. RESULTS: 4861 examinations from 870 infants were analysed. 155 examinations (3%) had a reference standard diagnosis of type 1 ROP. The i-ROP deep learning (DL) vascular severity score had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.960 for detecting type 1 ROP. Establishing a threshold i-ROP DL score of 3 conferred 94% sensitivity, 79% specificity, 13% positive predictive value and 99.7% negative predictive value for type 1 ROP. There was strong correlation between expert rank ordering of overall ROP severity and the i-ROP DL vascular severity score (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.93; p<0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model which predicted atherosclerosis by using retinal fundus images and to verify its clinical implications by conducting a retrospective cohort analysis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The database at the Health Promotion Center of Seoul National University Hospital (HPC-SNUH) was used. The deep learning model was trained using 15,408 images to predict carotid artery atherosclerosis, which was named the deep-learning funduscopic atherosclerosis score (DL-FAS). A retrospective cohort was constructed of participants 30-80 years old who had completed elective health examinations at HPC-SNUH. Using DL-FAS as the main exposure, participants were followed for the primary outcome of death due to CVD until Dec. 31, 2017. RESULTS: For predicting carotid artery atherosclerosis among subjects, the model achieved an area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 0.713, 0.569, 0.583, 0.891, 0.404, 0.465, and 0.865 respectively. The cohort consisted of 32,227 participants, 78 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths, and 7.6-year median follow-up visits. Those with DL-FAS greater than 0.66 had an increased risk of CVD deaths compared to those with DL-FAS <0.33 (hazard ratio: 8.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16-24.7). Risk association was significant among intermediate and high Framingham risk score (FRS) subgroups. The DL-FAS improved the concordance by 0.0266 (95% CI, 0.0043-0.0489) over the FRS-only model. The relative integrated discrimination index was 20.45% and net reclassification index was 29.5%.

Such rigorously validated medical diagnostic AI systems hold great promise for improving access to care, increasing accuracy, and lowering cost, while enabling specialist physicians to provide the greatest value by managing and treating patients whose outcomes can be improved. Ensuring that autonomous AI provides these benefits requires evaluation of the autonomous AI's effect on patient outcome, design, validation, data usage, and accountability, from a bioethics and accountability perspective. We performed a literature review of bioethical principles for AI, and derived evaluation rules for autonomous AI, grounded in bioethical principles. The rules include patient outcome, validation, reference standard, design, data usage, and accountability for medical liability. Application of the rules explains successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization of an example, the first autonomous point-of-care diabetic retinopathy examination de novo authorized by the FDA, after a preregistered clinical trial. Physicians need to become competent in understanding the potential risks and benefits of autonomous AI, and understand its design, safety, efficacy and equity, validation, and liability, as well as how its data were obtained.

While classification of disease stages is critical to understanding disease risk and progression, several systems based on color fundus photographs are known. Most of these require in-depth and time-consuming analysis of fundus images. Herein, we present an automated computer-based classification algorithm. DESIGN: Algorithm development for AMD classification based on a large collection of color fundus images. Validation is performed on a cross-sectional, population-based study. PARTICIPANTS: We included 120 656 manually graded color fundus images from 3654 Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) participants. AREDS participants were >55 years of age, and non-AMD sight-threatening diseases were excluded at recruitment. In addition, performance of our algorithm was evaluated in 5555 fundus images from the population-based Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA; Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study. METHODS: We defined 13 classes (9 AREDS steps, 3 late AMD stages, and 1 for ungradable images) and trained several convolution deep learning architectures. An ensemble of network architectures improved prediction accuracy. An independent dataset was used to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in a population-based study.

RESULTS: A network ensemble of 6 different neural net architectures predicted the 13 classes in the AREDS test set with a quadratic weighted <ce><ba> of 92% (95% confidence interval, 89%-92%) and an overall accuracy of 63.3%. In the independent KORA dataset, images wrongly classified as AMD were mainly the result of a macular reflex observed in young individuals. By restricting the KORA analysis to individuals >55 years of age and prior exclusion of other retinopathies, the weighted and unweighted <ce><ba> increased to 50% and 63%, respectively. Importantly, the algorithm detected 84.2% of all fundus images with definite signs of early or late AMD. Overall, 94.3% of healthy fundus images were classified correctly.

DESIGN: Development and evaluation of machine learning models. METHODS: Structured EHR data of 385 POAG patients from a single academic institution were incorporated into models using multivariable logistic regression, random forests, and artificial neural networks. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Youden index were calculated for each model to evaluate performance. Systemic variables driving predictions were identified and interpreted. RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression was most effective at discriminating patients with progressive disease requiring surgery, with an AUC of 0.67. Higher mean systolic blood pressure was associated with significantly increased odds of needing glaucoma surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, P < .001). Ophthalmic medications (OR = 0.28, P < .001), non-opioid analgesic medications (OR = 0.21, P = .002), anti-hyperlipidemic medications (OR = 0.39, P = .004), macrolide antibiotics (OR = 0.40, P = .03), and calcium blockers (OR = 0.43, P = .03) were associated with decreased odds of needing glaucoma surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Existing systemic data in the EHR has some predictive value in identifying POAG patients at risk of progression to surgical intervention, even in the absence of eye-specific data.

Medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical features and OCT findings, along with their impact on surgical decision-making were analysed. RESULTS: Of 27 patients, 10 had unilateral and 17 had bilateral disease. Two patients with mild disease (three eyes) had a posterior corneal defect with leukoma (2/27, 7.4%). Twenty patients (32 eyes) with iridocorneal adhesions were classified as having moderate Peters' anomaly (20/27, 74.1%) and five patients (nine eyes) with lenticulocorneal adhesions were classified as having severe Peters' anomaly (5/27, 18.5%). The range of angle closure, anterior chamber depth and maximum iridocorneal adhesion length (all p<0.001) were significantly different among groups, indicating that they might serve as novel OCT parameters for assessing the severity of Peters' anomaly. The surgical approach in seven patients (21.2%) was altered in response to intraoperative OCT findings, which provided information regarding the anatomical structure of the anterior chamber not provided by the surgical microscope.

The goal of this perspective is to review the challenges to detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging and propose ways to enhance its performance. DESIGN: Perspective with review of relevant literature. METHODS: Review of challenges and issues related to detection of change on macular OCT images in glaucoma eyes. The primary outcome measures were confounding factors affecting the detection of change on macular OCT images. RESULTS: The main challenges to detection of structural progression in the macula consist of the magnitude of and the variable amount of test-retest variability among patients, the confounding effect of aging, lack of a reliable and easy-to-measure functional outcome or external standard, the confounding effects of concurrent macular conditions including myopia, and the measurement floor of macular structural outcomes. Potential solutions to these challenges include controlling head tilt or torsion during imaging, estimating within-eye variability for individual patients, improved data visualization, the use of artificial intelligence methods, and the implementation of statistical approaches suitable for multidimensional longitudinal data. CONCLUSIONS: Macular OCT imaging is a crucial structural imaging modality for assessing central RGCs. Addressing the current shortcomings in acquisition and analysis of macular volume scans can enhance its utility for measuring the health of central RGCs and therefore assist clinicians with timely institution of appropriate treatment.",2021,10.1016/j.ajo.2020.09.026,222,NA,277-284,eng,1879-1891 0002-9394,"Humans and *Artificial Intelligence and Nerve Fibers/pathology and Glaucoma/*diagnosis/physiopathology and Intraocular Pressure/*physiology and Tomography, Optical Coherence/*methods and Macula Lutea/*pathology and *Visual Fields",NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,Am J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two abnormalities of the extraocular muscles (EOM) are commonly reported in UCS without objective quantification: (1) excyclorotation of the eye and (2) malposition of the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle. Here we aimed to assess the positions of the EOM in AP, using geometric morphometrics based on MRI data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient files were listed using Dr WareHouse, a dedicated big data search engine. We included all patients with AP managed between 2013 and 2018, with an available digital preoperative MRI. MRIs from age-matched controls without craniofacial conditions were also included. We defined 13 orbital and skull base landmarks in order to model the 3D position of the EOM. Cephalometric analyses and geometric morphometrics with Procrustes superimposition and principal component analysis were used with the aim of defining specific EOM anomalies in UCS. RESULTS: We included 15 preoperative and 7 postoperative MRIs from patients with UCS and 24 MRIs from age-matched controls. Cephalometric analyses, Procrustes superimposition and distance computations showed a significant shape difference for the position of the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle and an excyclorotation of the EOM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that UCS-associated anomalies of the superior oblique muscle function are associated with malposition of its trochlea in the roof of the orbit. This clinical anomaly supports the importance of MRI imaging in the surgical management of strabismus in patients with UCS.",2020,10.1136/bjophthalmol-2019-314989,104,8,1156-1160,eng,1468-2079 0007-1161,"Humans and Female and Male and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and imaging and Imaging, Three-Dimensional and child health (paediatrics) and Craniosynostoses/complications and muscles and Oculomotor Muscles/diagnostic imaging/*pathology and orbit and Orbit/diagnostic imaging and Plagiocephaly/etiology/*pathology and Strabismus/*diagnosis and treatment surgery",NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,Br J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: We created a computer simulation model of 1 pediatric ophthalmologist's clinic using EHR timestamp data, which was used to develop a scheduling template based on appointment length (short, medium, or long). We assessed its impact on clinic efficiency after implementation in the practices of 5 different pediatric ophthalmologists. PARTICIPANTS: We observed and timed patient appointments in person (n = 120) and collected EHR timestamps for 2 years of appointments (n = 650). We calculated efficiency measures for 172 clinic sessions before implementation vs. 119 clinic sessions after implementation. METHODS: We validated clinic workflow timings calculated from EHR timestamps and the simulation models based on them with observed timings. From simulation tests, we developed a new scheduling template and evaluated it with efficiency metrics before vs. after implementation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of clinical efficiency (mean clinic volume, patient wait time, examination time, and clinic length). RESULTS: Mean physician examination time calculated from EHR timestamps was 13.8<c2><b1>8.2 minutes and was not statistically different from mean physician examination time from in-person observation (13.3<c2><b1>7.3 minutes; P = 0.7), suggesting that EHR timestamps are accurate. Mean patient wait time for the simulation model (31.2<c2><b1>10.9 minutes) was not statistically different from the observed mean patient wait times (32.6<c2><b1>25.3 minutes; P = 0.9), suggesting that simulation models are accurate. After implementation of the new scheduling template, all 5 pediatric ophthalmologists showed statistically significant improvements in clinic volume (mean increase of 1-3 patients/session; P <e2><89><a4> 0.05 for 2 providers; P <e2><89><a4> 0.008 for 3 providers), whereas 4 of 5 had improvements in mean patient wait time (average improvements of 3-4 minutes/patient; statistically significant for 2 providers, P <e2><89><a4> 0.008). All of the ophthalmologists' examination times remained the same before and after implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation models based on big data from EHRs can test clinic changes before real-life implementation. A scheduling template using predicted appointment length improves clinic efficiency and may generalize to other clinics.

King_2011_ThBrjoofop,JOUR,Treating patients presenting with advanced glaucoma--should we reconsider current practice?,"King, Anthony J. and Stead, Richard E. and Rotchford, Alan P.",The British journal of ophthalmology,The management of patients presenting with advanced glaucoma presents a challenge to glaucoma clinicians. Presentation with advanced visual field loss is an important risk factor for progression to blindness in the affected eye(s) during the patients' lifetime. Maximising intraocular pressure (IOP) control in such situations is likely to minimise the risk of further visual field deterioration thus either preventing or slowing progression to blindness. Currently most patients presenting with advanced disease in the UK are managed on an escalating regime of medical treatment. Should this fail glaucoma surgery is usually employed to further lower IOP. Although glaucoma surgery is generally a safe and successful intervention it carries a small risk of severe visual loss and is considered by many clinicians as an intervention only to be used following failure of medical treatment. Recently however the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has suggested in its clinical guidelines for management of ocular hypertension and glaucoma that primary surgery should be offered to patients presenting with advanced glaucomatous visual field loss. This is contrary to the practice of most UK ophthalmologists. In this review the current available evidence underlying the management of presentation with advanced disease is examined.,2011,10.1136/bjo.2010.188128,95,9,1185-1192,eng,1468-2079 0007-1161,Humans and Risk Factors and Incidence and Disease Progression and *Decision Making and United Kingdom/epidemiology and Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use and Intraocular Pressure/physiology and *Blindness/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control and *Filtering Surgery and *Glaucoma/complications/epidemiology/therapy,NA,NA,2011/09//undefined,Br J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Large, multicenter, retrospective cohort study of commercially insured patients in the MarketScan database (Truven Health Analytics, San Jose, CA). PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-seven thousand three hundred twenty-five patients with IC who were enrolled continuously in the MarketScan database. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models (controlling for patient gender, age at index diagnosis of IC, and diagnosis with diabetes mellitus) followed up patients from index diagnosis of IC for 5 years, or until patients discontinued insurance coverage, or until patients' first diagnosis with a maculopathy. As a sensitivity analysis, we re-estimate all models after excluding all patients with diabetes. To assess for dose response, we calculated the total days of PPS prescriptions filled and created a categorical variable indicating total exposure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was association between binary PPS exposure and any maculopathy. Secondary outcome measures included exposure between binary and categorical, time-dependent, exposure to PPS and to drusen, nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), exudative AMD, hereditary maculopathy, and toxic maculopathy. RESULTS: The most common diagnoses of maculopathy in patients with IC were exudative AMD (1.5%), drusen (0.8%), nonexudative AMD (0.3%), toxic maculopathy (0.1%), and hereditary dystrophy (0.04%). In unadjusted analyses, the percentage of patients who filled a PPS prescription and were diagnosed later with a maculopathy (2.37%) was very similar to the percentage of patients who did not fill a prescription (2.77%). Survival models using a binary variable indicating PPS exposure showed no significant associations between PPS exposure and diagnosis of drusen, nonexudative AMD, exudative AMD, toxic maculopathy, hereditary dystrophy, or an aggregate variable of any maculopathy. Similarly, there was no dose-dependent relationship between PPS exposure and diagnosis of any maculopathy. These findings remained stable in sensitivity analysis models that excluded patients with diabetes mellitus.

METHODS: Two randomly chosen samples of retina specialists were surveyed regarding their treatment and dosing regimen choices among three antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) biologics (aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab), intravitreal steroid, focal laser and observation for the treatment of CMO secondary to RVO. The first group was asked to make recommendations for two hypothetical patients: one with CMO secondary to branch RVO (BRVO) and the second with CMO secondary to central RVO (CRVO). The second group was asked to make recommendations as if they themselves were the hypothetical patient with the same disease processes. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 492 respondents (20.1%). When comparing anti-VEGF agents for patients with BRVO, a majority of physicians recommended bevacizumab (60.5%) over ranibizumab (37.8%) and aflibercept (1.7%; p<0.0001).

DESIGN: Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Residents at academic institutions. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, single-masked, controlled trial was performed in 7 academic departments of ophthalmology (Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, University of Iowa, Emory University, University of Cincinnati, University of Pennsylvania/Scheie Eye Institute, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University/Wills Eye Institute, and the Aravind Eye Institute). All residents from these centers were asked to participate and were randomized into 2 groups. Group A (n = 30) served as the control and received traditional teaching materials; group B (n = 38) received a digital video disc of the Virtual Mentor program. This program is an interactive cognitive simulation, specifically designed to separate cognitive aspects (such as decision making and error recognition) from the motor aspects. Both groups took online anonymous pretests (n = 68) and posttests (n = 58), and answered satisfaction questionnaires (n = 53). Wilcoxon tests were completed to compare pretest and posttest scores between groups. Analysis of variance was performed to assess differences in mean scores between groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on pretests, posttests, and satisfaction questionnaires. RESULTS: There was no difference in the pretest scores between the 2 groups (P = 0.62). However, group B (Virtual Mentor [VM]) scored significantly higher on the posttest (P = 0.01).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: United States cataract surgery patients, 2013-2017 (5 401 686 patients). METHODS: Cases of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis occurring within 30 days after cataract surgery were identified using diagnosis codes in the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS (Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry database, drawn from electronic health records in ophthalmology practices across the nation. Annual and aggregate 5-year incidences were determined for all cataract surgeries and specifically for standalone procedures versus those combined with other ophthalmic surgeries. Patient characteristics were compared. Mean and median visual acuity was determined at 1 month preoperative as well as 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperative among patients with and without endophthalmitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. RESULTS: A total of 8 542 838 eyes underwent cataract surgery, 3629 of which developed acute-onset endophthalmitis (0.04%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04%-0.04%). Endophthalmitis incidence was highest among patients aged 0 to 17 years (0.37% over 5 years), followed by patients aged 18 to 44 years (0.18% over 5 years; P < 0.0001). Endophthalmitis occurred 4 times more often after combined cases (cataract with other ophthalmic procedures) than after standalone cataract surgeries (0.20% vs. 0.04% of cases), and occurred in 0.35% of patients receiving anterior vitrectomy. Mean 3-month postoperative visual acuity was 20/100 (median, 20/50) among endophthalmitis patients, versus a mean of approximately 20/40 (median, 20/30) among patients without endophthalmitis. However, 4% of endophthalmitis patients still achieved 20/20 or better visual acuity, and 44% achieved 20/40 or better visual acuity at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Acute-onset endophthalmitis occurred in 0.04% of 8 542 838 cataract surgeries performed in the United States between 2013 and 2017. Risk factors may include younger age, cataract surgery combined with other ophthalmic surgeries, and anterior vitrectomy.

Optimal management strategy is undecided and most centres err on the side of caution. Our aim was to test a virtual model of service delivery relying on interpretation of imaging test results by non-medically trained graders. METHODS: Patients with naevomelanocytic lesions referred to Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospital were retrospectively included in this study. All patients underwent imaging tests including optical coherence tomography and ultrasound and management was subsequently decided clinically. Images were anonymised and transferred to the Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre and were reviewed by a trained, masked grader who reached a management decision on the basis of a specific grading protocol. Agreement between decisions made on the basis of clinical examination and imaging ('gold standard') by an expert ophthalmologist in the clinic was compared with the decisions made by a masked ophthalmologist and a masked non-medical grader based on imaging tests alone. RESULTS: There were 102 consecutive patients included in this study. Agreement between gold-standard clinical management and decisions made by masked, non-medical grader and masked ophthalmologist on the basis of imaging test results alone was 96.1% (<ce><ba>=0.97) and 100%, respectively.

During the evolving coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, given the concerns related to IMT and the increased risk of infections, an urgent need for guidance on the management of IMT in patients with uveitis has emerged. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of international uveitis experts was conducted. An expert steering committee identified clinical questions on the use of IMT in patients with NIU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an interactive online questionnaire, guided by background experience and knowledge, 139 global uveitis experts generated consensus statements for IMT. In total, 216 statements were developed around when to initiate, continue, decrease and stop systemic and local corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressive agents and biologics in patients with NIU. Thirty-one additional questions were added, related to general recommendations, including the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: Highest consensus was achieved for not initiating IMT in patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and for using local over systemic corticosteroid therapy in patients who are at high-risk and very high-risk for severe or fatal COVID-19. While there was a consensus in starting or initiating NSAIDs for the treatment of scleritis in healthy patients, there was no consensus in starting hydroxychloroquine in any risk groups.

DESIGN: Database development. METHODS: Specific macular clinic user interfaces within the institutional hospital information system were created. Orders for imaging modalities were sent by an EMR-linked picture-archiving and communications system to the respective devices. All data of 325 767 patients since 2002 were gathered in a DW running on an SQL database. A data discovery tool was developed. An exemplary search for patients with age-related macular degeneration, performed cataract surgery, and at least 10 intravitreal (excluding bevacizumab) injections was conducted. RESULTS: Data related to those patients (3 142 204 diagnoses [including diagnoses from other fields of medicine], 720 721 procedures [eg, surgery], and 45 416 intravitreal injections) were stored, including 81 274 optical coherence tomography measurements. A web-based browsing tool was successfully developed for data visualization and filtering data by several linked criteria, for example, minimum number of intravitreal injections of a specific drug and visual acuity interval. The exemplary search identified 450 patients with 516 eyes meeting all criteria. CONCLUSIONS: A DW was successfully implemented in an ophthalmologic academic environment to support and facilitate research by using increasing EMR and measurement data.

The rate of surgery ranged from 1.99% for children birth to 5 years of age to 0.05% for adults 40 years of age and older. Horizontal surgical codes were reported 38 813 times, vertical surgery codes were reported 9304 times, and superior oblique codes were reported 711 times. Adjustable sutures were used for 3027 patients (7.42%). Cases with a code for repeat eye muscle surgery or restrictive myopathy were reported for 6098 patients (14.9%). Esotropia accounted for 30.06% and exotropia in 21.77% of diagnoses reported for surgery. The rate of undergoing a reoperation within 1 year of a strabismus surgery was 6.72%, lowest for the group 6 to 9 years of age (3.95%) and increasing with age (P < 0.001) to 11.5% for patients 65 years of age and older. CONCLUSIONS: Strabismus is an uncommonly reported diagnosis in ophthalmologic practice. Overall, approximately 1 in 750 patients in the IRIS Registry received strabismus surgery (1 in 20 with a strabismus diagnosis) during a 4-year period. Reoperations during the first year after surgery were performed for 1 in 15 patients, increasing with age at surgery.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: We reviewed 136 cases of radiographically confirmed orbital cellulitis between 2004 and 2012 at Children's Hospital Colorado. The presenting ophthalmic examinations, imaging results, medical and surgical interventions, and clinical complications were recorded. The main outcome measures were ophthalmic examinations on presentation, medical or surgical interventions, and complications. RESULTS: The median age was 6.5 years. Of the patients, 56 (41%) underwent surgical intervention, and 80 patients (59%) were managed medically. Patients requiring surgery had higher rates of extraocular motility (EOM) restriction (78.6% vs 38.8% P<0.01), proptosis (64.3% vs 21.2%, P<0.01), elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (35.7% vs 12.5%, P<0.01), and age over 9 years (58.9% vs 20.0%, P<0.01). Using any combination of the above risk factors at presentation, the probability of surgical intervention increases from 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1%-13%) with zero risk factors to 95% (95% CI 89%-100%) with 4 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric orbital cellulitis, the likelihood of surgical intervention can be estimated accurately based on the ophthalmic examination on initial presentation to the hospital. Risk factors for surgery include age older than 9 years, proptosis, EOM restriction, and elevated IOP. These factors may be used to identify patients at high risk for failure of medical management early in the clinical course.",2014,10.1016/j.ajo.2014.04.022,158,2,387-394.e1,eng,1879-1891 0002-9394,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Prognosis and ROC Curve and Follow-Up Studies and Infant, Newborn and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and *Decision Making and Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data and Orbital Cellulitis/diagnosis/*surgery",NA,NA,2014/08//undefined,Am J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: A study of the performance of the NOA compared with the results from 3 RSs. PARTICIPANTS: A selection of 155 anonymized OCT scans (Zeiss Cirrus; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) from an image repository at a single tertiary referral retina center (Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Belfast, United Kingdom) after approval from the local data guardian of the clinical site. METHODS: One hundred fifty-five OCT cube scans were stripped of all clinical identifiers and exported. The NOA and 3 independent RSs analyzed all 128 B-scans of each cube scan for the presence of intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, and sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid. The NOA also ranked individual B-scans of each volume scan for likelihood of CNV activity, which was subjected to a second grading session by the 3 RSs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The NOA's sensitivity and specificity versus the RS grading and the NOA's performance in ranking B-scans for activity. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two cube scans met the inclusion criteria for the primary analysis. On testing the RS grading versus the NOA, the accuracy was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], <c2><b1>7%), sensitivity was 92% (95% CI, <c2><b1>6%), and specificity was 91% (95% CI, <c2><b1>6%), meeting the primary outcome. The graders' accuracy when compared with the majority of the other graders (including a fourth grader) was 93%. On average, the 3 graders could identify fluid in 95% of scans by just reviewing a single cross-section with the highest NOA score and 99.5% of scans with fluid by viewing the top 3 cross-sections. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between the NOA and the RS determination of lesion activity was extremely high. The level of discrepancy between the RS and the NOA results was similar to the NOA's mismatches.

J. and Suleman, Mehrunisha and Gray, Muir and Yeates, David and Goldacre, Michael J.",The British journal of ophthalmology,"AIMS: To study trends in rates of childhood squint surgery in England over five decades, and to study recent geographical variation in England. METHODS: Use of routine hospital statistics to analyse trends in squint surgery in the Oxford record linkage study area 1963-2010, and England 1968-2010; analysis of geographical variation in England 1999-2010. All rates, numerators and population denominators were restricted to people aged under 15 years. RESULTS: The study included 519 089 admissions for operations on squint. Annual admission rates for squint surgery in England fell from 188.8 episodes per 100 000 population (95% CI 180.9 to 196.8) in 1968 to 64.1 (62.4 to 65.7) episodes per 100 000 population in 2010. A similar decline was seen in the Oxford region, from 213.2 (181.3 to 245.2) episodes per 100 000 population in 1963 to 61.3 (54.8 to 67.9) episodes in 2010. There was wide variation across local authorities in annual rates of squint surgery from 28.2 (95% CI 22.7 to 34.8) admissions per 100 000 population to 138.6 (123.0 to 155.7) admissions per 100 000, a 4.9-fold difference between areas with the highest and lowest rates. CONCLUSIONS: Squint surgery rates have decreased substantially over time. The current wide geographical variation in rates raises questions about whether this scale of variation is clinically warranted, whether it reflects variation in needs for surgery and patient/parental choice, whether it is a result of inequalities in the availability of ophthalmic services, or whether it results from variation between clinicians in clinical decision making about the likely benefits of squint surgery.",2013,10.1136/bjophthalmol-2012-302932,97,6,746-751,eng,1468-2079 0007-1161,"Public Health and Epidemiology and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Databases, Factual and Incidence and Topography, Medical and England/epidemiology and Treatment Surgery and Child Health (Paediatrics) and Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data/*trends and Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data/trends and Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data/trends and Strabismus/*epidemiology/*surgery",NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,Br J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tallab_2016_ThBrjoofop,JOUR,"Corticosteroids as a therapy for bacterial keratitis: an evidence-based review of 'who, when and why'","Tallab, Raghad T. and Stone, Donald U.",The British journal of ophthalmology,"Corticosteroids have been proposed as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial keratitis, with significant controversy regarding the appropriate use of this therapy. Recent prospective randomised controlled trials have provided additional evidence to guide clinical decision-making. A review of the epidemiology and mechanisms of pathogenesis, preliminary animal studies, retrospective human studies and prospective randomised clinical trials that address the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids in patients with bacterial keratitis was performed. Four prospective randomised controlled trials were identified. Three small studies found no benefit of topical corticosteroids, but were underpowered to evaluate adverse events. The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) study and subgroup analyses provide evidence for a relative gain of one line of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity in patients with non-Nocardia bacterial keratitis, especially when corticosteroids were initiated within 3 days of presentation; no increase in adverse events was noted. No evidence was found to support the concern for corneal thinning attributable to corticosteroids in the absence of an inadequately treated infectious process. In patients with culture-proven non-Nocardia bacterial keratitis, corticosteroids provide one line of vision improvement over antimicrobials alone, with no increase in adverse events. This benefit should not be extrapolated to patients with other aetiologies of keratitis, such as fungus, herpes viruses, acanthamoeba or atypical mycobacteria, and these entities should be excluded before considering adjunctive steroid therapy.",2016,10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-307955,100,6,731-735,eng,1468-2079 0007-1161,"Humans and Treatment Outcome and Drug Therapy, Combination and Visual Acuity and Inflammation and Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use and Clinical Trial and Treatment Medical and Cornea and Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use and Infection and Eye Infections, Bacterial/*drug therapy and Keratitis/*drug therapy/microbiology",NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,Br J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients (158 eyes) evaluated and treated for acute ocular involvement in SJS or TEN during hospitalization. METHODS: Photographic and chart review of acute ocular findings, interventions received, and outcomes with regard to visual acuity, dry eye symptoms, and scarring sequelae at least 3 months after the acute illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, dry eye severity, and scarring of the ocular surface and eyelids were assessed after follow-up of at least 3 months. RESULTS: Cases graded as mild or moderate were managed medically. All had best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20, no dry eye symptoms, and no scarring sequelae. Cases graded as severe or extremely severe were treated with urgent amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in addition to medical management. Severe cases all had BCVA of 20/20 and mild or no dry eye problems. Five of 28 patients had mild tarsal conjunctival scarring. No other scarring sequelae occurred. Nine of the 10 extremely severe cases had BCVA of 20/20 (1 was 20/30). Three of 10 had moderate scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva and lid margins and also moderate dry eyes with severe photophobia. Seven of 10 had only mild or no dry eye symptoms and scarring sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: This grading system facilitates decision making in the evaluation and management of the acute ocular manifestations of SJS and TEN. Mild and moderate cases have a low risk of significant scarring or visual sequelae and may be monitored and treated medically if not worsening.

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was proposed of patients with AMD or PCV who came to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Diagnoses of all patients were confirmed by two retinal experts based on diagnostic gold standard for AMD and PCV. Patients with concurrent retinal vascular diseases were excluded. Colour fundus images and spectral domain OCT images were taken from dilated eyes of patients and healthy controls, and anonymised. All images were pre-labelled into normal, dry or wet AMD or PCV. ResNet-50 models were used as the backbone and alternate machine learning models including random forest classifiers were constructed for further comparison. For human-machine comparison, the same testing data set was diagnosed by three retinal experts independently. All images from the same participant were presented only within a single partition subset. RESULTS: On a test set of 143 fundus and OCT image pairs from 80 eyes (20 eyes per-group), the bi-modal DCNN demonstrated the best performance, with accuracy 87.4%, sensitivity 88.8% and specificity 95.6%, and a perfect agreement with diagnostic gold standard (Cohen's <ce><ba> 0.828), exceeds slightly over the best expert (Human1, Cohen's <ce><ba> 0.810).

CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The availability of biologic agents for the treatment of human eye disease has altered practice patterns for the management of noninfectious uveitis. Current guidelines are insufficient to assure optimal use of noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory agents. METHODS: An international expert steering committee comprising 9 uveitis specialists (including both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists) identified clinical questions and, together with 6 bibliographic fellows trained in uveitis, conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol systematic review of the literature (English language studies from January 1996 through June 2016; Medline [OVID], the Central Cochrane library, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, and Web of Science). Publications included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective studies with sufficient follow-up, case series with 15 cases or more, peer-reviewed articles, and hand-searched conference abstracts from key conferences. The proposed statements were circulated among 130 international uveitis experts for review. A total of 44 globally representative group members met in late 2016 to refine these guidelines using a modified Delphi technique and assigned Oxford levels of evidence. RESULTS: In total, 10 questions were addressed resulting in 21 evidence-based guidance statements covering the following topics: when to start noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, including both biologic and nonbiologic agents; what data to collect before treatment; when to modify or withdraw treatment; how to select agents based on individual efficacy and safety profiles; and evidence in specific uveitic conditions. Shared decision-making, communication among providers and safety monitoring also were addressed as part of the recommendations. Pharmacoeconomic considerations were not addressed.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, interventional controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Institutional study at Hotel Dieu Hospital (Queen's University) of 50 eyes, from patients with moderate to severe dry eye. Each eye from eligible patients was separately randomized to receive Super Flex or Parasol punctal plugs. The main outcome measure was plug retention at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included objective tests of Schirmer I (mm), tear meniscus height (mm), tear break-up time (s), inferior fluorescein corneal staining (National Eye Institute [NEI] scale), and average lissamine green conjunctival staining (NEI scale). RESULTS: Punctal plug retention was significantly different at 6 months (P = .011). Sixty-eight percent of Parasol plugs were retained compared to 32% of Super Flex plugs. Parasol plugs required less frequent artificial tear use at 6 months (P = .024). There was a statistically significant improvement in all secondary outcome measures (Schirmer, tear meniscus height, tear break-up time, fluorescein corneal staining) at 6 months within plug groups except conjunctival staining. There were no additional significant differences between groups and no plug complications reported.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Three low-birth-weight, severely premature infants. METHODS: Clinical examination was performed using a portable slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscope. Imaging was performed by using a handheld SD OCT device and Retcam (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) or video-indirect recording. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging was conducted without sedation at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit on 1 patient. The other 2 patients had an examination under anesthesia with SD OCT imaging in the operating room. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In vivo determination of vitreoretinal morphology, anatomy, and pathology by clinical examination, imaging, and SD OCT. RESULTS: Linear and volumetric imaging was achieved with the handheld system in infant eyes despite tunica vasculosa lentis and vitreous bands. Imaging was not possible in eyes with notable vitreous hemorrhage. Analysis of SD OCT images revealed preretinal structures (ranging from 409 to 2700 microm in width and 212 to 440 microm in height), retinoschisis, and retinal detachment in the posterior pole of patients with advanced ROP. Both the retinoschisis and the preretinal structures were not identified on conventional examination or imaging by expert pediatric ophthalmologists. The preretinal structures varied in location and size, and may represent preretinal fibrovascular proliferation. Some were found in close proximity to blood vessels, whereas others were near the optic nerve. CONCLUSIONS: Handheld SD OCT imaging can be performed on the sedated or nonsedated neonate and provides valuable subclinical anatomic information.

DESIGN: Prospective, experimental, laboratory study. METHODS: Using the average wholesale price and common dosing patterns, we calculated the theoretical yearly cost of glaucoma medications. RESULTS: Calculated yearly cost ranged from $150.81 for generic timolol maleate 0.5% (Falcon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) to $697.42 for Cosopt (Merck & Co, West Point, Pennsylvania, USA), and as high as $873.98 for a three-times-daily dose of Alphagan P 0.15% (Allergan, Inc, Irvine, California, USA). Among brand name beta-blockers, yearly cost ranged between $203.47 for Timoptic 0.5% (Merck & Co) and $657.24 for Betoptic S (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas, USA). Generic beta-blockers consistently were more economical than their brand-name counterparts. Yearly cost of prostaglandin analogs ranged from $427.69 for Travatan (Alcon) to $577.62 for Lumigan (Allergan). The two carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Azopt (Alcon) and Trusopt (Merck & Co), yielded similar economic profiles. Alphagan P 0.15% had yearly calculated costs of $559.08 for twice daily dosing per eye.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study participants. Participants who had undergone incisional intraocular or keratorefractive surgery between CCT measurements were excluded. TESTING: The first CCT measurements were performed starting in 1999, and the second measurements were performed starting in 2002. Measurements were performed by OHTS certified technicians using an ultrasonic pachymeter under a standardized protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Central corneal thickness measurement (micrometers). RESULTS: First and second CCT measurements were available from 73% (1191) of the 1636 OHTS participants randomized. Central corneal thickness decreased a mean rate of -0.74+/-3.5 microm/year between the first and second CCT measurements. The mean medication exposure between first and second CCT measurements in participants originally randomized to observation (n = 595) was 1.1+/-1.6 years, versus 5.0+/-2.7 years in participants originally randomized to medication (n = 596). Central corneal thickness decreased by a mean of 1.0+/-3.4 microm/year among participants originally randomized to observation, compared with 0.5+/-3.5 microm/year among participants originally randomized to medication (P<0.0001). Subgroup analyses suggest that participants treated only with topical prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) between the two CCT measurements had a greater rate of decrease per year than participants treated only with topical beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of CCT decrease over 3.8 years is comparable to the cross-sectional age differences reported in the OHTS at the first measurement (0.6 microm/year) and comparable to other cross-sectional studies. Use of topical PGAs may be associated with a slightly higher rate of thinning.

Gedde_2009_Amjoofop,JOUR,Three-year follow-up of the tube versus trabeculectomy study,"Gedde, Steven J. and Schiffman, Joyce C. and Feuer, William J. and Herndon, Leon W. and Brandt, James D. and Budenz, Donald L.",American journal of ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To report 3-year results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Seventeen clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy, cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, or both and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) > or =18 mm Hg and < or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A 350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC 0.4 mg/ml for 4 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP, visual acuity, use of supplemental medical therapy, surgical complications, and failure (IOP >21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20%, IOP < or =5 mm Hg, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision). RESULTS: A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled, including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group. At 3 years, IOP (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) was 13.0 +/- 4.9 mm Hg in the tube group and 13.3 +/- 6.8 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (P = .78). The number of glaucoma medications (mean +/- SD) was 1.3 +/- 1.3 in the tube group and 1.0 +/- 1.5 in the trabeculectomy group (P = .30). The cumulative probability of failure during the first 3 years of follow-up was 15.1% in the tube group and 30.7% in the trabeculectomy group (P = .010; hazards ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.1). Postoperative complications developed in 42 patients (39%) in the tube group and 63 patients (60%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = .004). Surgical complications were associated with reoperation and/or loss of > or =2 Snellen lines in 24 patients (22%) in the tube group and 28 patients (27%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = .58). CONCLUSIONS: Tube shunt surgery had a higher success rate compared to trabeculectomy with MMC during the first 3 years of follow-up in the TVT Study. Both procedures were associated with similar IOP reduction and use of supplemental medical therapy at 3 years. While the incidence of postoperative complications was higher following trabeculectomy with MMC relative to tube shunt surgery, most complications were transient and self-limited.",2009,10.1016/j.ajo.2009.06.018,148,5,670-684,eng,1879-1891 0002-9394,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Follow-Up Studies and Postoperative Complications and Reoperation and Cataract Extraction and Intraocular Pressure/*physiology and Visual Acuity/physiology and *Glaucoma Drainage Implants and Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage and Glaucoma/physiopathology/*surgery and Lens Implantation, Intraocular and Mitomycin/administration & dosage and Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methods and Tonometry, Ocular and Trabeculectomy/adverse effects/*methods",NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,Am J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dahlgren_2007_Amjoofop,JOUR,The clinical diagnosis of microbial keratitis,"Dahlgren, Matthew A. and Lingappan, Ahila and Wilhelmus, Kirk R.",American journal of ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of ophthalmologists to predict the laboratory results of presumed microbial keratitis and to explore which findings may influence diagnostic prognostication. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: Fifteen ophthalmologists completed study forms at the initial presentation of patients with presumed microbial keratitis. After predicting the category of microbial recovery, clinicians submitted corneal scrapings for masked laboratory processing. The relative effects of ocular inflammatory signs on correct microbial diagnosis were explored with Poisson regression. RESULTS: Clinical examiners correctly predicted the presence or absence of microbial recovery in 79 (76%) of 104 ulcerative keratitis cases and successfully distinguished among bacterial, fungal, and amebic keratitis for 54 (73%) of 74 culture-positive infections, although only 31 (42%) were subcategorized properly. The positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43% to 84%) for 20 eyes with Pseudomonas keratitis cases, 48% (95% CI, 32% to 63%) for 38 other bacterial keratitis, 45% (95% CI, 17% to 77%) for 13 fungal keratitis, and 89% (95% CI, 52% to 100%) for nine Acanthamoeba keratitis cases. The recognition of Pseudomonas keratitis significantly improved by the occurrence of a larger infiltrate (P = .02), and correctly predicting Acanthamoeba keratitis was enhanced by observing a ring infiltrate (P < .001). Antimicrobial use before referral significantly attenuated clinical diagnosis (P = .03) and hampered microbial recovery (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Established Pseudomonas keratitis and Acanthamoeba keratitis can be suspected before laboratory confirmation, but overlapping inflammatory features and recent empiric antimicrobial treatment limits etiologic recognition of most microbial corneal infections.",2007,10.1016/j.ajo.2007.02.030,143,6,940-944,eng,0002-9394,"Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prospective Studies and Animals and Predictive Value of Tests and Medical History Taking and Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use and Acanthamoeba/isolation & purification and Bacteria/isolation & purification and Cornea/microbiology/parasitology and Corneal Ulcer/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology/parasitology and Eye Infections, Bacterial/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology and Eye Infections, Fungal/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology and Eye Infections, Parasitic/*diagnosis/drug therapy/parasitology and Fungi/isolation & purification",NA,NA,2007/06//undefined,Am J Ophthalmol,NA,NA,NA,NA
