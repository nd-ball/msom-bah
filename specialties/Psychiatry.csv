Oh_2019_Joofafdi,JOUR,Identifying depression in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data using a deep learning algorithm,"Oh, Jihoon and Yun, Kyongsik and Maoz, Uri and Kim, Tae-Suk and Chae, Jeong-Ho",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: As depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, large-scale surveys have been conducted to establish the occurrence and risk factors of depression. However, accurately estimating epidemiological factors leading up to depression has remained challenging. Deep-learning algorithms can be applied to assess the factors leading up to prevalence and clinical manifestations of depression. METHODS: Customized deep-neural-network and machine-learning classifiers were assessed using survey data from 19,725 participants from the NHANES database (from 1999 through 2014) and 4949 from the South Korea NHANES (K-NHANES) database in 2014. RESULTS: A deep-learning algorithm showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91 and 0.89 for detecting depression in NHANES and K-NHANES, respectively. The deep-learning algorithm trained with serial datasets (NHANES, from 1999 to 2012), predicted the prevalence of depression in the following two years of data (NHANES, 2013 and 2014) with an AUC of 0.92. Machine learning classifiers trained with NHANES could further predict depression in K-NHANES. There, logistic regression had the highest performance (AUC, 0.77) followed by deep learning algorithm (AUC, 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural-networks managed to identify depression well from other health and demographic factors in both the NHANES and K-NHANES datasets. The deep-learning algorithm was also able to predict depression relatively well on new data set-cross temporally and cross nationally. Further research can delineate the clinical implications of machine learning and deep learning in detecting disease prevalence and progress as well as other risk factors for depression and other mental illnesses.",2019,10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.034,257,NA,623-631,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Machine learning and Depression and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Machine Learning and Deep learning and Databases, Factual and Risk Factors and Nutrition Surveys and ROC Curve and *Algorithms and Neural Networks, Computer and *Deep Learning and Depression/*epidemiology and Republic of Korea and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey",NA,NA,2019/10/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hatton_2019_Joofafdi,JOUR,Predicting persistent depressive symptoms in older adults: A machine learning approach to personalised mental healthcare,"Hatton, Christopher M. and Paton, Lewis W. and McMillan, Dean and Cussens, James and Gilbody, Simon and Tiffin, Paul A.",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Depression causes significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. Predicting persistence of depressive symptoms could permit targeted prevention, and lessen the burden of depression. Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, and such approaches offer powerful predictive abilities. We investigated the utility of a machine learning approach to predict the persistence of depressive symptoms in older adults. METHOD: Baseline demographic and psychometric data from 284 patients were used to predict the likelihood of older adults having persistent depressive symptoms after 12 months, using a machine learning approach ('extreme gradient boosting'). Predictive performance was compared to a conventional statistical approach (logistic regression). Data were drawn from the 'treatment-as-usual' arm of the CASPER (CollAborative care and active surveillance for Screen-Positive EldeRs with subthreshold depression) trial. RESULTS: Predictive performance was superior using machine learning compared to logistic regression (mean AUC 0.72 vs. 0.67, p<e2><80><af><<e2><80><af>0.0001). Using machine learning, an average of 89% of those predicted to have PHQ-9 scores above threshold at 12 months actually did, compared to 78% using logistic regression. However, mean negative predictive values were somewhat lower for the machine learning approach (45% vs. 35%). LIMITATIONS: A relatively small sample size potentially limited the predictive power of the algorithm. In addition, PHQ-9 scores were used as an indicator of persistent depressive symptoms, and whilst well validated, a clinical interview would have been preferable.

Weissman_2020_JAMApsyc,JOUR,Big Data Begin in Psychiatry,"Weissman, Myrna M.",JAMA psychiatry,"The last 40 years of JAMA Psychiatry are reviewed as a celebration of its achievements. The focus of this article is on the evolution of big data as reflected in key journal articles. The review begins in 1984 with the introduction of the Epidemiology Catchment Area (ECA) study and Freedman's editorial ""Psychiatric Epidemiology Counts."" The ECA study (N = 17<e2><80><af>000), for the first time in a survey, used clinical diagnosis in 5 urban communities, thus linking research and care to population rates of psychiatric diagnosis. The review then traces the subsequent evolution of big data to 5 overlapping phases, other population surveys in the US and globally, cohort studies, administrative claims, large genetic data sets, and electronic health records. Each of these topics are illustrated in articles in JAMA Psychiatry. The many caveats to these choices, the historical roots before 1984, as well as the controversy around the choice of topics and the term big data are acknowledged. The foundation for big data in psychiatry was built on the development of defined and reliable diagnosis, assessment tools that could be used in large samples, the computational evolution for handling large data sets, hypothesis generated by smaller studies of humans and animals with carefully crafted phenotypes, the welcoming of investigators from all over the world with calls for broader diversity, open access and the sharing of data, and introduction of electronic health records more recently. Future directions as well as the opportunities for the complementary roles of big and little data are described.

Aggregate changes in medications in response to clinical need may serve as a surrogate outcome measure. We developed the Medication Recommendation Tracking Form (MRTF) to record the frequency, types, and reasons for medication adjustments in order to calculate Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCAs), medication adjustments to reduce symptoms, maximize treatment response, or address problematic side effects. METHODS: The MRTF was completed at every visit for 482 adult patients in Bipolar CHOICE, a 6-month randomized comparative effectiveness trial. RESULTS: Responders had significantly fewer NCAs compared to non-responders. NCAs predicted subsequent response status such that every additional NCA during the previous visit decreased a patient's odds of response by approximately 30%. Patients with more severe symptoms had a greater number of NCAs at the subsequent visit. Patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder demonstrated a significantly higher rate of NCAs per month than those without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients with greater frequency, intensity, and interference of side effects had higher rates of NCAs. Participants with fewer NCAs reported a higher quality of life and decreased functional impairment. LIMITATIONS: The MRTF has not been examined in community clinic settings and did not predict response more efficiently than the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP). CONCLUSIONS: The MRTF is a feasible proxy of clinical outcome, with implications for clinical training and decision-making.

Taquet_2021_ThelanPsy,JOUR,Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62 354 COVID-19 cases in the USA,"Taquet, Maxime and Luciano, Sierra and Geddes, John R. and Harrison, Paul J.",The lancet. Psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69<c2><b7>8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. FINDINGS: In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2<c2><b7>1, 95% CI 1<c2><b7>8-2<c2><b7>5 vs influenza; 1<c2><b7>7, 1<c2><b7>5-1<c2><b7>9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1<c2><b7>6, 1<c2><b7>4-1<c2><b7>9 vs skin infection; 1<c2><b7>6, 1<c2><b7>3-1<c2><b7>9 vs cholelithiasis; 2<c2><b7>2, 1<c2><b7>9-2<c2><b7>6 vs urolithiasis, and 2<c2><b7>1, 1<c2><b7>9-2<c2><b7>5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0<c2><b7>0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18<c2><b7>1% (95% CI 17<c2><b7>6-18<c2><b7>6), including 5<c2><b7>8% (5<c2><b7>2-6<c2><b7>4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1<c2><b7>6% (95% CI 1<c2><b7>2-2<c2><b7>1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1<c2><b7>65, 95% CI 1<c2><b7>59-1<c2><b7>71; p<0<c2><b7>0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. INTERPRETATION: Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of recurrent neural networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gradient boosted trees, with logistic regression and feedforward neural networks. METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The optimal recurrent neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8407), one-dimensional convolutional neural network configuration (AUC: 0.8419), and XGB model configuration (AUC: 0.8493) all outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179). In addition to superior discrimination, the optimal XGB model configuration also achieved superior calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings. It appears that the XGB model class is the most promising in terms of discrimination, calibration, and computational expense.

Na_2021_Joofafdi,JOUR,Machine learning-based discrimination of panic disorder from other anxiety disorders,"Na, Kyoung-Sae and Cho, Seo-Eun and Cho, Seong-Jin",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUNDS: Panic disorder is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that substantially impairs quality of life and psychosocial function. Panic disorder arises from neurobiological substrates and developmental factors that distinguish it from other anxiety disorders. Differential diagnosis between panic disorder and other anxiety disorders has only been conducted in terms of a phenomenological spectrum. METHODS: Through a machine learning-based approach with heart rate variability (HRV) as input, we aimed to build algorithms that can differentiate panic disorder from other anxiety disorders. Five algorithms were used: random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and regularized logistic regression (LR). 10-fold cross-validation with five repeats was used to build the final models. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with panic disorder and 61 patients with other anxiety disorders (aged between 20 and 65 years) were recruited. The L1-regularized LR showed the best accuracy (0.784), followed by ANN (0.730), SVM (0.730), GBM (0.676), and finally RF (0.649). LR also had good performance in other measures, such as F(1)-score (0.790), specificity (0.737), sensitivity (0.833), and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.572).

The aim of this study is to investigate the probability of suicide death using baseline characteristics and simple medical facility visit history data using Cox regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). METHOD: This study included 819,951 subjects in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-Cohort Sample Database from 2004 to 2013. The dataset was divided randomly into two independent training and validation groups. To improve the performance of predicting suicide death, we applied SVM and DNN to the same training set as the Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among the study population, 2546 people died by intentional self-harm during the follow-up time. Sex, age, type of insurance, household income, disability, and medical records of eight ICD-10 codes (including mental and behavioural disorders) were selected by a Cox regression model with backward stepwise elimination. The area of under the curve (AUC) of Cox regression (0.688), SVM (0.687), and DNN (0.683) were approximately the same. The group with top .5% of predicted probability had hazard ratio of 26.21 compared to that with the lowest 10% of predicted probability. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by the lack of information on suicidal ideation and attempts, other potential covariates such as information of medication and subcategory ICD-10 codes. Moreover, predictors from the prior 12-24 months of the date of death could be expected to show better performances than predictors from up to 10 years ago.

OBJECTIVE: To use a deep learning model applied to a large-scale clinical data set of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) session transcripts to generate a quantifiable measure of treatment delivered and to determine the association between the quantity of each aspect of therapy delivered and clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All data were obtained from patients receiving internet-enabled CBT for the treatment of a mental health disorder between June 2012 and March 2018 in England. Cognitive behavioral therapy was delivered in a secure online therapy room via instant synchronous messaging. The initial sample comprised a total of 17<e2><80><af>572 patients (90<e2><80><af>934 therapy session transcripts). Patients self-referred or were referred by a primary health care worker directly to the service. EXPOSURES: All patients received National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence-approved disorder-specific CBT treatment protocols delivered by a qualified CBT therapist. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were measured in terms of reliable improvement in patient symptoms and treatment engagement. Reliable improvement was calculated based on 2 severity measures: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), corresponding to depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, completed by the patient at initial assessment and before every therapy session (see eMethods in the Supplement for details). RESULTS: Treatment sessions from a total of 14<e2><80><af>899 patients (10<e2><80><af>882 women) aged between 18 and 94 years (median age, 34.8 years) were included in the final analysis. We trained a deep learning model to automatically categorize therapist utterances into 1 or more of 24 feature categories. The trained model was applied to our data set to obtain quantifiable measures of each feature of treatment delivered. A logistic regression revealed that increased quantities of a number of session features, including change methods (cognitive and behavioral techniques used in CBT), were associated with greater odds of reliable improvement in patient symptoms (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06-1.17) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.12-1.27). The quantity of nontherapy-related content was associated with reduced odds of symptom improvement (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85-0.92) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.84-0.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates an association between clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and the content of therapist utterances. These findings support the principle that CBT change methods help produce improvements in patients' presenting symptoms.

The increased focus on combining health care data with machine-learning approaches in psychiatry may help advance the understanding of suicide risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine sex-specific risk profiles for death from suicide using machine-learning methods and data from the population of Denmark. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-cohort study nested within 8 national Danish health and social registries was conducted from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2015. The source population was all persons born or residing in Denmark as of January 1, 1995. Data were analyzed from November 5, 2018, through May 13, 2019.

RESULTS: A total of 14<e2><80><af>103 individuals died by suicide between 1995 and 2015 (10 152 men [72.0%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [18.8] years and 3951 women [28.0%]; age, 47.6 [18.8] years). The comparison subcohort was a 5% random sample (n = 265<e2><80><af>183) of living individuals in Denmark on January 1, 1995 (130 591 men [49.2%]; age, 37.4 [21.8] years and 134 592 women [50.8%]; age, 39.9 [23.4] years). With use of classification trees and random forests, sex-specific differences were noted in risk for suicide, with physical health more important to men's suicide risk than women's suicide risk. Psychiatric disorders and possibly associated medications were important to suicide risk, with specific results that may increase clarity in the literature. Generally, diagnoses and medications measured 48 months before suicide were more important indicators of suicide risk than when measured 6 months earlier. Individuals in the top 5% of predicted suicide risk appeared to account for 32.0% of all suicide cases in men and 53.4% of all cases in women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite decades of research on suicide risk factors, understanding of suicide remains poor. In this study, the first to date to develop risk profiles for suicide based on data from a full population, apparent consistency with what is known about suicide risk was noted, as well as potentially important, understudied risk factors with evidence of unique suicide risk profiles among specific subpopulations.",2020,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2905,77,1,25-34,eng,2168-6238 2168-622X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Sex Factors and Models, Statistical and Registries and *Machine Learning and Risk Assessment/*methods and Denmark/epidemiology and Suicide/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and Marital Status and Mental Disorders/complications/epidemiology and Single-Payer System/*statistics & numerical data and Suicide, Completed/psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/01/01/,JAMA Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this Health Policy paper, we consider the complexities involved in generating such data and propose an approach to classify mental health research grants. We then describe a method using search terms and algorithms for automatic identification and categorisation of mental health research grants listed in a major international database (Dimensions, Digital Science). The automated approach was validated using manually categorised grants data from funders based in the UK, which showed that the accuracy of this approach is satisfactory and comparable to manual classification. Finally, we consider areas of research that are difficult to classify, and how the automated approach can be refined using machine-learning. We argue that agreed definitions and automated approaches could facilitate collaborative reporting of mental health research funders nationally and internationally and improve the strategic dialogue in this area of research.",2019,10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30033-1,6,5,445-452,eng,2215-0374 2215-0366,"Humans and Health Policy and Databases, Factual and United Kingdom and Biomedical Research/*economics and Mental Health/*economics",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Lancet Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

Psychiatry,"There is widespread agreement by health-care providers, medical associations, industry, and governments that automation using digital technology could improve the delivery and quality of care in psychiatry, and reduce costs. Many benefits from technology have already been realised, along with the identification of many challenges. In this Review, we discuss some of the challenges to developing effective automation for psychiatry to optimise physician treatment of individual patients. Using the perspective of automation experts in other industries, three examples of automation in the delivery of routine care are reviewed: (1) effects of electronic medical records on the patient interview; (2) effects of complex systems integration on e-prescribing; and (3) use of clinical decision support to assist with clinical decision making.

Although it is understudied, specialty probation could improve outcomes for the overrepresented group of people with mental illness. OBJECTIVE: To test whether specialty probation yields better public safety outcomes than traditional probation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal observational study with group matching on age, sex, race/ethnicity, probation time, and offense at 2 urban agencies that exemplify specialty and traditional probation. Enrollment began October 19, 2005; follow-up data were complete January 26, 2013. Participants were 359 diverse probationers with serious mental health problems and functional impairment. Probationers and officers were assessed 3 times (for probationers, 6-month retention, 315 of 359 [88%]; 12-month retention 304 of 359 [85%]) and follow-up records were obtained. Machine learning algorithms were combined with a targeted maximum likelihood estimation, a double robust estimator that accounts for associations between confounders and both treatment assignment and outcomes. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 1, 2016 to May 5, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Specialty probationers were assigned to small, homogeneous caseloads supervised by experts. Prior data indicate that specialty officers had better relationships with probationers, participated more in probationers' treatment, and relied more on positive compliance strategies than traditional officers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Violence during 1 year, determined by probationer report, officer report, and records, and rearrest during a period of 2 to 5 years, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation records. RESULTS: Participants were 183 specialty (73.8% of 248 eligible) and 176 traditional (56.6% of 311 eligible) probationers (205 men and 154 women; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [10.6]). Although specialty probation had no significant effect on violence (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.69-1.36), the odds of rearrest were 2.68 times higher for traditional probationers than for specialty probationers (95% CI, 1.86-3.84; P < .001). At 2 years, estimated probabilities of rearrest were 28.6% for specialty probationers and 51.8% for traditional probationers. Survival analyses indicate that arrest effects endured up to 5 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although it did not specifically reduce violence, well-implemented specialty probation appears to be effective in reducing general recidivism.

We report results of model validation in an independent prospective national household sample of 1056 respondents with lifetime MDD at baseline. The WMH ML models were applied to these baseline data to generate predicted outcome scores that were compared with observed scores assessed 10-12 years after baseline. ML model prediction accuracy was also compared with that of conventional logistic regression models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve based on ML (0.63 for high chronicity and 0.71-0.76 for the other prospective outcomes) was consistently higher than for the logistic models (0.62-0.70) despite the latter models including more predictors. A total of 34.6-38.1% of respondents with subsequent high persistence chronicity and 40.8-55.8% with the severity indicators were in the top 20% of the baseline ML-predicted risk distribution, while only 0.9% of respondents with subsequent hospitalizations and 1.5% with suicide attempts were in the lowest 20% of the ML-predicted risk distribution.

We propose a machine learning framework for PPD risk prediction using data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: Two EHR datasets containing data on 15,197 women from 2015 to 2018 at a single site, and 53,972 women from 2004 to 2017 at multiple sites were used as development and validation sets, respectively, to construct the PPD risk prediction model. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of PPD within 1 year following childbirth. A framework of data extraction, processing, and machine learning was implemented to select a minimal list of features from the EHR datasets to ensure model performance and to enable future point-of-care risk prediction. RESULTS: The best-performing model uses from clinical features related to mental health history, medical comorbidity, obstetric complications, medication prescription orders, and patient demographic characteristics. The model performances as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are 0.937 (95% CI 0.912 - 0.962) and 0.886 (95% CI 0.879-0.893) in the development and validation datasets, respectively. The model performances were consistent when tested using data ending at multiple time periods during pregnancy and at childbirth. LIMITATIONS: The prevalence of PPD in the study data represented a treatment prevalence and is likely lower than the illness prevalence.

Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype asked as part of an online mental health survey taken by a subset of participants (n = 157,366) in the UK Biobank. After quality control, we leveraged a genotyped set of unrelated, white British ancestry participants including 2433 cases and 334,766 controls that included those that did not participate in the survey or were not explicitly asked about attempting suicide. The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h(2)(SNP) = 0.035, p = 7.12 * 10(-4)) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h(2)(SNP) = 0.046, p = 1.51 * 10(-2)). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (t = 4.02, p = 5.75 * 10(-5)) and genetic correlation (rg = 1.073, SE = 0.36, p = 0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rg = 0.34-0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rg = 0.26-0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt.

However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria. OBJECTIVES: To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004-2005 managed care subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011-2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary care controls (n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS. RESULTS: Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples.

Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did.

The aim of our study was to explore the predictability of the success of smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions in eliciting mood changes using machine learning. METHODS: Participants conducted daily smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions, guided by short video clips, for 13 consecutive days. Participants chose one of four intervention techniques used in psychotherapeutic approaches. Mood changes were assessed using the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire. Micro-intervention success was predicted using random forest (RF) tree-based mixed-effects logistic regression models. Data from 27 participants were used, totaling 324 micro-interventions, randomly split 100 times into training and test samples, using within-subject and between-subject sampling.

However, to date, no research has demonstrated the capacity for these digital biomarkers to predict long-term prognosis. METHODS: We utilized deep learning models based on wearable sensor technology to predict long-term (17-18-year) deterioration in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms from actigraphy data on daytime movement and nighttime sleeping patterns. As part of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study of health and well-being, subjects (N = 265) (i) completed a phone-based interview that assessed generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms at enrollment, (ii) participated in a one-week actigraphy study 9-14 years later, and (iii) completed a long-term follow-up, phone-based interview to quantify generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms 17-18 years from initial enrollment. A deep auto-encoder paired with a multi-layered ensemble deep learning model was leveraged to predict whether participants experienced increased anxiety disorder symptoms across this 17-18 year period.

Their genetic architectures are highly polygenic and overlapping, which is supported by heterogeneous phenotypic expression and substantial clinical overlap. Brain network analysis provides a noninvasive means of dissecting biological heterogeneity, yet its sensitivity, specificity, and validity in assessing individual characteristics relevant for brain function and mental health and their genetic underpinnings in clinical applications remain a challenge. METHODS: In a machine learning approach, we predicted individual scores for educational attainment, fluid intelligence and dimensional measures of depression, anxiety, and neuroticism using functional magnetic resonance imaging-based static and dynamic temporal synchronization between large-scale brain network nodes in 10,343 healthy individuals from the UK Biobank. In addition to using age and sex to serve as our reference point, we also predicted individual polygenic scores for related phenotypes and 13 different neuroticism traits and schizophrenia. RESULTS: Beyond high accuracy for age and sex, supporting the biological sensitivity of the connectome-based features, permutation tests revealed above chance-level prediction accuracy for trait-level educational attainment and fluid intelligence. Educational attainment and fluid intelligence were mainly negatively associated with static brain connectivity in frontal and default mode networks, whereas age showed positive correlations with a more widespread pattern. In contrast, prediction accuracy was at chance level for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and polygenic scores across traits.

Statistical methods that can integrate such multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting, poor generalization, and difficulties in interpreting the results. METHODS: We propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach, we investigated structural brain-behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires and IQ and demographic measures. RESULTS: Both sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of brain-behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified brain-behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain volume.

To our knowledge, the overall characteristics and specific determinants of pretest risk of psychosis onset in individuals undergoing clinical high risk (CHR) assessment are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics and determinants of pretest risk of psychosis onset in individuals undergoing CHR assessment and to develop and externally validate a pretest risk stratification model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical register-based cohort study. Individuals were drawn from electronic, real-world, real-time clinical records relating to routine mental health care of CHR services in South London and the Maudsley National Health Service Trust in London, United Kingdom. The study included nonpsychotic individuals referred on suspicion of psychosis risk and assessed by the Outreach and Support in South London CHR service from 2002 to 2015. Model development and validation was performed with machine-learning methods based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator for Cox proportional hazards model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pretest risk of psychosis onset in individuals undergoing CHR assessment. Predictors included age, sex, age * sex interaction, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, marital status, referral source, and referral year. RESULTS: A total of 710 nonpsychotic individuals undergoing CHR assessment were included. The mean age was 23 years. Three hundred ninety-nine individuals were men (56%), their race/ethnicity was heterogenous, and they were referred from a variety of sources. The cumulative 6-year pretest risk of psychosis was 14.55% (95% CI, 11.71% to 17.99%), confirming substantial pretest risk enrichment during the recruitment of individuals undergoing CHR assessment. Race/ethnicity and source of referral were associated with pretest risk enrichment. The predictive model based on these factors was externally validated, showing moderately good discrimination and sufficient calibration. It was used to stratify individuals undergoing CHR assessment into 4 classes of pretest risk (6-year): low, 3.39% (95% CI, 0.96% to 11.56%); moderately low, 11.58% (95% CI, 8.10% to 16.40%); moderately high, 23.69% (95% CI, 16.58% to 33.20%); and high, 53.65% (95% CI, 36.78% to 72.46%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Significant risk enrichment occurs before individuals are assessed for a suspected CHR state. Race/ethnicity and source of referral are associated with pretest risk enrichment in individuals undergoing CHR assessment. A stratification model can identify individuals at differential pretest risk of psychosis.

We aimed to explore the potential of machine learning to predict future suicidal behaviour using population-based longitudinal data. METHOD: Baseline risk data assessed within the Scottish wellbeing study, in which 3508 young adults (18-34 years) completed a battery of psychological measures, were used to predict both suicide ideation and suicide attempts at one-year follow-up. The performance of the following algorithms was compared: regular logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, classification tree, random forests, gradient boosting and support vector machine. RESULTS: At one year follow up, 2428 respondents (71%) finished the second assessment. 336 respondents (14%) reported suicide ideation between baseline and follow up, and 50 (2%) reported a suicide attempt. All performance metrics were highly similar across methods. The random forest algorithm was the best algorithm to predict suicide ideation (AUC 0.83, PPV 0.52, BA 0.74) and the gradient boosting to predict suicide attempt (AUC 0.80, PPV 0.10, BA 0.69). LIMITATIONS: The number of respondents with suicidal behaviour at follow up was small. We only had data on psychological risk factors, limiting the potential of the more complex machine learning algorithms to outperform regular logistical regression. CONCLUSIONS: When applied to population-based longitudinal data containing multiple psychological measurements, machine learning techniques did not significantly improve the predictive accuracy of suicidal behaviour. Adding more detailed data on for example employment, education or previous health care uptake, might result in better performance of machine learning over regular logistical regression.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2020.03.081,271,NA,169-177,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Humans and Young Adult and Logistic Models and Longitudinal Studies and Machine Learning and *Suicidal Ideation and *Suicide, Attempted",NA,NA,2020/06/15/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the increasing volume of administrative health care data, there is an opportunity to evaluate whether machine learning models can improve upon statistical models for quantifying suicide risk. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative performance of logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network models that quantify suicide risk with predictors available in administrative health care system data. METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The optimal feedforward neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8352) outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179). LIMITATIONS: Many important predictors are not available in administrative data and this likely places a limit on how well prediction models developed with administrative data can perform.

Most patients try multiple antidepressants before finding an effective antidepressant. This study uses demographic and clinical information to create models predicting effectiveness of different antidepressants in treating sadness in a nationally representative sample of US adults. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey (CPES) was performed. Participants with or without a mental health diagnosis who reported sadness as a symptom, and were taking fluoxetine (n=156), sertraline (n=224), citalopram (n=91), paroxetine (n=156), venlafaxine (n=69), bupropion (n=92), or trazadone (n=26) within the past year were included. Two sets of principal component analyses (PCAs) and logistic regressions were performed: one determined associations between symptom clusters and antidepressant effectiveness for sadness, and the other created models to predict effectiveness. Both PCAs controlled for psychiatric and medical diagnoses, substance use, psychiatric medications, alternative treatments, and demographics. RESULTS: Anxiety was associated with ineffectiveness of fluoxetine in treating sadness. Low mood scores were associated with ineffectiveness of paroxetine and venlafaxine, and fatigue was associated with ineffectiveness of sertraline. The models for predicting drug effectiveness had a mean accuracy of 83% and internal validity of 72%. LIMITATIONS: CPES data were collected from 2001-2003, so newer drugs were not included. Effectiveness was for sadness, so results are not directly comparable to studies using overall depressive symptom reductions as outcomes. CONCLUSION: Since fewer than 50% of patients currently respond to their first antidepressant, this model could provide modest improvement to choosing starting antidepressants in treating sadness.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2020.04.010,272,NA,295-304,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,Machine learning and Humans and Adult and Demography and Machine Learning and Mental health and Family Characteristics and Sadness and *Sadness and *Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors and Antidepressive agents and Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use,NA,NA,2020/07/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shen_2018_ThelanPsy,JOUR,Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid in high-risk and normal-risk children with autism aged 2-4 years: a case-control study,"Shen, Mark D. and Nordahl, Christine W. and Li, Deana D. and Lee, Aaron and Angkustsiri, Kathleen and Emerson, Robert W. and Rogers, Sally J. and Ozonoff, Sally and Amaral, David G.",The lancet. Psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: We previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk infants who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally high extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6-24 months. The presence of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural symptoms of autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF volume is found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond infancy, and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children with autism. METHODS: In this case-control MRI study, children with autism spectrum disorder or with typical development aged 2-4 years were recruited from the community to the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in Sacramento, CA, USA. The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with autism spectrum disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) or high risk (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk status were derived from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously validated machine learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, age, and sex to the current dataset. FINDINGS: Between July 20, 2007, and Dec 13, 2012, 159 children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27 female) and 77 with typical development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans. The autism spectrum disorder group had an average of 15<c2><b7>1% more extra-axial CSF than controls after accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and sex (least-squares mean 116<c2><b7>74 cm(3) [SE 3<c2><b7>33] in autism group vs 101<c2><b7>40 cm(3) [3<c2><b7>93] in typical development group; p=0<c2><b7>007; Cohen's d = 0<c2><b7>39). Subgroups of normal-risk (n=132) and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly identical extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0<c2><b7>78), and both subgroups had significantly greater volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0<c2><b7>004) and brain volume (p<0<c2><b7>0001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the autism spectrum disorder group (p=0<c2><b7>04). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was associated with greater sleep disturbances (p=0<c2><b7>03) and lower non-verbal ability (p=0<c2><b7>04). The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum disorder diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76<c2><b7>2-88<c2><b7>3). INTERPRETATION: Increased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly that has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk and normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism that might share a common underlying pathophysiology.

Early post-deployment identification can direct early interventions to those in need and thereby prevents the development of chronic psychopathology. Both hold significant public health benefits given large numbers of deployed soldiers, but has so far not been achieved. Here, we aim to assess the potential for pre- and early post-deployment prediction of resilience or posttraumatic stress development in soldiers by application of machine learning (ML) methods. METHODS: ML feature selection and prediction algorithms were applied to a prospective cohort of 561 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 to identify unique risk indicators and forecast long-term posttraumatic stress responses. RESULTS: Robust pre- and early postdeployment risk indicators were identified, and included individual PTSD symptoms as well as total level of PTSD symptoms, previous trauma and treatment, negative emotions, and thought suppression. The predictive performance of these risk indicators combined was assessed by cross-validation. Together, these indicators forecasted long term posttraumatic stress responses with high accuracy (pre-deployment: AUC = 0.84 (95% CI = 0.81-0.87), post-deployment: AUC = 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91)). LIMITATIONS: This study utilized a previously collected data set and was therefore not designed to exhaust the potential of ML methods. Further, the study relied solely on self-reported measures.

However, little is known about the practice, and it remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of patients receiving EAS for psychiatric conditions and how the practice is regulated in the Netherlands. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigation reviewed psychiatric EAS case summaries made available online by the Dutch regional euthanasia review committees as of June 1, 2015. Two senior psychiatrists used directed content analysis to review and code the reports. In total, 66 cases from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical and social characteristics of patients, physician review process of the patients' requests, and the euthanasia review committees' assessments of the physicians' actions. RESULTS: Of the 66 cases reviewed, 70% (n = 46) were women. In total, 32% (n = 21) were 70 years or older, 44% (n = 29) were 50 to 70 years old, and 24% (n = 16) were 30 to 50 years old. Most had chronic, severe conditions, with histories of attempted suicides and psychiatric hospitalizations. Most had personality disorders and were described as socially isolated or lonely. Depressive disorders were the primary psychiatric issue in 55% (n = 36) of cases. Other conditions represented were psychotic, posttraumatic stress or anxiety, somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, as well as prolonged grief and autism. Comorbidities with functional impairments were common. Forty-one percent (n = 27) of physicians performing EAS were psychiatrists. Twenty-seven percent (n = 18) of patients received the procedure from physicians new to them, 14 of whom were physicians from the End-of-Life Clinic, a mobile euthanasia clinic. Consultation with other physicians was extensive, but 11% (n = 7) of cases had no independent psychiatric input, and 24% (n = 16) of cases involved disagreement among consultants. The euthanasia review committees found that one case failed to meet legal due care criteria. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Persons receiving EAS for psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands are mostly women and of diverse ages, with complex and chronic psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial histories. The granting of their EAS requests appears to involve considerable physician judgment, usually involving multiple physicians who do not always agree (sometimes without independent psychiatric input), but the euthanasia review committees generally defer to the judgments of the physicians performing the EAS.",2016,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2887,73,4,362-368,eng,2168-6238 2168-622X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Chronic Disease and Decision Making and Government Regulation and Social Isolation and Treatment Refusal and *Referral and Consultation and *Mental Competency and Netherlands/epidemiology and *Medical Futility and *Standard of Care and Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data and Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology and Euthanasia/*legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data and Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/therapy and Physicians/legislation & jurisprudence and Somatoform Disorders/epidemiology and Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology and Suicide, Assisted/*legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,JAMA Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

J.",Molecular psychiatry,"The 2013 US Veterans Administration/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines (VA/DoD CPG) require comprehensive suicide risk assessments for VA/DoD patients with mental disorders but provide minimal guidance on how to carry out these assessments. Given that clinician-based assessments are not known to be strong predictors of suicide, we investigated whether a precision medicine model using administrative data after outpatient mental health specialty visits could be developed to predict suicides among outpatients. We focused on male nondeployed Regular US Army soldiers because they account for the vast majority of such suicides. Four machine learning classifiers (naive Bayes, random forests, support vector regression and elastic net penalized regression) were explored. Of the Army suicides in 2004-2009, 41.5% occurred among 12.0% of soldiers seen as outpatient by mental health specialists, with risk especially high within 26 weeks of visits. An elastic net classifier with 10-14 predictors optimized sensitivity (45.6% of suicide deaths occurring after the 15% of visits with highest predicted risk). Good model stability was found for a model using 2004-2007 data to predict 2008-2009 suicides, although stability decreased in a model using 2008-2009 data to predict 2010-2012 suicides.

Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools. METHODS: The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility. LIMITATIONS: Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model. We highlight the importance of large-scale research initiatives and clinically accessible biomarkers, as well as the need for replication studies of current findings. In addition, we provide recommendations for future improvement and standardization of research efforts in this field.",2019,10.1016/j.jad.2018.09.067,243,NA,503-515,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Humans and Treatment Outcome and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Databases, Bibliographic and *Severity of Illness Index and Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use and Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use and Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy",NA,NA,2019/01/15/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, limited evidence exists to aid clinical decision making regarding which patients will benefit from which second-line treatments. OBJECTIVE: To test the moderating role of pretreatment executive function, severity of anxiety, and severity of medical comorbidity in remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression after aripiprazole augmentation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: As follow-up to a 12-week randomized clinical trial of aripiprazole augmentation for first-line treatment-resistant late-life depression (Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission [IRL-GRey]), we evaluated the effects of the following potential moderators and their interactions with treatment: baseline assessments of executive function (set shifting measured by the Trail Making Test) and response inhibition control (measured by a Color-Word Interference task), anxiety symptoms, and medical comorbidity. Analyses were conducted in May and June 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Aripiprazole or placebo tablets were started at 2 mg daily and titrated as tolerated, to a maximal dose of 15 mg daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression (defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score of <e2><89><a4>10 at both of the last 2 consecutive visits). RESULTS: Of 181 trial participants (103 female [56.9%]) who were 60 years of age or older and whose major depression had failed to remit with venlafaxine hydrochloride monotherapy, 91 received aripiprazole and 90 received placebo. Remission occurred in 40 (43%) who received aripiprazole and 26 (29%) who received placebo. Baseline set shifting moderated the efficacy of aripiprazole augmentation (odds ratio [OR], 1.66 [95% CI, 1.05-2.62]; P = .03 for interaction with treatment). Among participants with a Trail Making Test scaled score of 7 or higher, the odds of remission were significantly higher with aripiprazole than with placebo (53% vs 28%; number needed to treat, 4; OR, 4.11 [95% CI, 1.83-9.20]). Among participants with a Trail Making Test scaled score of less than 7, aripiprazole and placebo were equally efficacious (OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.15-2.80]). Greater severity of anxiety at baseline predicted a lower remission rate but did not moderate aripiprazole efficacy; each standard deviation greater anxiety severity was associated with 50% reduced odds of remission in both aripiprazole and placebo arms. Medical comorbidity and Color-Word Interference test performance were neither general predictors nor treatment-moderating factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Set-shifting performance indicates which older adults with treatment-resistant depression may respond favorably to augmentation with aripiprazole and thus may help to personalize treatment.

METHODS: In the current study, 13,325 (mean age = 17.06, SD = 2.61) pediatric primary care patients from rural, semi-urban, and urban areas of Pennsylvania and 12,001 (mean age = 15.79, SD = 1.40) pediatric patients from an urban children's hospital emergency department were included in the analyses. We used two methods of ML (decision trees, random forests) to (a) generate algorithms to classify suicide attempt history, and (b) validate generated algorithms within and across samples to assess model performance. We also employed ridge regression to evaluate performance of the ML approaches. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that ML approaches did not enhance our ability to classify lifetime or recent suicide attempt history among youth across medical care settings, suggesting that relationships may be mainly linear and non-interactive. In line with prior research, a history of suicide planning, active suicidal ideation, passive suicidal ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury emerged as relatively important correlates of suicide attempt. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional nature of the current study prevents us from determining the extent to which the important variables identified confer risk for future suicidal behavior.

Su_2021_Joofafdi,JOUR,Use of machine learning approach to predict depression in the elderly in China: A longitudinal study,"Su, Dai and Zhang, Xingyu and He, Kevin and Chen, Yingchun",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of potential depression among elderly people is conducive for timely preventive intervention and clinical care to improve quality of life. Therefore, depression prediction considering sequential progression patterns in elderly needs to be further explored. METHODS: We selected 1,538 elderly people from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS) wave 3-7 survey. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and six machine learning (ML) models were used to predict different depression risk factors and the depression risks in the elderly population in the next two years. Receiver operating curve (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the reference model and ML models. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of logistic regression with lasso regularisation (AUC=0.629, p-value=0.020) was the highest among ML models. DCA results showed that the net benefit of six ML models was similar (threshold: 0.00-0.10), the net benefit of lasso regression was the largest (threshold: 0.10-0.17 and 0.22-0.25), and the net benefit of DNN was the largest (threshold: 0.17-0.22 and 0.25-0.40). In two ML models, activities of daily living (ADL)/ instrumental ADL (IADL), self-rated health, marital status, arthritis, and number of cohabiting were the most important predictors for elderly with depression. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective waves used in the LSTM model need to be further increased.

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic-phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%).

This study aimed to use a machine learning approach to assess whether a pre-established cut-off score on the Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI) provided clear differentiation of melancholic/non-melancholic depression, and to identify the items making the most distinct contribution. METHODS: We analysed amalgamated data sets of 1513 clinically depressed patients assessed via the clinician-rated version of the SMPI (SMPI-CR). We also evaluated the self-report version of the SMPI (SMPI-SR) in a combined clinical/community sample of 2025 depressed patients and senior high school students. Rule ensembles were derived in which the outcome measure was the presence/absence of melancholia (defined as scoring at or above a SMPI cut-off score that had been established in previous studies) and the predictive variables were the individual SMPI items. RESULTS: The pre-established SMPI cut-off score was confirmed as differentiating melancholic/non-melancholic with near perfect accuracy for the SMPI-CR, and with very high accuracy for the SMPI-SR. The relative importance of all SMPI items was quantified. LIMITATIONS: It is difficult to validate SMPI-assigned diagnoses due to the lack of any similar measures. CONCLUSIONS: The SMPI-CR was confirmed to be a highly precise instrument for differentiating melancholic and non-melancholic depression. Its use will advance clinical decision making and studies evaluating causes, mechanisms and treatments for the two depressive sub-types, as well as assist clarification as to whether melancholia is categorically or dimensionally distinct from non-melancholic depression.",2021,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.112,282,NA,69-73,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Diagnosis and Machine learning and Humans and Self Report and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and *Depressive Disorder/diagnosis and Categorical versus spectrum models and Depressive disorders and Melancholia and Psychiatric classification",NA,NA,2021/03/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

BrainAGE has been proposed as a biomarker of age-related deterioration of the brain. Having an older brainAGE has been linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, and mortality. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional associations which can confuse age differences with cohort differences. To illuminate the validity of brainAGE as a biomarker of accelerated brain aging, a study is needed of a large cohort all born in the same year who nevertheless vary on brainAGE. In the Dunedin Study, a population-representative 1972-73 birth cohort, we measured brainAGE at age 45 years, as well as the pace of biological aging and cognitive decline in longitudinal data from childhood to midlife (N = 869). In this cohort, all chronological age 45 years, brainAGE was measured reliably (ICC = 0.81) and ranged from 24 to 72 years. Those with older midlife brainAGEs tended to have poorer cognitive function in both adulthood and childhood, as well as impaired brain health at age 3. Furthermore, those with older brainAGEs had an accelerated pace of biological aging, older facial appearance, and early signs of cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. These findings help to validate brainAGE as a potential surrogate biomarker for midlife intervention studies that seek to measure dementia-prevention efforts in midlife. However, the findings also caution against the assumption that brainAGE scores represent only age-related deterioration of the brain as they may also index central nervous system variation present since childhood.",2021,10.1038/s41380-019-0626-7,26,8,3829-3838,eng,1476-5578 1359-4184,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Aging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Brain/diagnostic imaging and *Cognitive Dysfunction and *Birth Cohort",NA,NA,2021/08//undefined,Mol Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a background to the China-India Mental Health Alliance Series, we aim to examine the availability of data and report prevalence for the most common mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in China and India from the Global Burden of Disease study 2013 (GBD 2013). METHODS: In this systematic analysis, data sources were identified from GBD 2013 for the prevalence of mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in China and India published up to Dec 31, 2013. We calculated the proportion of the population represented by the data with the adjusted population coverage (APC) method adjusting for age, sex, and population size. We developed prevalence models with DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression instrument used to pool population-representative epidemiological data as part of GBD 2013. We report estimates and 95% uncertainly intervals (95% UI) for 15 mental, neurological, and substance use disorders for China and India in 1990 and 2013, and benchmark these against those for other BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, and South Africa) in 2013. FINDINGS: Few population-representative data were found for the disorders, with an average coverage of 15% of the population of the Chinese mainland and 1% of the population of India. For men in both China and India, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and alcohol dependence were the most common mental, neurological, and substance use disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether inpatient treatment with ECT is associated with a reduction in 30-day psychiatric readmission risk in a large, multistate sample of inpatients with severe affective disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A quasi-experimental instrumental variables probit model of the association correlation of ECT administration with patient risk of 30-day readmission was estimated using observational, longitudinal data on hospital inpatient discharges from US general hospitals in 9 states. From a population-based sample of 490<e2><80><af>252 psychiatric inpatients, a sample was drawn that consisted of 162<e2><80><af>691 individuals with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. The key instrumental variable used in the analysis was ECT prevalence in the prior calendar year at the treating hospital. To examine whether ECT's association with readmissions was heterogeneous across population subgroups, analyses included interactions of ECT with age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis group. The study was conducted from August 27, 2015, to March 7, 2017. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Readmission within 30 days of being discharged. RESULTS: Overall, 2486 of the 162<e2><80><af>691 inpatients (1.5%) underwent ECT during their index admission. Compared with other inpatients, those who received ECT were older (mean [SD], 56.8 [16.5] vs 45.9 [16.5] years; P < .001) and more likely to be female (65.0% vs 54.2%; P < .001) and white non-Hispanic (85.3% vs 62.1%; P < .001), have MDD diagnoses (63.8% vs 32.0%; P < .001) rather than bipolar disorder (29.0% vs 40.0%; P < .001) or schizoaffective disorder (7.1% vs 28.0%; P < .001), have a comorbid medical condition (31.3% vs 26.6%; P < .001), have private (39.4% vs 21.7%; P < .001) or Medicare (49.2% vs 39.4%; P < .001) insurance coverage, and be located in urban small hospitals (31.2% vs 22.3%; P < .001) or nonurban hospitals (9.0% vs 7.6%; P = .02). Administration of ECT was associated with a reduced 30-day readmission risk among psychiatric inpatients with severe affective disorders from an estimated 12.3% among individuals not administered ECT to 6.6% among individuals administered ECT (risk ratio [RR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81). Significantly larger associations with ECT on readmission risk were found for men compared with women (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.69 vs 0.58; 95% CI, 0.30-0.88) and for individuals with bipolar disorder (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.17-0.69) and schizoaffective disorder (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.11-0.79) compared with those who had MDD (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.26-0.81).

Elizabeth and Cisneros-Trujillo, Sebastian and Burke, Ainsley K. and Parsey, Ramin V. and Mann, J. John",JAMA psychiatry,"IMPORTANCE: Biomarkers that predict suicidal behavior, especially highly lethal behavior, are urgently needed. In cross-sectional studies, individuals with depression who attempt suicide have lower midbrain serotonin transporter binding potential compared with those who do not attempt suicide, and higher serotonin1A binding potential in the raphe nuclei (RN) is associated with greater lethality of past suicide attempts and suicidal intent and ideation. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether serotonin transporter binding potential in the lower midbrain predicts future suicide attempts and whether higher RN serotonin1A binding potential predicts future suicidal ideation and intent and lethality of future suicide attempts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective 2-year observational study, a well-characterized cohort of 100 patients presenting for treatment of a major depressive episode of at least moderate severity underwent positron emission tomography using carbon 11-labeled N-(2-(1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl))-N-(2-pyridyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide ([11C]WAY-100635), a serotonin1A antagonist; a subset of 50 patients also underwent imaging with carbon 11-labeled 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)- benzonitrile ([11C]DASB), a serotonin transporter radioligand. Imaging was performed at Columbia University Medical Center from May 3, 1999, to March 11, 2008. Follow-up was completed on May 28, 2010, and data were analyzed from August 1, 2013, to March 1, 2016. EXPOSURES: Patients were treated naturalistically in the community and followed up for 2 years with documentation of suicidal behavior, its lethality, and suicidal ideation and intent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Suicide attempt or suicide. RESULTS: Of the 100 patients undergoing follow-up for more than 2 years (39 men; 61 women; mean [SD] age, 40.2 [11.2] years), 15 made suicide attempts, including 2 who died by suicide. Higher RN serotonin1A binding potential predicted more suicidal ideation at 3 (b = 0.02; t = 3.45; P = .001) and 12 (b = 0.02; t = 3.63; P = .001) months and greater lethality of subsequent suicidal behavior (b = 0.08; t = 2.89; P = .01). Exploratory analyses suggest that the serotonin1A binding potential of the insula (t = 2.41; P = .04), anterior cingulate (t = 2.27; P = .04), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 2.44; P = .03) were also predictive of lethality. Contrary to our hypotheses, suicidal intent was not predicted by serotonin1A binding potential in any brain region (F1,10 = 0.83; P = .38), and midbrain serotonin transporter binding potential did not predict future attempts (log-rank <cf><87>21 = 0.4; P = .54), possibly owing to low power. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Greater RN serotonin1A binding potential predicted higher suicidal ideation and more lethal suicidal behavior during a 2-year period. This effect may be mediated through less serotonin neuron firing and release, which affects mood and suicidal ideation and thereby decision making.",2016,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.1478,73,10,1048-1055,eng,2168-6238 2168-622X,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Prospective Studies and Follow-Up Studies and Pyridines and Piperazines and Benzylamines and *Suicidal Ideation and Brain Mapping and *Positron-Emission Tomography and Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology and Carbon Radioisotopes and Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/*physiopathology and Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/*physiology and Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*physiology and Suicide, Attempted/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data and Suicide/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2016/10/01/,JAMA Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sequeira_2020_Joofafdi,JOUR,Mobile and wearable technology for monitoring depressive symptoms in children and adolescents: A scoping review,"Sequeira, Lydia and Perrotta, Steve and LaGrassa, Jennifer and Merikangas, Kathleen and Kreindler, David and Kundur, Deepa and Courtney, Darren and Szatmari, Peter and Battaglia, Marco and Strauss, John",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: There has been rapid growth of mobile and wearable tools that may help to overcome challenges in the diagnosis and prediction of Major Depressive Disorder in children and adolescents, tasks that rely on clinical reporting that is inherently based on retrospective recall of symptoms and associated features. This article reviews more objective ways of measuring and monitoring mood within this population. METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed studies examined published research that employs mobile and wearable tools to characterize depression in children and/or adolescents. Our search strategy included the following terms: (1) monitoring or prediction (2) depression (3) mobile apps or wearables and (4) children and youth (including adolescents), and was applied to five databases. RESULTS: Our search produced 829 citations (2008- Feb 2019), of which 30 (journal articles, conference papers and abstracts) were included in the analysis, and 2 reviews included in our discussion. The majority of the evidence involved smartphone apps, with very few studies using actigraphy. Mobile and wearables captured a variety of data including unobtrusive passive analytics, movement and light data, plus physical and mental health data, including depressive symptom monitoring. Most studies also examined feasibility. LIMITATIONS: This review was limited to published research in the English language. The review criteria excluded any apps that were mainly treatment focused, therefore there was not much of a focus on clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review yielded a variety of studies with heterogeneous populations, research methods and study objectives, which limited our ability to address our research objectives cohesively. Certain mobile technologies, however, have demonstrated feasibility for tracking depression that could inform models for predicting relapse.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.156,265,NA,314-324,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Depression and Humans and Adolescent and Child and Retrospective Studies and *Mobile Applications and *Wearable Electronic Devices and *Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis and Digital phenotyping and Mobile phone and Wearable device",NA,NA,2020/03/15/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Day_2015_Joofafdi,JOUR,Cognitive and emotional biomarkers of melancholic depression: An iSPOT-D report,"Day, Claire V. and Gatt, Justine M. and Etkin, Amit and DeBattista, Charles and Schatzberg, Alan F. and Williams, Leanne M.",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Depressed patients with melancholic features have distinct impairments in cognition and anhedonia, but it remains unknown whether these impairments can be quantified on neurocognitive biomarker tests of behavioral performance. We compared melancholic major depressive disorder (MDD) patients to non-melancholic MDD patients and controls on a neurocognitive test battery that assesses eight general and emotional cognitive domains including the hypothesized decision-making and reward-threat perception. METHODS: MDD outpatients (n=1008) were assessed using a computerized battery of tests. MDD participants met DSM-IV criteria for MDD and had a score <e2><89><a5>16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Melancholic MDD was defined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a psychomotor disturbance observer-rated CORE measure score >7. Controls were age- and gender-matched with no previous DSM-IV or significant medical history. RESULTS: Melancholic participants (33.7% of the MDD sample) exhibited significantly poorer performance than controls across each domain of cognitive function and for speed of emotion identification and implicit emotion priming. Compared to the non-melancholic group, specific disturbances were seen on tests of information speed, decision speed, and reward-relevant emotional processing of happy expressions, even after co-varying for symptom severity. LIMITATIONS: Assessments were taken at only one medication-free time point. Reward was investigated using an emotional faces task. CONCLUSIONS: Melancholic MDD is distinguished by a specific neurocognitive marker profile consistent with reduced decision-making capacity under time demands and loss of reward sensitivity. This profile suggests an underlying deficit in mesolimbic-cortical circuitry for motivationally-directed behavior.",2015,10.1016/j.jad.2015.01.061,176,NA,141-150,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Cognition and Case-Control Studies and Emotion and Neuropsychological Tests and *Cognition and Reward and *Emotions and Biomarker and Major depressive disorder and Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis/*psychology and Endophenotypes and Melancholic features",NA,NA,2015/05/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hart_2020_Joofafdi,JOUR,What do patients learn about psychotropic medications on the web? A natural language processing study,"Hart, Kamber L. and Perlis, Roy H. and McCoy, Thomas H. Jr",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Low rates of medication adherence remain a major challenge across psychiatry. In part, this likely reflects patient concerns about safety and adverse effects, accurate or otherwise. We therefore sought to characterize online information about common psychiatric medications in terms of positive and negative sentiment. METHODS: We applied a natural language processing tool to score the sentiment expressed in web search results for 51 psychotropic medications across 3 drug classes (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers), as a means of seeing if articles referencing these medications were generally positive or generally negative in tone. We compared between medications of the same class, and across medication classes. RESULTS: Across 12,733 web search results, significant within-class differences in positive (antidepressants: F(24,2682)<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>2.97, p < 0.001; antipsychotics: F(16,4029) = 3.25, p < 0.001; mood stabilizers: F(8,2371)<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>6.88, p < 0.001) and negative sentiment (antidepressants: F(24,6282)<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>11.17, p < 0.001; antipsychotics: F(16, 4029) <e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>12.13, p < 0.001; mood stabilizers: F(8, 2371)<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>13.28, p < 0.001) were identified. Among these were significantly greater negative sentiment for the antidepressants sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and paroxetine, and for the antipsychotics, quetiapine and risperidone. Conversely, lithium preparations and valproate exhibited less negative sentiment than other mood stabilizing medications. LIMITATIONS: While these results provide a novel means of comparing medications, the present analyses cannot be linked to individual patient consumption of this information, or to its influence on their future clinical interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a subset of psychotropic medications were associated with significantly more negative sentiment. Characterizing these differences may allow clinicians to anticipate patient willingness to initiate or continue medications.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2019.09.043,260,NA,366-371,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Internet and Sentiment analysis and Natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and Internet/*statistics & numerical data and Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use and Medication adherence and Consumer Health Information/*statistics & numerical data and Consumer health information and Medication Adherence/psychology and Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use and Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use and Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use and Psychiatry/trends and Psychotropic drugs,NA,NA,2020/01/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Furukawa_2020_Joofafdi,JOUR,"Can personalized treatment prediction improve the outcomes, compared with the group average approach, in a randomized trial? Developing and validating a multivariable prediction model in a pragmatic megatrial of acute treatment for major depression","Furukawa, Toshi A. and Debray, Thomas P. A. and Akechi, Tatsuo and Yamada, Mitsuhiko and Kato, Tadashi and Seo, Michael and Efthimiou, Orestis",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have traditionally been analysed at the aggregate level, assuming that the group average would be applicable to all eligible and similar patients. We re-analyzed a mega-trial of antidepressant therapy for major depression to explore whether a multivariable prediction model may lead to different treatment recommendations for individual participants. METHODS: The trial compared the second-line treatment strategies of continuing sertraline, combining it with mirtazapine or switching to mirtazapine after initial failure to remit on sertraline among 1,544 patients with major depression. The outcome was the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at week 9: the original analyses showed that both combining and switching resulted in greater reduction in PHQ-9 by 1.0 point than continuing. We considered several models of penalized regression or machine learning. RESULTS: Models using support vector machines (SVMs) provided the best performance. Using SVMs, continuing sertraline was predicted to be the best treatment for 123 patients, combining for 696 patients, and switching for 725 patients. In the last two subgroups, both combining and switching were equally superior to continuing by 1.2 to 1.4 points, resulting in the same treatment recommendations as with the original aggregate data level analyses; in the first subgroup, however, switching was substantively inferior to combining (-3.1, 95%CI: -5.4 to -0.5). LIMITATIONS: Stronger predictors are needed to make more precise predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The multivariable prediction models led to improved recommendations for a minority of participants than the group average approach in a megatrial.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.141,274,NA,690-697,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"Depression and Precision medicine and Humans and Depressive disorder and Treatment Outcome and Prediction model and Precision Medicine and Antidepressive agents and Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use and *Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy and Sertraline/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2020/09/01/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

Symptoms of depression are expressed and experienced differently across cultural groups, impacting treatment decisions. Patient preferences predict service utilization, treatment selection and persistence, as well as health outcomes for medical and behavioral health conditions, including depression. We identified depression management preferences of Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) people who receive care within a comprehensive, integrated, tribally owned and operated healthcare facility in Anchorage, Alaska. METHODS: Adult AN/AI patients who screened positive for depression (10 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9)) completed a culturally-tailored decision-support tool to assess their depression management interests. RESULTS: The 125 eligible patients, who screened positive for depression, preferred counseling and medications to peer support groups, herbal remedies, and spiritual support. Those 18-39 years of age were more likely to prefer medications and less likely to prefer spirituality and peer support than those 40 years of age and older. Patients with moderate and severe depression were more likely to prefer exercise, healthy eating, and stress reduction than individuals with mild depression. LIMITATIONS: Women comprised 78% of the sample. Responses may not adequately represent the views of men. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling and medications should consistently be made available earlier in the course of depression management. Patient interest in exercise, stress reduction, and healthy eating to manage depression, especially among those with moderate and severe depression, offers opportunity for additional collaboration in an integrated care setting.",2018,10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.075,239,NA,214-219,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Exercise and Life Style and Age Factors and *Primary Health Care and Diet, Healthy and *Spirituality and Depressive Disorder/*therapy and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*ethnology and Medical decision-making and Patient Health Questionnaire and *Alaskan Natives and Attitude to Health/*ethnology and *Indians, North American and American Indian/Alaska Native people and Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Depression management and Integrated care and Relaxation Therapy and Traditional healing and Treatment preferences",NA,NA,2018/10/15/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wingo_2020_Joofafdi,JOUR,Purpose in life is a robust protective factor of reported cognitive decline among late middle-aged adults: The Emory Healthy Aging Study,"Wingo, Aliza P. and Wingo, Thomas S. and Fan, Wen and Bergquist, Sharon and Alonso, Alvaro and Marcus, Michele and Levey, Allan I. and Lah, James J.",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive abilities tend to decline in advanced age. A novel protective factor of cognitive decline in advanced age is purpose-in-life (PiL), a trait-like tendency to derive life meanings and purpose. However, whether PiL protects against cognitive decline in late-middle-age is unclear. Hence, we examined the association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline, one of the earliest detectable cognitive symptoms before the onset of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we used a machine learning approach to investigate whether PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered with the known protective and risk factors for cognition. METHODS: PiL was assessed with a 10-item questionnaire and perceived cognitive decline with the Cognitive Function Instrument among 5,441 Emory Healthy Aging Study participants, whose mean age was 63 and 51% were employed. Association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline was examined with linear regression adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Elastic Net was performed to identify the most robust predictors of cognitive decline. RESULTS: Greater PiL was associated with less perceived cognitive decline after adjusting for the relevant factors. Furthermore, Elastic Net modeling suggested that PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered simultaneously with known protective (education, exercise, enrichment activities) and risk factors for cognition (depression, anxiety, diagnosed medical, mental health problems, smoking, alcohol use, family history of dementia, and others). LIMITATION: This is a cross-sectional study. CONCLUSIONS: PiL is a robust protective factor of perceived cognitive decline observed as early as middle age. Thus, interventions to enhance PiL merit further investigation.",2020,10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.124,263,NA,310-317,eng,1573-2517 0165-0327,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Cognition and *Healthy Aging and *Cognitive Dysfunction and Protective Factors,NA,NA,2020/02/15/,J Affect Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lyu_2019_Joofafdi,JOUR,BP neural network prediction model for suicide attempt among Chinese rural residents,"Lyu, Juncheng and Zhang, Jie",Journal of affective disorders,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish and assess the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model for suicide attempt, so as to improve the individual prediction accuracy. METHOD: Data was collected from a wide range case-control suicide attempt survey. 659 serious suicide attempters (case group) were randomly recruited through the hospital emergency and patient registration system from 13 rural counties in China. Each case was matched the control by same community, gender, and similar age (<c2><b1><e2><80><af>2 ages). Face to face interviews were conducted for each subject with structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was applied to preliminarily screen the factors and BPNN was used to establish the prediction model of suicide attempt. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression indicated that family history of suicide (OR<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>4.146), mental problem (OR<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>3.876) Low education level, poor health, aspiration strain, hopelessness, impulsivity, depression are the risk predictors and social support, coping skills, healthy community are the protect predictors for suicide attempt. Repetitious data simulation process of BPNN indicated that three-layer BPNN with 9 hidden layer neurons is the optimal prediction model. The sensitivity (67.6%), specificity (93.9%), positive predictive value (86.0%), negative predictive value (84.1%), total coincidence rate (84.6%) manifested that it is excellent to distinguish suicide attempt case. CONCLUSIONS: The BPNN method is applicative, feasible, credible and good discriminative effect for suicide attempt.

Yang_2019_Joofafdi,JOUR,The mediating roles of caregiver social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease,"Yang, Zongfang and Tian, Yuling and Fan, Ying and Liu, Long and Luo, Yanhong and Zhou, Liye and Yu, Hongmei",Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Most studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have focused on the direct effects of social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden. This study aimed to test our prediction that caregiver self-efficacy and social support were two chaining mediator variables on the paths for patient factors affecting caregiver burden, caregiver anxiety, and depression. METHOD: We enrolled patients with PD and their caregivers from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University in China between July and December 2017. Patients completed scales evaluating their cognition, motor function, and depression. Caregivers completed scales evaluating social support, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and caregiver burden. We applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the mediating effects. RESULTS: Caregiver self-efficacy was a partial mediator on the path of patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (Variance Accounted For, VAF = 0.741), caregiver anxiety (VAF = 0.498) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.471). Social support for caregivers was a partial mediator on the path for patient motor function effects on caregiver self-efficacy (VAF = 0.247). Caregiver social support and self-efficacy were two chaining mediator variables on the pathway for patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (VAF = 0.768) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.510). LIMITATIONS: Our sample only met the minimum sample size requirement for the PLS-SEM and we only focused on a part of variables we collected. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction has been validated in this study.

METHODS: Certified psychiatrists of the Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology were asked to evaluate treatment options regarding 23 clinical situations in the treatment of depression using a 9-point Likert scale (1=""disagree"" and 9=""agree""). According to the responses of 114 experts, the options were categorized into first-, second-, and third-line treatments. RESULTS: First-line antidepressants varied depending on predominant symptoms: escitalopram (mean <c2><b1> standard deviation score, 7.8 <c2><b1> 1.7) and sertraline (7.3 <c2><b1> 1.7) were likely selected for anxiety; duloxetine (7.6 <c2><b1> 1.9) and venlafaxine (7.2 <c2><b1> 2.1) for loss of interest; mirtazapine for insomnia (8.2 <c2><b1> 1.6), loss of appetite (7.9 <c2><b1> 1.9), agitation and severe irritation (7.4 <c2><b1> 2.0), and suicidal ideation (7.5 <c2><b1> 1.9). While first-line treatment was switched to either an SNRI (7.7 <c2><b1> 1.9) or mirtazapine (7.4 <c2><b1> 2.0) in the case of non-response to an SSRI, switching to mirtazapine (7.1 <c2><b1> 2.2) was recommended in the case of non-response to an SNRI, and vice versa (switching to an SNRI (7.0 <c2><b1> 2.0) in the case of non-response to mirtazapine). Augmentation with aripiprazole was considered the first-line treatment for partial response to an SSRI (7.1 <c2><b1> 2.3) or SNRI (7.0 <c2><b1> 2.5).
