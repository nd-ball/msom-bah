It is a conceptual shift from ineffective treatments for biologically heterogeneous ""population averages"" to individually-tailored biomarker-guided targeted therapies. PM is defining which therapeutic approach will be the most effective for a specific individual, at a determined disease stage, across multiple medical research fields, including neuroscience, neurology and psychiatry.

This workshop brought together transdisciplinary leaders in the fields of function and disability and clinical investigators engaged in research on geriatric populations to outline opportunities and challenges for incorporating measures of function in clinical research. Topics addressed included reliable and clinically feasible measures of function and key domains of health (eg, musculoskeletal, cognitive, and sensory) that are most strongly associated with patients' perceptions of well-being, independence, and quality of life across a wide array of diseases and interventions. The workshop also focused on the importance of function in medical decision making to inform communications between specialty physicians and patients about prognosis and goals of care. Workshop participants called for more research on the role of function as a predictor of an intervention's effectiveness and an important treatment outcome. Such research would be facilitated by development of a core set of simple, short, functional measures that can be used by all specialties in the clinical setting to allow ""big data"" analytics and a pragmatic research.

We developed a novel CDSS, the PredictND tool, designed for differential diagnosis of different types of dementia. It combines information obtained from multiple diagnostic tests such as neuropsychological tests, MRI and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Here we evaluated how the classifier used in it performs in differentiating between controls with subjective cognitive decline, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies. We used the multiclass Disease State Index classifier, which is the classifier used by the PredictND tool, to differentiate between controls and patients with the four different types of dementia. The multiclass Disease State Index classifier is an extension of a previously developed two-class Disease State Index classifier. As the two-class Disease State Index classifier, the multiclass Disease State Index classifier also offers a visualization of its decision making process, which makes it especially suitable for medical decision support where interpretability of the results is highly important. A subset of the Amsterdam Dementia cohort, consisting of 504 patients (age 65 <c2><b1> 8 years, 44% females) with data from neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid samples and both automatic and visual MRI quantifications, was used for the evaluation. The Disease State Index classifier was highly accurate in separating the five classes from each other (balanced accuracy 82.3%). Accuracy was highest for vascular dementia and lowest for dementia with Lewy bodies. For the 50% of patients for which the classifier was most confident on the classification the balanced accuracy was 93.6%.

OBJECTIVES: To propose a system for continuous and objective remote monitoring of problematic daily living activity areas and design personalized interventions based on system feedback and clinical observations for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life. METHODS: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable, sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs. RESULTS: Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical condition and in the domains of sleep.

OBJECTIVE: We used a combined methodology of machine learning and semi-parametric survival analysis to estimate the relative importance of 52 predictors in forecasting cognitive impairment and dementia in a large, population-representative sample of older adults. METHODS: Participants from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 9,979; aged 50-98 years) were followed for up to 10 years (M = 6.85 for cognitive impairment; M = 7.67 for dementia). Using a split-sample methodology, we first estimated the relative importance of predictors using machine learning (random forest survival analysis), and we then used semi-parametric survival analysis (Cox proportional hazards) to estimate effect sizes for the most important variables. RESULTS: African Americans and individuals who scored high on emotional distress were at relatively highest risk for developing cognitive impairment and dementia. Sociodemographic (lower education, Hispanic ethnicity) and health variables (worse subjective health, increasing BMI) were comparatively strong predictors for cognitive impairment. Cardiovascular factors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity) and polygenic scores (with and without APOEe4) appeared less important than expected. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses underscored the robustness of these results.

In conditions in which cognitive functioning becomes compromised, such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), decision-making capacity can also get affected. Especially in AD, this has important implications, since over the course of the condition many important clinical decisions have to be made. For caregivers as well as physicians, it is sometimes difficult to determine how and when to intervene in the decision-making process. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify studies that have evaluated medical and research consent decision-making capacity in patients with AD. Studies consistently show that decision-making capabilities are impaired in patients with AD. The cognitive and neuronal correlates of this process are, however, poorly studied. The few studies that investigated correlations have shown worse cognitive performance, mainly on the MMSE, to be related to poorer decision-making capacity. As most of these correlations have been performed in groups combining patients and controls, it remains unknown if these associations are disease specific.

Characterization of a patient's cognitive profile is an essential step toward the identification of predictors of cognitive worsening. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of the combination of resting-state EEG and data-mining techniques to build characterization models. METHODS: Dense EEG data from 118 patients with Parkinson's disease, classified into 5 different groups according to the severity of their cognitive impairments, were considered. Spectral power analysis within 7 frequency bands was performed on the EEG signals. The obtained quantitative EEG features of 100 patients were mined using 2 machine-learning algorithms to build and train characterization models, namely, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors models. The models were then blindly tested on data from 18 patients. RESULTS: The overall classification accuracies were 84% and 88% for the support vector machines and k-nearest algorithms, respectively. The worst classifications were observed for patients from groups with small sample sizes, corresponding to patients with the severe cognitive deficits. Whereas for the remaining groups for whom an accurate diagnosis was required to plan the future healthcare, the classification was very accurate. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EEG features computed from a daily clinical practice exploration modality in-that it is nonexpensive, available anywhere, and requires minimal cooperation from the patient-can be used as a screening method to identify the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to validate predictive models to separately identify psychotic and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with dementia using clinical databases representing the whole population to inform decision-makers. METHODS: First, we searched the electronic health records of 4,003 patients with dementia to identify NPS. Second, machine learning (random forest) algorithms were applied to build separate predictive models for psychotic and depressive symptom clusters in the training set (N = 3,003). Third, calibration and discrimination were assessed in the test set (N = 1,000) to assess the performance of the models. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted in the electronic health record of 58% of patients. The area under the receiver operating curve reached 0.80 for the psychotic cluster model and 0.74 for the depressive cluster model. The Kappa index and accuracy also showed better discrimination in the psychotic model. Calibration plots indicated that both types of model had less predictive accuracy when the probability of neuropsychiatric symptoms was <25%. The most important variables in the psychotic cluster model were use of risperidone, level of sedation, use of quetiapine and haloperidol and the number of antipsychotics prescribed. In the depressive cluster model, the most important variables were number of antidepressants prescribed, escitalopram use, level of sedation, and age. CONCLUSION: Given their relatively good performance, the predictive models can be used to estimate prevalence of NPS in population databases.",2020,10.3233/JAD-200345,77,2,855-864,eng,1875-8908 1387-2877,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Dementia and Forecasting and Reproducibility of Results and Aged, 80 and over and Electronic Health Records/*standards and Machine Learning/*standards and *Data Analysis and real-world data and Databases, Factual/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Dementia/diagnosis/epidemiology and depressive symptoms and Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology and neuropsychiatric symptoms and predictive model\sep prevalence and psychotic symptoms",NA,NA,2020///,J Alzheimers Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite significant advances in technology, progress toward identifying reliable risk factors for suboptimal brain health requires realistically complex analytic methods to explain relationships between genetics, biology, and environment. Here we show the utility of a novel unsupervised machine learning technique - Correlation Explanation (CorEx) - to discover how individual measures from structural brain imaging, genetics, plasma, and CSF markers can jointly provide information on risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined 829 participants (M (age): 75.3 <c2><b1> 6.9 years; 350 women and 479 men) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database to identify multivariate predictors of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over a 1-year period. Our sample included 231 cognitively normal individuals, 397 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 201 with AD as their baseline diagnosis. Analyses revealed latent factors based on data-driven combinations of plasma markers and brain metrics, that were aligned with established biological pathways in AD. These factors were able to improve disease prediction along the trajectory from normal cognition and MCI to AD, with an area under the receiver operating curve of up to 99%, and prediction accuracy of up to 89.9% on independent ""held out"" testing data. Further, the most important latent factors that predicted AD consisted of a novel set of variables that are essential for cardiovascular, immune, and bioenergetic functions.

A potentially beneficial treatment strategy is suggestion, the voluntary use by the physicians of techniques that introduce into the patient's mind a belief that he or she will be healed. Principalism, the dominant school of contemporary medical ethics, holds that the use of suggestion is not ethically justifiable because it undermines patient autonomy and degrades the doctor-patient relationship. However, evidence from a variety of sources (neuroimaging, anecdote, expert opinion, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis) supports the efficacy of suggestion as a treatment for psychogenic movement disorders. When issues of choice, consent, deceit, disclosure, and decision-making are analyzed from the perspective of an ethics of care, we see that suggestion may enhance patient autonomy and does not violate the trust between doctors and their patients.

We developed and validated a predictive model of the 6-month risk of serious falls among middle-aged Veterans. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration (VA). PARTICIPANTS: Veterans, aged 45 to 65 years, who presented for care within the VA between 2012 and 2015 (N = 275,940). EXPOSURES: The exposures of primary interest were substance use (including alcohol and prescription opioid use), multimorbidity, and polypharmacy. Hazardous alcohol use was defined as an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C) score of 3 or greater for women and 4 or greater for men. We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes to identify alcohol and illicit substance use disorders and identified prescription opioid use from pharmacy fill-refill data. We included counts of chronic medications and of physical and mental health comorbidities. MEASUREMENTS: We identified serious falls using external cause of injury codes and a machine-learning algorithm that identified serious falls in radiology reports. We used multivariable logistic regression with general estimating equations to calculate risk. We used an integrated predictiveness curve to identify intervention thresholds. RESULTS: Most of our sample (54%) was aged 60 years or younger. Duration of follow-up was up to 4 years. Veterans who fell were more likely to be female (11% vs 7%) and White (72% vs 68%).

Such individuals constitute 16% of patients in intensive care units, 3% of nursing home residents, and a large but unspecified number of individuals in a variety of settings who are facing end-of-life decisions. Several approaches are currently used to aid in medical decision-making for people without families or designated surrogates, including hospital ethics committees, court-appointed surrogate agents, reliance on advance directives if they are available, and even the use of computer-based decision systems. These approaches all have limitations and often result in individuals receiving care that would not have been their preference. Additionally, because clinical care teams must wrestle with uncertainty about best approaches to care, lengths of hospital stay for individuals without family are longer, resulting in higher healthcare costs and potentially more-aggressive interventions than individuals with family experience.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cognitive training on number processing and/or executive functions improves performance on ratio processing and decision making under risk. METHODS: In a controlled cross-over study, patients with MCI (n = 23; mean MMSE 26.48, SD 2.43) underwent a week of numerical training followed by a week of executive-functions training (subgroup A), or vice versa (subgroup B). Before training (T1), patients performed experimental tasks of decision making (Game of Dice Task, GDT; Probability-Associated Gambling task, PAG-60 task) and of ratio processing as well as a neuropsychological background assessment. Experimental tasks were also administered after the first (T2) and the second (T3) training week. RESULTS: The numerical training and the training of executive functions had a differential effect on experimental tasks of ratio processing. Only the numerical training proved to be effective. The effects of the two training types on decision making under risk were less clear-cut. While no changes over time were observed in the GDT, performance on the PAG-60 task improved in both training subgroups. These improvements were apparent in one subgroup after a period of executive-functions training, in the other subgroup after both training weeks. That means, improvements are not attributable to one specific training type. CONCLUSION: Patients with MCI can profit from a cognitive training on number processing and executive functions. Improvements are reflected in higher ratio processing abilities and more advantageous decisions after training.

As the baby boom generation ages and brain diseases become more prevalent, the need to confront the pending health care crisis is more urgent than ever before. Indeed, there is now a critical need to expand significantly the national effort to solve the problem of AD, with special focus on prevention. The Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 (PAD2020) aims to create a new paradigm for planning and supporting the organization of worldwide cooperative research networks to develop new technologies for early detection and treatments of aging-related memory and motor impairments. PAD 2020 is developing an implementation plan to justify (1) increasing the federal budget for research, (2) developing novel national resources to discover new interventions for memory and motor disorders, and (3) creating innovative and streamlined decision-making processes for selecting and supporting new ideas. Since 1978 the National Institute on Aging or National Institute of Health (NIH) established an extensive national network of AD research facilities at academic institutions including AD Centers (ADCs), Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD, AD Cooperative Study (ADCS), AD Drug Discovery Program, National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, National Cell Repository for AD, and AD Neuroimaging Initiative. However, despite the success of these programs and their critical contributions, they are no longer adequate to meet the challenges presented by AD. PAD 2020 is designed to address these changes by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs. For example, the ADCs (P30s and P50s) can be enhanced by converting some into Comprehensive Alzheimer's Disease Centers (CADCs) to support not only research, but also by being demonstration projects on care/treatment, clinical trials, and education as well as by seamlessly integrating multisite collaborative studies (ADCS, AD Neuroimaging Initiative, Patient Registries, Clinical Data Banks, etc) into a cohesive structure that further enhances the original mission of the National Institute on Aging ADCs. Regional CADCs offer greater efficiency and cost savings while serving as coordinating hubs of existing ADCs, thereby offering greater economies of scale and programmatic integration. The CADCs also broaden the scope of ADC activities to include research on interventions, diagnosis, imaging, prevention trials, and other longitudinal studies that require long-term support. Thus, CADCs can address the urgent need to identify subjects at high risk of AD for prevention trials and very early in the course of AD for clinical trials of disease modification. The enhanced CADCs will allow more flexibility among ADCs by supporting collaborative linkages with other institutions and drawing on a wider expertise from different locations. This perspective article describes the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) CADC Model as an illustrative example of how an existing ADC can be converted into a CADC by better utilization of Penn academic resources to address the wide range of problems concerning AD.

Lancaster_2018_Frinagne,JOUR,Bayesian Optimization for Neuroimaging Pre-processing in Brain Age Classification and Prediction,"Lancaster, Jenessa and Lorenz, Romy and Leech, Rob and Cole, James H.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,"Neuroimaging-based age prediction using machine learning is proposed as a biomarker of brain aging, relating to cognitive performance, health outcomes and progression of neurodegenerative disease. However, even leading age-prediction algorithms contain measurement error, motivating efforts to improve experimental pipelines. T1-weighted MRI is commonly used for age prediction, and the pre-processing of these scans involves normalization to a common template and resampling to a common voxel size, followed by spatial smoothing. Resampling parameters are often selected arbitrarily. Here, we sought to improve brain-age prediction accuracy by optimizing resampling parameters using Bayesian optimization. Using data on N = 2003 healthy individuals (aged 16-90 years) we trained support vector machines to (i) distinguish between young (<22 years) and old (>50 years) brains (classification) and (ii) predict chronological age (regression). We also evaluated generalisability of the age-regression model to an independent dataset (CamCAN, N = 648, aged 18-88 years). Bayesian optimization was used to identify optimal voxel size and smoothing kernel size for each task. This procedure adaptively samples the parameter space to evaluate accuracy across a range of possible parameters, using independent sub-samples to iteratively assess different parameter combinations to arrive at optimal values. When distinguishing between young and old brains a classification accuracy of 88.1% was achieved, (optimal voxel size = 11.5 mm(3), smoothing kernel = 2.3 mm). For predicting chronological age, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.08 years was achieved, (optimal voxel size = 3.73 mm(3), smoothing kernel = 3.68 mm). This was compared to performance using default values of 1.5 mm(3) and 4mm respectively, resulting in MAE = 5.48 years, though this 7.3% improvement was not statistically significant. When assessing generalisability, best performance was achieved when applying the entire Bayesian optimization framework to the new dataset, out-performing the parameters optimized for the initial training dataset. Our study outlines the proof-of-principle that neuroimaging models for brain-age prediction can use Bayesian optimization to derive case-specific pre-processing parameters. Our results suggest that different pre-processing parameters are selected when optimization is conducted in specific contexts. This potentially motivates use of optimization techniques at many different points during the experimental process, which may improve statistical sensitivity and reduce opportunities for experimenter-led bias.",2018,10.3389/fnagi.2018.00028,10,NA,28,eng,1663-4365,machine learning and Bayesian optimization and brain aging and pre-processing and T1-MRI,NA,NA,2018///,Front Aging Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-two Boston-area NHs. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-three NH residents with advanced dementia and their HCPs. MEASUREMENTS: Decisions made by HCPs over 18 months were ascertained quarterly. After making a decision, HCPs completed the Decision Satisfaction Inventory (DSI) (range 0-100). Independent variables included HCP and resident sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and advance care planning. Multivariable linear regression identified factors associated with higher DSI scores (greater satisfaction). RESULTS: Of 323 HCPs, 123 (38.1%) recalled making at least one medical decision; 232 decisions were made, concerning feeding problems (27.2%), infections (20.7%), pain (12.9%), dyspnea (8.2%), behavior problems (6.9%), hospitalizations (3.9%), cancer (3.0%), and other complications (17.2%). Mean DSI score +/- standard deviation was 78.4 +/- 19.5, indicating high overall satisfaction. NH provider involvement in shared decision-making was the area of least satisfaction. In adjusted analysis, greater decision-making satisfaction was associated with the resident living on a special care dementia unit (P=.002), greater resident comfort (P=.004), and the HCP not being the resident's child (P=.02). CONCLUSION: HCPs of NH patients with advanced dementia can most commonly expect to encounter medical decisions relating to feeding problems, infections, and pain. Inadequate support from NH providers is the greatest source of HCP dissatisfaction with decision-making. Greater resident comfort and care in a special care dementia unit are potentially modifiable factors associated with greater decision-making satisfaction.",2009,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2009.02304.x,57,7,1149-1155,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Boston and Prospective Studies and Linear Models and *Decision Making and *Personal Satisfaction and Proxy/*psychology and *Nursing Homes and *Dementia,NA,NA,2009/07//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite advances in mobile health technologies, the implementation of digital outcome measures is hindered by a lack of consensus on the type and scope of measures, the most appropriate approach for data capture (eg, in clinic or at home), and the extraction of timely information that meets the needs of patients, clinicians, caregivers, and health care regulators. The Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Technology proposes the following objectives to facilitate the adoption of mobile health technologies: (1) identification of patient-centered and clinically relevant digital outcomes; (2) selection criteria for device combinations that offer an acceptable benefit-to-burden ratio to patients and that deliver reliable, clinically relevant insights; (3) development of an accessible, scalable, and secure platform for data integration and data analytics; and (4) agreement on a pathway for approval by regulators, adoption into e-health systems and implementation by health care organizations. We have developed a tentative roadmap that addresses these needs by providing the following deliverables: (1) results and interpretation of an online survey to define patient-relevant endpoints, (2) agreement on the selection criteria for use of device combinations, (3) an example of an open-source platform for integrating mobile health technology output, and (4) recommendations for assessing readiness for deployment of promising devices and algorithms suitable for regulatory approval.

PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 67 to 98 with a life expectancy of less than 1 year (N = 20). MEASUREMENTS: In-depth semistructured interviews in participants' homes. Constant comparative analysis was used to develop codes and identify themes. RESULTS: Participants generally delegated decisions to others, expressing their wishes by describing desired end-of-life outcomes and highlighting meaningful aspects of their lives. They did this in the belief that the delegate would make appropriate decisions on their behalf. In this way, participants were able to achieve a sense of control without being in control of decisions. Four themes emerged from the analysis that reflect the various approaches participants used to articulate their goals and maintain a sense of control: direct communication, third-party analogies, adaptive denial, and engaged avoidance.

With virtually no success at finding pharmaceutical therapeutics for altering progressive AD after diagnosis, research attention is increasingly directed at discovering biological and other markers that detect AD risk in the long asymptomatic phase. Both early detection and precision preclinical intervention require systematic investigation of multiple modalities and combinations of AD-related biomarkers and risk factors. We extend recent unbiased metabolomics research that produced a set of metabolite biomarker panels tailored to the discrimination of cognitively normal (CN), cognitively impaired and AD patients. Specifically, we compare the prediction importance of these panels with five other sets of modifiable and non-modifiable AD risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, cognitive, functional health and bio-demographic) in three clinical groups. Method: The three groups were: CN (n = 35), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 25), and AD (n = 22). In a series of three pairwise comparisons, we used machine learning technology random forest analysis (RFA) to test relative predictive importance of up to 19 risk biomarkers from the six AD risk domains. Results: The three RFA multimodal prediction analyses produced significant discriminating risk factors. First, discriminating AD from CN was the AD metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. Second, discriminating AD from MCI was the AD/MCI metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. Third, discriminating MCI from CN was the MCI metabolite panel and seven markers from four other risk modalities: genetic, lifestyle, cognition and functional health. Conclusions: Salivary metabolomics biomarker panels, supplemented by other risk markers, were robust predictors of: (1) clinical differences in impairment and dementia and even; (2) subtle differences between CN and MCI. For the latter, the metabolite panel was supplemented by biomarkers that were both modifiable (e.g., functional) and non-modifiable (e.g., genetic). Comparing, integrating and identifying important multi-modal predictors may lead to novel combinations of complex risk profiles potentially indicative of neuropathological changes in asymptomatic or preclinical AD.",2018,10.3389/fnagi.2018.00296,10,NA,296,eng,1663-4365,cognition and genetics and Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment and biomarkers and cognitively normal and salivary metabolomics and victoria longitudinal study,NA,NA,2018///,Front Aging Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, unique ethical challenges require particular attention to elements of subject enrollment and informed consent.

Decision-making capacity can render patients vulnerable in a way that requires careful ethical considerations by clinicians with respect to medical decision making, research participation, and public safety. Clinicians should discuss how future decisions will be made as early in the disease course as possible. Because of cognitive, visual, and motor impairments, PD may be associated with unsafe driving, leading to early driving cessation in many. DBS of the STN and, to a lesser degree, globus pallidus interna (GPi) has consistently been associated with decreased verbal fluency, but significant global cognitive decline is usually not observed in patients who undergo rigorous selection. There are some observations suggesting lesser cognitive decline in GPi DBS than STN DBS, but further research is required. Management of PD dementia (PDD) patients involves both pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures. Patients with PDD should be offered treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor taking into account expected benefits and potential risks. Treatment with neuroleptics may be necessary to treat psychosis; classical neuroleptics, as well as risperidone and olanzapine, should be avoided. Quetiapine might be considered first-line treatment because it does not need special monitoring, although the strongest evidence for efficacy exists for clozapine. Evidence from randomized, controlled studies in the PDD population is lacking; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may be used to treat depressive features.

As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment decisions, is then introduced.

To limit this impending socio-medical calamity, a fulcrum change from how AD is presently managed is crucial. The present approach has not averted the stress of AD on medical resources nor reduced the already cost-strained government health care programs. Since substantial evidence indicates that sporadic AD is directly associated with vascular risk factors, a strategic plan is proposed to target this association and markedly reduce the onset of AD. This plan would establish in-house heart-brain clinics devoted to identifying, detecting, and preventing the progression of vascular risk factors that predispose to cognitive impairment and development of AD. The heart-brain clinics would be staffed with a multidisciplinary group of neurologists, psychologists, neuroradiologists, cardiovascular specialists, and technical personnel Their goal would be to apply and interpret non-invasive, cost-effective multidiagnostic testing of heart and brain function in outpatient asymptomatic and symptomatic patients at risk of dementia. Multidiagnostic testing would permit better risk stratification, medical decision-making, and a tailored intervention of patients at-risk of dementia than the present monotherapeutic approach. Personalized intervention, moreover, should achieve better patient compliance and outcome through periodic follow-up visits to the clinics where the medical plan of action could be monitored and modified as needed.

This may explain why many medical students do not have a positive attitude toward elderly adults and find the complexity of their problems overwhelming.

The effects of this game-based course were evaluated as a proof of concept. The assessment was based on the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD) and a validated self-perceived knowledge scale of geriatric topics. The usability of (and satisfaction with) GeriatriX was also assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. After completion of the course, the ASD changed significantly in the geriatrics course group (n = 29; P = .02) but not in a control group that took a neuroscience course (n = 24; P = .30).

Clinician communication skills are a critical factor in achieving a patient and family understanding of their illness that enables them to share in decision making that will result in medical treatments and social supports that are aligned with their goals and values. Research demonstrates that existing clinician competence in communication skills is extremely variable, that most clinicians need specific communication training to have an adequate level of skill, and that evidence-based training is efficacious. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 219,000 physicians and advance practice providers (APPs) (50% of physicians in high-contact subspecialties and 25% of all APPs) could benefit from training. Combining evidence-based clinician training with health system workflow redesign would likely maximize the impact of this training. We conclude with recommendations designed to address gaps in communication skills through effective training and health system changes in the service of enabling all patients with serious illness and their families to receive care aligned with their personal priorities.

Sulmasy_2007_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,How would terminally ill patients have others make decisions for them in the event of decisional incapacity? A longitudinal study,"Sulmasy, Daniel P. and Hughes, Mark T. and Thompson, Richard E. and Astrow, Alan B. and Terry, Peter B. and Kub, Joan and Nolan, Marie T.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the role terminally ill patients would opt to have their loved ones and physicians play in healthcare decisions should they lose decision-making capacity and how this changes over time. DESIGN: Serial interviews. SETTING: The study institutions were The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore, Maryland, and St. Vincent's Hospital, in New York. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-seven patients with cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or heart failure, at baseline and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Patients' baseline decision control preferences varied widely, but most opted for shared decision-making, leaning slightly toward independence from their loved ones. This did not change significantly at 3 or 6 months. Fifty-seven percent opted for the same degree of decision control at 3 months as at baseline. In a generalized estimating equation model adjusted for time, more-independent decision-making was associated with college education (P=.046) and being female (P=.01), whereas more-reliant decision-making was associated with age (P<.001). Patients leaned toward more reliance upon physicians to make best-interest determinations at diagnosis but opted for physicians to decide based upon their own independent wishes (substituted judgment) over time, especially if college educated. CONCLUSION: Terminally ill patients vary in how much they wish their own preferences to control decisions made on their behalf, but most would opt for shared decision-making with loved ones and physicians. Control preferences are stable over time with respect to loved ones, but as they live longer with their illnesses, patients prefer somewhat less reliance upon physicians.",2007,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01473.x,55,12,1981-1988,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Interviews as Topic and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Mental Competency and Terminally Ill/*psychology and Neoplasms/psychology and *Third-Party Consent and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/psychology and Heart Failure/psychology,NA,NA,2007/12//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite this poor prognosis, little data are available on what factors should be prioritized to guide surgical decision making in these cases. We aimed to understand the decision-making process for older dementia patients hospitalized after hip fractures. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative analysis of in-depth elite interviews conducted with a clinical care team involved in management of patients with dementia after hospitalization for hip fractures. SETTING: Interviews were conducted with an interprofessional team involved in the care of patients with dementia after being hospitalized for hip fractures. PARTICIPANTS: Interviewees included nine orthopaedic surgeons, three hospitalists, three geriatricians, five nurses, three occupational therapists, three physical therapists, and two clinical ethicists. MEASUREMENTS: Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed and coded using QSR International's NVivo 10 qualitative database management software. RESULTS: The three main themes that most interviewees discussed were pain control, functional status, and medical comorbidities. Interviewees brought up many factors related to restoring functional status including baseline functional status, rehabilitation potential, social support, and the importance of mobility. Dementia and its impact on rehabilitation potential were mentioned by all geriatricians. CONCLUSION: Although frailty, prognosis, and life expectancy were largely absent from the responses, the emphasis on dementia, advanced directives, and involving family or caregivers by the three geriatricians indicates the importance of including geriatricians in the decision-making team for these patients.",2019,10.1111/jgs.15856,67,6,1132-1137,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Hospitalization and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and dementia and Advance Directives and Pain Management and *Decision Making and *Comorbidity and *Patient Care Team and Dementia/*psychology and interprofessional team and treatment decision making and hip fracture and Hip Fractures/rehabilitation/*surgery",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: University-based memory clinic in Munich, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred people with aMCI or mild AD, their relatives (N = 99), and their referring physicians (N = 93). MEASUREMENTS: Participation preferences and decisional capacity and assessment of these measures according to relatives and physicians. RESULTS: Patients had a preference for participation in healthcare-related decisions, especially in social ones. Overall, individuals wanted their relatives to play a secondary role in decision-making. Relatives and referring physicians performed poorly in predicting the individuals' participation preferences, and relatives wanted to attribute less decision-making power to patients than the patients did themselves. Patients refrained from participation if they had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores or were unsure about their decisional capacity. There were deficits in decision-making capacity, which mostly related to understanding of the information presented. There was only weak correlation between the different measures (patient's, relative's, and physician's estimate, MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment) of the patients' decisional capacity. CONCLUSION: The combination of marked participation preferences and impairments in the decisional capacity of individuals with aMCI and early AD constitute an ethical and practical challenge.

T. and Meijer, Johanna H. and Deboer, Tom",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,"Physical activity is beneficial for health. It has been shown to improve brain functioning and cognition, reduce severity of mood disorders, as well as facilitate healthy sleep and healthy aging. Sleep has been studied in healthy aged mice and absolute slow-wave-activity levels (SWA, electroencephalogram power between 0.75 and 4.0 Hz) in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) were elevated, suggesting changes in brain connectivity. To investigate whether physical activity can diminish this aging-induced effect, mice of three age groups were provided with a running wheel (RW) for 1-3 months (6-months-old, n = 9; 18-months-old, n = 9; 24-months-old, n = 8) and were compared with control sedentary mice (n = 11, n = 8 and n = 9 respectively). Two weeks before the sleep-wake recordings the running wheels were removed. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram were continuously recorded during undisturbed 24 h baseline (BL) and a sleep-deprivation was conducted during the first 6 h of the second day. Increased waking and decreased NREM sleep was found in the young RW mice, compared to young controls. These effects were not evident in the 18 and 24 months old mice. Unlike sleep architecture, we found that SWA was altered throughout the whole age spectrum. Notably, SWA was increased with aging and attenuated with exercise, exhibiting the lowest levels in the young RW mice. To utilize the cross-age revealing features of SWA, we applied machine learning techniques and found that characteristic information regarding age and exercise was enclosed in SWA. In addition, with cluster analysis, we could classify and accurately distinguish the different groups based solely on their SWA. Therefore, our study comprises a three-fold contribution: (a) effects of exercise on sleep are sustained following 2 weeks after removal of the wheel, (b) we show that EEG SWA can be used as a physiological marker of brain age in the mouse,",2018,10.3389/fnagi.2018.00233,10,NA,233,eng,1663-4365,EEG and aging and exercise and running wheel and spectral analysis and SWA,NA,NA,2018///,Front Aging Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA

Caleb",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the degree to which physicians report reliance on patient preferences when making medical decisions for hospitalized patients lacking decisional capacity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: One academic and two community hospitals in a single metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-one physicians who recently cared for hospitalized adults. MEASUREMENTS: A self-administered survey addressing physicians' beliefs about ethical principles guiding surrogate decision-making and physicians' recent decision-making experiences. RESULTS: Overall, 72.6% of physicians identified a standard related to patient preferences as the most important ethical standard for surrogate decision-making (61.2% identified advanced directives and 11.4% substituted judgment). Of the 73.3% of physicians who reported recently making a surrogate decision, 81.8% reported that patient preferences were highly important in decision-making, although only 29.4% reported that patient preference was the most important factor in the decision. Physicians were significantly more likely to base decisions on patient preferences when the patient was in the intensive care unit (odds ratio (OR)=2.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-7.45) and less likely when the patient was older (OR=0.76 for each decade of age, 95% CI=0.58-0.99). The presence of a living will, prior discussions with the patient, and the physicians' beliefs about ethical guidelines did not significantly predict the physicians' reliance on patient preferences.

We performed semistructured interviews with key stakeholders across multiple sectors in an urban county who participate in the care of or decision-making process for unrepresented adults. This included a safety net healthcare system, social services, and legal services. Participants were healthcare, social service, and legal professionals who worked with unrepresented adults (n = 25). Our interview questions explored the current process for proxy decision making in cases of unrepresented adults and potential alternatives. We recorded, transcribed, and analyzed interviews using the constant comparative method to identify major themes related to ethical challenges if they were raised. Participants grappled with multiple ethical challenges around the care of unrepresented adults. Themes described by participants were: (1) prioritizing autonomy; (2) varying safety thresholds; (3) distributing resources fairly; and (4) taking a moral toll on stakeholders. In conclusion, all stakeholders identified ethical challenges in caring for unrepresented adults. An applied ethical framework that takes these dilemmas into account could improve ethical practice for unrepresented adults and lessen the emotional toll on stakeholders.

No prior studies have researched the real-world use of VIPAs among older adults. We sought to explore how older adults and caregivers utilize VIPAs. DESIGN/MEASUREMENT: Retrospective review of all verified purchase reviews of the Amazon Echo posted on Amazon.com between January 2015 and January 2018, with filtering for health-related older adult key words. Open-ended reviews were qualitatively analyzed to identify relevant themes. RESULTS: On retrieval, there were 73 549 reviews; and with subsequent key word filtering, 125 total reviews were subsequently analyzed. Five major themes were identified: (1) entertainment (""For two very senior citizens...we have really had fun with Echo. She tells us jokes, answers questions, plays music.); (2) companionship (""A senior living alone...I now have Alex to talk to.""); (3) home control; (4) reminders (""I needed something that would provide me with information I couldn't remember well, such as the date, day, or my schedule...I highly recommend for anyone with memory challenges""); and (5) emergency communication. Several felt it reduced burdening caregivers. ""...You also feel guilt from fear of overburdening your caregivers. Alexa has alleviated much of this."" Specifically, caregivers found that: ""By making playlists of songs from her youth whoever is providing care, family or professional caregiver, can simply request the right song for the moment in order to sooth, redirect, or distract Mom."" Alternatively, negative reviewers felt the VIPA misunderstood them or could not adequately respond to specific health questions. CONCLUSION: VIPAs are a low-cost artificial intelligence that can support older adults in the home and potentially reduce caregiver burden. This study is the first to explore VIPA use among older adults, and further studies are needed to examine the direct benefits of VIPAs in supporting aging in place.

The population of people suffering from dementia is as large as 50 million. Most dementia cases result from various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) linked by a progressive degeneration of neurons. Among NDs, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia and accounts for 60- 80% of cases. Certain pathological changes on the cellular and subcellular level occur even 15 years before the manifestation of clinical symptoms of AD. This first asymptomatic phase of AD is considered a preclinical stage, whereas mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the symptomatic pre-dementia stage. The third, fully symptomatic phase of AD is dementia due to AD. The presence of specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be considered as a characteristic feature of some NDs. The measurement of their CSF concentrations, together with neuropsychological examination and neuroimaging, may be useful for diagnosing AD. The collection of CSF samples is performed by lumbar puncture, which is a medical procedure that requires obtaining informed consent from patients. While asymptomatic AD patients have full legal capacity, those with dementia require a legal guardian who will represent them. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the legal systems regulating the legal capacity issue in the USA, U.K. (England and Wales), Germany, and Poland.

DESIGN: We used a semistructured interview guide containing 2 domains of perceived benefits and strategies to explore why and how clinicians choose to discuss long-term prognosis, defined as life expectancy on the scale of years, with patients. SETTING: Clinicians from home-based primary care practices, community-based clinics, and academic medical centers across San Francisco. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen physicians, including 11 geriatricians and 1 geriatric nurse practitioner, with a mean age of 40 and a mean 9 years in practice. MEASUREMENTS: Clinician responses were analyzed qualitatively using the constant comparisons approach. RESULTS: Perceived benefits of discussing long-term prognosis included establishing realistic expectations for patients, encouraging conversations about future planning, and promoting shared decision-making through understanding of patient goals of care. Communication strategies included adapting discussions to individual patient preferences and engaging in multiple conversations over time.

Advance care planning (ACP) is the process whereby individuals communicate their wishes for future care with their clinicians and surrogate decision-makers while they are still able to do so. ACP has been shown to improve important outcomes for individuals with cognitive impairment, but rates of ACP for these individuals are low because of individual-, clinician-, and system-related factors. Addressing ACP early in the illness trajectory can maximize the chances that people can participate meaningfully. This article recommends best practices for approaching ACP for older adults with cognitive impairment. The importance of providing anticipatory guidance and eliciting values to guide future care to create a shared framework between clinicians, individuals, and surrogate decision-makers is emphasized. It is recommended that ACP be approached as an iterative process to continue to honor and support people's wishes as cognitive impairment progresses and increasingly threatens independence and function. The article describes effective strategies for assessing decision-making capacity, identifying surrogate decision-makers, and using structured communication tools for ACP. It also provides guidelines for documentation and billing.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Multicenter, emergency department (ED)-based cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 and older intubated in the ED from 2008 to 2015 from 262 hospitals across the United States (>95% of U.S. nonprofit academic medical centers). MEASUREMENTS: Our primary outcome was age-specific in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were age-specific odds of death after adjusting for race, comorbid conditions, admission diagnosis, hospital disposition, and geographic region. RESULTS: We identified 41,463 ED intubation encounters and included 35,036 in the final analysis. Sixty-four percent were in non-Hispanic whites and 54% in women. Overall in-hospital mortality was 33% (95% confidence interval (CI)=34-35%).

The Script Concordance Test (SCT) is an assessment tool designed to measure clinical data interpretation, an important element of clinical reasoning under uncertainty. The purpose of this study was to develop and analyze the validity of results of an SCT administered to undergraduate students in geriatric medicine. An SCT consisting of 13 cases and 104 items covering a spectrum of common geriatric problems was designed and administered to 41 undergraduate medical students at a medical school in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A reference panel of 21 practicing geriatricians contributed to the test's score key. The responses were analyzed, and the psychometric properties of the tool were investigated. The test's internal consistency and discriminative capacity to distinguish students from experienced geriatricians supported construct validity. The Cronbach alpha for the test was 0.84, and mean scores for the experts were found to be significantly higher than those of the students (80.0 and 70.7, respectively; P < .001).

The objective was to examine patient and surrogate reports of ACP engagement and associations with surrogate knowledge of goals. DESIGN: Cohort study SETTING: Primary care in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: 350 community-dwelling veterans age <e2><89><a5>55 years and the individual they would choose to make medical decisions on their behalf, interviewed separately. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment goals were assessed by veterans' ratings of 3 health states: severe physical disability, cognitive disability, and pain, as an acceptable or unacceptable result of treatment for severe illness. Surrogates had knowledge if they correctly predicted all 3 responses. Veterans and surrogates were asked about living will and health care proxy completion and communication about life-sustaining treatment and quality versus quantity of life (QOL). RESULTS: Over 40% of dyads agreed that the veteran had not completed a living will or health care proxy and that there was no QOL communication. For each activity, sizeable proportions (18-34%) disagreed about participation. In dyads who agreed QOL communication had occurred, 30% of surrogates had knowledge, compared to 21% in dyads who agreed communication had not occurred and 15% in dyads who disagreed (P = .01). This relationship persisted in multivariable analysis. Agreement about other ACP activities was not associated with knowledge. CONCLUSION: Disagreement about ACP participation was common.

Studying blood metabolomics in this population has the potential to probe the biological underpinnings of this health disparity. OBJECTIVE: We performed a comprehensive analysis of circulating plasma metabolites in relation to cognitive function in 736 participants from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS) who underwent untargeted mass-spectrometry based metabolomics analysis and had undergone a battery of in-person cognitive testing at baseline. METHODS: After relevant exclusions, 621 metabolites were examined. We used multivariable regression, adjusted for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, smoking, and Mediterranean dietary pattern, to identify metabolites related to global cognitive function in our cohort. LASSO machine learning was used in a complementary analysis to identify metabolites that could discriminate good from poor extremes of cognition. We also conducted sensitivity analyses: restricted to participants without diabetes, and to participants with good adherence to Mediterranean diet. RESULTS: Of 621 metabolites, FDR corrected (p < 0.05) multivariable linear regression identified 3 metabolites positively, and 10 negatively, associated with cognitive function in the BPRHS. In a combination of FDR-corrected linear regression, logistic regression regularized via LASSO, and sensitivity analyses restricted to participants without diabetes, and with good adherence to the Mediterranean diet, <ce><b2>-cryptoxanthin plasma concentration was consistently associated with better cognitive function and N-acetylisoleucine and tyramine O-sulfate concentrations were consistently associated with worse cognitive function.

Sources of data included audio recordings of visits, followed by post-visit patient interviews. Communication during the visit was assessed using the Siminoff Communication Content and Affect Program. Patient outcome measures included self-reported satisfaction with decision, decision conflict, and decision regret. Results showed that oncologists were significantly more fluent and more direct with older than middle-aged patients and trended toward expressing their own treatment preferences more with older patients. Satisfaction with treatment decisions was highest for women in their 50s and 60s. Decision conflict was significantly associated with more discussion of oncologist treatment preferences and prognosis. Decision regret was significantly associated with patient age and education. Older adults considering adjuvant therapy may find that oncologists' communication accommodations to perceived deficiencies in older adult cognition or communication challenge their decision-making involvement.

M.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into how advance directives for euthanasia affect resident care in Dutch nursing homes. DESIGN: Survey of elderly care physicians and additional qualitative interviews with a selection of elderly care physicians and relatives of people with dementia who had an advance directive for euthanasia. SETTING: Dutch nursing home practice. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred thirty-four elderly care physicians completed the general part of the questionnaire; 110 physicians provided case histories. Interviews were conducted with 11 physicians and eight relatives. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire contained general questions about the incidence of advance directives for euthanasia in people with dementia. A second part involved questions about the most recent case of a person with dementia and an advance directive for euthanasia who had died. The interviews with elderly care physicians and relatives focused on further exploration of the decision-making process regarding adherence to the advance directive for euthanasia. RESULTS: Despite law-based possibilities, advance directives for euthanasia of people with dementia were rarely adhered to, although they seem to have a supportive role in setting limitations on life-sustaining treatments. Elderly care physicians and relatives were found to be reluctant to adhere to advance directives for euthanasia. Not being able to engage in meaningful communication played a crucial role in this reluctance. CONCLUSION: Advance directives for euthanasia are never adhered to in the Netherlands in the case of people with advanced dementia, and their role in advance care planning and end-of-life care of people with advanced dementia is limited.

We studied the effect of recommendations made by a consultative geriatric oncology clinic on treatment decision making by oncologists in Mexico. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective chart review of 173 consecutive patients with solid tumors referred before treatment initiation to the geriatric oncology clinic at a third-level public hospital in Mexico City between March 2015 and October 2017. Patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary geriatric oncology clinic, and treatment recommendations were issued to treating oncologists. MEASUREMENTS: We determined the overall proportion of agreement between geriatric oncology recommendations and oncologists' treatment decisions. We assessed whether agreement increased when geriatric oncology recommendations were acknowledged in the treating oncologist's clinic note. The homogeneity of agreement was tested using the Stuart-Maxwell test. RESULTS: Median age was 79 years (range = 64-97 years). ""Standard treatment"" was recommended in 48% of cases, followed by ""less intensive treatment"" in 32%, and ""best supportive care"" in 20%. The overall proportion of agreement for the entire population was 80% (<ce><ba> = 0.69), although agreement was heterogeneous (X(2) = 8.16, P = .02). Geriatric oncology recommendations were acknowledged in the treating oncologists' notes in 62% of cases. Overall agreement was higher when the evaluation was acknowledged (83%, <ce><ba> = 0.74) than when it was not acknowledged (74%, <ce><ba> = 0.60). Agreement was homogeneous only when recommendations were acknowledged in the oncologist's note (X(2) = 3.0, P = .22). CONCLUSIONS: The overall proportion of agreement between geriatric oncology recommendations and final treatment decisions was high, particularly when recommendations were acknowledged in the treating oncologists' note.

DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of in-depth interviews with 20 patient-caregiver dyads. SETTING: Community and academic-affiliated primary care clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 or older with 2 or more health conditions and their family caregivers (n=20 patient-caregiver dyads). MEASUREMENTS: Open-ended questions were asked about the tasks that the patient and caregiver performed to manage the patient's health conditions; questions were designed to elicit participant reactions and attitudes toward the help they provided or received. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Participant preferences and attitudes toward the receipt and provision of disease management tasks were highly personal. Participant responses clustered into 2 caregiving typologies: supportive caregiving relationships and conflicted caregiving relationships. Supportive relationships were characterized by patient-caregiver agreement about caregiver level of involvement, agreement about one another's competency to perform disease-related tasks, mutual understanding, collaborative decision-making and disease management, and use of family and formal caregiving. Conflicted relationships were characterized by disagreement about caregiver level of involvement, disagreement about one another's competency to perform disease management tasks, underappreciation of one another's experiences, disagreement over decision-making and disease management, and use of formal caregiving.

Because dementia leads to prolonged incapacity, with many decisions arising before a terminal event, it has been suggested that dementia-specific ACP is necessary. We sought to elicit the perspectives of older adults with early cognitive impairment and their caregivers on traditional and dementia-specific ACP. DESIGN: Qualitative study with separate focus groups for patients and caregivers. SETTING: Memory disorder clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty eight persons aged 65+ with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia and 19 caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Understanding of dementia trajectory and types of planning done; how medical decisions would be made in the future; thoughts about these decisions. RESULTS: No participants had engaged in any written form of dementia-specific planning. Barriers to dementia-specific ACP emerged, including lack of knowledge about the expected trajectory of dementia and potential medical decisions, the need to stay focused in the present because of fear of loss of self, disinterest in planning because the patient will not be aware of decisions, and the expectation that involved family members would take care of issues. Some patients had trouble engaging in the discussion. Patients had highly variable views on what the quality of their future life would be and on the leeway their surrogates should have in decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Even among patients with early cognitive impairment seen in specialty clinics and their caregivers, most were unaware of the decisions they could face, and there were many barriers to planning for these decisions. These issues would likely be magnified in more representative populations, and highlight challenges to the use of dementia-specific advance directive documents.",2021,10.1111/jgs.16953,69,4,932-937,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Patient Participation and attitudes and Communication Barriers and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Qualitative Research and dementia and *Decision Making and *Quality of Life and Mental Competency and advance care planning and *Advance Care Planning/ethics/organization & administration and *Caregivers/psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Terminal Care/methods/psychology and Dementia/*psychology/therapy",NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: Primary care clinicians were recruited from nursing homes, community-based clinics, and academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Three geriatric nurse practitioners, nine geriatricians, five general internists, and three family medicine physicians with a mean age of 44 and a mean 12 years in practice. Seventeen clinicians had patient panels with 80% or more community-dwelling outpatients, 13 had patient panels with 50% or more patients aged 85 and older, and 16 had patient panels with 25% or more of patients in a minority group (Asian, African American, Hispanic). MEASUREMENTS: Clinicians were asked to describe their practice of discussing long-term (<5-year) and short-term (<1-year and 3-month) prognosis. Responses were analyzed qualitatively using constant comparison until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: Clinicians reported individualizing the decision to discuss prognosis with their frail older patients based on clinical circumstances. Common reasons for discussing prognosis included patient had a specific condition with a limited prognosis, to give patients time to prepare, to promote informed medical decision-making, and when patients or families prompted the conversation. Common reasons not to discuss included maintaining hope and avoiding anxiety, cognitive impairment or patient unable to understand prognosis, respect for patients' cultural values, and long-term prognosis too uncertain to be useful. CONCLUSION: Clinicians caring for frail older adults are generally willing to discuss short- but not long-term prognosis.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample. SETTING: National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), 2005-2006. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults without known cognitive impairment, aged 57 to 85, interviewed as part of NSHAP (n = 2,767). MEASUREMENTS: We examined demographic, medical, and social connectedness characteristics associated with answering ""no"" to this question: ""Do you have someone who you would like to make medical decisions for you if you were unable, as for example if you were seriously injured or very sick?"" Because many states permit nuclear family to make decisions for persons with no legally appointed health care agent, we used logistic regression to identify factors associated with individuals who were ill suited to this paradigm in the sense that they had nuclear family but did not have a desired surrogate. RESULTS: Among NSHAP respondents, 7.5% (95% confidence interval = 6.4-8.7) did not have a desired surrogate. Nearly 90% of respondents without desired surrogates had nuclear family. Compared with respondents with desired surrogates, those without desired surrogates had lower indicators of social connectedness. On average, however, they had four confidants, approximately 70% socialized at least monthly, and more than 90% could discuss their health with a confidant. Among respondents who had nuclear family, few characteristics distinguished those with and without desired surrogates. CONCLUSION: Nearly 8% of older adults did not have a desired surrogate. Most had nuclear family and were not socially disconnected. Older adults should be asked explicitly about a desired surrogate, and strategies are needed to identify surrogates for those who do not have family or would not choose family to make decisions for them.",2021,10.1111/jgs.16813,69,1,114-121,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Independent Living and *Decision Making and *Aging and Family/*psychology and Social Interaction and surrogate decision-making and unbefriended and Advance Directives/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and incapacitated patients",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Semistructured interviews about a recent hospitalization. SETTING: Two hospitals affiliated with one large medical school: an urban public hospital and a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Surrogates were eligible if they had recently made a major medical decision for a hospitalized individual aged 65 and older and were available for an interview within 1 month (2-5 months if the patient died). MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: Thirty-five surrogates were interviewed (80% female, 44% white, 56% African American). Three primary themes emerged. First, it was found that the nature of surrogate-clinician relationships was best characterized as a relationship with a ""team"" of clinicians rather than individual clinicians because of frequent staff changes and multiple clinicians. Second, surrogates reported their communication needs, including frequent communication, information, and emotional support. Surrogates valued communication from any member of the clinical team, including nurses, social workers, and physicians. Third, surrogates described trust and mistrust, which were formed largely through surrogates' communication experiences. CONCLUSION: In the hospital, surrogates form relationships with a ""team"" of clinicians rather than with individuals, yet effective communication and expressions of emotional support frequently occur, which surrogates value highly. Future interventions should focus on meeting surrogates' needs for frequent communication and high levels of information and emotional support.",2012,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04086.x,60,8,1401-1407,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and *Decision Making and *Hospitalization and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Third-Party Consent,NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Cross-sectional interview. SETTING: Twenty-two senior centers in greater Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-seven Latinos aged 60 and older. MEASUREMENTS: EOL care preferences, extent of ACP, attitudes regarding patient autonomy, family-centered decision-making, trust in healthcare providers, and health and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: If seriously ill, 84% of participants would prefer medical care focused on comfort rather than care focused on extending life, yet 47% had never discussed such preferences with their family or doctor, and 77% had no advance directive. Most participants favored family-centered decision making (64%) and limited patient autonomy (63%).

The difference in importance of the concept between two age groups (40-69 and 70-79) was investigated using effect sizes (ESs). RESULTS: Clinically significant differences in the concept of good death were observed for two domains and one component: not being a burden to others (ES = -0.24), role accomplishment and contribution to others (ES = 0.29), and omakase (leaving the decisions to a medical expert; ES = 0.60).

DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING: Primary and community care. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was change in PIP measured using implicit or explicit tools. Studies were grouped into organizational, professional, financial, regulatory, and multifaceted interventions. RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials were identified with baseline PIP prevalence of 18% to 100%. Four of six organizational interventions reported a reduction in PIP, particularly through pharmacists conducting medication reviews. Evidence of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary teams was weak. Both of the two professional (targeting prescriber's directly) interventions were computerized clinical decision support interventions and were effective in decreasing new PIP but not existing PIP. Three of four multifaceted approaches were effective in reducing PIP. The risk of bias was often high, particularly in reporting selection bias. CONCLUSION: Interventions including organizational (pharmacist interventions), professional (computerized clinical decision support systems), and multifaceted approaches appear beneficial in terms of reducing PIP, but the range of effect sizes reported was modest, and it is unclear whether such interventions can result in clinically significant improvements in patient outcomes.

DESIGN: Using a conceptual model that classifies QIs principally by aim and burden of the care process, 12 clinical experts rated whether each Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders-3 (ACOVE-3) QI should be applied in evaluating quality of care for older persons with AD or PP. QI exclusions were assessed for each of the 26 conditions and by whether these conditions were mainly medical (e.g., diabetes mellitus), geriatric (e.g., falls), or crosscutting processes of care (e.g., pain management). QI exclusions were also identified for older persons who decided against hospitalization or surgery. RESULTS: Of 392 ACOVE-3 QIs, 140 (36%) were excluded for patients with AD and 135 (34%) for patients with PP; 57% of QIs focusing on medical conditions were excluded from patients with AD and 53% from patients with PP, whereas only 20% of QIs for geriatric conditions were excluded from AD and 15% from PP. All QIs with care processes judged to carry a heavy burden were excluded; 86% of moderate-burden QIs were excluded from AD and 92% from PP. All QIs aimed at long-term goals were excluded; 83% of intermediate-term goal QIs were excluded from AD and 98% from PP. Individuals holding a preference to forgo hospitalization or surgery would be excluded from 7% of potentially applicable QIs.

This study quantifies dyskinesia risks for different Parkinson's onset ages in a patient population treated at the Parkinson's Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Medical records were reviewed to determine age of Parkinson's onset, medication history, and dyskinesia onset. Dyskinesia risks were determined by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare age groups and to perform multivariate modeling. This study included 109 patients with Parkinson's, 105 of whom had onset of symptoms after 1989. At 5 years of levodopa treatment, the dyskinesia risk for patients with onset age 40-49 was 70%, decreasing to 42% for onset ages 50-59, 33% for onset ages 60-69, and 24% for onset ages 70-79. Pairwise comparisons between the 40-49 age group and the other age groups were statistically significant in time-to-event models. After 5 years of levodopa treatment, dyskinesia risks became uniformly high regardless of age of onset. These results suggest it is appropriate to use different baseline dyskinesia risks in clinical decision-making for patients on the basis of their ages of onset. However, the most significant difference occurs between ages 40-49 and ages 50-79, and if more than 5 years of levodopa therapy are anticipated, dyskinesia risk may have less utility when deciding upon Parkinson's therapy. Drug studies for Parkinson's disease should also take age of Parkinson's onset into account when analyzing dyskinesia outcomes.",2010,10.1002/mds.23068,25,9,1177-1182,eng,1531-8257 0885-3185,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Age Factors and Proportional Hazards Models and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and *Age of Onset and Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality and Levodopa/*adverse effects and Parkinsonian Disorders/drug therapy/mortality",NA,NA,2010/07/15/,Mov Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

A central problem is how to decide about individuals who have become incapacitated and can no longer request or refuse potentially life-sustaining treatment. An advance directive is a formal attempt to protect people's right to autonomy when they are no longer autonomous. As such, it assumes that previously expressed wishes are precise and immutable, but many families make decisions together, and individuals may negotiate, compromise, and modify their genuine preferences, especially when novel threats arise, and the stakes are high. The current article describes a case in which two daughters overruled a patient's explicit preference to refuse life-sustaining treatment, leading to burdensome illness before death. In the end, the mother seemed to understand her children's needs and seemed willing, at least in retrospect, to have met those needs. After the death of this individual, we continued to talk with the daughters and videotaped an interview in which they shared their perspectives on the case. The daughters consented to be videotaped and to share the video with the medical community (available in online version of article). Their forceful devotion to their mother and their search in retrospect for what could have been done differently has completely changed our understanding of events. We believe that the daughters' behavior is not the indefensible breach of respect for person that it seemed to be. Their mother's true wishes might well have included a desire to help her children during her own dying. Family members' preferences are likely to be important considerations for many people, although the possibility of coercion has to be acknowledged as well.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: NHs in North Carolina (N = 31). PARTICIPANTS: Nursing staff (n = 182) and medical providers (n = 50). MEASUREMENTS: Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire about their perspectives on antibiotic use in their NH, the influence of residents and families on antibiotic prescribing decisions, and readiness to improve antibiotic stewardship. Open-ended questions on barriers to antibiotic stewardship were also asked. Linear mixed modeling was used to analyze differences between respondent groups and to test for associations with individual and organizational characteristics. RESULTS: All respondents supported reducing antibiotic use, although medical providers' support was significantly stronger (P = .005). When asked about their perception of residents' and family members' preference for antibiotic use in the case of suspected infection and the influence of that preference on antibiotic-prescribing decisions, respondents indicated that residents and families favor antibiotic use and influence prescribing decisions. Nurses reported a stronger perception than medical providers that families prefer antibiotics (P = .04) and influence prescribing decisions (P = .02). All respondents reported commitment and efficacy to change practices (mean 4.0-4.1 for nurses and 3.6-3.9 for medical providers on a 5-point scale).

Efforts to enhance oral feeding by altering the environment and creating patient-centered approaches to feeding should be part of usual care for older adults with advanced dementia. Tube feeding is a medical therapy that an individual's surrogate decision-maker can decline or accept in accordance with advance directives, previously stated wishes, or what it is thought the individual would want. It is the responsibility of all members of the healthcare team caring for residents in long-term care settings to understand any previously expressed wishes of the individuals (through review of advance directives and with surrogate caregivers) regarding tube feeding and to incorporate these wishes into the care plan.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare expert expectations about the timing of research milestone attainment with those of patients who follow Parkinson's disease (PD) research. METHODS: Patients with PD and experts were asked to provide forecasts about 11 milestones in PD research in an online survey. PD experts were identified from a Michael J. Fox Foundation database, highly ranked neurology centers in the United States and Canada, and corresponding authors of articles on PD in top medical journals. Patients with PD were recruited through the Michael J. Fox Foundation. We tested whether patient forecasts differed on average from expert forecasts. We also tested whether differences between patient forecasts and the average expert forecasts were associated with any demographic factors. RESULTS: A total of 256 patients and 249 PD experts completed the survey. For 9 of the 11 milestones, patients' forecasts were on average higher than those of experts. Only exercise therapy met our 10% difference threshold for practical significance. Education was the only demographic that predicted patient deviations from expert forecasts on milestone forecasts. Patients offered significantly higher forecasts than experts that the clinical trials used in milestone queries would report positive primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between patient and expert expectations about research milestones were generally minor, suggesting that there is little cause for concern that patients who follow PD research are unduly swayed by inaccurate representations of research advancement in the media or elsewhere.

The objective of this report is to describe the process, which began in 2008, of implementing Honoring Choices Minnesota in a large, diverse metropolitan area. All eight large healthcare systems in the metropolitan area agreed to participate in the project, and as of April 30, 2013, the proportion of hospitalized individuals 65 and older with advance care directives in the electronic medical record was 12.1% to 65.6%. The proportion of outpatients aged 65 and older was 11.6% to 31.7%. Organizations that had sponsored recruitment initiatives had the highest proportions of records containing healthcare directives. It was concluded that it is possible to reduce redundancy by recruiting all healthcare systems in a metropolitan area to endorse the same ACP model, although significantly increasing the proportion of individuals with a healthcare directive in their medical record requires a campaign with recruitment of organizations and individuals.",2014,10.1111/jgs.13136,62,12,2420-2425,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Decision Making and Models, Organizational and Program Evaluation and Minnesota and Program Development and Focus Groups and organizational innovation and healthcare systems and end-of-life care and advance care planning and Advance Care Planning/*organization & administration and Community Health Services/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2014/12//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program and the Johns Hopkins Older Americans Independence Center sponsored a symposium to identify potential barriers that impede the movement of frailty into clinical practice and to highlight opportunities to facilitate the further integration of frailty into clinical practice. Primary and subspecialty care providers, and investigators working to integrate and translate new biological aging knowledge into more specific preventive and treatment strategies for frailty provided the meeting content. Recommendations included a call for more specific language that clarifies conceptual differences between frailty definitions and measurement tools; the development of randomized controlled trials to test whether specific intervention strategies for a variety of conditions differently affect frail and non-frail individuals; development of implementation studies and therapeutic trials aimed at tailoring care as a function of pragmatic frailty markers; the use of deep learning and dynamic systems approaches to improve the translatability of findings from epidemiological studies; and the incorporation of advances in aging biology, especially focused on mitochondria, stem cells, and senescent cells, toward the further development of biologically targeted intervention and prevention strategies that can be used to treat or prevent frailty.

MEASUREMENTS: We used descriptive statistics of quantitative measures (percentage accepted invitation and completed template, duration of process) and qualitative analysis of barriers and enablers (challenges and solutions identified, facilitator perceptions). RESULTS: We developed and refined a process for identifying patient health priorities that was typically completed in 35 to 45 minutes over 2 sessions; 64 patients completed the process. Qualitative analyses were used to elucidate the characteristics and training needed for the patient priorities facilitators, as well as perceived benefits and challenges of the process. Refinements based on our experience and feedback include streamlining the process for greater feasibility, balancing fidelity to the process while customizing to individuals, encouraging patients to share their priorities with their clinicians, and simplifying the template transmitted to clinicians.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, factorial research survey. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Interns in all specialties; residents in internal medicine, family practice, emergency medicine, psychiatry, and surgery; and attending faculty at an academic medical center. MEASUREMENTS: Survey of demographic, professional, and restraint knowledge items and for each of five distinct vignettes; physician ratings of probability of patient harm and likelihood of ordering restraints. For each, physicians rated probability of patient harm and likelihood of ordering restraint. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine of 246 (77%) surveys were returned. More than half (58%) were men; the median age was 30 (range 25-63), median years experience was 2 (range 0-33), and 60% were U.S. medical school graduates. Mean knowledge score was 68.4% (range 27-100%). Mean likelihood of ordering restraints ranged from 0.6 (not likely) to 9 (absolutely) (overall mean 3.9 +/- 2.2).

DESIGN: Systematic review with narrative analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. PARTICIPANTS: All interventional and observational studies were included, excepting those with fictive cases. Included studies were conducted in adults with and without living wills, excluding individuals with specific psychiatric living wills. MEASUREMENTS: Two authors independently extracted study and participant characteristics and outcomes related to end-of-life care (place of death, hospitalization and intensive care unit management, life-sustaining treatments, restricted care). Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. RESULTS: From 7,596 records identified, 28 observational studies were included, 19 conducted in the United States, 7 in Europe, and 1 each in Canada and Australia. Place of death was assessed in 14 studies, life-sustaining treatments in 13, decision for restricted care in 12, and hospitalization in 8. Risk of bias was serious for 26 studies and moderate for 2. Twenty-one studies reported significantly less medical management for individuals with a living will, 3 reported more medical management, and the difference was not significant in 37. CONCLUSION: Methodological quality of included studies was insufficient to offer reliable results. The effect of living wills appears limited in view of the importance and direction of potential biases. Further studies including larger populations, considering main confounding factors, and documenting the real presence of a living will in medical records are necessary to reach stronger conclusions on the effect of living wills on end-of-life care.

Articles in Section One focus on evidence-based clinical practice and recommendations. Section Two includes articles on original psychosocial and health services research that inform this topic. Papers in this conference were developed in recognition of the greater prevalence and growing incidence of cancer in older adults; the unique geriatric expertise and practice considerations essential to the prevention and control of cancer in older adults; the important and effective roles that PCPs may play in such care; and the need to develop shared care models that foster collaboration between PCPs and oncologists, from cancer prevention through long-term survivorship and end-of-life care of older adults. Models of shared care between oncologists and PCPs should be tested and compared for optimal care of older patients with cancer and their families.

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort study of multimorbid cancer survivors. SETTING: Cancer registries from regional Department of Veterans Affairs networks in New England and southeast Texas. PARTICIPANTS: Multimorbid adults who completed interviews 12 months after diagnosis of head and neck, colorectal, gastric, or esophageal cancer and after cancer treatment (N = 146). MEASUREMENTS: An interdisciplinary team conducted thematic analyses of participants' intuitive responses to two questions: Now that you have had cancer and may face ongoing decisions about medical care in the future, what would you want your family, friends, and doctors to know about you, in terms of what is most important to you in your life? If your cancer were to recur, is there anything you'd want to be sure your loved ones knew about you and your goals of care? RESULTS: Analysis revealed five distinct health-related values that guide how multimorbid cancer survivors conceptualize specific health care goals and medical decisions: self-sufficiency, life enjoyment, connectedness and legacy, balancing quality and length of life, and engagement in care. Participants typically endorsed more than one value as important. CONCLUSION: Older multimorbid adults who recently faced life-threatening cancer endorsed a multidimensional taxonomy of health-related values.

Adults without surrogates are among the most vulnerable in the community and are often alone and estranged from family, neglected and abused, and at risk of receiving inappropriate medical treatment. This article describes the program model and outcomes for the first 2 years of the Wishard Volunteer Advocates Program (WVAP), a guardianship program using trained, supervised volunteers as surrogates for unbefriended, incapacitated individuals. Of the 50 individuals enrolled during the study period, 20 were female, and 39 were Caucasian and 11 African American. Their average age was 67. Nineteen were insured with Medicare as primary and Medicaid as supplementary insurance. Ninety-eight percent had four or more comorbid conditions at the time of the index hospitalization. Before program referral, many lived alone in unsafe conditions. Adult Protective Services was involved in almost half of the cases at the time of the index hospitalization. Approximately half of the participants required some type of property management. Healthcare usage data demonstrated that most were not receiving medical care before WVAP enrollment; the data indicated a decrease in emergency department visits and hospitalization after WVAP enrollment. The WVAP completed Medicaid applications for 12 participants, resulting in $297,481.62 in reimbursement for the index hospitalization and a payer source for subsequent hospitalization and long-term care.

DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups, interactive webinars, and a modified Delphi process. SETTING: Research department within an integrated delivery system. PARTICIPANTS: The webinars and Delphi process included 17 experts in clinical geriatrics and primary care, health policy, quality assessment, health technology, and health system operations. The focus group included 10 individuals aged 70-87 with three to six chronic conditions selected from a random sample of individuals aged 65 and older with three or more chronic medical conditions. MEASUREMENTS: Through webinars and the focus group, input was solicited on constructs representing high-quality care for individuals with MCCs. A working list was created of potential measures representing these constructs. Using a modified Delphi process, experts rated the importance of each possible measure and the feasibility of implementing each measure using EHR data. RESULTS: High-priority constructs reflected processes rather than outcomes of care. High-priority constructs that were potentially feasible to measure included assessing physical function, depression screening, medication reconciliation, annual influenza vaccination, outreach after hospital admission, and documented advance directives. High-priority constructs that were less feasible to measure included goal setting and shared decision-making, identifying drug-drug interactions, assessing social support, timely communication with patients, and other aspects of good customer service. Lower-priority domains included pain assessment, continuity of care, and overuse of screening or laboratory testing.

Keim_2020_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,Patient Factors Linked with Return Acute Healthcare Use in Older Adults by Discharge Disposition,"Keim, Susan K. and Ratcliffe, Sarah J. and Naylor, Mary D. and Bowles, Kathryn H.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: Compare patient characteristics by hospital discharge disposition (home without services, home with home healthcare (HHC) services, or post-acute care (PAC) facilities). Examine timing and rates of 30-day healthcare utilization (rehospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, or observation (OBS) visit) and patient characteristics associated with rehospitalization by discharge location. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of hospital administrative and clinical data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,294 older adult inpatients discharged home with or without HHC services or to a PAC facility. MEASUREMENTS: Patient-level sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Number of and time to occurrences of rehospitalization or ED/OBS visit within 30 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Most rehospitalizations and ED/OBS visits occurred within 14 days from hospital discharge. Patients who returned within 24 hours came mostly from inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). More intense levels of PAC services were linked with higher rehospitalization risk. However, specific predictors differed by discharge location. Being unemployed, being single, and having more comorbidities were most associated with rehospitalization in those who went home with or without services, whereas patients rehospitalized from IRFs were younger, with less chronic illness burden, but greater and recent functional decline. Those discharged with HHC services had more return ED/OBS visits. CONCLUSIONS: Although sicker patients were referred for more intense levels of PAC services, patients with greater chronic illness burden were still most often rehospitalized. In addition to unique patient differences, rehospitalizations from IRF within 24 hours suggest systems factors are contributory. Most return acute healthcare utilization occurred within 14 days; therefore, interventions should focus on smoothing transitions to all discharge locations. Because predictors of rehospitalization risk differed by discharge disposition, future research is necessary to study approaches aimed at matching patients' care needs with the most suitable PAC services at the right time.

DESIGN: Qualitative cross-sectional study. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one veterans age 55 years and older and their surrogates. MEASUREMENTS: In interviews conducted with both the veteran and surrogate, they were asked to discuss their participation in four ACP activities: communication about life-sustaining treatment, communication about views on quality of life, completion of a living will, and appointment of a healthcare proxy. They were asked about barriers to and facilitators of ACP engagement. When they did not agree about engagement, they each provided their perspective on what they believed had or had not occurred. RESULTS: Many of the same barriers to and facilitators of engagement were discussed by both patients and surrogates. These included difficulty thinking about dying, differences in values, and experiences with others that demonstrated the ability of ACP to decrease burden or avoid conflict. Reasons for disagreements in perceptions about whether communication had occurred included surrogates' need for more detailed information, surrogates' lack of readiness to hear what the patient was saying, and surrogates' reliance on what they know about the patient. For some dyads, participation in the study prompted additional communication, resulting in a better shared understanding of ACP engagement. CONCLUSION: Surrogates can both impede and facilitate engagement in ACP, and they can hold different perceptions from patients regarding this engagement. Efforts to promote ACP may be most successful if they assess and address both patients' and surrogates' attitudes and help to facilitate clear communication between them.",2017,10.1111/jgs.14497,65,1,172-178,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,Communication and communication and Connecticut and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Veterans and Interviews as Topic and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and *Advance Care Planning and *Proxy and *Attitude to Death and advance care planning and surrogates,NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

To mitigate the disproportionately high rate of emergency care use by PwD, an understanding of contributing factors driving reliance on emergency care services and identification of feasible alternatives are needed. This study aimed to identify clinician, caregiver, and service providers' views and experiences of unmet needs leading to emergency care use among community-dwelling PwD and alternative ways of addressing these needs. DESIGN: Qualitative, employing semistructured interviews with clinicians, informal caregivers, and aging service providers. SETTING: Wisconsin, United States. PARTICIPANTS: Informal caregivers of PwD (n = 4), emergency medicine physicians (n = 4), primary care physicians (n = 5), geriatric healthcare providers (n = 5), aging service providers (n = 6), and community paramedics (n = 3). MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics of participants and data from semistructured interviews. FINDINGS: Four major themes were identified from interviews: (1) system fragmentation influences emergency care use by PwD, (2) informational, decision-making, and social support needs influence emergency care use by PwD, (3) emergency departments (EDs) are not designed to optimally address PwD and caregiver needs, and (4) options to prevent and address emergency care needs of PwD. CONCLUSION: Participants identified numerous system and individual-level unmet needs and offered many recommendations to prevent or improve ED use by PwD. These novel findings, aggregating the perspectives of multiple dementia-care stakeholder groups, serve as the first step to developing interventions that prevent the need for emergency care or deliver tailored emergency care services to this vulnerable population through new approaches.

SETTING: Residential care homes in the Netherlands (N=16). PARTICIPANTS: Care home residents and community-dwelling adults receiving home care (N=201; n=101 intervention; n=100 control). Participants were 75 years and older, frail, and capable of consenting to participation. INTERVENTION: Adjusted Respecting Choices ACP program. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was change in patient activation (Patient Activation Measure, PAM-13) between baseline and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included change in quality of life (SF-12), advance directive (AD) completion, and surrogate decision-maker appointment. Use of medical care in the 12 months after inclusion was also assessed. Multilevel analyses were performed, controlling for clustering effects and differences in demographics. RESULTS: Seventy-seven intervention participants and 83 controls completed the follow-up assessment. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention (-0.26<c2><b1>11.2) and control group (-1.43<c2><b1>10.6) in change scores of the PAM (p=.43) or the SF-12.

H.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Improving quality and delivery of care for people with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) requires a comprehensive research agenda that encompasses the entire care continuum. Logistical and ethical challenges of informed consent for research participation of persons with ADRD include determination of capacity to consent, surrogate consent when capacity to consent is compromised, timely identification of the legally authorized representative (LAR) providing surrogate consent, and balancing residual autonomy with surrogate consent. Short stays; limited access to patients, caregivers, and LARs; and fluctuating influences of acute illness on capacity determination compound these challenges in the acute care setting. To address these challenges, we worked with the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board to develop a procedural framework for obtaining informed consent from hospitalized individuals with ADRD and their caregivers to participate in a minimal risk care intervention. The framework is specially designed for minimal risk situations in which rapid enrollment is a necessity and uses rapid identification of surrogates to consent for patients who lack legal capacity to make medical decisions, indicated by an activated healthcare power of attorney, and individualized formal assent procedures for patients who lack capacity to consent. These methods were proven effective in facilitating hospital-based recruitment in an ongoing randomized controlled trial and provide a basis for increasing access to acute care clinical research for persons with ADRD. Bolstering research participation through more easily used consent procedures during acute illness is critical to fostering improvements in the delivery of high-quality care to persons with ADRD.

Jr and Barnes, Deborah E. and Shi, Ying and Volow, Aiesha M. and Shim, Janet K. and Alexander, Stewart C. and Sudore, Rebecca L.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A patient-directed, online program (PREPARE for Your Care [PREPARE]; prepareforyourcare.org) has been shown to increase advance care planning (ACP) documentation. However, the mechanisms underlying PREPARE are unknown. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) vs an AD alone to increase active patient participation in ACP discussions during clinic visits and to examine effects of active patient participation on ACP documentation. DESIGN: Audio recordings of postintervention primary care visits from two randomized trials (2013-2016). SETTING: Seven primary care clinics at a veterans affair and safety-net hospital in San Francisco, CA. PARTICIPANTS: English- and Spanish-speaking adults, aged 55 years and older, with two or more chronic/serious conditions. INTERVENTION: PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD or an AD alone. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the number of active patient participation utterances about ACP (eg, asking questions, stating preferences) measured by the validated Active Patient Participation Coding Scheme. We examined differences in utterances by study arm using mixed effects negative binomial models and utterances as a mediator of PREPARE's effect on documentation using adjusted logistic regression. Models were adjusted for health literacy, prior care planning, and clinician. RESULTS: Among 393 participants, the mean (SD) age was 66 (8.1) years, 120 (30.5%) had limited health literacy, and 99 (25.2%) were Spanish speaking. PREPARE plus the AD resulted in 41% more active patient participation in ACP discussions compared with the AD alone (mean [SD] = 10.1 [16.8] vs 6.6 [13.4] utterances; incidence rate ratio = 1.41; 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.98). For every additional utterance, participants had 15% higher odds of ACP documentation, and active patient participation accounted for 16% of PREPARE's effect on documentation. CONCLUSIONS: The PREPARE program and easy-to-read AD empowered patients to actively participate in ACP discussions during clinical visits more than the AD alone. Increased activation was associated with increased ACP documentation. Therefore, PREPARE may mitigate barriers to ACP among English- and Spanish-speaking older adults.

Health and social services professionals are in need of validated tools to assess capacity for self-care and self-protection (SC&P) during initial evaluations of older adults with suspected self-neglect syndrome. Currently, legal and medical declarations of incapacity and guardianship rely on clinical evaluations and instruments developed to assess only decision-making capacity. This article first describes the conceptual and methodological challenges to assessing the capacity to make and execute decisions regarding safe and independent living. Second, the article describes the pragmatic obstacles to developing a screening tool for the capacity for SC&P.

MEASUREMENTS: Capacity to provide informed consent for a hypothetical, but ecologically valid, clinical trial was assessed using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. Neuropsychological functioning was assessed using a comprehensive protocol. RESULTS: Adjusted between-group comparisons yielded significant differences for most decisional capacity indices examined, including Understanding (P=.001; NC>MCI) and Reasoning (P=.002; NC>MCI). Post hoc analyses revealed that participants with MCI who were categorized as capable of providing informed consent according to expert raters had higher levels of education than those who were categorized as incapable. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that many individuals with MCI perform differently on a measure of decisional capacity than their NC peers and that participants with MCI who are incapable of providing informed consent on a hypothetical and complex clinical trial are less educated.

DESIGN: Chart review. SETTING: A regional hospital-based laboratory in the Netherlands between January 2008 and December 2010. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals aged 80 and older with newly ascertained IDA. MEASUREMENTS: IDA was defined as a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL or less and a ferritin level of 25 <ce><bc>g/L or less. RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-one participants were newly diagnosed with IDA during the study period (median age 85.4), 276 of whom (59%) did not undergo any diagnostic procedures for IDA. A cause of anemia was identified during the initial examination in 50% of the 205 investigated participants, including nine (4%) upper and 37 (18%) lower gastrointestinal malignancies. Another 24 malignancies were identified during follow-up, of which 16 were in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in participants for whom the initial diagnostic examination was limited or omitted.

Carrington",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"America's increasingly diverse older population needs clinicians to be familiar with ethnic and cultural issues pertaining to end-of-life care (EOLC). Although there has been some work addressing these issues among African-American, Hispanic-American, and some Asian-American populations, data on the Asian-Indian and Hindu populations remain sparse. This community-based exploratory study surveyed older Indo-Caribbean Hindu people (a subset of the Hindu population living in America) attending a senior center in Queens, New York. This study describes the demographic and health characteristics of this population and examines their attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding some EOLC issues. Data on participants' demographic, medical, psychosocial, and cognitive status were obtained. Previously validated scales were used to collect data on subjects' acculturation, religiosity, and EOLC beliefs.

Subjects were socially connected, moderately acculturated, and religious. Scores on the Ethnicity and Attitudes Towards EOLC Survey indicated negative beliefs about life-sustaining or prolonging technology and positive attitudes about advance care directives (ACDs), truth-telling, and family involvement. The number of ACDs that had been completed and knowledge about ACDs was low. The Indo-Caribbean elder population in this study expressed attitudes and beliefs regarding EOLC similar to those of other ethnic elders.

The study was conducted in a large, urban, long-term care (LTC) facility. Participants were 45 long-term care nurses and 26 terminally ill nursing home residents. Nurses completed an openended interview about their perceptions of the concept of dying with dignity, and the data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. Main themes identified as promoting resident dignity at the EOL included treating them with respect, helping them prepare for the EOL, promoting shared decision-making, and providing high-quality care. The nurses' cultural and religious backgrounds influenced their perceptions of what constitutes dignity-conserving care. Foreign-born nurses stressed the need for EOL rituals, but this was strikingly absent in the statements of U.S.-born nurses. Foreign-born Catholic nurses stated that the dying experience should not be altered using analgesics to relieve suffering or by attempts to hasten death by forgoing curative therapy or by other means. Nurses and terminally ill individuals completed the Dignity Card-sort Tool (DCT). A comparison of the DCT responses of the LTC nurses cohort with those of the terminally ill participants revealed that the nurses felt patient dignity was eroded when patient wishes were not followed and when they were treated without respect.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy older adults (n=75) and patients with amnestic MCI (n=58), mild AD (n=97), and moderate AD (n=31). MEASUREMENTS: The investigators and five study physicians developed a conceptually based, semistructured clinical interview for evaluating seven core financial domains and overall financial capacity (Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for Financial Capacity; SCIFC). For each participant, a physician made capacity judgments (capable, marginally capable, or incapable) for each financial domain and for overall capacity. RESULTS: Study physicians made more than 11,000 capacity judgments across the study sample (N=261). Very good interrater agreement was obtained for the SCIFC judgments. Increasing proportions of marginal and incapable judgment ratings were associated with increasing disease severity across the four study groups. For overall financial capacity, 95% of physician judgments for older controls were rated as capable, compared with 82% for patients with MCI, 26% for patients with mild AD, and 4% for patients with moderate AD. CONCLUSION: Physicians and other clinicians can reliably evaluate financial capacity in cognitively impaired older adults using a relatively brief, semistructured clinical interview.

Zarowitz_2019_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,Navigating the Minefield of QTc Interval-Prolonging Therapy in Nursing Facility Residents,"Zarowitz, Barbara J. and Tisdale, James E.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"BACKGROUND: The exponential increase in the number of medications associated with clinically important prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) places older adults at increased risk of arrhythmias including life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden death. Risk factors, other than age older than 65 years and female sex, include multiple concurrent drugs that prolong QTc and a variety of underlying predisposing conditions. Although electronic medical records and pharmacy dispensing systems can alert clinicians to the risk of QTc-prolonging therapy, more than 95% of safety alerts are overridden, and many systems have deactivated QTc drug interaction alerts. The clinical consequences, magnitude of the effect, mitigation strategies, and recommended monitoring are not well defined for nursing facility (NF) residents. DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING: NFs in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: NF residents. RESULTS: Medications known to prolong QTc include selected anti-infectives, antidepressants, urinary anticholinergics, antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil), used commonly in NFs. Drug-drug interactions are a risk when adding a medication that exaggerates the effect or inhibits the metabolism of a QTc-prolonging medication. The vast majority of patients in whom TdP is induced by noncardiac drugs have risk factors that are easily identifiable. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are provided to improve standardization and use of drug interaction alerts, evaluate the risk of QTc-prolonging drugs in older adults receiving generally lower doses, validate a QTc risk score addressing complex multimorbidity, garner evidence to guide clinical decision making, avail NFs of access to electrocardiograms and interpretive recommendations, and develop standards of practice for hosting risk discussions with residents and their families.

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 65 and older prescribed seven or more medications randomized to receipt of TRIM or usual care (N = 128). INTERVENTION: TRIM extracts information on medications and chronic conditions from the EHR and contains data entry screens for information obtained from brief chart review and telephonic patient assessment. These data serve as input for automated algorithms identifying medication reconciliation discrepancies, potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), and potentially inappropriate regimens. Clinician feedback reports summarize discrepancies and provide recommendations for deprescribing. Patient feedback reports summarize discrepancies and self-reported medication problems. MEASUREMENTS: Primary: subscales of the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC) related to shared decision-making; clinician and patient communication. Secondary: changes in medications. RESULTS: 29.7% of TRIM participants and 15.6% of control participants provided the highest PACIC ratings; this difference was not significant. Adjusting for covariates and clustering of patients within clinicians, TRIM was associated with significantly more-active patient communication and facilitative clinician communication and with more medication-related communication among patients and clinicians. TRIM was significantly associated with correction of medication discrepancies but had no effect on number of medications or reduction in PIMs. CONCLUSION: TRIM improved communication about medications and accuracy of documentation.

Independent factors of unsafe patient behavior (P=.001) and secondary diagnosis of dementia (P=.06) resulted in greater likelihood of ordering restraint, whereas lack of trust in the judgment of the reporting nurse (P=.008) resulted in lower likelihood of ordering restraints. CONCLUSION: Patients' clinical status had less influence on physicians' likelihood of ordering physical restraints than the working relationship with the requesting nurse or the patient's behavior. Interdisciplinary team approaches with active physician input for nonrestraint strategies in the management of patient behavior is emphasized to minimize restraint use.",2010,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02952.x,58,7,1279-1288,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Health Status and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Sex Factors and Risk Factors and Health Care Surveys and Age Factors and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Physicians/*psychology and *Restraint, Physical/instrumentation/statistics & numerical data and Dangerous Behavior and Mental Disorders/complications/psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2010/07//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nicosia_2019_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,Making Function Part of the Conversation: Clinician Perspectives on Measuring Functional Status in Primary Care,"Nicosia, Francesca M. and Spar, Malena J. and Steinman, Michael A. and Lee, Sei J. and Brown, Rebecca T.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: Although there is increasing interest in using functional status to guide clinical decision making, function is seldom routinely assessed in primary care. We explored clinician perspectives on barriers and facilitators to routine measurement of older adults' functional status in primary care settings. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. SETTING: Primary care and geriatrics clinics at six Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four primary care providers, including 17 from primary care clinics and 7 from geriatrics clinics. MEASUREMENTS: We conducted interviews to elicit clinician perspectives about functional status measurement, including barriers and facilitators to routine assessment. We analyzed transcripts iteratively using a hybrid inductive and deductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Interviews revealed three distinct aspects to measuring function: screening and assessment, documentation, and use of data to inform care. Barriers and facilitators to screening and assessment included time availability, clinic processes, and degree of interdisciplinary environment. Barriers and facilitators to documentation included the usability and integration of electronic instruments into workflows and the availability of a standardized location to document function in the electronic medical record. Barriers and facilitators to use of data included the availability of a standardized location to retrieve data on function, the availability of appropriate referrals and services, and provider knowledge of available resources to address functional impairments. To address these barriers, providers emphasized the critical importance of connecting measurement of function directly to improved patient care. CONCLUSION: Although clinicians emphasized the importance of measuring function, they also cautioned against additional workload burdens, cumbersome electronic documentation, and measurement of function without ensuring that these data are used to improve care. Approaches to functional status measurement must address these barriers to improve care and outcomes for older adults.

O.Toole_2009_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,The role of primary care physicians in advanced cancer care: perspectives of older patients and their oncologists,"O'Toole, Elizabeth and Step, Mary M. and Engelhardt, Kathryn and Lewis, Steven and Rose, Julia Hannum",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To examine data from advanced cancer patients and their oncologists regarding patient age-related differences in patient and oncologist perspectives on involvement of primary care physicians (PCPs) in aspects of cancer management. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of a support intervention for patients with late-stage cancer treated in two teaching hospital-based cancer clinics caring for underserved populations. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred fifty-seven patients who had an oncologist and PCP enrolled 2 to 3 months after an advanced cancer diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic data and structured interviews were used to assess patients' perceptions of PCP involvement in care discussions and decision-making and satisfaction with that involvement, oncologists' beliefs about how involved PCPs should be in these discussions and decisions, and their shared care practices. RESULTS: Older patients (>or=65) were more likely to have a PCP (P=.02). Patients reported a broad range of perceived PCP involvement and satisfaction with that involvement. Greater involvement was associated with greater satisfaction (P<.001). Half of oncologists reported themselves as PCP for more than 25% of their patients. Approximately half of oncologists reported that more older than younger patients had PCPs, yet only 20% reported differences in PCP involvement or in their communication with PCPs for older late-stage patients. CONCLUSION: Results support involvement of PCPs in advanced cancer care and demonstrate variable perspectives on PCP involvement. Matching patient preferences and practices may improve satisfaction. Clarification of elements in the partnership between patients, PCPs, and oncologists will inform efforts to optimally care for older patients with advanced cancer.",2009,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2009.02508.x,57 Suppl 2,NA,268-S265,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Age Factors and Neoplasm Staging and *Primary Health Care and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Medical Oncology and *Patient Preference and *Physician's Role and Advance Care Planning/*organization & administration and Neoplasms/pathology/therapy",NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Cross sectional. SETTING: Clalit Health Services (CHS), Israel's largest health maintenance organization (HMO), provides care for more than half of the country's population and operates a national age-based programs for cancer screening. PARTICIPANTS: All community-dwelling members aged 65 to 79 in 2014 (N = 370,876). MEASUREMENTS: We used CHS data warehouse to evaluate cancer screening during 2014. Life expectancy (LE) was estimated using the validated Schonberg index. RESULTS: Almost one-quarter (23.1%; 15.6% of adults aged 65-74, 42.7% of adults aged 75-79) of the study population had an estimated LE of less than 10 years. Annual fecal occult blood test and biannual mammography rates among adults aged 65 to 74 with a LE of 10 years or longer were 37.1% and 70.0%, respectively. Rates dropped after age 75 (4.0%, 19.5%) and to a lesser extent with a LE of less than 10 years (31.6%, 56.4%). Prostate-specific antigen testing is not part of the national screening program, and the proportion of people tested (42.6%), did not vary similarly with age of 75 and older (43.2%) or LE of less than 10 years (38.1%). CONCLUSION: The cancer screening inclusion criteria of the national referral system have a strong effect on receipt of screening; LE considerations are less influential. Some method of estimating LE could be incorporated into algorithms to improve individualized cancer screening to reduce over- and underscreening of older adults.",2017,10.1111/jgs.15035,65,11,2539-2544,eng,1532-5415 0002-8614,"Humans and Female and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis and *Patient Preference and Neoplasms/*diagnosis and *Life Expectancy and Israel and early detection of cancer and Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data and life expectancy and medical overuse and Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data and Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis and community health planning",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,J Am Geriatr Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Observational study of a representative sample of older inpatients; duplicate assessments conducted on a subsample by independent assessors to examine interrater reliability. SETTING: Acute medical, acute geriatric and orthopedic units in 13 hospitals in nine countries. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-three patients aged 70 and older (mean age 82.4, range 70-102) with an anticipated stay of 48 hours or longer of whom 161 received duplicate assessments. MEASUREMENTS: Sixty-two clinical items across 11 domains. Premorbid (3-day observation period before onset of the acute illness) and admission (the first 24 hours of hospital stay) assessments were conducted. RESULTS: The frequency of deficits exceeded 30% for most items, ranging from 1% for physically abusive behavior to 86% for the need for support in activities of daily living after discharge. Common deficits were in cognitive skills for daily decision-making (38% premorbid, 54% at admission), personal hygiene (37%, 65%), and walking (39%, 71%). Interrater reliability was substantial in the premorbid period (average kappa=0.61) and admission period (average kappa=0.66). Of the 69 items tested, less than moderate agreement (kappa<0.4) was recorded for six (9%), moderate agreement (kappa=0.41-0.6) for 14 (20%), substantial agreement (kappa=0.61-0.8) for 40 (58%), and almost perfect agreement (kappa>0.8) for nine (13%).

We describe end-of-life care preferences and acute care and hospice use in the last 6 months of life for persons enrolled in a comprehensive dementia care management program. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort. SETTING: Urban, academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 322 persons enrolled in dementia care management after July 1, 2012, who died before July 1, 2016. INTERVENTION: Dementia care comanagement model using nurse practitioners partnered with primary care providers and community organizations to provide comprehensive dementia care, including advance care planning. MEASUREMENTS: Advance care preferences, use of Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST), hospice enrollment, and hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits in the last 6 months of life obtained from electronic health record data. RESULTS: Nearly all decedents (99.7%, N = 321) had a goals-of-care conversation documented (median = 3 conversations; interquartile range = 2-4 conversations), and 64% had advance care preferences recorded. Among those with recorded preferences, 88% indicated do not resuscitate, 48% limited medical interventions, and 35% chose comfort-focused care. Most patients (89%) specified limited artificial nutrition, including withholding feeding tubes. Over half (54%) had no hospitalizations or ED visits in the last 6 months of life, and intensive care unit stays were rare (5% of decedents). Overall, 69% died on hospice. Decedents who had completed a POLST were more likely to die in hospice care (74% vs 62%; P = .03) and die at home (70% vs 59%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Enrollees in a comprehensive dementia care comanagement program had high engagement in advance care planning, high rates of hospice use, and low acute care utilization near the end of life. Wider implementation of such programs may improve end-of-life care for persons with dementia.

Wesley",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the reliability and sustainability of delirium and sedation measurements of bedside intensive care unit (ICU) nurses. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred ten ICU patients from 2007 to 2010; 627 bedside nurses. MEASUREMENTS: Bedside nurses and well-trained reference-rater research nurses independently measured delirium and sedation levels in routine care. Bedside nurses were instructed to use the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) every 12 hours to measure delirium and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) every 4 hours to measure sedation. CAM-ICU and RASS assessment agreement were computed using weighted kappa statistics across the entire population and subgroups (e.g., ICU type). Sensitivity and specificity of bedside nurse identification of delirium were calculated to understand sources of discordance. RESULTS: Six thousand one hundred ninety-eight CAM-ICU and 6,880 RASS measurement pairs obtained on 3,846 patient-days. For CAM-ICU measurements, agreement between bedside and research nurses was substantial (weighted kappa = 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-0.70) and stable over 3 years of data collection. RASS measures also demonstrated substantial agreement (weighted kappa = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.64-0.68), which was stable across all years of data collection. The sensitivity of delirium nurse assessments was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.78-0.83), and the specificity was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.78-0.85).

Liu_2016_JoofthAmGeSo,JOUR,Association Between Hospital Admission Risk Profile Score and Skilled Nursing or Acute Rehabilitation Facility Discharges in Hospitalized Older Adults,"Liu, Stephen K. and Montgomery, Justin and Yan, Yu and Mecchella, John N. and Bartels, Stephen J. and Masutani, Rebecca and Batsis, John A.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the Hospital Admission Risk Profile (HARP) score is associated with skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation facility discharge after an acute hospitalization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient unit of a rural academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized individuals aged 70 and older from October 1, 2013 to June 1, 2014. MEASUREMENTS: Participant age at the time of admission, modified Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score, and self-reported instrumental activities of daily living 2 weeks before admission were used to calculate HARP score. The primary predictor was HARP score, and the primary outcome was discharge disposition (home, facility, deceased). Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the association between HARP score and discharge disposition, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and length of stay. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-eight individuals admitted from home were screened and their HARP scores were categorized as low (n = 162, 37.8%), intermediate (n = 157, 36.7%), or high (n = 109, 25.5%). Participants with high HARP scores were significantly more likely to be discharged to a facility (55%) than those with low HARP scores (20%) (P < .001). After adjustment, participants with high HARP scores were more than four times as likely as those with low scores to be discharged to a facility (odds ratio = 4.58, 95% confidence interval = 2.42-8.66). CONCLUSION: In a population of older hospitalized adults, HARP score (using readily available admission information) identifies individuals at greater risk of skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation facility discharge.

Little is known about the performance of standard cardiovascular risk factors in older adults. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk model, as well as the underlying cardiovascular risk factors, among adults older than 65 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort derived from a regional referral system's electronic medical records. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 25 349 patients who were 65 years or older at study baseline (date of the first outpatient lipid panel taken between 2007 and 2010). MEASUREMENTS: Exposures of interest were traditional cardiovascular risk factors, as defined by inclusion in the PCE model. The primary outcome was major ASCVD events, defined as a composite of myocardial infarctions, stroke, and cardiovascular death. RESULTS: The PCE and internally estimated models produced similar risk distributions for white men aged 65 to 74 years. For all other groups, PCE predictions were generally lower than those of the internal models, particularly for African Americans. Discrimination of the PCE was poor for all age groups, with concordance index (95% confidence interval) estimates of 0.62 (0.60-0.64), 0.56 (0.54-0.57), and 0.52 (0.49-0.54) among patients aged 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, respectively. Reestimating relationships within these age groups resulted in better calibration but negligible improvements in discrimination. Blood pressure, total cholesterol, and diabetes either were not associated at all or had inverse associations in the older age groups. CONCLUSION: Traditional clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease failed to accurately characterize risk in a contemporary population of Medicare-aged patients. Among those aged 85 years and older, some traditional risk factors were not associated with ASCVD events. Better risk models are needed to appropriately inform treatment decision making for the growing population of older adults.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial-Lipid-Lowering Trial (ALLHAT-LLT). SETTING: Ambulatory setting. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older (mean aged 71, 49% female) free of cardiovascular disease (N=2,867). INTERVENTION: Pravastatin 40 mg/d (n=1,467) versus usual care (n=1,400). MEASUREMENTS: We estimated the difference in RMST for total and coronary heart disease (CHD)-free survival between the pravastatin and usual care groups over the 6-year trial period and used parametric survival models to estimate RMST differences projected over 10 years. RESULTS: Over 6 years, individuals treated with pravastatin lived (RMST 2,008.1 days), on average, 33.7 fewer days than those receiving usual care (RMST 2,041.8 days) (difference -33.7 days, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-67.0 to -0.5 days, p=.047). Pravastatin-treated individuals lived RMST 2,088.1 days), on average, 18.7 more days free of CHD over 6 years than those receiving usual care (RMST 2,069.4 days), but this difference was not statistically significant (difference 18.7 days, 95% CI=-10.4-47.8 days, p=.21). The 10-year projection showed that pravastatin-treated individuals would live 108.1 fewer days (95% CI=-204.5 to -14.1, p=.03) than those receiving usual care, although treated individuals would gain 77.9 days (95% CI=3.8-159.6, p=.046) of CHD-free survival. CONCLUSION: RMST provides an intuitive and explicit way to express the effect of pravastatin therapy on CHD-free and overall survival in older adults free of cardiovascular disease.
