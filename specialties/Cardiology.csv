Problems with timing, efficiency, and missed diagnoses occur at all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is dependent on robust data; the application of appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its clinical application to image segmentation, automated measurements, and eventually, automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at the stages of image acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making. Moreover, the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging, combined with ""big data"" from the electronic health record and pathology, is likely to better characterize disease and personalize therapy.

Rogers_2019_NatureviCard,JOUR,Cardiovascular calcification: artificial intelligence and big data accelerate mechanistic discovery,"Rogers, Maximillian A. and Aikawa, Elena",Nature reviews. Cardiology,"Cardiovascular calcification is a health disorder with increasing prevalence and high morbidity and mortality. The only available therapeutic options for calcific vascular and valvular heart disease are invasive transcatheter procedures or surgeries that do not fully address the wide spectrum of these conditions; therefore, an urgent need exists for medical options. Cardiovascular calcification is an active process, which provides a potential opportunity for effective therapeutic targeting. Numerous biological processes are involved in calcific disease, including matrix remodelling, transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, calcium and phosphate signalling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid and mineral metabolism, autophagy, inflammation, apoptosis, loss of mineralization inhibition, impaired mineral resorption, cellular senescence and extracellular vesicles that act as precursors of microcalcification. Advances in molecular imaging and big data technology, including in multiomics and network medicine, and the integration of these approaches are helping to provide a more comprehensive map of human disease. In this Review, we discuss ectopic calcification processes in the cardiovascular system, with an emphasis on emerging mechanistic knowledge obtained through patient data and advances in imaging methods, experimental models and multiomics-generated big data. We also highlight the potential and challenges of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning to integrate imaging and mechanistic data for drug discovery.",2019,10.1038/s41569-018-0123-8,16,5,261-274,eng,1759-5010 1759-5002,Humans and *Artificial Intelligence and *Big Data and *Calcinosis/diagnosis/metabolism and *Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/metabolism and *Molecular Imaging/methods/trends and Cardiovascular System/diagnostic imaging/metabolism,NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Nat Rev Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research. METHODS AND RESULTS: We sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium. We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills. Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency. In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.g. linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.g. human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.g. DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics. In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health. CONCLUSION: High volumes of inherently diverse ('big') EHR data are beginning to disrupt the nature of cardiovascular research and care.

With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities.

Its increasing prevalence in aging societies constitutes a growing challenge to global healthcare systems. Despite substantial unmet needs in AF prevention and treatment, drug developments hitherto have been challenging, and the current pharmaceutical pipeline is nearly empty. In this review, we argue that current drugs for AF are inadequate because of an oversimplified system for patient classification and the development of drugs that do not interdict underlying disease mechanisms. We posit that an improved understanding of AF molecular pathophysiology related to the continuous identification of novel disease-modifying drug targets and an increased appreciation of patient heterogeneity provide a new framework to personalize AF drug development.

The public health dimension of AF motivates research in modifiable AF risk factors and improved precision in AF prediction and management. In this review, we summarize current knowledge in an attempt to untangle these multifaceted associations from an epidemiological perspective. We discuss disease trends, preventive opportunities offered by underlying risk factors and concomitant disorders, current developments in diagnosis and risk prediction, and prognostic implications of AF and its complications. Finally, we review current technological (eg, eHealth) and methodological (artificial intelligence) advances and their relevance for future prevention and disease management.",2020,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316340,127,1,20-4,eng,1524-4571 0009-7330,artificial intelligence and Humans and Artificial Intelligence and atrial fibrillation and risk factors and incidence and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control and prevalence and Preventive Health Services/methods/trends,NA,NA,2020/06/19/,Circ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditionally, most risk models have been based on regression models. While useful and robust, these statistical methods are limited to using a small number of predictors which operate in the same way on everyone, and uniformly throughout their range. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the use of machine-learning methods for development of risk prediction models. Typically presented as black box approaches, most machine-learning methods are aimed at solving particular challenges that arise in data analysis that are not well addressed by typical regression approaches. To illustrate these challenges, as well as how different methods can address them, we consider trying to predicting mortality after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. We use data derived from our institution's electronic health record and abstract data on 13 regularly measured laboratory markers. We walk through different challenges that arise in modelling these data and then introduce different machine-learning approaches. Finally, we discuss general issues in the application of machine-learning methods including tuning parameters, loss functions, variable importance, and missing data.

Cardiology,"The advent of coronary angiography in the 1960s allowed for the risk stratification of patients with stable angina. Patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease have an increased risk of death related to the large amount of myocardium supplied by this vessel. Although coronary angiography remains the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of left main coronary artery stenosis, this technique has important limitations. Angiograms of the left main coronary artery segment can be difficult to interpret, and almost one-third of patients can be misclassified when fractional flow reserve is used as the reference. In patients with clinically significant unprotected left main coronary artery disease, surgical revascularization was shown to improve survival compared with medical therapy and has been regarded as the treatment of choice for unprotected left main coronary artery disease. Two large-scale clinical trials published in 2016 support the usefulness of catheter-based revascularization in selected patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease.

By contrast, evidence - particularly from clinical trials - supporting the use of revascularization to improve clinical outcomes in stable CAD is in some important respects outdated in that it reflects therapies that predate both contemporary standards for optimal medical therapy and current revascularization techniques and technologies. Despite such limitations, these clinical trials still provide the foundation for many of the current guideline-based indications for coronary revascularization in patients with stable CAD.

Most of the concepts, methods, and standards for measuring QOL were derived from psychometrics, but the degree to which current tools adhere to these methods varies greatly. Despite the importance of QOL, patient-reported outcomes are not measured in most cardiovascular clinical trials. Lack of familiarity with QOL measures and their interpretation, and unrealistic expectations about the information these measures can provide, are obstacles to their use. Large clinical trials of revascularization therapy for coronary artery disease and medical treatments for heart failure show small-to-moderate QOL effects, primarily detected with disease-specific instruments. Larger treatment effects, seen in trials of device therapy for heart failure and ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation, have been detected with both generic and disease-specific instruments.

New tools will be needed for describing the cardiovascular health status of individuals and populations, including 'omic' data, exposome and social determinants of health, the microbiome, behaviours and motivations, patient-generated data, and the array of data in electronic medical records. Cardiovascular specialists can build on their experience and use precision medicine to facilitate discovery science and improve the efficiency of clinical research, with the goal of providing more precise information to improve the health of individuals and populations. Overcoming the barriers to implementing precision medicine will require addressing a range of technical and sociopolitical issues. Health care under precision medicine will become a more integrated, dynamic system, in which patients are no longer a passive entity on whom measurements are made, but instead are central stakeholders who contribute data and participate actively in shared decision-making.

We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection. METHODS: Using 14 035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. RESULTS: Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15% to 17% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5%, n=419, and 9.0%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively.

Patient-reported outcomes can improve the quality of patient care by creating a holistic approach to clinical decision-making; however, PROs are not routinely used as key outcome measures in major cardiovascular clinical trials. Thus, limited information is available on the impact of cardiovascular therapeutics on PROs to guide patient-level clinical decision-making or policy-level decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: Identify PAH immune phenotypes based on unsupervised analysis of blood proteomic profiles. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective observational study of group 1 PAH patients evaluated at Stanford University (discovery cohort; n=281) and University of Sheffield (validation cohort; n=104) between 2008 and 2014, we measured a circulating proteomic panel of 48 cytokines, chemokines, and factors using multiplex immunoassay. Unsupervised machine learning (consensus clustering) was applied in both cohorts independently to classify patients into proteomic immune clusters, without guidance from clinical features. To identify central proteins in each cluster, we performed partial correlation network analysis. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were subsequently compared across clusters. Four PAH clusters with distinct proteomic immune profiles were identified in the discovery cohort. Cluster 2 (n=109) had low cytokine levels similar to controls. Other clusters had unique sets of upregulated proteins central to immune networks-cluster 1 (n=58; TRAIL [tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand], CCL5 [C-C motif chemokine ligand 5], CCL7, CCL4, MIF [macrophage migration inhibitory factor]), cluster 3 (n=77; IL [interleukin]-12, IL-17, IL-10, IL-7, VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor]), and cluster 4 (n=37; IL-8, IL-4, PDGF-<ce><b2> [platelet-derived growth factor beta], IL-6, CCL11). Demographics, PAH clinical subtypes, comorbidities, and medications were similar across clusters.

Professional medical associations such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) support these obligations. In Europe, the costs of continuing medical education (CME) are insufficiently supported from governments and employers; however, medical associations have been criticized for accepting alternative financial support from industry. Medical education and training in research include learning how to assess the quality and reliability of any information. There is some risk of bias in any form of scientific communication including intellectual, professional, and financial and it is essential that in particular, the latter must be acknowledged by full disclosure. It is essential that there is strong collaboration between basic and clinical researchers from academic institutions on the one hand, with engineers and scientists from the research divisions of device and pharmaceutical companies on the other. This is vital so that new diagnostic methods and treatments are developed. Promotion of advances by industry may accelerate their implementation into clinical practice.

METHODS AND RESULTS: CT angiography (Dual Source CT, Somatom Definition, Siemens Medical Systems, Forchheim, Germany) was performed in 60 consecutive patients [51 men, median age 64 (57-70) years] scheduled for elective coronary angiography. Both techniques were used to evaluate the presence of CAD, significant stenosis, and the need for revascularization therapy. Sensitivity and specificity for the presence of significant stenosis were: per segment (n = 766) 62% (95% CI 50-72) (64/104) and 79% (95% CI 74-84) (526/662), respectively; per patient (n = 60) 100% (95% CI 91-100) (38/38) and 45% (95% CI 24-68) (10/22), respectively.

BACKGROUND: AUC have been developed to guide utilization of noninvasive imaging for individuals with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The effect of a point-of-order AUC-DST on rates of appropriateness and clinical decision making has not been examined. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study evaluating physicians who ordered CAD imaging tests for consecutive patients insured by 1 large private payer. During an 8-month study period, each study site was granted exemption from prior authorization requirements by radiology benefits managers. An AUC-DST was employed to determine appropriateness ratings for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), stress echocardiography (STE), or coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA), as well as intended downstream testing and therapy. RESULTS: One hundred physicians used the AUC-DST for 472 patients (age 55.6 <c2><b1> 9.6 years, 61% male, 52% prior known CAD) over 8 months for MPS (72%), STE (24%), and CCTA (5%). The AUC-DST required an average of 137 <c2><b1> 360 s to determine the appropriateness category that, by American College of Cardiology AUC, was considered appropriate in 241 (51%), uncertain in 96 (20%), inappropriate in 85 (18%), and not addressed in 50 (11%). For tests ordered in the first 2 months compared with the last 2 months, appropriate tests increased from 49% to 61% (p = 0.02), whereas inappropriate tests decreased from 22% to 6% (p < 0.001). During this period, intended changes in medical therapy increased from 11% to 32% (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A point-of-order AUC-DST enabled rapid determination of test appropriateness for CAD evaluation and was associated with increased and decreased testing for appropriate and inappropriate indications, respectively.

In the initial document, 180 clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, extent of medical therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, and coronary anatomy. This update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios the writing group felt to be affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. The methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document, and the definition of appropriateness was unchanged. The technical panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate and likely to improve patients' health outcomes or survival. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate revascularization is considered inappropriate and unlikely to improve health outcomes or survival. Scores in the mid-range (4 to 6) indicate a clinical scenario for which the likelihood that coronary revascularization will improve health outcomes or survival is uncertain. In general, as seen with the prior AUC, the use of coronary revascularization for patients with acute coronary syndromes and combinations of significant symptoms and/or ischemia is appropriate. In contrast, revascularization of asymptomatic patients or patients with low-risk findings on noninvasive testing and minimal medical therapy are viewed less favorably. The technical panel felt that based on recent studies, coronary artery bypass grafting remains an appropriate method of revascularization for patients with high burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally,percutaneous coronary intervention may have a role in revascularization of patients with high burden of CAD. The primary objective of the appropriate use criteria is to improve physician decision making and patient education regarding expected benefits from revascularization and to guide future research.",2012,10.1016/j.jacc.2011.12.001,59,9,857-881,eng,1558-3597 0735-1097,"United States and Humans and Decision Making and Advisory Committees and American Heart Association and Societies, Medical and *Cardiac Imaging Techniques and Cardiology/*standards and Coronary Disease/diagnosis/*surgery and Myocardial Revascularization/methods/*standards",NA,NA,2012/02/28/,J Am Coll Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

The MIDA Score was derived from the MIDA-Flail-Registry (2472 patients with DMR and flail leaflet-Derivation Cohort) by weighting all guideline-provided prognostic markers, and externally validated in the MIDA-BNP-Registry (1194 patients with DMR and flail leaflet/prolapse-Validation Cohort). The MIDA Score ranged from 0 to 12 depending on accumulating risk factors. In predicting total mortality post-diagnosis, the MIDA Score showed excellent concordance both in Derivation Cohort (c = 0.78) and Validation Cohort (c = 0.81). In the whole MIDA population (n = 3666 patients), 1-year mortality with Scores 0, 7-8, and 11-12 was 0.4, 17, and 48% under medical management and 1, 7, and 14% after surgery, respectively (P < 0.001).

Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient's values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Our understanding of their mechanistic and genetic similarities has led to their improved clinical management. However, our inability to prevent diLQTS has resulted in removal of many medicines from the market and from development. Genetic and clinical risk factors for diLQTS and TdP are well known and raise the possibility of TdP prevention. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can scan the patient's electronic health records for clinical risk factors predictive of diLQTS and warn when a drug that can cause TdP is prescribed.

Meier_2016_Eurohearjour,JOUR,"Interventional cardiology, where real life and science do not necessarily meet","Meier, Bernhard",European heart journal,"Evidence-based diagnosis, decision-making, and therapy appear a must these days. Generating and publishing evidence is a tedious job according to ever new and tightened research practice regulations. Rules will never prevent the typical human behaviour from showing the new thing to be shinier and the old thing dustier than they really are. The medical community is solicited to concoct a meal that is gullible for patients, authorities, and third-party payers out of the available evidence (after applying some conversion factors correcting the common bias of the researchers), anticipation of what will be the evidence tomorrow, common sense, and digested experience. Examples of misguidance by poorly produced or misinterpreted evidence are plentiful in interventional cardiology as they are in other disciplines. Coronary stents, for instance, were first underestimated due to the fact that they were generally used in bailout situations where the outcome remained rather dismal in spite of the salvaging potential of stents. Then they were overused quite uncritically rather to the detriment of the patient. Now with the high quality of the modern drug-eluting stents (DESs), the overuse persists but is no longer a concern. However, the enhanced potential of DESs compared with bare-metal stents was poorly exploited for >10 years because of reports that slipped through the meshes of good review and publication practice to convey the untenable message that bare-metal stents were preferable in many situations. As other examples, use of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) for decision-making has to be questioned despite prominently published reports recommending it. Fixing a lesion is today easier and hardly more complication prone than assessing it with the FFR. Closure of the patent foramen ovale may never be properly applied, because the collection of the understandably requested evidence takes decades, a follow-up duration that makes research unattractive to physicians and financiers. Transarterial aortic valve replacement, finally, is certain to eventually supplant surgical aortic valve replacement. However, this should have already been accomplished as a logical progress. The adoption of this remarkable breakthrough technology is slowed down by the quest for providing randomized evidence in patients, for whom the evidence should rather be derived from already existing studies, and by the quest to triage all these patients in a heart team, meaning to also keep the surgeons happy, although these patients do not really need them.",2016,10.1093/eurheartj/ehw220,37,26,2014-2019,eng,1522-9645 0195-668X,"Humans and Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary and Stents and Drug-Eluting Stents and *Cardiovascular Diseases and *Coronary angioplasty and *Coronary stenting and *Interventional cardiology and *Publication bias and *Scientific rigour",NA,NA,2016/07/07/,Eur Heart J,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Mosseveld, Mees and Moorman, Peter W. and van der Lei, Johan",Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Indirect evidence shows that alerting users with clinical decision support systems seems to change behavior more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However, randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. We studied the effect of both alerting and on-demand decision support with respect to screening and treatment of dyslipidemia based on the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a clustered randomized trial design, 38 Dutch general practices (77 physicians) and 87,886 of their patients (39,433 men 18 to 70 years of age and 48,453 women 18 to 75 years of age) who used the ELIAS electronic health record participated. Each practice was assigned to receive alerts, on-demand support, or no intervention. We measured the percentage of patients screened and treated after 12 months of follow-up. In the alerting group, 65% of the patients requiring screening were screened (relative risk versus control=1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 2.20) compared with 35% of patients in the on-demand group (relative risk versus control=1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.68) and 25% of patients in the control group.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A mixed-methods educational needs assessment was performed. Following a qualitative phase (interviews), an online survey was undertaken using three case scenarios (asymptomatic severe primary MR, symptomatic severe primary MR in the elderly, and severe secondary MR) in 115 primary care physicians (PCPs), and 439 cardiologists or cardiac surgeons from seven European countries. Systematic cardiac auscultation was performed by only 54% of clinicians in asymptomatic patients. Cardiologists appropriately interpreted echocardiographic assessment of mechanism and quantification of primary MR (<e2><89><a5>75%), but only 44% recognized secondary MR as severe. In asymptomatic severe primary MR with an indication for surgery, 27% of PCPs did not refer the patient to a cardiologist and medical therapy was overused by 19% of cardiologists. In the elderly patient with severe symptomatic primary MR, 72% of cardiologists considered mitral intervention (transcatheter edge-to-edge valve repair in 72%). In severe symptomatic secondary MR, optimization of medical therapy was advised by only 51% of PCPs and 33% of cardiologists, and surgery considered in 30% of cases (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in 64%). CONCLUSION: Systematic auscultation is underused by PCPs for the early detection of MR. Medical therapy is overused in primary MR and underused in secondary MR.

However, revascularization when FFR is 0.76 to 0.80, within the so-called gray zone, is still debatable. METHODS AND RESULTS: From February 1997 to June 2013, all patients with single-segment disease and an FFR value within the gray zone or within the 2 neighboring FFR strata (0.70-0.75 and 0.81-0.85) were included. Study end points consisted of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, and any revascularization) up to 5 years. Of 17 380 FFR measurements, 1459 patients were included. Of them, 449 patients were treated with revascularization and 1010 patients were treated with medical therapy. In the gray zone, the major adverse cardiovascular events rate was similar (37 [13.9%] versus 21 [11.2%], respectively; P=0.3) between medical therapy and revascularization, whereas a strong trend toward a higher rate of death or myocardial infarction (25 [9.4] versus 9 [4.8], P=0.06) and overall death (20 [7.5] versus 6 [3.2], P=0.059) was observed in the medical therapy group. Among medical therapy patients, a significant step-up increase in major adverse cardiovascular events rate was observed across the 3 FFR strata, especially with proximal lesion location.

Clinical and demographic data, ECG parameters, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and selected laboratory markers where collected and included in deep learning (DL) algorithms. Specific DL-models were built based on raw data to categorize diagnostic group, disease complexity, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. In addition, models were developed to estimate need for discussion at multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and to gauge prognosis of individual patients. Overall, the DL-algorithms-based on over 44 000 medical records-categorized diagnosis, disease complexity, and NYHA class with an accuracy of 91.1%, 97.0%, and 90.6%, respectively in the test sample.

The clinical scenarios were developed to mimic common situations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, extent of medical therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, and coronary anatomy. Approximately 180 clinical scenarios were developed by a writing committee and scored by a separate technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization was considered appropriate and likely to improve health outcomes or survival. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate revascularization was considered inappropriate and unlikely to improve health outcomes or survival. The mid range (4 to 6) indicates a clinical scenario for which the likelihood that coronary revascularization would improve health outcomes or survival was considered uncertain. For the majority of the clinical scenarios, the panel only considered the appropriateness of revascularization irrespective of whether this was accomplished by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In a select subgroup of clinical scenarios in which revascularization is generally considered appropriate, the appropriateness of PCI and CABG individually as the primary mode of revascularization was considered. In general, the use of coronary revascularization for patients with acute coronary syndromes and combinations of significant symptoms and/or ischemia was viewed favorably.

We aimed to assess whether the introduction of individual operator specific outcome reporting after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the UK was associated with a change in patient risk factor profiles, procedural management, or 30-day mortality outcomes in a large cohort of consecutive patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was an observational cohort study of 123 780 consecutive PCI procedures from the Pan-London (UK) PCI registry, from January 2005 to December 2015. Outcomes were compared pre- (2005-11) and post- (2011-15) public reporting including the use of an interrupted time series analysis. Patients treated after public reporting was introduced were older and had more complex medical problems. Despite this, reported in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events rates were significantly lower after the introduction of public reporting (2.3 vs. 2.7%, P < 0.0001). Interrupted time series analysis demonstrated evidence of a reduction in 30-day mortality rates after the introduction of public reporting, which was over and above the existing trend in mortality before the introduction of public outcome reporting (35% decrease relative risk 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.77; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The introduction of public reporting has been associated with an improvement in outcomes after PCI in this data set, without evidence of risk-averse behaviour. However, the lower reported complication rates might suggest a change in operator behaviour and decision-making confirming the need for continued surveillance of the impact of public reporting on outcomes and operator behaviour.",2019,10.1093/eurheartj/ehz152,40,31,2620-2629,eng,1522-9645 0195-668X,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Case-Control Studies and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Registries and Outcomes and United Kingdom/epidemiology and Hospital Mortality/trends and Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Percutaneous coronary intervention and Quality Improvement/standards and Acute Coronary Syndrome/diagnosis/*surgery and Angina, Stable/diagnosis/*surgery and Cardiologists/*psychology and Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/mortality and Cerebrovascular Disorders/epidemiology/mortality and Interrupted Time Series Analysis/*methods and Mandatory Reporting/ethics and Patient Care Management/ethics/*statistics & numerical data and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/adverse effects/mortality/statistics & numerical data and Professional Misconduct/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/08/14/,Eur Heart J,NA,NA,NA,NA

Morton_2010_Eurohearjour,JOUR,Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to guide complex revascularization in stable coronary artery disease,"Morton, Geraint and Schuster, Andreas and Perera, Divaka and Nagel, Eike",European heart journal,"Coronary revascularization has been a cornerstone of the management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) for many years. Both coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention have evolved and improved over time such that increasingly complex and challenging cases can now be tackled with a high degree of procedural success. In parallel with this, there have been major advances in medical therapy for CAD. Consequently, one of the main decisions in the contemporary management of stable CAD concerns which patients and lesions should be revascularized. This is particularly true for patients with complex disease such as multivessel disease or those with left ventricular impairment. Such patients will potentially benefit the most but are also at highest risk of complications and it is therefore important that they are carefully selected. Recent major trials have challenged the conventional view that consideration of coronary anatomy alone is sufficient in this decision-making. An accumulating body of evidence underscores the importance of functional investigations when assessing the potential benefits of revascularization in these complex patients. In parallel with these developments, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has matured into a robust technology that is able to measure many of the parameters required to accurately characterize these patients. This article will review the importance of myocardial viability and ischaemia when selecting patients with stable CAD for revascularization, the use of CMR imaging for assessing this pathophysiology, and planning complex revascularization, and finally give an outlook on how CMR may help address some important outstanding clinical questions.",2010,10.1093/eurheartj/ehq256,31,18,2209-2215,eng,1522-9645 0195-668X,"Humans and Magnetic Resonance Angiography and Myocardial Revascularization/*methods and Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/methods and Coronary Artery Disease/pathology/*therapy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional and Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/pathology/therapy",NA,NA,2010/09//undefined,Eur Heart J,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is not known whether this approach enables the highest impact science. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to conduct an observational analysis of percentile rankings and bibliometric outcomes for a contemporary set of funded NHLBI cardiovascular R01 grants. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 1492 investigator-initiated de novo R01 grant applications that were funded between 2001 and 2008 and followed their progress for linked publications and citations to those publications. Our coprimary end points were citations received per million dollars of funding, citations obtained <2 years of publication, and 2-year citations for each grant's maximally cited paper. In 7654 grant-years of funding that generated $3004 million of total National Institutes of Health awards, the portfolio yielded 16 793 publications that appeared between 2001 and 2012 (median per grant, 8; 25th and 75th percentiles, 4 and 14; range, 0-123), which received 2 224 255 citations (median per grant, 1048; 25th and 75th percentiles, 492 and 1932; range, 0-16 295).

Over the past 2 decades, technological advancements have resulted in the emergence of miniaturized handheld ultrasound equipment that is compact and battery operated, and handheld echocardiography can be readily performed at the point of care with reasonable image quality. The simplicity of use, availability at the patient's bedside, easy transportability, and relatively low cost have encouraged physicians to use these devices for prompt medical decision making. As a consequence, the use of handheld echocardiography is on the rise even among nonechocardiographers (intensivists, emergency care physicians, internists, and medical students). One of the real utilities of ultrasound-augmented clinical diagnosis is in evaluating patients efficiently and selecting patients for appropriate downstream diagnostic testing including comprehensive echocardiography. Although clinical evidence supports the use of handheld devices in various clinical settings and by different users, proficiency in point-of-care ultrasound requires dedicated training in both performance and interpretation.

We assessed the interrelation of patient-clinician communication factors to determine their independent associations with hypertension control in diabetes care. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 566 older adults with diabetes mellitus and hypertension at the DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Tex. Clinical and pharmacy data were collected, and a patient questionnaire was sent to all participants. A total of 212 individuals returned surveys. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of patient characteristics, self-management behaviors, and communication factors on hypertension control. Three communication factors had significant associations with hypertension control. Two factors, patients' endorsement of a shared decision-making style (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.57) and proactive communication with one's clinician about abnormal results of blood pressure self-monitoring (odds ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 3.26), had direct, independent associations in multivariate regression. Path analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of communication factors and hypertension control. Decision-making style (beta=0.20, P<0.01) and proactive communication (beta=0.50, P<0.0001) again demonstrated direct effects on hypertension control. A third factor, clinicians' use of collaborative communication when setting treatment goals, had a total effect on hypertension control of 0.16 (P<0.05) through its direct effects on decision-making style (beta=0.28, P<0.001) and proactive communication (beta=0.22, P<0.01).

However, the relationship between LF and outcome remains unclear as data on normal reference values defining LF are scarce, and previous studies did not explore the risk associated with other SVi cut-points. We analysed the relationship between LF and mortality in severe AS to establish prognostic LF values associated with mortality risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 1450 consecutive patients with severe AS (aortic valve area <1 cm2 and/or <0.6 cm2/m2) and preserved LVEF and 1645 controls with normal echocardiograms. Patients were stratified in three groups: (i) SVi > 35 mL/m2 or SV > 70 mL; (ii) SVi 30-35 mL/m2 or SV 55-70 mL; and (iii) SVi < 30 mL/m2 or SV < 55 mL. Mortality with medical and surgical management was analysed. Five-year survival was low for SVi < 30 mL/m2 and SV < 55 mL compared to the other groups (all P-values <0.001). After adjustment for outcome predictors, including aortic valve replacement, mortality risk was considerable with SVi < 30 mL/m2 vs. >35 mL/m2 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.60 (1.17-2.18)] and SV < 55 mL vs. >70 mL [adjusted HR 1.84 (1.32-2.58)]. Similar mortality risk was observed for SVi 30-35 mL/m2 vs. >35 mL/m2 [adjusted HR 1.05 (0.78-1.41)], and for SV 55-70 mL vs. >70 mL [adjusted HR 1.22 (0.94-1.58)]. The prognostic impact of SVi < 30 mL/m2 and SV < 55 mL was consistent in subgroups, including asymptomatic patients and patients with low-gradient severe AS.

The clinical scenarios were developed to mimic common situations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, extent of medical therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, and coronary anatomy. Approximately 180 clinical scenarios were developed by a writing committee and scored by a separate technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization was considered appropriate and likely to improve health outcomes or survival. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate revascularization was considered inappropriate and unlikely to improve health outcomes or survival. The mid range (4 to 6) indicates a clinical scenario for which the likelihood that coronary revascularization would improve health outcomes or survival was considered uncertain. For the majority of the clinical scenarios, the panel only considered the appropriateness of revascularization irrespective of whether this was accomplished by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In a select subgroup of clinical scenarios in which revascularization is generally considered appropriate, the appropriateness of PCI and CABG individually as the primary mode of revascularization was considered.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to reappraise the association of HDL-C level with CV and non-CV mortality using a ""big data"" approach. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted using the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) dataset, which was created by linking together 17 different individual-level data sources. People were included if they were between 40 and 105 years old on January 1, 2008, living in Ontario, Canada, without previous CV conditions or severe comorbidities, and had an outpatient fasting cholesterol measurement in the year prior to the inception date.

All mortalities were checked against the Social Security Death Index. Survival curves were derived with Kaplan-Meier methods; hazard ratios were calculated with the Cox proportional hazard model; and propensity score matching was used to account for differences in patient selection. RESULTS: Among the 973 CABG and 2255 PCI patients, Kaplan-Meier major adverse cardiac event-free survival curves demonstrated a significant benefit for antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and <ce><b2>-blocker therapy in both the CABG and PCI groups (P=0.001 for all 3 medications). Cox regression identified compliance with optimal medical therapy as a more powerful predictor of major adverse cardiac event-free survival than choice of therapy (hazard ratio for noncompliance=2.79; 95% confidence limits, 2.19-3.54; P<0.001; hazard ratio for PCI versus CABG=1.68, 95% confidence limits, 138-2.04; P<0.001). In propensity-matched patients, CABG outcomes were superior to PCI outcomes in patients nonadherent to optimal medical therapy (P=0.001) but were not different in patients adherent to optimal medical therapy (P=0.574). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of coronary revascularization strategy, medication adherence has a dramatic effect on long-term outcome. Among comparable patients who adhere to optimal medical therapy, outcomes of PCI and CABG may not differ; however, among nonadherent patients, CABG affords better major adverse cardiac event-free survival. Therefore, patient compliance with medical therapy may inform clinical decision making and should be incorporated into all future comparative studies of comparative coronary revascularization strategies.",2016,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.021183,134,17,1238-1246,eng,1524-4539 0009-7322,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Risk Factors and Disease-Free Survival and Follow-Up Studies and Survival Rate and *Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and *Patient Compliance and drug therapy and coronary artery disease and percutaneous coronary intervention and *Coronary Artery Bypass and coronary artery bypass and Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction/*mortality/*surgery,NA,NA,2016/10/25/,Circulation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Diagnostic catheterization may include several different procedure components. The indications developed focused primarily on 2 aspects of diagnostic catheterization. Many indications focused on the performance of coronary angiography for the detection of coronary artery disease with other procedure components (e.g., hemodynamic measurements, ventriculography) at the discretion of the operator. The majority of the remaining indications focused on hemodynamic measurements to evaluate valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and other conditions, with the use of coronary angiography at the discretion of the operator.

Michael and Michler, Robert E. and Lee, Kerry L. and Yii, Michael and Leng, Chua Yeow and Zembala, Marian and Rouleau, Jean L. and Daly, Richard C. and Al-Khalidi, Hussein R.",Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, ischemic heart failure, and coronary artery disease suitable for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at higher risk for surgical morbidity and mortality. Paradoxically, those patients with the most severe coronary artery disease and ventricular dysfunction who derive the greatest clinical benefit from CABG are also at the greatest operative risk, which makes decision making regarding whether to proceed to surgery difficult in such patients. To better inform such decision making, we analyzed the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) CABG population for detailed information on perioperative risk and outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In both STICH trials (hypotheses), 2136 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <e2><89><a4>35% and coronary artery disease were allocated to medical therapy, CABG plus medical therapy, or CABG with surgical ventricular reconstruction. Relationships of baseline characteristics and operative conduct with morbidity and mortality at 30 days were evaluated. There were a total of 1460 patients randomized to and receiving surgery, and 346 (<e2><89><88>25%) of these high-risk patients developed a severe complication within 30 days. Worsening renal insufficiency, cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and ventricular arrhythmias were the most frequent complications and those most commonly associated with death. Mortality at 30 days was 5.1% and was generally preceded by a serious complication (65 of 74 deaths). Left ventricular size, renal dysfunction, advanced age, and atrial fibrillation/flutter were significant preoperative predictors of mortality within 30 days. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was the only independent surgical variable predictive of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CABG can be performed with relatively low 30-day mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Serious postoperative complications occurred in nearly 1 in 4 patients and were associated with mortality. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an established biomarker for prognostication and treatment in heart failure. The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of NT-proBNP beyond the SYNTAX score II (SSII), and its association with long-term outcome after three strategies [percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and medical therapy (MT)] in a cohort of patients with 3VD. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 6597 patients with available baseline NT-proBNP data were included in the study. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Secondary endpoints included cardiac death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. During a median follow-up of 7.0 years, higher NT-proBNP levels were strongly associated with increased risks of all-cause death, cardiac death, and MACCE (all adjusted P < 0.01). Moreover, NT-proBNP significantly improved discrimination and reclassification of the SSII. Notably, there was a significant interaction between NT-proBNP quartiles and treatment strategies for MACCE (P = 0.004). Revascularization was associated with lower risks of MACCE than MT, except for patients in the lowest quartile wherein no such association was observed. Among patients in the highest quartile, PCI was associated with an increased risk of MACCE compared with CABG (hazard ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.87).

BACKGROUND: Left atrial enlargement is a consequence of organic MR, but its association with clinical outcome independently of MR severity is uncertain. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 492 patients (age 63 +/- 15 years, 60% men) in sinus rhythm with organic MR (regurgitant volume 68 +/- 42 ml/beat) and performed at baseline triple echocardiographic quantitation (MR severity, LA volume, and left ventricular characteristics). Outcome with medical and surgical management was analyzed. RESULTS: Left atrial volume indexed to body surface area (LA index) was 55 +/- 26 ml/m(2) (<40 ml/m(2) in 158 patients, 40 to 59 ml/m(2) in 160 patients, and > or =60 ml/m(2) in 174 patients). Under medical management, 5-year survival was 80 +/- 2.9% and cardiac events 28 +/- 3%. Adjusting for established predictors of outcome, LA index was independently associated with survival after diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 1.5] per 10 ml/m(2) increment, p = 0.001). Patients with LA index > or =60 ml/m(2) had lower 5-year survival than those with no or mild LA enlargement (p < 0.0001) and than the rates of survival expected in the U.S. population (53 +/- 8.6% vs. 76%, p = 0.017). Compared with patients with LA index <40 ml/m(2), those with LA index > or =60 ml/m(2) had increased mortality (HR: 2.8 [95% CI: 1.2 to 6.5], p = 0.016) and cardiac events (HR: 5.2 [95% CI: 2.6 to 10.9], p < 0.0001) with medical management. Mitral surgery was associated with decreased mortality (HR: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.26 to 0.84], p = 0.01) and cardiac events (HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.23 to 0.62], p = 0.0001) and after surgery patients with LA index > or =60 ml/m(2) versus <60 ml/m(2) did not incur excess mortality or cardiac events (both p > 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: In organic MR, LA index at diagnosis predicts long-term outcome, incrementally to known predictors of outcome. This marker of risk is particularly important because mitral surgery in these patients markedly improves outcome and restores life expectancy. LA index should be measured in routine clinical practice for risk-stratification and for clinical decision making in patients with organic MR.",2010,10.1016/j.jacc.2010.02.059,56,7,570-578,eng,1558-3597 0735-1097,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Aged and Risk Factors and Predictive Value of Tests and Severity of Illness Index and Ultrasonography and Organ Size and Heart Atria/diagnostic imaging/*pathology and Mitral Valve Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/*pathology,NA,NA,2010/08/10/,J Am Coll Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article briefly reviews the concept of health status measures, with a focus on their interpretation. It then discusses both the rationale and potential applications of health status measures in clinical care. Health status measures are not surrogate measures of outcome but rather highly meaningful outcomes of care. As such, they have important emerging roles as outcomes in clinical trials, as tools for monitoring patients in routine clinical care, as a mechanism for operationalizing and evaluating disease management programs, and as tools for quality assessment/improvement. Over time, it is expected that health status measures will also have an increasingly important role in patient-centered medical decision making.

BACKGROUND: The international STICH trial seeks to define the role of cardiac surgery for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Baseline characteristics of 2,136 randomized STICH patients were entered into a multivariate equation created using the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases to predict their 5-year risk for death without cardiac surgery. Patients ordered by increasing predicted risk were assigned to 1 of 32 risk at randomization (RAR) groups created to share one-thirty-second of total predicted deaths. Numbers of patients sharing the same RAR group were compared between higher and lower enrolling site groupings and for countries tending to enroll high- or low-risk patients. RESULTS: Country of enrollment was a stronger determinant of risk diversity than site enrollment performance among patients enrolled at 127 sites in 26 countries. Mean RAR differences among countries ranged from 9.4 (Singapore) to 18.6 (Germany). However, 1,614 of 2,136 patients (76%) from countries enrolling lower-risk patients shared the same RAR group with patients from countries enrolling higher-risk patients. Baseline characteristics responsible for risk differences of patients enrolled in the 2 country groupings were sufficiently similar to exert little influence on clinical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: STICH randomized patients are characterized by a continuous spectrum of risk, without discordant dominance from any site or country. Clinical site diversity promises to enhance the generalization of STICH trial results to a broad population of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Boden_2007_JoofthAmCoofCa,JOUR,Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a comprehensive review of contemporary management options,"Boden, William E. and Eagle, Kim and Granger, Christopher B.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"There are an estimated 500,000 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) events in the U.S. annually. Despite improvements in care, up to one-third of patients presenting with STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset still receive no reperfusion therapy acutely. Clinical studies indicate that speed of reperfusion after infarct onset may be more important than whether pharmacologic or mechanical intervention is used. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), when performed rapidly at high-volume centers, generally has superior efficacy to fibrinolysis, although fibrinolysis may be more suitable for many patients as an initial reperfusion strategy. Because up to 70% of STEMI patients present to hospitals without on-site PCI facilities, and prolonged door-to-balloon times due to inevitable transport delays commonly limit the benefit of PCI, the continued role and importance of the prompt, early use of fibrinolytic therapy may be underappreciated. Logistical complexities such as triage or transportation delays must be considered when a reperfusion strategy is selected, because prompt fibrinolysis may achieve greater benefit, especially if the fibrinolytic-to-PCI time delay associated with transfer exceeds approximately 1 h. Selection of a fibrinolytic requires consideration of several factors, including ease of dosing and combination with adjunctive therapies. Careful attention to these variables is critical to ensuring safe and rapid reperfusion, particularly in the prehospital setting. The emerging modality of pharmacoinvasive therapy, although controversial, seeks to combine the benefits of mechanical and pharmacologic reperfusion.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In all, 6838 patients without CS on admission and treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI), included in the Observatoire Regional Breton sur l'Infarctus (ORBI), served as a derivation cohort, and 2208 patients included in the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Cote-d'Or (RICO) constituted the external validation cohort. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used to build the score. Eleven variables were independently associated with the development of in-hospital CS: age >70 years, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack, cardiac arrest upon admission, anterior STEMI, first medical contact-to-pPCI delay >90 min, Killip class, heart rate >90/min, a combination of systolic blood pressure <125 mmHg and pulse pressure <45 mmHg, glycaemia >10 mmol/L, culprit lesion of the left main coronary artery, and post-pPCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade <3. The score derived from these variables allowed the classification of patients into four risk categories: low (0-7), low-to-intermediate (8-10), intermediate-to-high (11-12), and high (<e2><89><a5>13). Observed in-hospital CS rates were 1.3%, 6.6%, 11.7%, and 31.8%, across the four risk categories, respectively.

Siu_2010_JoofthAmCoofCa,JOUR,Bicuspid aortic valve disease,"Siu, Samuel C. and Silversides, Candice K.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac defect. While the BAV can be found in isolation, it is often associated with other congenital cardiac lesions. The most frequent associated finding is dilation of the proximal ascending aorta secondary to abnormalities of the aortic media. Changes in the aortic media are present independent of whether the valve is functionally normal, stenotic, or incompetent. Although symptoms often manifest in adulthood, there is a wide spectrum of presentations ranging from severe disease detected in utero to asymptomatic disease in old age. Complications can include aortic valve stenosis or incompetence, endocarditis, aortic aneurysm formation, and aortic dissection. Despite the potential complications, 2 large contemporary series have demonstrated that life expectancy in adults with BAV disease is not shortened when compared with the general population. Because BAV is a disease of both the valve and the aorta, surgical decision making is more complicated, and many undergoing aortic valve replacement will also need aortic root surgery. With or without surgery, patients with BAV require continued surveillance. Recent studies have improved our understanding of the genetics, the pathobiology, and the clinical course of the disease, but questions are still unanswered. In the future, medical treatment strategies and timing of interventions will likely be refined.

BACKGROUND: We previously showed that the Z(va) is superior to standard indexes of AS severity in estimating the global hemodynamic load faced by the left ventricle (LV) and predicting the occurrence of LV dysfunction. This index is calculated by dividing the estimated LV systolic pressure (systolic arterial pressure + mean transvalvular gradient) by the stroke volume indexed for the body surface area. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and echocardiographic data of 544 consecutive patients having at least moderate AS (aortic jet velocity > or =2.5 m.s(-1)) and no symptoms at baseline. The primary end point for this study was the overall mortality regardless of the realization of aortic valve replacement (AVR). RESULTS: Four-year survival was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the patients with a baseline Z(va) > or =4.5 mm Hg x ml(-1) x m(2) (65 +/- 5%) compared with those with Z(va) between 3.5 and 4.5 mm Hg x ml(-1) x m(2) (78 +/- 4%) and those with Z(va) < or =3.5 mm Hg x ml(-1) x m(2) (88 +/- 3%). The risk of mortality was increased by 2.76-fold in patients with Z(va) > or =4.5 mm Hg x ml(-1) x m(2) and by 2.30-fold in those with a Z(va) between 3.5 and 4.5 mm Hg x ml(-1) x m(2) after adjusting for other risk factors and type of treatment (surgical vs. medical). CONCLUSIONS: Increased Z(va) is a marker of excessive LV hemodynamic load, and a value >3.5 successfully identifies patients with a poor outcome. These findings suggest that beyond standard indexes of stenosis severity, the consideration of Z(va) may be useful to improve risk stratification and clinical decision making in patients with AS.",2009,10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.079,54,11,1003-1011,eng,1558-3597 0735-1097,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Cohort Studies and Prognosis and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Stroke Volume/*physiology and Ventricular Function, Left/*physiology and Aortic Valve Stenosis/*diagnosis/mortality/*physiopathology and Blood Flow Velocity and Vascular Resistance/*physiology and Ventricular Pressure/*physiology",NA,NA,2009/09/08/,J Am Coll Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older patients typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a detailed review of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older patients. We found that there is a pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision making in older patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as a paucity of data on the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on key outcomes that are particularly important to older patients, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older patients representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older patients in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older patients, thereby enhancing patient-centered evidence-based care of older people with cardiovascular disease in the United States and around the world.",2016,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000380,133,21,2103-2122,eng,1524-4539 0009-7322,"stroke and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Risk Factors and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Aged, 80 and over and heart failure and elderly and AHA Scientific Statements and United States/epidemiology and Societies, Medical/*standards and Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy and Patient Care/*standards and Geriatrics/*standards and Cardiology/*standards and *American Heart Association and heart rhythm disorders and non-cardiac surgery and valvular heart disease",NA,NA,2016/05/24/,Circulation,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Optimal decision making regarding warfarin use for atrial fibrillation requires estimation of hemorrhage risk. METHODS: We followed up 9,186 patients with atrial fibrillation contributing 32,888 person-years of follow-up on warfarin, obtaining data from clinical databases and validating hemorrhage events using medical record review. We used Cox regression models to develop a hemorrhage risk stratification score, selecting candidate variables using bootstrapping approaches. The final model was internally validated by split-sample testing and compared with 6 published hemorrhage risk schemes. RESULTS: We observed 461 first major hemorrhages during follow-up (1.4% annually). Five independent variables were included in the final model and weighted by regression coefficients: anemia (3 points), severe renal disease (e.g., glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min or dialysis-dependent, 3 points), age <e2><89><a5>75 years (2 points), prior bleeding (1 point), and hypertension (1 point). Major hemorrhage rates ranged from 0.4% (0 points) to 17.3% per year (10 points). Collapsed into a 3-category risk score, major hemorrhage rates were 0.8% for low risk (0 to 3 points), 2.6% for intermediate risk (4 points), and 5.8% for high risk (5 to 10 points). The c-index for the continuous risk score was 0.74 and 0.69 for the 3-category score, higher than in the other risk schemes. There was net reclassification improvement versus all 6 comparators (from 27% to 56%). CONCLUSIONS: A simple 5-variable risk score was effective in quantifying the risk of warfarin-associated hemorrhage in a large community-based cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation.",2011,10.1016/j.jacc.2011.03.031,58,4,395-401,eng,1558-3597 0735-1097,Humans and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Aged and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Predictive Value of Tests and Hemorrhage/*chemically induced and Anticoagulants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use and Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy and Warfarin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use,NA,NA,2011/07/19/,J Am Coll Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

In prior coronary revascularization AUC documents, indications for revascularization in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable ischemic heart disease were combined into 1 document. To address the expanding clinical indications for coronary revascularization, and in an effort to align the subject matter with the most current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, the new AUC for coronary artery revascularization were separated into 2 documents addressing ACS and stable ischemic heart disease individually. This document presents the AUC for ACS. Clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, presence of clinical instability or ongoing ischemic symptoms, prior reperfusion therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, fractional flow reserve testing, and coronary anatomy. This update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios that the writing group felt to be affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. The methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document but employs the recent modifications in the methods for developing AUC, most notably, alterations in the nomenclature for appropriate use categorization. A separate, independent rating panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate for the clinical scenario presented. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate that revascularization is considered rarely appropriate for the clinical scenario, whereas scores in the mid-range (4 to 6) indicate that coronary revascularization may be appropriate for the clinical scenario. Seventeen clinical scenarios were developed by a writing committee and scored by the rating panel: 10 were identified as appropriate, 6 as may be appropriate, and 1 as rarely appropriate. As seen with the prior coronary revascularization AUC, revascularization in clinical scenarios with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were considered appropriate. Likewise, clinical scenarios with unstable angina and intermediate- or high-risk features were deemed appropriate. Additionally, the management of nonculprit artery disease and the timing of revascularization are now also rated. The primary objective of the AUC is to provide a framework for the assessment of practice patterns that will hopefully improve physician decision making.",2017,10.1016/j.jacc.2016.10.034,69,5,570-591,eng,1558-3597 0735-1097,Humans and Advisory Committees and Patient Selection and imaging and coronary revascularization and Myocardial Revascularization/*methods and ACC Appropriate Use Criteria and Acute Coronary Syndrome/etiology/surgery/*therapy and Coronary Artery Disease/complications/surgery/*therapy and medical therapy and multimodality,NA,NA,2017/02/07/,J Am Coll Cardiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Without novel approaches to improve prescribing, the cumulative benefits of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction treatment will be largely unrealized. Direct-to-consumer marketing and shared decision making reflect a culture where patients are increasingly involved in treatment choices, creating opportunities for prescribing interventions that engage patients. METHODS: The EPIC-HF (Electronically Delivered, Patient-Activation Tool for Intensification of Medications for Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial randomized patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction from a diverse health system to usual care versus patient activation tools-a 3-minute video and 1-page checklist-delivered electronically 1 week before, 3 days before, and 24 hours before a cardiology clinic visit. The tools encouraged patients to work collaboratively with their clinicians to ""make one positive change"" in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction prescribing. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with GDMT medication initiations and dose intensifications from immediately preceding the cardiology clinic visit to 30 days after, compared with usual care during the same period. RESULTS: EPIC-HF enrolled 306 patients, 290 of whom attended a clinic visit during the study period: 145 were sent the patient activation tools and 145 were controls. The median age of patients was 65 years; 29% were female, 11% were Black, 7% were Hispanic, and the median ejection fraction was 32%. Preclinic data revealed significant GDMT opportunities, with no patients on target doses of <ce><b2>-blocker, sacubitril/valsartan, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. From immediately preceding the cardiology clinic visit to 30 days after, 49.0% in the intervention and 29.7% in the control experienced an initiation or intensification of their GDMT (P=0.001). The majority of these changes were made at the clinician encounter itself and involved dose uptitrations. There were no deaths and no significant differences in hospitalization or emergency department visits at 30 days between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A patient activation tool delivered electronically before a cardiology clinic visit improved clinician intensification of GDMT.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the association of DBP and RHR with all-cause mortality in patients with AR. METHODS: Consecutive patients with <e2><89><a5> moderate to severe AR were retrospectively identified from 2006 to 2017. The association between all-cause mortality and routinely measured DBP and RHR was examined. RESULTS: Of 820 patients (age 59 <c2><b1> 17 years; 82% men) followed for 5.5 <c2><b1> 3.5 years, 104 died under medical management, and 400 underwent aortic valve surgery (AVS). Age, symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-systolic diameter-index (LVESDi), DBP, and RHR were univariable predictors of all-cause mortality (all p <e2><89><a4> 0.002). When adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and surgical triggers (symptoms, LVEF, and LVESDi), baseline DBP (adjusted-hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79 [95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.94] per 10 mm Hg increase, p = 0.009) and baseline RHR (adjusted HR: 1.23 [95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.45] per 10 beat per min [bpm] increase, p = 0.01) were independently associated with all-cause mortality. These associations persisted after adjustment for presence of hypertension, medications, time-dependent AVS, and using average DBP and RHR (all p <e2><89><a4> 0.02). Compared with the general population, patients with AR exhibited excess mortality (relative risk of death >1), which rose steeply in inverse proportion (p nonlinearity = 0.002) to DBP starting at 70 mm Hg and peaking at 55 mm Hg and in direct proportion to RHR starting at 60 bpm. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic hemodynamically significant AR, routinely measured DBP and RHR demonstrate a robust association with all-cause death, independent of demographics, comorbidities, guideline-based surgical triggers, presence of hypertension, and use of medications.

BACKGROUND: In CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial), the largest randomized trial of carotid revascularization to date, there was no significant difference in the primary composite endpoint, but rates of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) differed between CAS and CEA. To help guide individualized clinical decision making, we compared HRQOL among patients enrolled in the CREST study. We also performed exploratory analyses to evaluate the association between periprocedural complications and HRQOL. METHODS: We measured HRQOL at baseline, and after 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 year among 2,502 patients randomly assigned to either CAS or CEA in the CREST study. The HRQOL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and 6 disease-specific scales designed to study HRQOL in patients undergoing carotid revascularization. RESULTS: At both 2 weeks and 1 month, CAS patients had better outcomes for multiple components of the SF-36, with large differences for role physical function, pain, and the physical component summary scale (all p < 0.01). On the disease-specific scales, CAS patients reported less difficulty with driving, eating/swallowing, neck pain, and headaches but more difficulty with walking and leg pain (all p < 0.05). However, by 1 year, there were no differences in any HRQOL measure between CAS and CEA. In the exploratory analyses, periprocedural stroke was associated with poorer 1-year HRQOL across all SF-36 domains, but periprocedural MI or cranial nerve palsy were not. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing carotid revascularization, CAS is associated with better HRQOL during the early recovery period as compared with CEA-particularly with regard to physical limitations and pain-but these differences diminish over time and are not evident after 1 year. Although CAS and CEA are associated with similar overall HRQOL at 1 year, event-specific analyses confirm that stroke has a greater and more sustained impact on HRQOL than MI.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Registre Francais de la FFR (R3F) investigated 1075 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic angiography including an FFR investigation at 20 French centers. Investigators were asked to define prospectively their revascularization strategy a priori based on angiography before performing the FFR. The final revascularization strategy, reclassification of the strategy by FFR, and 1-year clinical follow-up were prospectively recorded. The strategy a priori based on angiography was medical therapy in 55% and revascularization in 45% (percutaneous coronary intervention, 38%; coronary artery bypass surgery, 7%). Patients were treated according to FFR in 1028/1075 (95.7%). The applied strategy after FFR was medical therapy in 58% and revascularization in 42% (percutaneous coronary intervention, 32%; coronary artery bypass surgery, 10%). The final strategy applied differed from the strategy a priori in 43% of cases: in 33% of a priori medical patients, in 56% of patients undergoing a priori percutaneous coronary intervention, and in 51% of patients undergoing a priori coronary artery bypass surgery. In reclassified patients treated based on FFR and in disagreement with the angiography-based a priori decision (n=464), the 1-year outcome (major cardiac event, 11.2%) was as good as in patients in whom final applied strategy concurred with the angiography-based a priori decision (n=611; major cardiac event, 11.9%; log-rank, P=0.78). At 1 year, >93% patients were asymptomatic without difference between reclassified and nonreclassified patients (Generalized Linear Mixed Model, P=0.75).

We sought to validate an atrioventricular valve index (AVVI) (left atrioventricular valve area/total atrioventricular valve area, centimeters squared) as a discriminator of balanced and unbalanced forms of complete AVSD and to characterize the association of AVVI with surgical strategies and outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Diagnostic echocardiograms and hospital records of 356 infants with complete AVSD at 4 Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society (CHSS) institutions (2000-2006) were reviewed and AVVI measured (n=315). Patients were classified as unbalanced if AVVI<e2><89><a4>0.4 (right dominant) or <e2><89><a5>0.6 (left dominant). Surgical strategy and outcomes were examined across the range of AVVI. Competing risks analysis until the time of commitment to a surgical strategy examined 4 end states: biventricular repair (BVR), univentricular repair (UVR), pulmonary artery banding (PAB), and death before surgery. A prediction nomogram for surgical strategy based on AVVI was developed. The majority of patients had balanced AVSD (0.4<AVVI<0.6) and underwent BVR. Patients with AVVI<0.19 uniformly underwent UVR. Heterogeneous repair strategies were found when 0.19<e2><89><a4>AVVI<e2><89><a4>0.39 (UVR and BVR), with a disproportionate number of deaths in this range. AVVI<e2><89><a5>0.6 (left dominant) was less common.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The SYNTAX II study is a multicenter, all-comers, open-label, single arm study that investigated the impact of a contemporary PCI strategy on clinical outcomes in patients with 3VD in 22 centres from four European countries. The SYNTAX-II strategy includes: heart team decision-making utilizing the SYNTAX Score II (a clinical tool combining anatomical and clinical factors), coronary physiology guided revascularisation, implantation of thin strut bioresorbable-polymer drug-eluting stents, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guided stent implantation, contemporary chronic total occlusion revascularisation techniques and guideline-directed medical therapy. The rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE [composite of all-cause death, cerebrovascular event, any myocardial infarction and any revascularisation]) at one year was compared to a predefined PCI cohort from the original SYNTAX-I trial selected on the basis of equipoise 4-year mortality between CABG and PCI. As an exploratory endpoint, comparisons were made with the historical CABG cohort of the original SYNTAX-I trial. Overall 708 patients were screened and discussed within the heart team; 454 patients were deemed appropriate to undergo PCI. At one year, the SYNTAX-II strategy was superior to the equipoise-derived SYNTAX-I PCI cohort (MACCE SYNTAX-II 10.6% vs. SYNTAX-I 17.4%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39-0.85, P = 0.006). This difference was driven by a significant reduction in the incidence of MI (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.70, P = 0.007) and revascularisation (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37-0.9, P = 0.015). Rates of all-cause death (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.27-1.73, P = 0.43) and stroke (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.10-4.89, P = 0.71) were similar. The rate of definite stent thrombosis was significantly lower in SYNTAX-II (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.97, P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: At one year, clinical outcomes with the SYNTAX-II strategy were associated with improved clinical results compared to the PCI performed in comparable patients from the original SYNTAX-I trial.

Sports-related and clinical data were obtained by phone interview and medical records. Follow-up occurred every 6 months. ICD shock data and clinical outcomes were adjudicated by 2 electrophysiologists. Median age was 33 years (89 subjects <20 years of age); 33% were female. Sixty were competitive athletes (varsity/junior varsity/traveling team). A pre-ICD history of ventricular arrhythmia was present in 42%. Running, basketball, and soccer were the most common sports. Over a median 31-month (interquartile range, 21-46 months) follow-up, there were no occurrences of either primary end point-death or resuscitated arrest or arrhythmia- or shock-related injury-during sports. There were 49 shocks in 37 participants (10% of study population) during competition/practice, 39 shocks in 29 participants (8%) during other physical activity, and 33 shocks in 24 participants (6%) at rest. In 8 ventricular arrhythmia episodes (device defined), multiple shocks were received: 1 at rest, 4 during competition/practice, and 3 during other physical activity. Ultimately, the ICD terminated all episodes. Freedom from lead malfunction was 97% at 5 years (from implantation) and 90% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Many athletes with ICDs can engage in vigorous and competitive sports without physical injury or failure to terminate the arrhythmia despite the occurrence of both inappropriate and appropriate shocks. These data provide a basis for more informed physician and patient decision making in terms of sports participation for athletes with ICDs.",2013,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000447,127,20,2021-2030,eng,1524-4539 0009-7322,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Internationality and *Registries and sports and *Athletes and Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & control and defibrillators, implantable and Defibrillators, Implantable/adverse effects/*standards and Sports/*standards",NA,NA,2013/05/21/,Circulation,NA,NA,NA,NA

We estimate a long-term survival model using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. METHODS AND RESULTS: The final study cohort included 348 341 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting patients aged <e2><89><a5>65 years, discharged between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2007, from 917 Society of Thoracic Surgeons-participating hospitals, randomly divided into training (n=174 506) and validation (n=173 835) samples. Through linkage with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data, we ascertained vital status from date of surgery through December 31, 2008 (1- to 6-year follow-up). Because the proportional hazards assumption was violated, we fit 4 Cox regression models conditional on being alive at the beginning of the following intervals: 0 to 30 days, 31 to 180 days, 181 days to 2 years, and >2 years. Kaplan-Meier-estimated mortality was 3.2% at 30 days, 6.4% at 180 days, 8.1% at 1 year, and 23.3% at 3 years of follow-up. Harrell's C statistic for predicting overall survival time was 0.732. Some risk factors (eg, emergency status, shock, reoperation) were strong predictors of short-term outcome but, for early survivors, became nonsignificant within 2 years. The adverse impact of some other risk factors (eg, dialysis-dependent renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) continued to increase.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether left atrial volume index (LAVI) measured in routine clinical practice of multiple sonographers/cardiologists is associated independently with DMR survival. METHODS: A cohort of 5,769 (63 <c2><b1> 16 years, 47% women) consecutive patients with degenerative mitral valve disease, in whom LAVI was prospectively measured, was enrolled and the long-term survival was analyzed. RESULTS: LAVI (43 <c2><b1> 24 ml/m(2)) was widely distributed (<40 ml/m(2) in 3,154 patients, 40 to 59 ml/m(2) in 1,606, and <e2><89><a5>60 ml/m(2) in 1,009). Overall survival throughout follow-up (10-year 66 <c2><b1> 1%) was strongly associated with LAVI (79 <c2><b1> 1% vs. 65 <c2><b1> 2% and 54 <c2><b1> 2% for LAVI <40, 40 to 59, and <e2><89><a5>60 ml/m(2), respectively; p < 0.0001) even after comprehensive adjustment, including for DMR severity (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 1.08] per 10 ml/m(2); p < 0.0001). Mortality under medical management was profoundly affected by LAVI (adjusted HR: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.04 to 1.10] per 10 ml/mm(2) and 1.55 [95% CI: 1.31 to 1.84] for LAVI <e2><89><a5>60 ml/m(2) vs. <40 ml/m(2); both p < 0.0001) incrementally to adjusting variables (p < 0.0001) and in all subgroups, particularly sinus rhythm (adjusted HR: 1.25 [95% CI: 1.21 to 1.28]) or atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR: 1.10 [95% CI: 1.06 to 1.13] per 10 ml/m(2); both p < 0.0001). Thresholds of excess mortality in spline curve analysis were approximated at 40 ml/m(2) in all subgroups. Survival markedly improved after mitral surgery (time-dependent adjusted HR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.36 to 0.53]; p < 0.0001) but remained modestly linked to LAVI (10-year survival 85 <c2><b1> 3% vs. 86 <c2><b1> 2% and 75 <c2><b1> 3% for LAVI <40, 40 to 59, and <e2><89><a5>60 ml/m(2), respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequent left atrial enlargement of DMR as measured by LAVI in routine practice displays, overall and in all subsets, a powerful, incremental, and independent link to excess mortality, which is partially alleviated by mitral surgery.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial randomized patients with severe aortic stenosis to medical management versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR; inoperable cohort) and surgical aortic valve replacement versus TAVR (high-risk cohort). Among 971 patients with evaluable echocardiograms (92%), LF (stroke volume index <e2><89><a4>35 mL/m(2)) was observed in 530 (55%); LF and low ejection fraction (<50%) in 225 (23%); and LF, low ejection fraction, and low mean gradient (<40 mm Hg) in 147 (15%). Two-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with LF compared with those with normal stroke volume index (47% versus 34%; hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.89; P=0.006). In the inoperable cohort, patients with LF had higher mortality than those with normal flow, but both groups improved with TAVR (46% versus 76% with LF and 38% versus 53% with normal flow; P<0.001). In the high-risk cohort, there was no difference between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement. In patients with paradoxical LF and low gradient (preserved ejection fraction), TAVR reduced 1-year mortality from 66% to 35% (hazard ratio, 0.38; P=0.02). LF was an independent predictor of mortality in all patient cohorts (hazard ratio, <e2><89><88>1.5), whereas ejection fraction and gradient were not. CONCLUSIONS: LF is common in severe aortic stenosis and independently predicts mortality. Survival is improved with TAVR compared with medical management and similar with TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement.

We linked data on patients <e2><89><a5>65 years of age enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry to Medicare claims. Two-year to postdischarge outcomes of those discharged on a statin versus not on a statin were adjusted through inverse probability weighting. Our coprimary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events and home time (days alive and out of a hospital or skilled nursing facility). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, cardiovascular readmission, and hemorrhagic stroke. From 2007 to 2011, 77 468 patients who were not taking statins at the time of admission were hospitalized with ischemic stroke; of these, 71% were discharged on statin therapy.

Over the past decade, a number of factors have shifted that have forced the cardiology community to reconsider the role of T2DM in CAD. First, in addition to being associated with increased cardiovascular risk, T2DM has the potential to affect a number of treatment choices for CAD. In this document, we discuss the role that T2DM has in the selection of testing for CAD, in medical management (both secondary prevention strategies and treatment of stable angina), and in the selection of revascularization strategy. Second, although glycemic control has been recommended as a part of comprehensive risk factor management in patients with CAD, there is mounting evidence that the mechanism by which glucose is managed can have a substantial impact on cardiovascular outcomes. In this document, we discuss the role of glycemic management (both in intensity of control and choice of medications) in cardiovascular outcomes.

Recent studies showed a benefit of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, but appropriate shocks for ventricular tachyarrhythmias were noted only in a minority of patients during 4 to 5 years of follow-up. Accordingly, better risk stratification is needed to optimize patient selection. In this regard, microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) has emerged as a potentially useful measure of arrhythmia vulnerability, but it has not been evaluated previously in a prospective, randomized trial of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This investigation was a prospective substudy of the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) that included 490 patients at 37 clinical sites. TWA tests were classified by blinded readers as positive (37%), negative (22%), or indeterminate (41%) by standard criteria. The composite primary end point was the first occurrence of any of the following events: sudden cardiac death, sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, or appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharge. During a median follow-up of 30 months, no significant differences in event rates were found between TWA-positive or -negative patients (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.59, P=0.56) or TWA-negative and nonnegative (positive and indeterminate) subjects (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 2.53, P=0.46). Similar results were obtained with the inclusion or exclusion of patients randomized to amiodarone in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: TWA testing did not predict arrhythmic events or mortality in SCD-HeFT, although a small reduction in events (20% to 25%) among TWA-negative patients cannot be excluded given the sample size of this study.

Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF. METHODS: The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations. RESULTS: Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes.

We compared 13 negative risk markers using diagnostic likelihood ratios (DLRs), which model the change in risk for an individual after the result of an additional test. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Coronary artery calcium score of 0, carotid intima-media thickness <25th percentile, absence of carotid plaque, brachial flow-mediated dilation >5% change, ankle-brachial index >0.9 and <1.3, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein <2 mg/L, homocysteine <10 <c2><b5>mol/L, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide <100 pg/mL, no microalbuminuria, no family history of coronary heart disease (any/premature), absence of metabolic syndrome, and healthy lifestyle were compared for all and hard coronary heart disease and all CVD events over the 10-year follow-up. Models were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors. Among all negative risk markers, coronary artery calcium score of 0 was the strongest, with an adjusted mean DLR of 0.41 (SD, 0.12) for all coronary heart disease and 0.54 (SD, 0.12) for CVD, followed by carotid intima-media thickness <25th percentile (DLR, 0.65 [SD, 0.04] and 0.75 [SD, 0.04], respectively). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein <2 mg/L and normal ankle-brachial index had DLRs >0.80. Among clinical features, absence of any family history of coronary heart disease was the strongest (DLRs, 0.76 [SD, 0.07] and 0.81 [SD, 0.06], respectively). Net reclassification improvement analyses yielded similar findings, with coronary artery calcium score of 0 resulting in the largest, most accurate downward risk reclassification. CONCLUSIONS: Negative results of atherosclerosis-imaging tests, particularly coronary artery calcium score of 0, resulted in the greatest downward shift in estimated CVD risk. These results may help guide discussions on the identification of individuals less likely to receive net benefit from lifelong preventive pharmacotherapy.",2016,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018524,133,9,849-858,eng,1524-4539 0009-7322,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and risk assessment and Cohort Studies and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Follow-Up Studies and cardiovascular diseases and Biomarkers/blood and C-Reactive Protein/metabolism and biomarkers and Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood and Calcium/*blood and calcium and Atherosclerosis/*blood/diagnosis/*ethnology and cardiac imaging techniques and Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/diagnosis/ethnology and Coronary Vessels/*metabolism/pathology and Ethnicity/*ethnology and Peptide Fragments/blood",NA,NA,2016/03/01/,Circulation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Sperling, Laurence and Virani, Salim S. and Yeboah, Joseph",Circulation,"Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Recommendations for guideline-directed management and therapy, which encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments, are effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee both contains requisite expertise and is representative of the broader medical community by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. Beginning in 2017, numerous modifications to the guidelines have been and continue to be implemented to make guidelines shorter and enhance ""user friendliness."" Guidelines are written and presented in a modular knowledge chunk format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text and, when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. More structured guidelines-including word limits (""targets"") and a web guideline supplement for useful but noncritical tables and figures-are 2 such changes.

Eileen",Circulation,"Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care. In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine(,) and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology.(-) The relationships among guidelines, data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere. INTENDED USE: Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, revised, or superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles.(-) MODERNIZATION: Processes have evolved to support the evolution of guidelines as ""living documents"" that can be dynamically updated. This process delineates a recommendation to address a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally <250 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Writing committee members review the literature; weigh the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected health outcomes. In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data.(-) Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited. The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, and assess the evidence to address systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format (P=population, I=intervention, C=comparator, O=outcome, T=timing, S=setting).(,-) Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself to systematic review and analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding recommendations. GUIDELINE-DIRECTED MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT: The term ""guideline-directed management and therapy"" (GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States. CLASS OF RECOMMENDATION AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1).(-) Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When >1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically. RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY AND OTHER ENTITIES: The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All writing committee members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced writing committee and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online.

Our objective was to develop such a method and test its performance against a population-guided approach. Methods and results: All public location cardiac arrests in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from December 16, 2005, to July 15, 2010, and all automated external defibrillator (AED) locations registered with Toronto Emergency Medical Services as of September 2009 were plotted geographically. Current AED coverage was quantified by determining the number of cardiac arrests occurring within 100 m of a registered AED. Clusters of cardiac arrests without a registered AED within 100 m were identified. With the use of mathematical optimization techniques, cardiac arrest coverage improvements were computed and shown to be superior to results from a population-guided deployment method. There were 1310 eligible public location cardiac arrests and 1669 registered AEDs. Of the eligible cardiac arrests, 304 were within 100 m of at least 1 registered AED (23% coverage). The average distance from a cardiac arrest to the closest AED was 281 m. With AEDs deployed in the top 30 locations, an additional 112 historical cardiac arrests would be covered (32% total coverage), and the average distance to the closest AED would be 262 m. Conclusions: Geographic clusters of cardiac arrests can be easily identified and prioritized with the use of mathematical modeling. Optimized AED deployment can increase cardiac arrest coverage and decrease the distance to the closest AED. Mathematical modeling can augment public AED deployment programs.",2013,NA,127,17,1801-1809,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2013///,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
