Al.Mosaiwi_2018_Perandinddif,JOUR,Linguistic markers of moderate and absolute natural language,"Al-Mosaiwi, Mohammed and Johnstone, Tom",Personality and individual differences,"In social, personality and mental health research, the tendency to select absolute end-points on Likert scales has been linked to certain cultures, lower intelligence, lower income and personality/mental health disorders. It is unclear whether this response style reflects an absolutist cognitive style or is merely an experimental artefact. In this study, we introduce an alternative, more informative, flexible and ecologically valid approach for estimating absolute responding, that uses natural language markers. We focussed on 'function words' (e.g. particles, conjunctions, prepositions) as they are more generalizable because they do not depend on any specific context. To identify such linguistic markers and test their generalizability, we conducted a text analysis of online reviews for films, tourist attractions and consumer products. All written reviews were accompanied by a rating scale (akin to Likert scale), which allowed us to label text samples as absolute/moderate. The data was split into independent 'training' and 'test' sets. Using the training set we identified a rank order of linguistic markers for absolute and moderate text, which were evaluated in a classifier on the test set. The top three markers alone (""but"", ""!"" and ""seem"") produced 88% classification accuracy, which increased to 91% using 31 linguistic markers.",2018,10.1016/j.paid.2018.06.004,134,NA,119-124,eng,0191-8869,Machine learning and Text analysis and Natural language and Absolutism and Extreme responding,NA,NA,2018/11/01/,Pers Individ Dif,NA,NA,NA,NA
McGuckin_2012_Cybbehandsocnet,JOUR,Using Google Analytics to evaluate the impact of the CyberTraining project,"McGuckin, Conor and Crowley, Niall","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking","A focus on results and impact should be at the heart of every project's approach to research and dissemination. This article discusses the potential of Google Analytics (GA: http://google.com/analytics ) as an effective resource for measuring the impact of academic research output and understanding the geodemographics of users of specific Web 2.0 content (e.g., intervention and prevention materials, health promotion and advice). This article presents the results of GA analyses as a resource used in measuring the impact of the EU-funded CyberTraining project, which provided a well-grounded, research-based training manual on cyberbullying for trainers through the medium of a Web-based eBook ( www.cybertraining-project.org ). The training manual includes review information on cyberbullying, its nature and extent across Europe, analyses of current projects, and provides resources for trainers working with the target groups of pupils, parents, teachers, and other professionals. Results illustrate the promise of GA as an effective tool for measuring the impact of academic research and project output with real potential for tracking and understanding intra- and intercountry regional variations in the uptake of prevention and intervention materials, thus enabling precision focusing of attention to those regions.",2012,10.1089/cyber.2011.0460,15,11,625-629,eng,2152-2723 2152-2715,Software and Humans and Program Evaluation and *Internet and *Bullying/psychology and Computer-Assisted Instruction/methods/standards and Education/*methods/standards,NA,NA,2012/11//undefined,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jay and Engler, Nicole B. and Geske, Jeffrey B. and Klarich, Kyle W. and Timimi, Farris K.","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking","With more than 300 million monthly active users, Twitter is a powerful social media tool in healthcare, yet the characterization of an academic healthcare Twitter account remains poor to date. We assessed basic gender and geographic data on the account's ""followers,"" as well as categorization of each tweet based on content type. We analyzed the impressions, engagements, retweets, favorites, replies, hashtag clicks, and detail expansions using both Sprinklr and Twitter Analytics. Over a period of 12 months, the account amassed 1,235 followers, with 54 percent being male and 68 percent residing in the United States. Of the 1,635 tweets sent out over the life of the account, we report more than 382,464 impressions, 6,023 engagements, 1,255 retweets, 776 favorites, and 1,654 embedded media clicks in this period. When broken down by tweet category, publication tweets garnered the highest engagement with an estimated mean number of clicks per tweet of 8.2 <c2><b1> 81.9. Original content had higher total engagement per tweet than retweeted material (2.8 <c2><b1> 9.2 vs. 0.2 <c2><b1> 0.9 engagements per tweet; p < 0.0001).

Zhu_2021_Cybbehandsocnet,JOUR,Effect of Social Anxiety on the Adoption of Robotic Training Partner,"Zhu, Dong Hong and Deng, Zhong Zhun","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking","With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, robotic training partner is becoming a reality, which is a substitute for human training partner. Socially anxious individuals feel uncomfortable in front of unfamiliar people or when being observed by others. Playing with robotic training partners can avoid face-to-face interaction with other people. It is unclear whether social anxiety affects the adoption of robotic training partners. This study investigates the effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partners among university students. Study 1 confirmed that university students with higher social anxiety are more likely to choose robotic training partners than human training partners. Mediation analysis in Study 2 supported the mediating role of sense of relaxation with robotic training partner in the positive effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partner. This study shows that developing training partner robots is a meaningful thing for corporate profits and the health of socially anxious people.",2021,10.1089/cyber.2020.0179,24,5,343-348,eng,2152-2723 2152-2715,artificial intelligence and Emotions and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and adoption and Artificial Intelligence and Fear and Interpersonal Relations and Anxiety/*psychology and *Robotics and robotic training partner and sense of relaxation and social anxiety,NA,NA,2021/05//undefined,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA

R. and Hutchinson, Delyse M. and Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Matthew and Teague, Samantha J.","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking","Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant mental health issue in mothers and fathers alike; yet at-risk fathers often come to the attention of health care professionals late due to low awareness of symptoms and reluctance to seek help. This study aimed to examine whether passive social media markers are effective for identifying fathers at risk of PPD. We collected 67,796 Reddit posts from 365 fathers, spanning a 6-month period around the birth of their child. A list of ""at-risk"" words was developed in collaboration with a perinatal mental health expert. PPD was assessed by evaluating the change in fathers' use of words indicating depressive symptomatology after childbirth. Predictive models were developed as a series of support vector machine classifiers using behavior, emotion, linguistic style, and discussion topics as features. The performance of these classifiers indicates that fathers at risk of PPD can be predicted from their prepartum data alone. Overall, the best performing model used discussion topic features only with a recall score of 0.82. These findings could assist in the development of support and intervention tools for fathers during the prepartum period, with specific applicability to personalized and preventative support tools for at-risk fathers.",2020,10.1089/cyber.2019.0746,23,9,611-618,eng,2152-2723 2152-2715,"social media and mental health and Humans and Female and Male and Machine Learning and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and *Social Media and *Fathers and Depression, Postpartum/*diagnosis/epidemiology and fathers and parenting transition and postnatal depression and postpartum depression",NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using web search data has advantages in terms of data objectivity, ecological validity, temporal resolution, and unique application value. This review integrates existing studies on web search data that have explored topics including sexual behavior, suicidal behavior, mental health, social prejudice, social inequality, public responses to policies, and other psychosocial issues. These studies are categorized as descriptive, correlational, inferential, predictive, and policy evaluation research. The integration of theory-based hypothesis testing in future web search research will result in even stronger contributions to social psychology.",2017,10.1089/cyber.2017.0261,20,10,596-602,eng,2152-2723 2152-2715,"Humans and big data and Google and web search and *Internet and *Psychology, Social and *Biomedical Research and social psychology",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA
Glowacki_2017_Cybbehandsocnet,JOUR,E-Cigarette Topics Shared by Medical Professionals: A Comparison of Tweets from the United States and United Kingdom,"Glowacki, Elizabeth M. and Lazard, Allison J. and Wilcox, Gary B.","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking","Medical professionals are now relying on social media platforms like Twitter to express their recommendations for the use or avoidance of products like electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), which may have long-term health consequences for users. The goal of this study is to compare how physicians from the United States and the United Kingdom talk about e-cigs on Twitter and identify the topics that these groups perceive as salient. Comparing tweets from the U.S. and U.K. will allow for a better understanding of how medical professionals from these countries differ in their attitudes toward e-cigs. This information can be also used to inform policies designed to regulate the use of e-cigs. Using a text-mining program, we analyzed approximately 3,800 original tweets sent by physicians from the U.S. and the U.K. within a 1-year time span (June 2015 through June 2016). The program clustered the tweets by topics, which allowed us to categorize the topics by importance. Both sets of tweets contained debates about the degree to which e-cigs pose a threat to health, but the U.S. tweets emphasized the dangers of e-cig use for teens, while the U.K. tweets focused more on the potential that e-cigs have to be used as a smoking cessation aid. Doctors are using Twitter to share timely information about the potential risks, benefits, and regulations associated with e-cigs. Evaluating these tweets allows researchers to collect information about topics that doctors find important and make comparisons about how medical professionals from the U.S. and the U.K. regard e-cigs.",2017,10.1089/cyber.2016.0409,20,2,133-137,eng,2152-2723 2152-2715,text analytics and Humans and twitter and Smoking Cessation and United States/epidemiology and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and United Kingdom/epidemiology and Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data and physician and electronic cigarettes and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sah_2019_P.spb,JOUR,Insinuation Anxiety: Concern That Advice Rejection Will Signal Distrust After Conflict of Interest Disclosures,"Sah, Sunita and Loewenstein, George and Cain, Daylian",Personality & social psychology bulletin,"When expert advisors have conflicts of interest, disclosure is a common regulatory response. In four experiments (three scenario experiments involving medical contexts, and one field experiment involving financial consequences for both parties), we show that disclosure of a financial or nonfinancial conflict of interest can have a perverse effect on the advisor-advisee relationship. Disclosure, perhaps naturally, decreases an advisee's trust in the advice. But disclosure can also lead to concern that failure to follow advice will be interpreted as a signal of distrust. That is, rejecting the advice could suggest that the advisee is insinuating that the advisor could be biased by the conflict of interest. We show that this insinuation anxiety persists whether the disclosure is voluntary or required by law and whether the disclosed conflict is big or small, but it diminishes when the disclosure is made by an external source rather than directly by the advisor.",2019,10.1177/0146167218805991,45,7,1099-1112,eng,1552-7433 0146-1672,decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and ethics and Interpersonal Relations and Choice Behavior and conflicts of interest and *Trust and *Conflict of Interest and *Disclosure and *Psychological Distance and advice and Anxiety/*etiology/psychology and disclosure,NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,Pers Soc Psychol Bull,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an effort to understand some of the psychological underpinnings of such decisions, the present research builds from terror management theory to examine whether reminders of death motivate individuals strongly invested in a religious worldview (i.e., fundamentalists) to rely on religious beliefs when making medical decisions. The results showed that heightened concerns about mortality led those high in religious fundamentalism to express greater endorsement of prayer as a medical substitute (Study 1) and to perceive prayer as a more effective medical treatment (Study 2). Similarly, high fundamentalists were more supportive of religiously motivated medical refusals (Study 3) and reported an increased willingness to rely on faith alone for medical treatment (Study 4) following reminders of death. Finally, affirmations of the legitimacy of divine intervention in health contexts functioned to solidify a sense of existential meaning among fundamentalists who were reminded of personal mortality (Study 5). The existential importance of religious faith and the health-relevant implications of these findings are discussed.",2009,10.1037/a0015545,97,2,334-350,eng,0022-3514,"Missouri and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Religion and Students/psychology and *Attitude to Death and Existentialism/*psychology and Treatment Refusal/*psychology and Decision Making/physiology and *Religion and Psychology and Adaptation, Psychological/physiology",NA,NA,2009/08//undefined,J Pers Soc Psychol,NA,NA,NA,NA
