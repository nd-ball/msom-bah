Bagnasco_2015_Joofadnu,JOUR,Instruments measuring meaningful learning in undergraduate healthcare students: a systematic review protocol,"Bagnasco, Annamaria and Cadorin, Lucia and Tolotti, Angela and Pagnucci, Nicola and Rocco, Gennaro and Sasso, Loredana",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To establish the psychometric properties of instruments to measure learning outcomes in healthcare students. BACKGROUND: Meaningful learning is an active process that promotes a wider and deeper understanding of concepts. It is the result of an interaction between new and previous knowledge. Meaningful learning produces a long-term change in knowledge and skills, which is underpinned by willingness to learn and experience and it is exclusively built by the learner. DESIGN: Systematic psychometric review protocol developed from Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care guidance. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection Database between 1990-2013. Selected studies will be evaluated with the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Funding for the review was confirmed on January 2011 by the Centre of Excellence for Nursing Scholarship in Rome. RESULTS: The systematic review will produce a synthesis of the data related to the instruments that measure learning outcomes. These data will help us decide which tools to use and identify the state of knowledge in this field.

BACKGROUND: Meaningful learning is an active process that enables a wider and deeper understanding of concepts. It is the result of an interaction between new and prior knowledge and produces a long-standing change in knowledge and skills. In the field of education, validated and reliable instruments for assessing meaningful learning are needed. DESIGN: A psychometric systematic review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Psychology & Behavioural Sciences Collection Database from 1990-December 2013. REVIEW METHOD: Using pre-determined inclusion criteria, three reviewers independently identified studies for full-text review. Then they extracted data for quality appraisal and graded instrument validity using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of the health status Measurement INstruments checklist and the Psychometric Grading Framework. RESULTS: Of the 57 studies identified for full-text review, 16 met the inclusion criteria and 13 different instruments were assessed. Following quality assessment, only one instrument was considered of good quality but it measured meaningful learning only in part; the others were either fair or poor. The Psychometric Grading Framework indicated that one instrument was weak, while the others were very weak. No instrument displayed adequate validity. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review produced a synthesis of the psychometric properties of tools that measure learning outcomes in students of healthcare disciplines.

Squires_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,Strategies for overcoming language barriers in research,"Squires, Allison and Sadarangani, Tina and Jones, Simon",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper seeks to describe best practices for conducting cross-language research with individuals who have a language barrier. DESIGN: Discussion paper. DATA SOURCES: Research methods papers addressing cross-language research issues published between 2000-2017. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Rigorous cross-language research involves the appropriate use of interpreters during the research process, systematic planning for how to address the language barrier between participant and researcher and the use of reliably and validly translated survey instruments (when applicable). Biases rooted in those who enter data into ""big data"" systems may influence data quality and analytic approaches in large observational studies focused on linking patient language preference to health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Cross-language research methods can help ensure that those individuals with language barriers have their voices contributing to the evidence informing healthcare practice and policies that shape health services implementation and financing. Understanding the inherent conscious and unconscious biases of those conducting research with this population and how this may emerge in research studies is also an important part of producing rigorous, reliable, and valid cross-language research. IMPACT: This study synthesized methodological recommendations for cross-language research studies with the goal to improve the quality of future research and expand the evidence-base for clinical practice. Clear methodological recommendations were generated that can improve research rigor and quality of cross-language qualitative and quantitative studies.

Chang_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,The performance of an online osteoporosis detection system a sensitivity and specificity analysis,"Chang, Shu Fang and Hong, Chin Ming and Yang, Rong Sen",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop an online system for the detection of osteoporosis risk and to test its accuracy. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a silent killer; usually, there are no symptoms, such as pain, until bone erosion and fracture occur. The risks of osteoporosis have been underestimated and neglected; as a result, osteoporosis can be as dangerous as heart diseases and cancers that lead to a healthcare crisis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The study participants were individuals presenting for routine health examinations at a medical centre in Taiwan from 2006-2007. Women over 30 years of age who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning for measurement of bone mineral density were eligible for this study. The system for osteoporosis detection and health risk, which was developed in this study, was analysed. RESULTS: The findings indicated a high sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 75% and negative predictive value of 75%. In addition, the online osteoporosis detective system had a higher predictive power (24<c2><b7>2% vs. 11%) and a similar cut-off point (33% vs. 27%) compared with the tool designed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. CONCLUSION: The online system for detection of osteoporosis risk had excellent reliability and validity. It performed well in predicting osteoporosis and the cut-off point used for identifying the risk among women at risk of developing osteoporosis. Therefore, it is suitable for the Asian women and can help women achieve the goals of early detection and health promotion. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Early detection is the only way to prevent osteoporosis.

Kang_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Qualitative evaluation of a delirium prevention and management programme,"Kang, Yun and Moyle, Wendy and Cooke, Marie and O'Dwyer, Siobhan",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an educational programme on registered nurses' knowledge and attitude in delirium care for hospitalised older adults with and without dementia, and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the programme from the participants' perspectives. BACKGROUND: Providing care for patients with delirium or delirium superimposed on dementia often poses particular challenges such as distinguishing between delirium and dementia for nurses. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative study was used. METHODS: A delirium educational programme based on adult learning principles was provided to the participants. A purposive sample of 12 registered nurses who participated in the educational programme undertook individual interviews. Content analysis was conducted to identify unique and common themes indicative of registered nurse perceptions. RESULTS: Registered nurses reported improved knowledge and attitude towards the delirium care of hospitalised older adults with dementia and at risk of delirium. Active learning in the programme facilitated the participants' learning processes. This active learning included deep learning, collaborative learning and application of new concepts to practice. Most participants felt that they had inadequate management support to apply their new knowledge in practice, and this included staff resource and policies and protocols. CONCLUSION: The qualitative findings indicated that the delirium education had benefited the participants by improving their knowledge and attitude towards the delirium care of hospitalised older adults with dementia and at risk of delirium. This study provided an understanding of the strengths and limitations of the educational programme delivered to registered nurses in South Korea.

Bourla_2020_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Are student nurses ready for new technologies in mental health? Mixed-methods study,"Bourla, Alexis and Mouchabac, Stephane and Ogorzelec, Laetitia and Guinchard, Christian and Ferreri, Florian",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. METHOD: Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screenplay method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. RESULTS: We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability, the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. CONCLUSION: This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital phenotyping. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies.",2020,10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104240,84,NA,104240,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Ecological Momentary Assessment and Ecological momentary assessment and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Decision Support Techniques and Reproducibility of Results and France and *Smartphone and Acceptability and Computerized adaptive testing and Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis/nursing and Digital phenotyping and Professional culture and Psychiatric Nursing/*education and Students, Nursing/*psychology",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Itzhaki_2016_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Family involvement in medical decision-making: Perceptions of nursing and psychology students,"Itzhaki, Michal and Hildesheimer, Galya and Barnoy, Sivia and Katz, Michael",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Family members often rely on health care professionals to guide and support them through the decision-making process. Although family involvement in medical decisions should be included in the preservice curriculum for the health care professions, perceptions of students in caring professions on family involvement in medical decision-making have not yet been examined. OBJECTIVE: To examine the perceptions of nursing and psychology students on family involvement in medical decision-making for seriously ill patients. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: First year undergraduate nursing and psychology students studying for their Bachelor of Arts degree were recruited. METHODS: Perceptions were assessed with a questionnaire constructed based on the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), which examines decision-maker preferences. The questionnaire consisted of two parts referring to the respondent once as the patient and then as the family caregiver. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 116 nursing students and 156 psychology students. Most were of the opinion that family involvement in decision-making is appropriate, especially when the patient is incapable of making decisions. Nursing students were more inclined than psychology students to think that financial, emotional, and value-based considerations should be part of the family's involvement in decision-making. Both groups of students perceived the emotional consideration as most acceptable, whereas the financial consideration was considered the least acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing and psychology students perceive family involvement in medical decision-making as appropriate. In order to train students to support families in the process of decision-making, further research should examine Shared Decision-Making (SDM) programs, which involve patient and clinician collaboration in health care decisions.",2016,10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.002,40,NA,181-187,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Decision-making and Curriculum and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Psychology and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Decision Making and *Clinical Decision-Making and Family/*psychology and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Family involvement and Nursing students and Patient Participation/psychology and Psychology students and Shared Decision-Making",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wang_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,The emergency patient's participation in medical decision-making,"Wang, Li-Hsiang and Goopy, Suzanne and Lin, Chun-Chih and Barnard, Alan and Han, Chin-Yen and Liu, Hsueh-Erh",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to explore the medical decision-making processes of patients in emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Studies indicate that patients should be given enough time to acquire relevant information and receive adequate support when they need to make medical decisions. It is difficult to satisfy these requirements in emergency situations. Limited research has addressed the topic of decision-making among emergency patients. DESIGN: This qualitative study used a broadly defined grounded theory approach to explore decision-making in an emergency department in Taiwan. METHODS: Thirty emergency patients were recruited between June and December 2011 for semi-structured interviews that were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. RESULTS: The study identified three stages in medical decision-making by emergency patients: predecision (interpreting the problem); decision (a balancing act) and postdecision (reclaiming the self). Transference was identified as the core category and pattern of behaviour through which patients resolved their main concerns. This transference around decision-making represents a type of bricolage. CONCLUSIONS: The findings fill a gap in knowledge about the decision-making process among emergency patients.

Salamonson_2013_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Learning approaches as predictors of academic performance in first year health and science students,"Salamonson, Yenna and Weaver, Roslyn and Chang, Sungwon and Koch, Jane and Bhathal, Ragbir and Khoo, Cheang and Wilson, Ian",Nurse education today,"AIMS: To compare health and science students' demographic characteristics and learning approaches across different disciplines, and to examine the relationship between learning approaches and academic performance. BACKGROUND: While there is increasing recognition of a need to foster learning approaches that improve the quality of student learning, little is known about students' learning approaches across different disciplines, and their relationships with academic performance. DESIGN: Prospective, correlational design. METHODS: Using a survey design, a total of 919 first year health and science students studying in a university located in the western region of Sydney from the following disciplines were recruited to participate in the study - i) Nursing: n = 476, ii) Engineering: n = 75, iii) Medicine: n = 77, iv) Health Sciences: n = 204, and v) Medicinal Chemistry: n = 87. RESULTS: Although there was no statistically significant difference in the use of surface learning among the five discipline groups, there were wide variations in the use of deep learning approach. Furthermore, older students and those with English as an additional language were more likely to use deep learning approach. Controlling for hours spent in paid work during term-time and English language usage, both surface learning approach (<ce><b2> = -0.13, p = 0.001) and deep learning approach (<ce><b2> = 0.11, p = 0.009) emerged as independent and significant predictors of academic performance.

Lin_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Reasons for family involvement in elective surgical decision-making in Taiwan: a qualitative study,"Lin, Mei-Ling and Huang, Chuen-Teng and Chen, Ching-Huey",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To inquire into the reasons for family involvement in adult patients' surgical decision-making processes from the point of view of the patients' family. BACKGROUND: Making a patient the centre of medical decision-making is essential for respecting individual's autonomy. However, in a Chinese society, family members are often deeply involved in a patient's medical decision-making. Although family involvement has long been viewed as an aspect of the Chinese culture, empirical evidence of the reasons for family involvement in medical decision-making has been lacking. DESIGN: A qualitative study. METHOD: In order to record and examine reasons for family involvement in adult patients' surgical decision-making, 12 different family members of 12 elective surgery patients were interviewed for collecting and analysing data. RESULTS: Three major reasons for family involvement emerged from the data analyses: (1) to share responsibility; (2) to ensure the correctness of medical information; and (3) to safeguard the patient's well-being. These findings also reveal that culture is not the only reason for family involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Making decision to undergo a surgery is a tough and stressful process for a patient. Family may provide the patient with timely psychological support to assist the patient to communicate with his or her physician(s) and other medical personnel to ensure their rights. It is also found that due to the imbalanced doctor-patient power relationship, a patient may be unable, unwilling to, or even dare not, tell the whole truth about his or her illness or feelings to the medical personnel. Thus, a patient would expect his or her family to undertake such a mission during the informed consent and decision-making processes.

Price_2017_Joofadnu,JOUR,Accuracy of intuition in clinical decision-making among novice clinicians,"Price, Amanda and Zulkosky, Kristen and White, Krista and Pretz, Jean",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To assess the reliance on intuitive and analytical approaches during clinical decision-making among novice clinicians and whether that reliance is associated with accurate decision-making. BACKGROUND: Nurse educators and managers tend to emphasize analysis over intuition during clinical decision-making though nurses typically report some reliance on intuition in their practice. We hypothesized that under certain conditions, reliance on intuition would support accurate decision-making, even among novices. DESIGN: This study utilized an experimental design with clinical complication (familiar vs. novel) and decision phase (cue acquisition, diagnosis and action) as within-subjects' factors, and simulation role (observer, family, auxiliary nurse and primary nurse) as between-subjects' factor. METHODS: We examined clinical decision-making accuracy among final semester pre-licensure nursing students in a simulation experience. Students recorded their reasoning about emerging clinical complications with their patient during two distinct points in the simulation; one point involved a familiar complication and the other a relatively novel complication. All data were collected during Spring 2015. RESULTS: Although most participants relied more heavily on analysis than on intuition, use of intuition during the familiar complication was associated with more accurate decision-making, particularly in guiding attention to relevant cues. With the novel complication, use of intuition appeared to hamper decision-making, particularly for those in an observer role. CONCLUSION: Novice clinicians should be supported by educators and nurse managers to note when their intuitions are likely to be valid.

Dowding_2009_Joofclnu,JOUR,Nurses' use of computerised clinical decision support systems: a case site analysis,"Dowding, Dawn and Mitchell, Natasha and Randell, Rebecca and Foster, Rebecca and Lattimer, Valerie and Thompson, Carl",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how nurses use computerised clinical decision support systems in clinical practice and the factors that influence use. BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence for the benefits of computerised clinical decision support systems in nursing, with the majority of existing research focusing on nurses' use of decision support for telephone triage. Research has suggested that several factors including nurses' experience, features of the technology system and organisational factors may influence how decision support is used in practice. DESIGN: A multiple case site study. METHODS: Four case sites were purposively selected to provide variation in staff experience, technology used and decisions supported by the technology. Data were collected in each case site using non-participant observation of nurse/patient consultations (n = 115) and interviews with nurses (n = 55). Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Computerised decision support systems were used in a variety of ways by nurses, including recording information, monitoring patients' progress and confirming decisions that had already been made. Nurses' experience with the decision and the technology affected how they used a decision support system and whether or not they over-rode recommendations made by the system. The ability of nurses to adapt the technology also affected its use. CONCLUSIONS: How nurses use computerised decision support appears to be the result of an interaction between a nurses' experience and their ability to adapt the technology to 'fit' with local clinical practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: One of the stated aims of introducing computerised decision support systems to assist nursing practice is to reduce variation and/or the number of errors associated with clinical practice. The study found unanticipated uses in such systems such as the routine over-riding of recommendations which could lead to an increase rather than a decrease in variation or errors.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02607.x,18,8,1159-1167,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Medical Informatics and *Nurses",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Koller_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,'Kids need to talk too': inclusive practices for children's healthcare education and participation,"Koller, Donna",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine how children with chronic medical conditions view healthcare education and decision-making and to propose the application of the universal design for learning in paediatric settings. BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions tend to be excluded from healthcare decision-making. In schools, the universal design for learning promotes access to education and participation in school communities for all children, regardless of their disabilities or medical needs, rendering it an appropriate model for children's participation in healthcare decision-making. DESIGN: This article presents findings from a qualitative study with 26 children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions about their views and experiences with healthcare education and decision-making. METHODS: Twenty-six children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Findings provide evidence that clinical practices often fail to provide equal opportunities for paediatric patients to understand their condition, share their views and/or participate in decisions regarding their care. CONCLUSIONS: In response to ongoing concerns about paediatric decision-making, we propose that the universal design for learning be adapted in paediatrics. The model presents exemplary programmes as inclusive, accounting for the needs of all children through multiple means of engagement and expression.

Lin_2013_Joofclnu,JOUR,Family as a whole: elective surgery patients' perception of the meaning of family involvement in decision making,"Lin, Mei-Ling and Pang, Mei-Che S. and Chen, Ching-Huey",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore patient perception of the meaning of family involvement in elective surgery decision making in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: Informed consent is based on respecting patient autonomy. However in cultures where family plays a key role in medical decision making, a patient's perspective of family involvement has not been fully investigated. DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a phenomenological approach, this study conducted semistructured interviews to elicit the experiences of 10 elective surgery patients in southern Taiwan who had family present during their surgery decision making. An adapted version of Colaizzi's (1978) method was used to analyse narratives. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the elective surgery patients' perception of the meaning of family involvement in their surgery decision-making process: (1) Primacy of family well-being, (2) family as information broker, and (3) family as patient advocate. Patients articulated reciprocal relationships amongst family members, and they expressed overall family well-being as their ultimate concern when making their treatment decision. The essence of the elective surgery patients' perception of the meaning of family involvement in decision making was 'family as a whole'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' concern for overall family well-being and their perspective that family plays a supportive role in transmitting information and acting as patient advocate during the decision-making process may both enhance and restrict individual patient autonomy. In cultures where family is central in decision making, appropriately involving the family in medical decisions should not be overlooked.

BACKGROUND: Decision-making in acute care nursing requires an evaluation of many complex factors. While decision-making research in acute care nursing is prevalent, errors in decision-making continue to lead to poor patient outcomes. Naturalistic decision making may provide a framework for further exploring decision-making in acute care nursing practice. A better understanding of the literature is needed to guide future research to more effectively support acute care nurse decision-making. DESIGN: PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched, and research meeting criteria was included. Data were identified from all included articles, and themes were developed based on these data. RESULTS: Key findings in this review include nursing experience and associated factors; organisation and unit culture influences on decision-making; education; understanding patient status; situation awareness; and autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care nurses employ a variety of decision-making factors and processes and informally identify experienced nurses to be important resources for decision-making. Incorporation of evidence into acute care nursing practice continues to be a struggle for acute care nurses. This review indicates that naturalistic decision making may be applicable to decision-making nursing research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Experienced nurses bring a broad range of previous patient encounters to their practice influencing their intuitive, unconscious processes which facilitates decision-making. Using naturalistic decision making as a conceptual framework to guide research may help with understanding how to better support less experienced nurses' decision-making for enhanced patient outcomes.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14151,27,5-6,917-928,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,decision-making and education and Humans and literature review and Nursing Research and Clinical Competence and *Decision Making and clinical decision-making and *Clinical Decision-Making and Awareness and Nurses/*psychology and evidence-based practice and *Critical Care Nursing and acute care and naturalistic decision making and nursing practice and nursing research,NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Crispin_2017_Injoofnust,JOUR,Sufficiency and relevance of information for inpatients in general ward settings: A qualitative exploration of information exchange between patients and nurses,"Crispin, Vivianne and Bugge, Carol and Stoddart, Kathleen",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Information exchange as part of shared decision-making is widely discussed in research and policy literature as a means of improving patient involvement in treatment and care. To date information exchange between patients and nurses has not been explored in ward contexts. OBJECTIVE: To explore the sufficiency of, and intentions behind, information exchanged by patients and nurses in surgical and medical ward settings using a recognised model of shared decision-making. DESIGN: A multiple-case study design was used. Data were collected from 19 cases. Each case comprised one patient, the nurses interacting with that patient, the interactions between them, and their perceptions about the interactions. SETTINGS: The study was undertaken across six surgical, six medical and one rehabilitation ward in a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to first recruit nurses and then patients. Inclusion criteria included nurses registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, and patients who had been in hospital for more than 24h and who could consent to participating. Twenty-two nurses and 19 patients participated. METHODS: Interactions from 19 cases were observed and audio-recorded. Individual interviews with patients and nurses followed, and were related to, the observed interactions. RESULTS: Patients and nurses perceived they had exchanged sufficient information for their own needs including patient involvement, due to: information being shared previously and on an ongoing basis; having asked all their questions; therapeutic patient/nurse relationships; and, nurses speaking in lay terms. In contrast, the observational data suggested that insufficient information was exchanged between patients and nurses due to: lost opportunities for sharing information; paternalistic practice; and withholding information. CONCLUSION: The elements of information exchange within a recognised model of shared decision-making do not adequately fit with patient/nurse interactions in ward settings. Participants generally perceived they had given and received enough information for their own needs. Therefore, the ways in which patients and nurses currently interact, could remain as they are. Policymakers should be aware of the varying contexts where healthcare staff work, and should promote information exchange and shared decision-making more strategically. Due to the complexities of patient/nurse interactions, consideration should be given to situation and context when applying these findings to practice.",2017,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.07.010,75,NA,112-122,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and United Kingdom and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Inpatients and Hospitals, Teaching and *Hospital Units and Shared decision-making and *Information Services and *Nurse-Patient Relations and Information exchange and Multiple-case study design and Observational research and Patient/nurse interactions",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Protocol-based care is a strategy to reduce variability in clinical practice. There are no studies looking at protocol-based care decision-making. Understand this process is key to successful implementation. METHOD: A multiple embedded case study was carried out. Nurses' protocol-based care decision-making was studied in three inpatient wards (medical, surgical and medical-surgical) of a university hospital in northern Spain. Data collection was performed between 2015 and 2016 including documentary analysis, non-participant observations, participant observations and interviews. Analysis of quantitative data involved descriptive statistics and qualitative data was submitted to Burnard's method of content analysis (1996). The data integration comprised the integration of the data set of each case separately and the integration of the findings resulting from the comparison of the cases. The following the thread method of data integration was used for this purpose. The SRQR guideline was used for reporting. RESULTS: The multiple embedded case study revealed protocol-based care decision-making as a linear and variable process that depends on the context and consists of multiple interrelated elements, among which the risk perception is foremost. CONCLUSION: This study has allowed progress in protocol-based care decision-making characterisation. This knowledge is crucial to support the design of educational and management strategies aimed at implementing protocol-based care.

Twibell_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,A qualitative study of factors in nurses' and physicians' decision-making related to family presence during resuscitation,"Twibell, Renee and Siela, Debra and Riwitis, Cheryl and Neal, Alexis and Waters, Nicole",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the similarities and differences in factors that influence nurses' and physicians' decision-making related to family presence during resuscitation. BACKGROUND: Despite the growing acceptance of family presence during resuscitation worldwide, healthcare professionals continue to debate the risks and benefits of family presence. As many hospitals lack a policy to guide family presence during resuscitation, decisions are negotiated by resuscitation teams, families and patients in crisis situations. Research has not clarified the factors that influence the decision-making processes of nurses and physicians related to inviting family presence. This is the first study to elicit written data from healthcare professionals to explicate factors in decision-making about family presence. DESIGN: Qualitative exploratory-descriptive. METHODS: Convenience samples of registered nurses (n = 325) and acute care physicians (n = 193) from a Midwestern hospital in the United States of America handwrote responses to open-ended questions about family presence. Through thematic analysis, decision-making factors for physicians and nurses were identified and compared. RESULTS: Physicians and nurses evaluated three similar factors and four differing factors when deciding to invite family presence during resuscitation. Furthermore, nurses and physicians weighted the factors differently. Physicians weighted most heavily the family's potential to disrupt life-saving efforts and compromise patient care and then the family's knowledge about resuscitations. Nurses heavily weighted the potential for the family to be traumatised, the potential for the family to disrupt the resuscitation, and possible family benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and physicians considered both similar and different factors when deciding to invite family presence. Physicians focused on the patient primarily, while nurses focused on the patient, family and resuscitation team.

Quaye_2019_Joofclnu,JOUR,Children's active participation in decision-making processes during hospitalisation: An observational study,"Quaye, Angela A. and Coyne, Imelda and Soderback, Maja and Hallstrom, Inger Kristensson",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim was to explore and describe the child's active participation in daily healthcare practice at children's hospital units in Sweden. OBJECTIVES: (a) Identify everyday situations in medical and nursing care that illustrate children's active participation in decision-making, (b) identify various ways of active participation, actual and optimal in situations involving decision-making and (c) explore factors in nursing and medical care that influence children's active participation in decision-making. BACKGROUND: Despite active participation being a fundamental right for children, they are not always involved in decision-making processes during their health care. There still remains uncertainty on how to support children to actively participate in decisions concerning their health care. DESIGN: A qualitative study with overt, nonparticipant observations fulfilling the COREQ checklist criteria. METHODS: Observations of interactions between children aged 2 and 17 years with both acute and chronic conditions, their parents, and healthcare professionals were conducted at three paediatric hospitals in Sweden. The Scale of Degrees of Self Determination was used to grade identified situations. The scale describes five levels of active participation, with level one being the least and level five being the most active level of participation. Normative judgements were also made. RESULTS: Children's active participation was assessed as being generally at levels four and five. Children demonstrated both verbal and nonverbal ways of communication during decision-making. Findings indicated that children's, parents' and healthcare professional's actions influenced children's active participation in decision-making processes involving healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals specialised in paediatrics need to embrace both a child perspective and a child's perspective, plan care incorporating key elements of a child-centred care approach, to ensure children's active participation at a level of their choosing.

Ganz_2013_Joofclnu,JOUR,Resuscitation in general medical wards: who decides?,"Ganz, Freda DeKeyser and Kaufman, Nechama and Israel, Sima and Einav, Sharon",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate nurse experiences and attitudes regarding resuscitation while focusing on intentional avoidance of action during a futile cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND: Nurses often lack the legal and clinical authority to make resuscitation decisions; however, in cases where they believe that resuscitation would be futile, they may elect to delay/avoid the initiation of resuscitation as a non-confrontational method of achieving the desired endpoint, thus essentially transferring the final resuscitation decision from the physician to the nurse. DESIGN AND METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire survey conducted among a convenience sample of 122/142 nurses from five medical wards in two Jerusalem hospitals. RESULTS: Nearly one-fifth (19/117) of participants reported non-initiation of a futile resuscitation. Nurses who chose not to initiate futile resuscitations were those who scored higher on the Support Do Not Attempt Resuscitation Questionnaire, those that had previously been consulted by a doctor regarding the initiation of resuscitation and those that expressed a desire to be a part of a multidisciplinary team focused on resuscitation decision-making. No other variables seemed to affect this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are often excluded from the resuscitation decision-making process despite their desire to participate. Delayed initiation/avoidance of resuscitation is being actively practiced by some nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should be given the opportunity to become an essential component of resuscitation decision-making to avoid the pre-emption of medical resuscitation decisions.",2013,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04240.x,22,5-6,848-855,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Hospital Units and Israel and *Resuscitation,NA,NA,2013/03//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Leung_2008_Nurseductoda,JOUR,The impact of assessment methods on the learning of nursing students,"Leung, Sau Fong and Mok, Esther and Wong, Daniel",Nurse education today,"Assessment methods can influence the learning approaches of nursing students. Assessments designed to assess understanding rather than rote learning can contribute to a deep learning approach. Multiple-choice questions can be formulated at high cognitive levels for nursing assessments. This study aimed to examine the effect of high quality multiple-choice tests on the learning approaches of students enrolled in a mental health nursing course as measured by the revised two-factor study process questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F). Data were collected from 136 students in a higher diploma (HD) in nursing programme and 142 baccalaureate (BSN) nursing students. Two-step cluster analysis yielded three clusters represented by students who were predominantly deep, predominantly surface or intermediate in their orientation to learning. There was a general decrease in the deep learning score and an increase in the surface learning score of the students on the course, possibly related to the excessive workload in nursing studies. However, there was no direct association with multiple-choice assessment. The academic achievement of students correlated negatively with their surface learning approach. Students (n=31) in four focus group interviews believed that assessments constructed using scenario-based questions, simulated role-play situations and case studies could direct desired learning in order to facilitate their understanding of knowledge, their use of critical thinking, and their application of knowledge.",2008,10.1016/j.nedt.2007.11.004,28,6,711-719,eng,0260-6917,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Educational Measurement/*methods and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Program Evaluation and Analysis of Variance and Learning and Factor Analysis, Statistical and Focus Groups and Statistics, Nonparametric and Clinical Competence and Nursing Methodology Research and Role Playing and Cluster Analysis and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Thinking and Hong Kong and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate/*methods and Education, Nursing, Diploma Programs/*methods and Nursing Education Research and Psychiatric Nursing/education",NA,NA,2008/08//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA

Masiero_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Psycho-cognitive predictors of burnout in healthcare professionals working in emergency departments,"Masiero, Marianna and Cutica, Ilaria and Russo, Selena and Mazzocco, Ketti and Pravettoni, Gabriella",Journal of clinical nursing,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals working in emergency departments commonly experience high work pressure and stress due to witnessing human suffering and the unpredictable nature of the work. Several studies have identified variables that affect burnout syndrome, but poor data are available about the predictors of the different dimensions of burnout (depersonalisation, emotional exhaustion, professional inefficacy and disillusionment). Some research has suggested that alexithymia, coping style and decision-making style may predict burnout. DESIGN: We conducted a noninterventional study to investigate whether and how alexithymia, coping style and decision-making style are associated with the different dimensions of burnout. METHODS: We recruited a convenience sample of 93 healthcare professionals working in an Italian emergency departments. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing their level of burnout (the Link Burnout Questionnaire), and possible burnout predictors: decision-making style, alexithymia and the coping style. Four bivariate linear regressions were performed to define the predictors that characterised the dimensions of burnout. RESULTS: We found that an avoidant decision-making style and a difficulty to identify and describe feelings (a difficulty close to alexithymia even though not as severe) are strong predictors of some burnout dimensions. Individuals who experience relational depersonalisation are more likely to turn to religion as a way to cope. CONCLUSIONS: Our research shows that, to some extent, difficulties in emotion regulation and the attitude to avoid or postpone decisions characterised burnout. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These results might be used to develop tailored psycho-educational interventions. This might help healthcare professionals to develop personal skills to cope with the critical conditions that characterise their work and to enable them to recognise potential risk factors that favour burnout.

Ek_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Registered nurses' experiences of their decision-making at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre,"Ek, Bosse and Svedlund, Marianne",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe registered nurses' experiences at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre. BACKGROUND: It is important that ambulances are urgently directed to patients who are in need of immediate help and of quick transportation to a hospital. Because resources are limited, Emergency Medical Dispatch centres cannot send ambulances with high priority to all callers. The efficiency of the system is therefore dependent on triage. Nurses worldwide are involved in patient triage, both before the patient's arrival to the hospital and in the subsequent emergency care. Ambulance dispatching is traditionally a duty for operators at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres, and in Sweden this duty has become increasingly performed by registered nurses. DESIGN: A qualitative design was used for this study. METHODS: Fifteen registered nurses with experience at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres were interviewed. The participants were asked to describe the content of their work and their experiences. They also described the most challenging and difficult situations according to the critical incidence technique. Content analysis was used. RESULTS: Two themes emerged during the analysis: 'Having a profession with opportunities and obstacles' and 'Meeting serious and difficult situations', with eight sub-themes. The results showed that the decisions to dispatch ambulances were both challenging and difficult. Difficulties included conveying medical advice without seeing the patient, teaching cardio-pulmonary resuscitation via telephone and dealing with intoxicated and aggressive callers. Conflicts with colleagues and ambulance crews as well as fear of making wrong decisions were also mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: Work at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres is a demanding but stimulating duty for registered nurses.

A process evaluation,"Lenzen, Stephanie Anna and Daniels, Ramon and van Bokhoven, Marloes Amantia and van der Weijden, Trudy and Beurskens, Anna",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Primary care nurses play a crucial role in coaching patients in shared decision making about goals and actions. This presents a challenge to practice nurses, who are frequently used to protocol-based working routines. Therefore, an approach was developed to support nurses to coach patients in shared decision making. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how the approach was implemented and experienced by practice nurses and patients. DESIGN: A process evaluation was conducted using quantitative and qualitative methods. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen female practice nurses (aged between 28 and 55 years), working with people suffering from diabetes, COPD, asthma and/or cardiovascular diseases, participated. Nurses were asked to apply the approach to their chronically ill patients and to recruit patients (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>10) willing to participate in an interview or an audio-recording of a consultation (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>13); patients (13 women, 10 men) were aged between 41 and 88 years and suffered from diabetes, COPD or cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: The approach involved a framework for shared decision making about goals and actions, a tool to explore the patient perspective, a patient profiles model and a training course. Interviews (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>15) with nurses, a focus group with nurses (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>9) and interviews with patients (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>10) were conducted. Nurses filled in a questionnaire about their work routine before, during and after the training course. They were asked to deliver audiotapes of their consultations (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>13). RESULTS: Overall, nurses felt that the approach supported them to coach patients in shared decision making. Nurses had become more aware of their own attitudes and learning needs and reported to have had more in-depth discussions with patients. The on-the-job coaching was experienced as valuable. However, nurses struggled to integrate the approach in routine care. They experienced the approach as different to their protocol-based routines and expressed the importance of receiving support and the need for integration of the approach into the family physician practice. CONCLUSION: This study shows that changing practice nurses' role from medical experts to coaches in shared decision making is very complex and requires paying attention to skills and attitudes, as well as to contextual factors. Our results indicate that more time and training might be needed for this role transition. Moreover, it might be worthwhile to focus on organizational learning, in order to increase an organization's capacity to change work routines in a collaborative process.

This study was, therefore, designed to ascertain the aspirations, priorities and preferred mode of CPD for non-medical prescribers. METHOD: Qualitative data were derived from semi-structured in-depth interviews and a focus group given by 16 allied health professionals working in primary and secondary care settings. A topic guide was used to cover clinical decision-making (including difficult decisions), legal aspects of prescribing and diagnostic issues. A content analysis of the verbatim transcripts enabled four key emerging themes to be identified, thus offering a basis for developing a greater understanding of the CPD needs of non-medical prescribers. RESULTS: The four key emerging themes identified are the following: Theme 1: ""Personal anxiety undermining confidence to prescribe"", Theme 2: ""External barriers and other factors that exacerbate anxiety"", Theme 3: ""Need for support identified through coping strategies"", and Theme 4: ""Preferred mode or style of learning"".

Offredy_2008_Injoofnust,JOUR,The use of cognitive continuum theory and patient scenarios to explore nurse prescribers' pharmacological knowledge and decision-making,"Offredy, Maxine and Kendall, Sally and Goodman, Claire",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Nurses have been involved in prescribing in England since 1996, and to date over 41,000 nurses are registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council as prescribers. The majority of evaluative research on nurse prescribing is descriptive and relies on self-report and assessment of patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVES: To explore and test nurse prescribers' pharmacological knowledge and decision-making. DESIGN: An exploratory approach to test the usefulness of patient scenarios in addressing the reasons why nurses decide whether or not to prescribe was utilised. Semi-structured interviews with nurse prescribers using patient scenarios were used as proxy methods of assessment of how nurses made their prescribing decisions. SETTING: Two primary care trusts in the southeast of England were the settings for this study. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling to ensure there was a mixed group of prescribers was used to enable detailed exploration of the research objectives and to obtain in-depth understanding of the complex activities involved in nurse prescribing. METHODS: Interviews and case scenarios. The use of cognitive continuum theory guided the analysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants were unable to identify the issues involved in all the scenarios; they also failed to provide an acceptable solution to the problem, suggesting that they would refer the patient to the general practitioner. A similar number described themselves as 'very confident' while seven participants felt that they were 'not confident' in dealing with medication issues, four of whom were practising prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of social and institutional factors are important in the decision-making process. The lack of appropriate pharmacological knowledge coupled with lack of confidence in prescribing was demonstrated. The scenarios used in this study indicate that nurses are perhaps knowledgeable in their small area of practise but flounder outside this. Further research could be conducted with a larger sample and with more scenarios to explore the decision-making and the pharmacological knowledge base of nurse prescribers, particularly in the light of government policy to extend prescribing rights to non-medical prescribers, including pharmacists.",2008,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2007.01.014,45,6,855-868,eng,0020-7489,England and Humans and *Cognition and *Decision Making and *Drug Prescriptions and Nurses/*psychology,NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Various treatments of differing qualities can be used for patients with localised prostate cancer; these treatments may cause conflicts in treatment decision-making and post-treatment regret. DESIGN: A quantitative longitudinal study. METHODS: A total of 48 patients were recruited from a 3700-bed medical centre in northern Taiwan and assessed at pretreatment and one and six months post-treatment. Demographic characteristics, clinical information and results from the psychosocial adjustment to illness scale, decisional conflict scale and decision regret scale were collected. Data were analysed based on the generalised estimating equations models. RESULTS: The overall decisional conflict substantially improved over time. However, the feeling of being less informed was high and did not improve considerably during the study period. Education level, decision preferences and psychosocial adjustment were associated with decisional conflict and influenced decision-making. The feeling of ineffective decision-making and decisional regret was low, post-treatment. Psychosocial adjustment was associated with effective decision-making and decisional regret. CONCLUSION: In patients with localised prostate cancer, decisional conflict reduced considerably up to six months post-treatment. Moreover, the patients were satisfied with their treatment decision-making and believed that they had made the correct choice up to six months post-treatment. However, patients may have experienced feelings of being less informed pre- and post-treatment, particularly those with lower education levels, a preference for passive roles, or inferior psychosocial adjustment. Consequently, health professionals must provide adequate medical information and psychosocial intervention to help patients in the decision-making process. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and healthcare providers must provide localised prostate cancer patients with adequate information and psychosocial intervention to reduce decisional conflict.",2014,10.1111/jocn.12470,23,13-14,1959-1969,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Humans and Male and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Prospective Studies and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Taiwan and Prostatic Neoplasms/*psychology and *Emotions and psychology and *Conflict, Psychological and prostate cancer",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rassin_2007_Injoofnust,JOUR,"Personal medical documents management--how patients perceive, keep and manage their medical documents: a qualitative study","Rassin, Michal and Zilcha, Lia and Berger, Miri and Silner, Dina",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Absence of medical documents damages the quality of treatment and service. Despite the computerized medical folder, its use is still limited, and not all countries have a national health communications systems. That is why the patients are asked to bring with them the documents they hold. However, some patients lose the documents and others are uncooperative due to forgetfulness, and a lack of knowledge. OBJECTIVES: To examine how patients perceive, keep and manage medical documents. DESIGN: The research was conducted in the qualitative method. SETTINGS: A cardiology clinic, in a big medical center in Israel. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 28 patients suffering from ischemic heart disease and/or rhythm disorders. The sample was a convenience one, and were taken from the population visiting the Cardiology Clinic from May to October 2003. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were held with the participants. The data were processed by means of content analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that, even though the participants expressed that it is the health system's responsibility to manage medical documents, most of them kept, and some even managed, their medical documents via a personal folder. By keeping documents and deciding to whom and when to show them the patient functions as a self-care manager. This made them more involved in their treatment and, they felt in control and empowered.

Johnstone_2007_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Clinical risk management and patient safety education for nurses: a critique,"Johnstone, Megan-Jane and Kanitsaki, Olga",Nurse education today,"Nurses have a pivotal role to play in clinical risk management (CRM) and promoting patient safety in health care domains. Accordingly, nurses need to be prepared educationally to manage clinical risk effectively when delivering patient care. Just what form the CRM and safety education of nurses should take, however, remains an open question. A recent search of the literature has revealed a surprising lack of evidence substantiating models of effective CRM and safety education for nurses. In this paper, a critical discussion is advanced on the question of CRM and safety education for nurses and the need for nurse education in this area to be reviewed and systematically researched as a strategic priority, nationally and internationally. It is a key contention of this paper that without 'good' safety education research it will not be possible to ensure that the educational programs that are being offered to nurses in this area are evidence-based and designed in a manner that will enable nurses to develop the capabilities they need to respond effectively to the multifaceted and complex demands that are inherent in their ethical and professional responsibilities to promote and protect patient safety and quality care in health care domains.",2007,10.1016/j.nedt.2006.04.011,27,3,185-191,eng,0260-6917,"Curriculum and Humans and Quality Assurance, Health Care and Evidence-Based Medicine and Educational Status and Patient Rights and Systems Analysis and Decision Making, Organizational and Health Services Needs and Demand and Patient Care Team/organization & administration and Models, Educational and Clinical Competence and Total Quality Management and Nurse's Role and Education, Nursing/*organization & administration and Medical Errors/nursing/*prevention & control and Risk Management/*organization & administration and Safety Management/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2007/04//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sorensen_2007_Injoofnust,JOUR,Advocacy at end-of-life research design: an ethnographic study of an ICU,"Sorensen, Roslyn and Iedema, Rick",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Clinicians worldwide are being called upon to reconcile accountability for patient outcomes with the resources they consume. In the case of intensive care, contradictory pressures can arise in decisions about continuing treatment where benefit is diminishing. As concern grows about the cost effectiveness of treatment at end-of-life, nursing expertise and advocacy become significant factors in decision making. OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential for a nursing advocacy role within a specific regime of nursing practice: end-of-life care; specifically to examine the concept of nursing advocacy from the literature, to consider its application in the workplace and to assess the capacity for nurses to advocate for people who die in institutions such as intensive care units. DESIGN: Open-ended interviews with nurse managers and educators (4), palliative care specialists (2), chaplain (1), medical managers (2), intensives (7); focus groups with nurses (4 focus groups and 29 participants); patient case studies (13); observation of family conferences (6 conferences and 15 participants); observation of ward rounds (3 ward rounds and 11 participants). Total number of participants: 84. SETTING: A large ICU in a principal referral and teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical staff within, and clinical and non-clinical caregivers external to the unit. METHOD: Qualitative, ethnographic study. RESULTS: Spurious economic imperatives, primacy given to medical intervention, conflict between medical and nursing clinicians about patient management and absence of nursing operational autonomy and organizational authority, impede the opportunity for nurses to define and enact an advocacy role. CONCLUSIONS: If nurses are to be effective patient advocates at end-of-life, they will need to develop clear criteria within which nursing assessments of patient status can be framed, the specialized skills to manage the non-medical needs of dying people and the organizational and political skills to negotiate changing clinical practice and workplace relations.",2007,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2006.07.019,44,8,1343-1353,eng,0020-7489,"Humans and Anthropology, Cultural and Research Design and New South Wales and Intensive Care Units and Attitude to Death and Withholding Treatment and *Decision Making and *Terminal Care and *Patient Advocacy and *Nursing and Physician-Nurse Relations",NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Merrick_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,Australian practice nursing: collaboration in context,"Merrick, Eamon and Fry, Margaret and Duffield, Christine",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore whether or not the context of Australian practice nursing supports collaborative decision-making about organisation and delivery of patient care. BACKGROUND: Positive patient outcomes depend on Australian practice nurses participating in collaborative and interprofessional services, particularly for patients with chronic disease(s). It is unclear whether Australian practice nurses have the opportunity to collaborate in decision-making or how traditional organisational structures may support or hinder collaboration. DESIGN: This is a descriptive exploratory study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a purposive sample of practice nurses (n = 15). Thematic analysis was used to provide meaningful and contextual insights into how practice nurses participate in decision-making. METHOD: An interview tool, based on available literature, was developed and consisted of thirty open-ended questions to direct discussion during telephone interviews. Transcribed data were imported into NVivo(tm) for analysis and interpretation. The collection, analysis and thematic interpretation of data were an iterative process. FINDINGS: Participants fostered trusting interprofessional relationships, which enabled them to influence medical decision-making and thereby advocate for patient need. Trusting interprofessional relationships were perceived to alter the relative roles of the medical practitioner and practice nurse and enhance the opportunities for collaborative decision-making. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Collaborative interprofessional care in Australian general practice must occur if increased demands for care are to be met. It is timely to consider how government policy, financial regulations and the organisation of Australian general practice can better support and enhance a collaborative contribution to care by practice nurses.",2014,10.1111/jocn.12605,23,23-24,3525-3532,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and primary care and Interviews as Topic and policy and New South Wales and Nurse's Role and *Decision Making and *Interprofessional Relations and *Nurse Practitioners and interprofessional practice and nurse roles and practice nursing and Practice Patterns, Nurses'/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2014/12//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chen_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,An exploration of the correlates of nurse practitioners' clinical decision-making abilities,"Chen, Shiah-Lian and Hsu, Hsiu-Ying and Chang, Chin-Fu and Lin, Esther Ching-Lan",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study investigated nurse practitioners' clinical decision-making abilities and the factors that affect these abilities. BACKGROUND: Nurse practitioners play an important role in clinical care decision-making; however, studies exploring the factors that affect their decision-making abilities are lacking. DESIGN: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was employed. METHODS: A purposive sample of 197 nurse practitioners was recruited from a medical centre in central Taiwan. Structured questionnaires consisting of the Knowledge Readiness Scale, the Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory and the Clinical Decision-Making Model Inventory were used to collect data. RESULTS: The intuitive-analytical type was the most commonly used decision-making model, and the intuitive type was the least frequently used model. The decision-making model used was significantly related to the nurse practitioners' work unit. Significant differences were noted between the nurse practitioners' clinical decision-making models and their critical thinking dispositions (openness and empathy). The nurse practitioners' years of work experience, work unit, professional knowledge and critical thinking disposition (openness and empathy as well as holistic and reflective dispositions) predicted the nurse practitioners' analytical decision-making scores. Age, years of nurse practitioner work experience, work unit and critical thinking disposition (holistic and reflective) predicted the nurse practitioners' intuitive decision-making scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the topic of clinical decision-making by describing various types of nurse practitioner decision-making. The factors associated with analytic and intuitive decision-making scores were identified. These findings might be beneficial when planning continuing education programmes to enhance the clinical decision-making abilities of nurse practitioners.

Kilpatrick_2012_Injoofnust,JOUR,How are acute care nurse practitioners enacting their roles in healthcare teams? A descriptive multiple-case study,"Kilpatrick, Kelley and Lavoie-Tremblay, Melanie and Ritchie, Judith A. and Lamothe, Lise and Doran, Diane and Rochefort, Christian",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: In many countries, acute care nurse practitioners contribute to patient care through an expanded scope of practice that includes nursing and medical activities. There have been calls across nations to establish better understanding of how nurse practitioners enact their roles in healthcare teams. The 2006 introduction of cardiology nurse practitioners in Quebec, Canada provides an opportunity to examine this process more closely. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to understand how nurse practitioners enact the medical and expanded nursing portions of their role in healthcare teams. DESIGN: A descriptive multiple-case study design was used. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in two university-affiliated teaching hospitals in Quebec. DATA SOURCES: Data were collected from March 2009 to May 2009. Data sources included interviews (N=59), field notes, documents, and a time and motion study (N=108 h 53 min) of nurse practitioner activities using a validated observation tool. METHODS: The interviews were conducted individually or in groups. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. Descriptive statistics were generated for the time and motion study. RESULTS: The clinical role component, including nursing and medical activities, occupied the largest portion of the nurse practitioners' work time. The pace of nurse practitioner work activities was faster in the first half of the workday in response to patient care demands. The enacted nurse practitioner scope of practice was sensitive to the local context, and the needs of team members, patients and families. Nursing and medical leadership, and the transfer of prescriptive authority and decision-making autonomy affected how nurse practitioners enacted the medical and expanded nursing portions of their roles. Participants believed the pace of work influenced the nurse practitioners' ability to develop relationships with team members, and enact all the components of their role. CONCLUSIONS: The practitioners' scope of practice changed in response to pressures inside and outside healthcare teams or a lack of healthcare system structures. The study findings appear to be applicable to nurse practitioners working in other specialties, and in other countries. Future research needs to examine how the pace of work affects the nurse practitioners' ability to provide care.",2012,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.01.011,49,7,850-862,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Decision Making and Quebec and *Patient Care Team and *Nursing Staff, Hospital and *Nurse's Role and *Nurse Practitioners",NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Charalambous_2010_Injoofnust,JOUR,Interpreting patients as a means of clinical practice: introducing nursing hermeneutics,"Charalambous, Andreas",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: The increased reference to hermeneutics from nursing scientists, researchers and academics has emphasized that interpretation has traditionally been a fundamental part of nursing practice. In nursing research a propensity for acquiring knowledge and understanding by using, multiple modalities has been demonstrated. In recent years, the use of hermeneutic phenomenology, has featured amongst these modalities. Hermeneutic phenomenology is an inquiry arm of, philosophical hermeneutics. OBJECTIVES: To explore the hypotheses that the patient can be considered as ""text"" and as such to be, interpreted in order to gain information for decision-making in clinical practice. DESIGN: A qualitative approach (hermeneutic phenomenological) to nursing clinical practice. SETTINGS: The clinical case of a patient suffering from cancer is described in the paper who was treated, in an Oncology Centre in Cyprus. METHODS: A hermeneutical model of clinical decision-making in nursing is implemented in practice. The, model was initially used in medical practice; however it finds applications to nursing as well. According, to the model, a patient is perceived as a literary text which may be interpreted on four levels: (1) the, literal facts of the patient's body and the literal story told by the patient, (2) the nursing diagnostic, meaning of the literal data, (3) the praxis (the nursing interventions) emanating from the nursing, diagnosis, and (4) the change effected by the clinical encounter in both the patient's and nurse's lifeworlds. RESULTS: Nursing interventions were successfully informed by the interpretation process.",2010,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.02.011,47,10,1283-1291,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and Decision Making and *Nursing and Cyprus and Neoplasms/nursing,NA,NA,2010/10//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Goethals_2010_Injoofnust,JOUR,Nurses' ethical reasoning and behaviour: a literature review,"Goethals, Sabine and Gastmans, Chris and de Casterle, Bernadette Dierckx",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Today's healthcare system requires that nurses have strong medical-technical competences and the ability to focus on the ethical dimension of care. For nurses, coping with the ethical dimension of care in practise is very difficult. Often nurses cannot act according to their own personal values and norms. This generates internal moral distress, which has a negative impact on both nurses and patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is a thorough analysis of the literature about nurses' ethical practise particularly with regard to their processes of ethical reasoning and decision making and implementation of those decisions in practise. DESIGN: We conducted an extensive search of the electronic databases Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and PsycInfo for papers published between January 1988 and September 2008. A broad range of search keywords was used. The 39 selected articles had a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method design. FINDINGS: Despite the conceptual difficulties that the literature on the ethical practise of nurses suffers, in this review we understand nurses' ethical practise a complex process of reasoning, decision making, and implementation of the decision in practise. The process of decision making is more than a pure cognitive process; it is influenced by personal and contextual factors. The difficulties nurses encounter in their ethical conduct are linked to their difficult work environment. As a result, nurses often capitulate to the decisions made by others, which results in a conformist way of acting and less individually adapted care. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides us with a more nuanced understanding of the way nurses reason and act in ethically difficult situations than emerged previously. If we want to support nurses in their ethical care and if we want to help them to change their conformist practises, more research is needed. Especially needed are in-depth qualitative studies that explore the experiences of nurses. Such studies could help us better understand not only how nurses reason and behave in practise but also the relationship between these two processes.",2010,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.12.010,47,5,635-650,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"*Decision Making and Nurses/*psychology and *Ethics, Nursing",NA,NA,2010/05//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Thompson_2017_Joofadnu,JOUR,A comparative study on the clinical decision-making processes of nurse practitioners vs. medical doctors using scenarios in a secondary care environment,"Thompson, Stephen and Moorley, Calvin and Barratt, Julian",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To investigate the decision-making skills of secondary care nurse practitioners compared with those of medical doctors. BACKGROUND: A literature review was conducted, searching for articles published from 1990 - 2012. The review found that nurse practitioners are key to the modernization of the National Health Service. Studies have shown that compared with doctors, nurse practitioners can be efficient and cost-effective in consultations. DESIGN: Qualitative research design. METHODS: The information processing theory and think aloud approach were used to understand the cognitive processes of 10 participants (5 doctors and 5 nurse practitioners). One nurse practitioner was paired with one doctor from the same speciality and they were compared using a structured scenario-based interview. To ensure that all critical and relevant cues were covered by the individual participating in the scenario, a reference model was used to measure the degree of successful diagnosis, management and treatment. This study was conducted from May 2012 - January 2013. RESULTS: The data were processed for 5 months, from July to November 2012. The two groups of practitioners differed in the number of cue acquisitions obtained in the scenarios. In our study, nurse practitioners took 3 minutes longer to complete the scenarios. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that nurse practitioner consultations are comparable to those of medical doctors in a secondary care environment in terms of correct diagnoses and therapeutic treatments.

BACKGROUND: In chronic diseases, pathogenic-oriented health care falls short in generating all the information required for determining healthcare provision to improve health. A broader, so-called salutogenic approach, by using the ICF, focusing on how to stay healthy, rather than on what causes diseases, seems more appropriate. DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparative study using data from a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Data about patient problems and professional healthcare activities were collected from a total of 81 patients with severe multiple sclerosis who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the ICF group, assessed with a functioning assessment (n = 43), and the medical group, assessed with a conventional medical assessment (n = 38). Data were analysed statistically using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: A functioning assessment resulted in the registration of significantly more patient problems in the health components 'participation' and 'environmental factors', as well as significantly more professional healthcare activities befitting these components. The ICF group had a significant positive correlation between registered problems by health professionals and patients' self-reported problems, whereas the medical group had several negative correlations. CONCLUSION: A functioning assessment resulted in a care plan that not only was broader and more complete but also reflected the patients' self-reported problems more closely than a medical assessment, without a loss of focus on medical problems. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study has shown that some health problems remain unnoticed by a medical assessment alone, which is especially important for the chronically ill.

Klest_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,Factors affecting surgery decision-making in patients with a chronic neurovascular condition,"Klest, Bridget and Mutschler, Christina and Tamaian, Andreea",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the factors that affect patient decision-making for an elective surgery. BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations are lesions found in the brain and spinal cord comprised of abnormal blood vessels, which bleed sporadically causing serious neurological deficits. Course of treatment for cerebral cavernous malformation is often ultimately left up to the patient, and can include symptom management or surgery. Decision-making for surgery in life-threatening conditions has been well documented in the literature. Less extensive research has focused on elective surgeries, where patients have a choice. There has been no research on the factors that affect decision-making for cavernous malformation patients. DESIGN: Correlational self-report survey. METHODS: In part of a larger online study, participants were asked to rate the importance of six factors on their decision-making about surgery for cavernous malformation. RESULTS: Factors that were rated most important for individuals' decision-making included doctor's opinion regarding surgery, presence of disabling symptoms, fear of symptoms getting worse or developing new symptoms, and availability of an expert surgeon. Results indicated that these were rated as more important than having social support during recovery or having the means to pay for surgery. Additionally, having social support during recovery was rated as significantly more important than having the means to pay for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that affect decision-making for patients diagnosed with cavernous malformation were similar to those found with other medical conditions requiring elective surgery. This study will assist healthcare workers in understanding the decision-making process of individuals who may choose an elective surgery for potentially disabling conditions with uncertain outcomes.

Pattison_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Managing clinical uncertainty: An ethnographic study of the impact of critical care outreach on end-of-life transitions in ward-based critically ill patients with a life-limiting illness,"Pattison, Natalie and Mclellan, Jude and Roskelly, Lara and McLeod, Kirsty and Wiseman, Theresa",Journal of clinical nursing,"Rapid response teams, such as critical care outreach teams, have prominent roles in managing end-of-life transitions in critical illness, often questioning appropriateness of treatment escalation. Clinical uncertainty presents clinicians with dilemmas in how and when to escalate or de-escalate treatment. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how critical care outreach team decision-making processes affect the management of transition points for critically ill, ward-based patients with a life-limiting illness. METHODS: An ethnographic study across two hospitals observed transition points and decisions to de-escalate treatment, through the lens of critical care outreach. In-depth interviews were carried out to elucidate rationales for practices witnessed in observations. Detailed field notes were taken and placed in a descriptive account. Ethnographic data were analysed, categorised and organised into themes using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Data were collected over 74 weeks, encompassing 32 observation periods with 20 staff, totalling more than 150 hr. Ten formal staff interviews and 20 informal staff interviews were undertaken. Three main themes emerged: early decision-making and the role of critical care outreach; communicating end-of-life transitions; end-of-life care and the input of critical care outreach. Findings suggest there is a negotiation to achieve smooth transitions for individual patients, between critical care outreach, and parent or ward medical teams. This process of negotiation is subject to many factors that either hinder or facilitate timely transitions. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care outreach teams have an important role in shared decision-making. Associated emotional costs relate to conflict with parent medical teams, and working as lone practitioners. The cultural contexts in which teams work have a significant effect on their interactions and agency. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: There needs to be a cultural shift towards early and open discussion of treatment goals and limitations of medical treatment, particularly when facing serious illness. With training and competencies, outreach nurses are well placed to facilitate these discussions.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14618,27,21-22,3900-3912,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Uncertainty and Humans and ethnography and Anthropology, Cultural and Interviews as Topic and *Decision Making and Critical Care/*organization & administration and Patient Care Team/*organization & administration and Terminal Care/*methods and end-of-life decision-making and Negotiating and critical care outreach and Critical Illness/nursing",NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rycroft.Malone_2009_Joofclnu,JOUR,Protocol-based care: the standardisation of decision-making?,"Rycroft-Malone, Jo and Fontenla, Marina and Seers, Kate and Bick, Debra",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: To explore how protocol-based care affects clinical decision-making. BACKGROUND: In the context of evidence-based practice, protocol-based care is a mechanism for facilitating the standardisation of care and streamlining decision-making through rationalising the information with which to make judgements and ultimately decisions. However, whether protocol-based care does, in the reality of practice, standardise decision-making is unknown. This paper reports on a study that explored the impact of protocol-based care on nurses' decision-making. DESIGN: Theoretically informed by realistic evaluation and the promoting action on research implementation in health services framework, a case study design using ethnographic methods was used. Two sites were purposively sampled; a diabetic and endocrine unit and a cardiac medical unit. METHODS: Within each site, data collection included observation, postobservation semi-structured interviews with staff and patients, field notes, feedback sessions and document review. Data were inductively and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Decisions made by nurses in both sites were varied according to many different and interacting factors. While several standardised care approaches were available for use, in reality, a variety of information sources informed decision-making. The primary approach to knowledge exchange and acquisition was person-to-person; decision-making was a social activity. Rarely were standardised care approaches obviously referred to; nurses described following a mental flowchart, not necessarily linked to a particular guideline or protocol. When standardised care approaches were used, it was reported that they were used flexibly and particularised. CONCLUSIONS: While the logic of protocol-based care is algorithmic, in the reality of clinical practice, other sources of information supported nurses' decision-making process. This has significant implications for the political goal of standardisation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The successful implementation and judicious use of tools such as protocols and guidelines will likely be dependant on approaches that facilitate the development of nurses' decision-making processes in parallel to paying attention to the influence of context.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02605.x,18,10,1490-1500,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and United Kingdom and *Decision Making and *Clinical Protocols and Nurses/*psychology,NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Higgins_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,Nutrition and hydration in dying patients: the perceptions of acute care nurses,"Higgins, Isabel and van der Riet, Pamela and Sneesby, Ludmilla and Good, Phillip",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions of nurses regarding the provision and nonprovision of medical nutrition and hydration during the end stage of life when death is imminent in the acute care setting. BACKGROUND: When people are dying, they often experience a loss of appetite and desire for drinking which are natural processes at this time. The cessation of eating and drinking challenges both family members and clinical staff. This article builds on previous studies that describe the perceptions of medical doctors and palliative care nurses regarding medical nutrition and hydration during the end stage of life when death is imminent. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design. METHODS: This study included three focus group meetings with ten nurses in an acute care setting in medical, oncology and haematology units. An interview schedule was used to guide the discussions. RESULTS: The main theme to emerge from this study was 'finding a comfort space/ambiguous spaces of unrest' that included four subthemes: (1) limited involvement in decision-making, (2) comfort vs. discomfort, (3) uncertainty and (4) the comfort of withdrawing treatment. Finding a comfort space captures the challenges nurses faced when speaking about the concerns of patients and family. In this space, there were ambiguities that created unease and unrest: a reluctance to talk about death; a reluctance to engage with the patient and the family. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care nurses need to be more cognisant of the palliative approach to care and become more engaged with decision-making during the end stage of life when death is imminent. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses in acute care settings need to be involved in decision-making and advocate for patients and family during the dying phase.

Arias_2007_Joofclnu,JOUR,Early mobilization of acute stroke patients,"Arias, Monica and Smith, Lorraine N.",Journal of clinical nursing,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the early mobilization of acute stroke patients. DESIGN: Postal survey. SETTING: Thirteen health boards in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine health professionals of whom 39 were doctors, 39 nurses and 21 physiotherapists. RESULTS: There was a lack of understanding and agreement across the three professions in terms of what was meant by 'early mobilization'. Further, the duration, frequency, intensity, risk/benefits and activities associated with early mobilization are undescribed despite clinical guidelines urging its use. Multi-disciplinary decision making regarding early mobilization was not self-evident. CONCLUSIONS: (i) An evidence-base for early mobilization is required along with agreement on what physiological monitoring should be undertaken while early mobilization is on going; (ii) Health professionals need a greater awareness of the evidence linking stroke complications with patient immobilization and in particular in relation to pressure sores, painful shoulder and falls; (iii) The clinical decision to mobilize an acute stroke patient early should be made explicitly within a multi-disciplinary acute stroke team; (iv) There is an absolute need for further research into early mobilization in terms of intensity, duration, frequency, risks and benefits in relations to types of stroke of early mobilization. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Early mobilization in acute stroke care is recommended in a range of European, American and UK policy guidelines as a strategy to minimize or prevent complications. However the evidence-base to support early mobilization in acute stroke is missing.

Bingham_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,The pre-Medical Emergency Team response: Nurses' decision-making escalating deterioration to treating teams using urgent review criteria,"Bingham, Gordon and Fossum, Mariann and Hughes, Leanne and Digby, Robin and Bucknall, Tracey",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To describe nurses' decision-making, experiences and perceptions of escalating deteriorating patients to the treating medical team using urgent clinical review criteria. DESIGN: A qualitative design comprising individual in-depth interviews with nurses from a major Australian metropolitan tertiary teaching hospital. METHOD: A purposive sample of 30 Registered Nurses from nine surgical and medical wards were interviewed in April 2018 using semi-structured interviews. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Identified themes included: detecting the deterioration; countering the problem; getting a response; and challenges faced in the process of escalation. Nurses reported an important awareness, sense of responsibility, and critical thinking to ensure the safe management and escalation of deteriorating patients. However, barriers to escalation necessitated individual workarounds and organizational structures to mitigate patient risk. CONCLUSION: This study supports the importance of communication between clinical teams and recognizes that it is crucial to enable a fail-safe experience for patients and families. Recognition of disciplinary contributions to patients' goals of care is required to better understand and address the prevalence of deteriorating patients. Our study is among the first to explore the actual experience of nurses who articulate balancing uncertainty and managing complex team dynamics on wards for patients experiencing deteriorating health status. The information may assist in determining team training strategies and structures to facilitate patient management during deterioration.

Thrysoee_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Management of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation in an outpatient clinic setting-patient's perspectives and experiences,"Thrysoee, Lars and Stromberg, Anna and Brandes, Axel and Hendriks, Jeroen M.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To gain in-depth knowledge of patients' experiences of the consultation processes at a multidisciplinary atrial fibrillation outpatient clinic in a university hospital in Denmark. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated as recommended. Patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation preferably should be managed in an outpatient setting which includes medical examination, patient education and decision-making on medical therapy. DESIGN: This is a qualitative study of 14 patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, ranging from asymptomatic patients, to those with mild to severe symptoms; they were all referred from general practitioners. METHODS: Data were generated in 2013-2015 using participant observation during each consultation, followed by individual interviews postconsultation. RESULTS: Patients were referred with limited information on AF and knowledge about the management consultation procedures. The consultations were performed in a professional way by the cardiologist as well as by the nurses with an emphasis on the medical aspects of atrial fibrillation. The understanding that atrial fibrillation is not a fatal disease in itself was very important for patients. At the same time, visiting the clinic was overwhelming, information was difficult to understand, and patients found it difficult to be involved in decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that patients were uncertain on what AF was before as well as after their consultation. The communication was concentrated on the medical aspects of atrial fibrillation and visiting the clinic was an overwhelming experience for the patients. They had difficulty understanding what atrial fibrillation was, why they were treated with anticoagulation, and that anticoagulating was a lifelong treatment. RELEVANCE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study demonstrates some lack of patient-centred care and an absence of tailored patient AF-related education. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for and importance of active patient involvement.",2018,10.1111/jocn.13951,27,3-4,601-611,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Communication and Denmark and Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and atrial fibrillation and Ambulatory Care Facilities and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Patient Participation and Anticoagulants/therapeutic use and *Nurse-Patient Relations and Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy/nursing/*psychology and clinical management and multidisciplinary care and outpatient clinic and patient experiences",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Thompson_2017_Joofadnu_1,JOUR,The concept of exposure in environmental health for nursing,"Thompson, Marcella Remer and Schwartz Barcott, Donna",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To report an analysis of the concept of exposure in environmental health for nursing. BACKGROUND: The importance of the environment has long been recognized in nursing, although the nature and scope of the concept and how it influences health have varied over time. Exposure is the sufficient and necessary link between environment and health. In nursing practice, the word 'exposure' has been used frequently with no clear standard definition. DESIGN: Concept analysis using Kim's first-level analytics. DATA SOURCES: Chronological review (1980-2015) of the nursing science literature was conducted through ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and CINAHL, followed by a multi-disciplinary search through PubMed (1980-2015), texts and the Internet to compare definitions and measurements of exposure and related concepts. METHODS: Explicit and implicit conceptual definitions and measurements of exposure were identified, categorized and analysed. RESULTS: The newly defined concept of 'exposure' is a process involves three phases: 1, contact is made between a target and one or more agents in the same environment; 2, the agent accesses the target by one or more routes of entry; and 3, the agent enters the target by crossing a barrier or boundary. Existing measurements related to each phase are identified and discussed. Definitions of 'target' and 'agent' were refined for congruency. CONCLUSION: Consistent use of terms as defined is critical to development of nursing knowledge. These concepts should be incorporated into nursing-related research to evaluate their usefulness to nursing. Alignment of this concept with relevant theories should be critically examined.",2017,10.1111/jan.13246,73,6,1315-1330,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and nursing and *Nurses and *Health Facility Environment and *Nursing Research and concept analysis and environmental health and exposure and knowledge development,NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Understanding how low health literacy may influence health outcomes is important. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: A total of 326 asthma patients aged 20 years and older (average: 51 <c2><b1> 18<c2><b7>3 years) were recruited by purposive sampling from pulmonary medicine outpatient departments at three medical centres and a regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. Data were collected via structured questionnaires, including measures of socio-demographic and disease characteristics; medical decision-making; asthma knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy; healthcare experience and health outcome-related factors (metered-dose inhaler/dry-powder inhaler usage proficiency, medical use, self-management behaviour). Three hundred patients who met the inclusion criteria and completed the questionnaire survey were analysed. RESULTS: Overall, 217 subjects (72<c2><b7>3%) had adequate functional health literacy, 42 (14%) had inadequate functional health literacy, and 41 (13<c2><b7>7%) had marginal functional health literacy. Subjects' average asthma knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy scores were 7<c2><b7>23 <c2><b1> 2<c2><b7>69, 51<c2><b7>46 <c2><b1> 6<c2><b7>18 and 58<c2><b7>31 <c2><b1> 8<c2><b7>10, respectively. Health literacy correlated positively with asthma knowledge (r = 0<c2><b7>605), attitudes (r = 0<c2><b7>192) and medical decision-making (r = 0<c2><b7>413). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy is positively associated with proficiency in metered-dose inhaler usage, asthma knowledge, attitudes and medical decision-making, but is not significantly associated with medical care use and self-management behaviour. Health literacy had an indirect effect on self-management behaviour through the mediation effect of asthma attitudes. No moderator was found for the effect of health literacy on health outcome-related factors.

Porter_2007_Joofadnu,JOUR,New midwifery? A qualitative analysis of midwives' decision-making strategies,"Porter, Sam and Crozier, Kenda and Sinclair, Marlene and Kernohan, W. George",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to explore the reasons why midwives decided to adopt observed decision-making strategies relating to the use of technology. BACKGROUND: Literature on the development of midwifery and nursing has suggested that they are developing more egalitarian relationships with clients in decision-making processes. METHODS: A qualitative approach was adopted, using participant observation with a convenience sample of midwives (n=16), and a focus group of midwives (n=8). Data collection took place over 9 months in 2004. FINDINGS: The dominant mode of decision-making was bureaucratic decision-making, which involved adherence to written policies and procedures. The least frequently used was 'new professional' decision-making, which involved collaboration with clients. The reasons for midwives' approaches could be categorized under three main headings: first, context, including possible litigation, management strategies, workload pressures, and medical dominance; second, midwives' characteristics, including both lack of experience and the reliance on tradition of some experienced midwives; and third, women's perceived characteristics, some of whom were seen by midwives as either unwilling or unable to participate in decision-making. There was also implicit evidence that some midwives were uncomfortable with the new professional rebalancing of power relations between professionals and the laity. CONCLUSION: Managers need to question whether the strategies they adopt hinder or support clinicians in their efforts to involve women in decisions. Clinicians need to consider whether they wish to be selective or universal in their use of new professional strategies.",2007,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04449.x,60,5,525-534,eng,0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Adaptation, Psychological and Focus Groups and Decision Making/*physiology and Delivery of Health Care/methods and Nurse Midwives/*psychology and *Nurse-Patient Relations",NA,NA,2007/12//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chan_2021_Injoofnust,JOUR,"The effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Chan, Janice Kuang Yeung and Klainin-Yobas, Piyanee and Chi, Yuchen and Gan, Javeil Ke En and Chow, Gigi and Wu, Xi Vivien",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Falls in older adults result in serious, life-limiting consequences. An increasing number of fall prevention interventions have used technology to reduce the number of falls in community-dwelling adults. Various types of e-interventions are being tested in clinical trials and in the community. These include telehealth, exergames, cognitive games, socialized training, smart home systems and non-conventional balance training. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the overall effectiveness of e-interventions and compared the effectiveness of the different types. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to synthesize best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A rigorous three-step search was conducted in nine online databases for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials studying e-interventions. Studies were screened and assessed for individual and overall risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Six fall-related outcomes were evaluated in the meta-analysis: fall risk, balance, lower extremity strength, fall efficacy, cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were conducted during meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies fit the eligibility criteria and had an overall 74.7% low risk of bias. A total of 4,877 older adults from 17 countries were included in narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Telehealth combined with exercise programmes and smart home systems were able to reduce fall risk significantly (risk ratio=0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.86]). E-interventions also significantly improved balance and fall efficacy (standardized mean difference=0.28, 95% CI [0.04, 0.53]). However, lower extremity strength, cognitive function and health-related quality of life did not show significant improvements. CONCLUSION: Telehealth combined with exercise and smart home systems demonstrated the best evidence of effectiveness in reduction of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Future research should focus on forecasting falls using smart home technology and Artificial Intelligence, and testing promising e-interventions on larger samples to improve the strength of evidence of fall prevention by e-interventions.",2021,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103784,113,NA,103784,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and Aged and Technology and Cognition and Quality of life and Exercise Therapy and Artificial Intelligence and *Quality of Life and *Independent Living and Older adults and Cognitive training and Community-dwelling and Exergames and Fall and Non-conventional balance training and Smart home systems and Socialized exercise and Telehealth,NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johnsen_2018_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Nursing students' perceptions of a video-based serious game's educational value: A pilot study,"Johnsen, Hege M. and Fossum, Mariann and Vivekananda-Schmidt, Pirashanthie and Fruhling, Ann and Slettebo, Ashild",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing number of serious games (SGs) in nursing education, few evaluation studies specifically address their educational value in terms of face, content, and construct validity. OBJECTIVES: To assess nursing students' perceptions of a video-based SG in terms of face, content, and construct validity. In addition, the study assessed perceptions of usability, individual factors, and preferences regarding future use. DESIGN: A pilot study was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An SG prototype was implemented as part of two simulation courses in nursing education: one for home health care and one for hospital medical-surgical wards. The SG aimed to teach clinical reasoning and decision-making skills to nursing students caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 249second-year nursing students participated in pilot testing of the SG. METHOD: A paper-based survey was used to assess students' perceptions of the SG's educational value. RESULTS: Overall, students from both simulation courses perceived the SG as educationally valuable and easy to use. No significant differences were found in perceptions of educational value between nursing students with previous healthcare experience versus those with none. However, significantly more students in the home healthcare simulation course indicated that the SG tested their clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. Students from both the medical-surgical and home healthcare simulation courses suggested that more video-based SGs should be developed and used in nursing education. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the survey results indicate that the participants perceived the SG as educationally valuable, and that the SG has potential as an educational tool in nursing education, especially in caring for patients with chronic diseases and in home healthcare simulation. Showing a SG's educational value and user acceptance among nursing students may justify the development and application of more SGs in nursing education.",2018,10.1016/j.nedt.2017.12.022,62,NA,62-68,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Health care and Humans and Female and Male and Young Adult and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Computer simulation and Games and Clinical Competence and Validation and *Video Games and *Learning and Survey and Clinical decision-making and Students, Nursing/*psychology and *Problem Solving and Nursing Education Research and Computer Simulation/statistics & numerical data and E-learning and Education, Nursing",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Abuzour_2018_Joofadnu,JOUR,A qualitative study exploring how pharmacist and nurse independent prescribers make clinical decisions,"Abuzour, Aseel S. and Lewis, Penny J. and Tully, Mary P.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how secondary care pharmacist and nurse independent prescribers clinically reason when making prescribing decisions. BACKGROUND: Clinical reasoning is a central component of prescribers' competence and professional autonomy when reaching a clinically appropriate decision. Like doctors, pharmacist and nurse independent prescribers in the UK have extensive prescribing rights, but little is known about their clinical reasoning. DESIGN: A qualitative approach using a think-aloud methodology and semi-structured interviews. METHODS: Eleven nurse and 10 pharmacist independent prescribers were asked to think-aloud about validated clinical vignettes prior to interview, between March - December 2015. Data were analysed using a constant-comparative approach. RESULTS: A strong link between clinical knowledge, grounded in previous experience and clinical reasoning was found. Despite prescribers approaching the clinical vignettes holistically, their focus varied according to professional background and job role. Nurses were more likely to describe interacting with patients, compared with pharmacists who were more focused on medical notes and laboratory results. Think-aloud protocol analysis revealed a distinct pattern in the process undertaken to reach a clinical decision. This is presented as a decision-making model, encompassing case familiarization, generating hypotheses, case assessment, final hypotheses and decision-making stages, which oscillated throughout the model. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore the clinical reasoning processes of secondary care pharmacist and nurse independent prescribers. The resultant decision-making model shows clinical reasoning as a complex and dynamic process. This model can inform the training of independent prescribers to become accurate problem solvers and continue making clinically appropriate decisions.",2018,10.1111/jan.13375,74,1,65-74,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and United Kingdom and Qualitative Research and Models, Psychological and Patient Safety and Professional Role and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Drug Prescriptions and Nurses/*psychology and nurses and clinical competence and clinical reasoning and independent prescribing and non-medical prescribing and pharmacists and Pharmacists/*psychology",NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Firnhaber_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,Nursing staff participation in end-of-life nutrition and hydration decision-making in a nursing home: A qualitative study,"Firnhaber, Gina C. and Roberson, Donna W. and Kolasa, Kathryn M.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To better understand the participation of nursing staff in end-of-life nutrition and hydration decision-making in an American nursing home. DESIGN: A qualitative exploration with ethnographic focus. METHODS: In April 2017, in-person, semi-structured interviews were performed with 19 nursing staff members in a nursing home located in the south-eastern United States. Additional information was gathered through participant observation during interviews and review of organizational and regulatory policies. Transcripts were coded and analysed using qualitative methods described by Roper and Shapira (2000). RESULTS: Three primary themes relating to nursing staff participation in end-of-life nutrition and hydration decision-making were identified: (a) Formal decision-making: decisions made and implemented by persons with the authority to make legal and binding care decisions in the nursing home setting; (b) Informal decision-making: decisions not requiring medical orders; and (c) Influential factors: factors that influence actions of nursing staff. CONCLUSION: A variety of factors have an impact on nursing staff participation in end-of-life nutrition and hydration decision-making. Participation is closely aligned with the type of decision, whether formal or informal, and role, whether Certified Nursing Assistant/Aide, Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurse, or Registered Nurse. IMPACT: End-of-life nutrition and hydration decision-making in nursing homes differs from decision-making in other care settings and presents a challenge globally.

Gazarian_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,A description of nurses' decision-making in managing electrocardiographic monitor alarms,"Gazarian, Priscilla K. and Carrier, Natalie and Cohen, Rachel and Schram, Haley and Shiromani, Samara",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the cues and factors that nurses use in their decision-making when responding to clinical alarms. BACKGROUND: Alarms are designed to be very sensitive, and as a result, they are not very specific. Lack of adherence to the practice standards for electrocardiographic monitoring in hospital settings has been observed, resulting in overuse of the electrocardiographic monitoring. Monitoring without consideration of clinical indicators uses scarce healthcare resources and may even produce untoward circumstances because of alarm fatigue. With so many false alarms, alarm fatigue represents a symptom of a larger problem. It cannot be fixed until all of the factors that contribute to its existence have been examined. DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study. METHOD: This study was conducted at an academic medical centre located in the Northeast United States. Eight participants were enrolled using purposive sampling. Nurses were observed for two three-hour periods. Following each observation, the nurse was interviewed using the critical decision method to describe the cognitive processes related to the alarm activities. Qualitative data from the conducted interviews were analysed via an a priori framework founded in the critical decision method. RESULTS: This study reveals information, experience, guidance and decision-making as the four prominent categories contributing to nurses' decision-making in relation to alarm management. Managing technology was a category not identified a priori that emerged in the data analysis. CONCLUSION: Nurses revealed a breadth of information needed to adequately identify and interpret monitor alarms, and how they used that information to put the alarms into the particular context of an individual patient's situations.

Kilpatrick_2013_Joofclnu,JOUR,Understanding acute care nurse practitioner communication and decision-making in healthcare teams,"Kilpatrick, Kelley",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to describe communication and decision-making in healthcare teams following the introduction of an acute care nurse practitioner role. BACKGROUND: Healthcare teams need to establish clear processes for communication and decision-making about patient care to be effective. Little is known about how acute care nurse practitioners affect these team processes. DESIGN: Observational/descriptive study. METHODS: Structured non-participant observations of acute care nurse practitioners and healthcare team members during routine patient care activities were completed to identify the verbal and non-verbal behaviours. Data were collected in two hospitals in one Canadian province from March-May 2009 for a total of 17 hours and 23 minutes. Descriptive statistics were generated. RESULTS: Differences in communication and decision-making were noted between the cases. The acute care nurse practitioners in Case 1 spoke most frequently with physicians when making patient care decisions while the acute care nurse practitioners in Case 2 spoke most frequently with the nurses. The acute care nurse practitioners needed to validate all patient care decisions if prescriptive authority had not been transferred to them. DISCUSSION: Much of the potential of acute care nurse practitioner roles rests on the ability to enact the full scope of their role. Acute care nurse practitioner scope of practice depends on the legislation, the transfer of decision-making authority in the organisation, and the messages received form the medical and nursing leadership group. CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be the first in-depth description of communication and decision-making in healthcare teams following the introduction of acute care nurse practitioners and furthers our understanding of how system-level imperatives filter down to healthcare teams.

Walsh_2022_Joofclnu,JOUR,Exploring acute care nurses' decision-making in psychotropic PRN use in hospitalised people with dementia,"Walsh, Brittany and Dahlke, Sherry and O'Rourke, Hannah and Hunter, Kathleen F.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To understand how acute care nurses make decisions about administering ""as-needed"" (PRN) psychotropic medications to hospitalised people with dementia (PWD). BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia occur in approximately 75% of PWD admitted to acute care. Despite this, few studies provide insight into the use and prevalence of psychotropic use in acute care. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used to explore acute care nurses' decision-making about PRN psychotropic medication administration to PWD. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight nurses from three acute care medical units in a large tertiary hospital in Western Canada. Conventional content analysis was used to develop three themes that reflect nurses' decision-making related to administering PRNs to hospitalised PWD. COREQ guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Three themes of legitimising control, making the patient fit and future telling were developed. Legitimising control involved medicating undesirable behaviours to promote the nurses' perceptions of safety. Making the patient fit involved maintaining routine and order. Future telling involved pre-emptively medicating to prevent undesirable behaviours from escalating. Nurses provided little to no mention of assessing for physical causes contributing to behaviours. PRNs were seen as a reasonable alternative to physical restraints and were frequently used. Additionally, organisational and unit routines greatly influenced nurses' decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide an initial understanding of how nurses make decisions to administer PRN medications to hospitalised older people and may inform prescribing practices. There were novel findings about the lack of assessment prior to PRN administration, and the nurses' collective response in decision-making. More research is needed to better understand the complexities of nurses' decision-making, to assist in the development of interventions for nursing practice.",2022,10.1111/jocn.15477,31,13-14,2024-2035,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Hospitalization and Humans and Aged and qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and older people and *Nurses and *Dementia/drug therapy and Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use and psychotropic medication and responsive behaviours,NA,NA,2022/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Meeker_2009_Joofclnu,JOUR,Metasynthesis: withdrawing life-sustaining treatments: the experience of family decision-makers,"Meeker, Mary Ann and Jezewski, Mary Ann",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: The present study was undertaken to synthesise findings from qualitative investigations of family participation in decisions to withdraw and/or withhold life-sustaining treatment from a seriously ill family member. BACKGROUND: As a consequence of increasing effectiveness and sophistication of available medical interventions, death is commonly preceded by a decision to withdraw or withhold potentially life-sustaining treatments. These decisions take place in a bioethical context characterised by the pre-eminence of self-determination, but patients are typically too ill to make their own decisions. Thus, family members are called upon to participate in these morally consequential decisions on the patient's behalf. DESIGN: Metasynthesis. METHOD: Metasynthesis is a form of inquiry that provides for integration of qualitative studies' findings to strengthen knowledge for practice and advance theoretical development. This metasynthesis was conducted using the constant comparative methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: Family members engage in a process of participation in decision-making that is comprised of three major categories: reframing reality, relating and integrating. Surrogates used both cues and information as they reframed their understanding of the patient's status. Relationships with providers and with other family members powerfully influenced the decision-making process. Integrating was characterised by reconciling and going forward. This part of the process has both intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects and describes how family decision-makers find meaning in their experience and move forward in their lives. CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis provides a more comprehensive and empirically supported understanding of family members' experiences as they participate in treatment decisions for dying family members. Relevance to clinical practice. This metasynthesis provides evidence to improve family care during treatment withdrawal/withholding decision-making and a theoretical model that can be used to guide creation of clinical practice guidelines. Through increased understanding of family members' experiences, clinicians can more effectively support family decision-making processes.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02465.x,18,2,163-173,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and *Decision Making and Family/*psychology and *Withholding Treatment and *Euthanasia, Passive",NA,NA,2009/01//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Huang_2012_Joofclnu,JOUR,Fathers of children with disabilities: encounters with health professionals in a Chinese context,"Huang, Yu-Ping and Tsai, Sen-Wei and Kellett, Ursula",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the experiences of fathers of developmentally disabled children during interactions with health professionals in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: The role of Chinese fathers in raising a disabled child has been neglected because most studies on the impact of parenting a child with disabilities in this culture have primarily focused on mothers. DESIGN: A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was undertaken to recover and interpret fathers' experiences. METHOD: Sixteen fathers living with their disabled child (0-18 years old) were purposively recruited from a teaching hospital in central Taiwan. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and journal notes. All participants were interviewed twice. Interviews lasted from 50-100 minutes, and all were recorded. RESULTS: Three shared meanings were attributed to fathers' interactions with health professionals: (1) experiencing no supportive communication, (2) missing the critical time for disability management and (3) being excluded from medical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Fathers in Taiwan commonly rely on health professionals to solve their child's health problems owing to their perceived power to cure and their professional authority in Chinese society. However, fathers felt powerless and hopeless when they received unclear information and incorrect diagnoses, which delayed appropriate treatment. Expressions of dissatisfaction and possessing a sense of futility were common experiences related to exclusion in a paternalistic healthcare system. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Taiwanese clinicians' attitudes and parental-professional relationships challenge an exploration of ethics and standards of medical care shaped by Chinese culture. Ways of promoting parental inclusion in decision making and care, in particular father's inclusion, need to be explored. Recognition of the Chinese mother and father and their differing parental healthcare experiences are important to understand to ensure improvement in encounters with health professionals and the maximisation of positive health outcomes.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03826.x,21,1-2,198-206,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Decision Making and Infant, Newborn and Taiwan and *Health Personnel and *Professional-Family Relations and Fathers/*psychology and *Disabled Children",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Voldbjerg_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Newly graduated nurses' use of knowledge sources in clinical decision-making: an ethnographic study,"Voldbjerg, Siri Lygum and Gronkjaer, Mette and Wiechula, Rick and Sorensen, Erik Elgaard",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore which knowledge sources newly graduated nurses' use in clinical decision-making and why and how they are used. BACKGROUND: In spite of an increased educational focus on skills and competencies within evidence-based practice, newly graduated nurses' ability to use components within evidence-based practice with a conscious and reflective use of research evidence has been described as being poor. To understand why, it is relevant to explore which other knowledge sources are used. This may shed light on why research evidence is sparsely used and ultimately inform approaches to strengthen the knowledgebase used in clinical decision-making. DESIGN AND METHODS: Ethnographic study using participant-observation and individual semistructured interviews of nine Danish newly graduated nurses in medical and surgical hospital settings. RESULTS: Newly graduates use of knowledge sources was described within three main structures: 'other', 'oneself' and 'gut feeling'. Educational preparation, transition into clinical practice and the culture of the setting influenced the knowledge sources used. The sources ranged from overt easily articulated knowledge sources to covert sources that were difficult to articulate. The limited articulation of certain sources inhibited the critical reflection on the reasoning behind decisions. Reflection is a prerequisite for an evidence-based practice where decisions should be transparent in order to consider if other evidentiary sources could be used. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Although there is a complexity and variety to knowledge sources used, there is an imbalance with the experienced nurse playing a key role, functioning both as predominant source and a role model as to which sources are valued and used in clinical decision-making. If newly graduates are to be supported in an articulate and reflective use of a variety of sources, they have to be allocated to experienced nurses who model a reflective, articulate and balanced use of knowledge sources.",2017,10.1111/jocn.13628,26,9-10,1313-1327,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Denmark and Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Anthropology, Cultural and clinical decision-making and transition and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Nursing Process/*organization & administration and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Clinical Competence and critical reflection and knowledge sources and newly graduated nurses and Nursing Assessment/organization & administration and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tsai_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Determinants of self-care decision-making in hospitalised patients with heart failure,"Tsai, Pi-Kuang and Wang, Ruey-Hsia and Lee, Chee-Siong and Tsai, Liang-Miin and Chen, Hsing-Mei",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the important determinants of self-care decision-making in inpatients with heart failure. BACKGROUND: Self-care is a natural decision-making process that helps patients to improve clinical outcomes. However, patients with heart failure engage in insufficient self-care. More research studies are needed to identify the determinants of self-care decision-making. DESIGN: A cross-sectional correlational research design. METHODS: A questionnaire survey with a non-probability sampling was used. A total of 71 inpatients were interviewed at a medical centre in southern Taiwan. Instruments included a demographic and clinical questionnaire, the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale and the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index. RESULTS: Admission frequency was the only significant determinant of self-care maintenance. Heart failure knowledge, admission frequency and type of residence were important determinants of self-care management. Heart failure knowledge, having a spouse and admission frequency were important determinants of self-care confidence. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings support the presence of ongoing clinical challenges associated with poor heart failure knowledge and improper performance of self-care in patients. Admission frequency was correlated with three self-care variables, while heart failure knowledge was associated with self-care management and self-care confidence. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: More effective strategies, including pre-discharge education, consultation of successful cases, case sharing and patient support groups, should be designed to enhance patients' self-care decision-making. However, clinical nurses may not be able to actually perform this task or provide consultation services after hospital discharge due to their workload.

Turrentine_2016_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Interprofessional training enhances collaboration between nursing and medical students: A pilot study,"Turrentine, Florence E. and Rose, Karen M. and Hanks, John B. and Lorntz, Breyette and Owen, John A. and Brashers, Valentina L. and Ramsdale, Erika E.",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Effective collaboration among healthcare providers is an essential component of high-quality patient care. Interprofessional education is foundational to ensuring that students are prepared to engage in optimal collaboration once they enter clinical practice particularly in the care of complex geriatric patients undergoing surgery. STUDY DESIGN: To enhance interprofessional education between nursing students and medical students in a clinical environment, we modeled the desired behavior and skills needed for interprofessional preoperative geriatric assessment for students, then provided an opportunity for students to practice skills in nurse/physician pairs on standardized patients. This experience culminated with students performing skills independently in a clinic setting. RESULTS: Nine nursing students and six medical students completed the pilot project. At baseline and after the final clinic visit we administered a ten question geriatric assessment test. Post-test scores (M=90.33, SD=11.09) were significantly higher than pre-test scores (M=72.33, SD=12.66, t(14)=-4.50, p<0.001. Nursing student post-test scores improved a mean of 22.0 points and medical students a mean of 11.7 points over pre-test scores. Analysis of observational notes provided evidence of interprofessional education skills in the themes of shared problem solving, conflict resolution, recognition of patient needs, shared decision making, knowledge and development of one's professional role, communication, transfer of interprofessional learning, and identification of learning needs. CONCLUSIONS: Having nursing and medical students ""learn about, from and with each other"" while conducting a preoperative geriatric assessment offered a unique collaborative educational experience for students that better prepares them to integrate into interdisciplinary clinic teams.",2016,10.1016/j.nedt.2016.01.024,40,NA,33-38,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Geriatrics and Humans and Pilot Projects and Education, Medical, Undergraduate and *Cooperative Behavior and *Students, Medical and *Interprofessional Relations and Educational Measurement/methods and *Students, Nursing and Patient Simulation and Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Speers_2015_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Service user involvement in giving mental health students feedback on placement: A participatory action research study,"Speers, Janey and Lathlean, Judith",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Although the drive to engage service users in service delivery, research and education has mainstream acceptance, it is not easy to achieve meaningful involvement. The contribution that could potentially be made by users whilst accessing services is often overlooked. OBJECTIVES AND PARTICIPANTS: This study involved stakeholders (mentors, service users and a lecturer) working together to design, evaluate and refine a system enabling students to seek feedback from service users. The feedback concerned mental health students' interpersonal skills and occurred whilst on practice placement. This research aimed to explore the experiences of those concerned when nine students attempted to learn from rather than about service users. DESIGN: A 2-year study, encompassing five cycles of participatory action research (PAR). SETTING: A small island community in the British Isles, adopting UK standards for pre-registration nurse education. METHODS: Data came from interviews with service users and mentors and a series of reflective group discussions with students who volunteered to try out the feedback mechanism. The deliberations of the PAR stakeholder group informed the research cycles and added to the data, which were subject to thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicated that service users volunteering to give feedback had unanimously positive experiences. Students' experience lay on a continuum: those with a stronger sense of self were more willing and able to ask for feedback than less confident students. Cultural adjustment to the role change needed was challenging, requiring self-awareness and courage. Over time, all students achieved deep learning and, for some, learning appeared transformative. CONCLUSION: Although contextual, the study concluded that the feedback initiative encouraged the development of more equitable relationships, in which mental health nurses respected the expertise of service users. This potentially benefits student development, recovery-orientated practice, service users and HEIs searching for meaningful ways to involve service users in learning and formative assessment.",2015,10.1016/j.nedt.2015.07.004,35,9,89-e84,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Humans and Health Services Research and United Kingdom and Mental health and Nurses and Interviews as Topic and User involvement and Feedback and Clinical Competence and *Patient Participation and Mentors/psychology and *Feedback and Psychiatric Nursing/*education and Nursing Education Research and Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate and *Students, Nursing/psychology and Mental Health Services/standards and Service user and Student nurse",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shaw_2008_Injoofnust,JOUR,How people decide to seek health care: a qualitative study,"Shaw, C. and Brittain, K. and Tansey, R. and Williams, K.",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable variation in service use, with overuse in conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections and high levels of unmet need in older patients with embarrassing conditions such as incontinence. The reasons for this situation are varied but to facilitate appropriate accessing of services the decision processes involved in help-seeking require greater understanding. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the decision making process for help-seeking in middle and older aged people with urinary storage symptoms. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with 33 men and women who had sought medical care for urinary symptoms. Respondents were recruited from an epidemiological study of the prevalence of urinary symptoms in community dwelling adults aged 40 years and over. Questions were directed at help-seeking for urinary symptoms as well as help-seeking in general. Interviews were audio-taped and a thematic analysis carried out according to grounded theory methods. RESULTS: The steps in the decision process to seek medical care were drawn from the data. These consisted of appraisals of the presence and cause of symptoms, treatment options and the severity of symptoms and their impact on quality of life. Once the level of threat of the symptom was established, the costs and benefits of treatments and services were balanced against the perceived impact of symptoms on quality of life. These results were considered in relation to available models of health behaviour.

Usher_2009_Joofadnu,JOUR,Clinical decision-making for 'as needed' medications in mental health care,"Usher, Kim and Baker, John A. and Holmes, Colin and Stocks, Belinda",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study exploring the medical and nursing decision-making process associated with the prescription and administration of 'as needed' psychotropic medication. BACKGROUND: The administration of 'as needed' psychotropic medications is a relatively autonomous component of a nurse's role, allowing for the capacity to administer psychotropic medications rapidly in acute situations or at the request of a patient. From the research evidence available to date, it is very difficult to determine how doctors and nurses make decisions about the prescription and administration of 'as needed' psychotropic medications. METHOD: A qualitative exploratory-descriptive study was undertaken to explore nurses and doctors decision-making surrounding the administration of pro re nata or 'as needed' psychotropic medications. Nineteen medical and nursing staff from three mental healthcare sites (acute, secure and rehabilitation) in Australia participated in semi-structured interviews in 2006. Thematic content analysis of the transcripts was conducted independently by two members of the research team and then merged to form the final themes. RESULTS: Four themes were identified in the data: decision-making processes; factors which influenced the administration and prescription of 'as needed' medication; individual protocols and improving practice. CONCLUSION: In-service education should be developed for mental health nurses on psychotropic medications and 'as needed' medications, and on the appropriate use of 'as needed' medications as a behaviour management strategy. Further, an extensive review of 'as needed' medication prescription and administration compared to best practice guidelines is needed.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04957.x,65,5,981-991,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Queensland and Mental Disorders/*drug therapy and Mentally Ill Persons and Psychotropic Drugs/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rankin_2016_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Creative teaching method as a learning strategy for student midwives: A qualitative study,"Rankin, Jean and Brown, Val",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Traditional ways of teaching in Higher Education are enhanced with adult-based approaches to learning within the curriculum. Adult-based learning enables students to take ownership of their own learning, working in independence using a holistic approach. Introducing creative activities promotes students to think in alternative ways to the traditional learning models. The study aimed to explore student midwives perceptions of a creative teaching method as a learning strategy. RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative design was used adopting a phenomenological approach to gain the lived experience of students within this learning culture. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit student midwives (n=30). METHODS: Individual interviews were conducted using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions to gain subjective information. Data were transcribed and analyzed into useful and meaningful themes and emerging themes using Colaizzi's framework for analyzing qualitative data in a logical and systematic way. Over 500 meaningful statements were identified from the transcripts. FINDINGS: Three key themes strongly emerged from the transcriptions. These included'meaningful learning','inspired to learn and achieve', and 'being connected'. A deep meaningful learning experience was found to be authentic in the context of theory and practice. Students were inspired to learn and achieve and positively highlighted the safe learning environment. The abilities of the facilitators were viewed positively in supporting student learning. This approach strengthened the relationships and social engagement with others in the peer group and the facilitators. On a less positive note, tensions and conflict were noted in group work and indirect negative comments about the approach from the teaching team. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating creative teaching activities is a positive addition to the healthcare curriculum. Creativity is clearly an asset to the range of contemporary learning strategies. In doing so, higher education will continue to keep abreast of the needs of graduating students in a complex and rapidly changing professional environment.",2016,10.1016/j.nedt.2015.12.009,38,NA,100-93,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,Curriculum and Humans and Female and Deep learning and Pregnancy and Program Evaluation and Qualitative Research and Problem-Based Learning/*methods and Midwifery/*education and Nursing Education Research and *Teaching and *Creativity and Contemporary learning strategies in higher education and Creative teaching method and Flexible pedagogies and Lateral thinking and Transformative learning,NA,NA,2016/03//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sarabia.Cobo_2016_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Assessment of a learning intervention in palliative care based on clinical simulations for nursing students,"Sarabia-Cobo, Carmen Maria and Alconero-Camarero, Ana Rosa and Lavin-Alconero, Lucia and Ibanez-Rementeria, Isabel",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Major deficiencies exist in undergraduate nursing education for Palliative Care. Opportunities to care for dying patients are often unavailable to students in traditional clinical settings. Palliative care simulation is an innovative strategy that may help to prepare undergraduate nursing students to provide quality palliative/end of life care. It is valuable to explore the student nurses' beliefs, feelings and satisfaction regarding the impact that simulation clinic applied to palliative care has and how it influenced their overall experience of caring for a dying patient and the patient's family. This study aimed to evaluate a learning intervention in palliative care using a low-fidelity clinical simulation for undergraduate nursing students from a Spanish university, based on the analytics of their expectations and learning objectives. METHOD: Sixty-eight students participated in this mixed descriptive design study, they participated in a palliative care simulation scenario and completed three questionnaires which assess the knowledge and expectations before the simulation and the subsequent satisfaction with the performance and learning received. RESULTS: The intervention in question met students' learning expectations, singling out social abilities as important tools in palliative care training, and the students were satisfied with the presented case studies.

Chang_2012_Joofclnu,JOUR,Decision-making related to complementary and alternative medicine use by people with Type 2 diabetes: a qualitative study,"Chang, Hsiao-Yun Annie and Wallis, Marianne and Tiralongo, Evelin and Wang, Hui Lan",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users make decisions about CAM use. Specifically, an exploration of the processes used by people with Type 2 diabetes, related to the assessment of information sources, factors influencing decision-making and the role of other key individuals, was undertaken. BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic illnesses increasingly seek to use CAM to improve their well-being. Currently, however, the decision-making processes related to CAM use among people with Type 2 diabetes are poorly understood. METHODS: An exploratory study using a naturalistic design, with in-depth semi-structured interviews, was undertaken. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants with Type 2 diabetes who used CAM alongside conventional medicine. The data were analysed in a three-step coding process. Ethical approval was gained from a human research ethics committee. RESULTS: Evidence about CAM use from interview data was consistent with a multi-dimensional decision-making processes used by participants. Four major categories emerged: recognising the need for using CAM; assessing the potential CAM before use; matching CAM use to personal philosophy; and ongoing evaluation of CAM. CONCLUSION: As diabetes affects the entirety of a person's being self-management, incorporating CAMs has become a way of controlling the condition and improving well-being. It is important for health professionals to consider clients' CAM use and to incorporate this information, where appropriate, into management plans. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health care professionals should be aware of patients who use CAM while under conventional medical care and should discuss CAM use at various points in the client journey to facilitate better communication.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04339.x,21,21-22,3205-3215,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Qualitative Research and *Decision Making and Taiwan and *Complementary Therapies and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*psychology/therapy",NA,NA,2012/11//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: In China, there has been an increase in medical disputes, which at times has resulted in physical assaults on healthcare providers. Enhanced patient satisfaction may reduce disputes and can perhaps be bolstered by the improved cultural competence of providers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional path analytic research design was used. METHODS: A random sample of 583 hospitalized patients recruited from six tertiary comprehensive hospitals in Changsha, China in 2016 completed a face-to-face structured questionnaire. Measures included the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competency Item Set, the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale, the Patient Satisfaction with Primary Nurses Scale and the Patient Overall Satisfaction with the Hospital Scale. RESULTS: Significant associations among cultural competence of nurses, patient satisfaction and patient trust were confirmed, and path analyses supported the proposed mediating role of patient trust. Furthermore, the cultural competence subscales of communication-positive behaviours, trust-building behaviours and shared decision-making were positively and significantly correlated with patient satisfaction.

BACKGROUND: Existing research shows that nurses and physicians view the amount of teamwork they experience in the ICU differently though the attitudes of junior doctors and critical care nurses on collaboration remain unknown. METHODS: Thirty-one nurses and 46 junior doctors completed a modified version of the Baggs Collaboration and Satisfaction about Care Decisions instrument during 2006-2007 in a 24 bed medical/surgical ICU in the northeastern United States. Score responses of nurses and junior doctors were compared with the Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Nurses consistently gave more negative responses on every survey question than junior doctors. While nurses said that the amount of collaboration was inadequate, junior doctors were satisfied and views between groups were most divergent (P < 0.01) on questions about overall satisfaction with team decisions.

Guinane_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Patient perceptions of deterioration and patient and family activated escalation systems-A qualitative study,"Guinane, Jessica and Hutchinson, Alison M. and Bucknall, Tracey K.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experiences of patients who received a medical emergency team review following a period of clinical deterioration and their views about the potential use of a patient and family activated escalation system. BACKGROUND: Delay or failure by health professionals to respond to clinical deterioration remains a patient safety concern. Patients may sometimes identify subtle cues of early deterioration prior to changes in vital signs. In response to health professional and system failures, patient and family activated escalation systems have been mandated and implemented in Australia. However, little research has evaluated their effectiveness nor taken patients' perspectives into account. DESIGN: Qualitative exploratory descriptive design was used. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used. Semistructured interviews were undertaken in 2014 with 33 patients who required medical emergency team intervention. Data were collected from one private and one public hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The framework method was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: All patients stated that it was the clinician who detected and responded to deterioration. Private patient participants were unaware of the medical emergency team system, and felt escalating care was not their responsibility. These patients reported being too sick to communicate prior to and during medical emergency team review and did not favour a patient and family activated escalation system. Public patients were well informed about the medical emergency team system yet expressed concerns around overriding clinicians if activating a patient and family activated escalation system. CONCLUSION: Patient participation during a period of deterioration is restricted by their clinical condition and limited medical knowledge. Patients felt comfortable to communicate concerns to clinicians but felt they would not activate the patient and family activated escalation system. This behoves clinicians to actively listen and respond to patient concerns. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinicians must promote a collaborative relationship and encourage patients to communicate their concerns. Given the perceived barriers to patient and family activated escalation systems use, resources being employed for their implementation could be redistributed to other areas of patient safety.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14202,27,7-8,1621-1631,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and nursing and Qualitative Research and patient participation and Aged, 80 and over and Victoria and Nurse-Patient Relations and clinical decision-making and Family/*psychology and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration and Health Personnel/*psychology and Hospitals, Public/statistics & numerical data and *Clinical Deterioration and Inpatients/*psychology and deterioration and Hospitals, Private/statistics & numerical data and patient and family escalation and rapid response systems",NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lim_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Beginners in prescribing practice: Experiences and perceptions of nurses and doctors,"Lim, Anecita Gigi and North, Nicola and Shaw, John",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare the experiences and perceptions of nurses and doctors in becoming prescribers. BACKGROUND: The development of core skills, knowledge and attitudes as a prescriber is among the present foci of current medical education, and the requirements for ongoing mentorship, support and education for novice medical prescribers have been identified as important training components. However, little is known of the prescribing practices of other health professionals who are also new to prescribing, for example, nurse prescribers. DESIGN: This qualitative study was guided by a constructivist narrative approach using a multiple case narrative strategy. METHODS: A purposive sampling approach was used, with a view to selecting participants to best illuminate the experiences of beginning to prescribe. Individual interviews were conducted, 26 in total, lasting approximately one hour each and were audio-recorded. RESULTS: Common themes were found across prescribing groups: fear and anxiety when taking on prescribing responsibility; the strategy of using a personal list of medicines to support safe practice; how this list was expanded over time; referring to senior colleagues in prescribing decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the journeys are similar for nurses and doctors as beginning prescribers. The effort required for a novice prescriber to select the most appropriate medication and write prescriptions can be extensive as development of expertise takes time and occurs over months or years.

Smith_2010_Joofadnu,JOUR,Helping parents cope with crying babies: decision-making and interaction at NHS Direct,"Smith, Suzanne",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study of how nurses at a national telephone triage centre in England (NHS Direct) make different use of the algorithms and organizational protocols to make decisions and give advice to parents with crying babies, how their clinical knowledge and experience influences these decisions, and the techniques used to enhance parental coping ability. BACKGROUND: Parents of persistently crying babies state that they need to be listened to, understood, believed and reassured to help them cope. Nurses at NHS Direct use their clinical judgement in decision-making, and see the software as a guide that can be both valuable and problematic. METHOD: The study design was influenced by grounded theory and incorporated discourse and thematic analysis. It had two phases involving data collection and analysis over the period 2002-2006. A theoretical sample of 11 calls was analysed and later a focus group of six nurses at the same site. FINDINGS: NHS Direct nurses used the 'crying baby' algorithm in various ways, influenced by their experience and confidence to use the algorithm to support their clinical knowledge. Its medical elements were regarded as safe but its non-medical elements, including questions about the likelihood of shaking a child, were treated differently. CONCLUSION: Nurses were reluctant to deviate from the algorithm when dealing with child-focused calls. However, this reluctance did not apply when they were prompted to ask the caller if they felt that they were reaching a point where they might shake their baby, or when prompted to give related advice.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05195.x,66,2,381-391,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"England and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Infant and Algorithms and Adaptation, Psychological and Focus Groups and Attitude of Health Personnel and Infant, Newborn and *Decision Making and Triage and *Decision Support Techniques and Parents/psychology and State Medicine and Hotlines and *Crying and Infant Care/*methods and Nursing Staff/*psychology",NA,NA,2010/02//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mitchell_2008_Joofadnu,JOUR,Non-technical skills of the operating theatre scrub nurse: literature review,"Mitchell, Lucy and Flin, Rhona",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a review to identify the non-technical (cognitive and social) skills used by scrub nurses. BACKGROUND: Recognition that failures in non-technical skills contributed to accidents in high-risk industries led to the development of research programmes to study the role of cognition and social interactions in operational safety. Recently, psychological research in operating theatres has revealed the importance of non-technical skills in safe and efficient performance. Most of the studies to date have focused on anaesthetists and surgeons. DATA SOURCES: On-line sources and university library catalogues, publications of the Association for Perioperative Practice, National Association of Theatre Nurses and Association of Peri-Operative Registered Nurses were searched in 2007. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included in the review if they presented data from scrub nurses on one or more of their non-technical skills. These findings were examined in relation to an existing medical non-technical skills framework with categories of communication, teamwork, leadership, situation awareness and decision-making. RESULTS: Of 424 publications retrieved, 13 were reviewed in detail. Ten concerned communication and eight of those also had data on teamwork. In 11 papers teamwork was examined, and one focused on nurses' situation awareness, teamwork and communication. None of the papers we reviewed examined leadership or decision-making by scrub nurses. CONCLUSION: Further work is needed to identify formally the non-technical skills which are important to the role of scrub nurse and then to design training in the identified non-technical skills during the education and development of scrub nurses.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04695.x,63,1,15-24,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Communication and Humans and Decision Making and Nurse's Role and *Cognition and Clinical Competence/*standards and Medical Errors/prevention & control and Nursing Audit and Operating Room Nursing/*standards and Risk Management/*standards,NA,NA,2008/07//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sullivan_2008_Joofclnu,JOUR,Review of small rural health services in Victoria: how does the nursing-medical division of labour affect access to emergency care?,"Sullivan, Elise and Francis, Karen and Hegney, Desley",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS: This paper is based on a review of the Australian and International literature relating to the nursing-medical division of labour. It also explores how the division of labour affects patient access to emergency care in small rural health services in Victoria, Australia. BACKGROUND: The paper describes the future Australian health workforce and the implications for rural Victoria. The concept of division of labour and how it relates to nursing and medicine is critically reviewed. Two forms of division of labour emerge - traditional and negotiated division of labour. Key themes are drawn from the literature that describes the impact of a traditional form of division of labour in a rural context. METHODS: This paper is based on a review of the Australian and international literature, including grey literature, on the subject of rural emergency services, professional boundaries and roles, division of labour, professional relationships and power and the Australian health workforce. RESULTS: In Australia, the contracting workforce means that traditional divisions of labour between health professionals cannot be sustained without reducing access to emergency care in rural Victoria. A traditional division of labour results in rural health services that are vulnerable to slight shifts in the medical workforce, unsafe services and recruitment and retention problems. A negotiated form of division of labour provides a practical alternative. CONCLUSION: A division of labour that is negotiated between doctors and nurses and supported by a legal and clinical governance framework, is needed to support rural emergency services. The published evidence suggests that this situation currently does not exist in Victoria. Strategies are offered for creating and supporting a negotiated division of labour. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper offers some strategies for establishing a negotiated division of labour between doctors and nurses in rural emergency care.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02087.x,17,12,1543-1552,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Communication and Safety and Humans and Decision Making, Organizational and Attitude of Health Personnel and Health Services Needs and Demand and Job Satisfaction and Professional Autonomy and Nursing Methodology Research and Victoria and Medically Underserved Area and Power, Psychological and Rural Health Services/*organization & administration and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration and *Physician-Nurse Relations and *Nurse's Role/psychology and *Physician's Role/psychology and Health Services Accessibility/*organization & administration and Negotiating/psychology and Nursing Administration Research",NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Romero_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,The impact of evidence-based sepsis guidelines on emergency department clinical practice: a pre-post medical record audit,"Romero, Bernadine and Fry, Margaret and Roche, Michael",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the number of patients presenting with sepsis before and after guideline implementation; the impact of sepsis guidelines on triage assessment, emergency department management and time to antibiotics. BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity within hospitals. Globally, strategies have been implemented to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, which rely on the early recognition and management of sepsis. To improve patient outcomes, the New South Wales government in Australia introduced sepsis guidelines into emergency departments. However, the impact of the guidelines on clinical practice remains unclear. DESIGN/METHODS: A 12-month pre-post retrospective randomised medical record audit of adult patients with a sepsis diagnosis. Data were extracted from the emergency department database and paper medical record. Data included patient demographic (age, gender), clinical information (time of arrival, triage code, seen by time, disposition, time to antibiotic, pathology, time to intravenous fluids) and patient assessment data (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturations, medication). RESULTS: This study demonstrated a statistically significant 230-minute reduction in time to antibiotics post implementation of the guidelines. The post group (n = 165) received more urgent triage categories (n = 81; 49<c2><b7>1%), a 758-minute reduction in mean time to second litre of intravenous fluids and an improvement in collection of lactate (n = 112, 67<c2><b7>9%), also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the impact the guidelines can have on clinician decision-making and behaviour that support best practice and positive patient outcomes. The sepsis guidelines improved the early assessment, recognition and management of patients presenting with sepsis in one tertiary referral emergency department. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The use of evidenced-based guidelines can impact clinical decision-making and behaviour, resulting in the translation and support of best practice and improving patient care.",2017,10.1111/jocn.13728,26,21-22,3588-3596,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and assessment and Practice Guidelines as Topic and sepsis and clinical guidelines and Medical Audit and New South Wales and Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration and emergency care and Triage/methods and emergency and Time-to-Treatment/*statistics & numerical data and Sepsis/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mitchell_2013_Injoofnust,JOUR,An interprofessional team approach to tracheostomy care: a mixed-method investigation into the mechanisms explaining tracheostomy team effectiveness,"Mitchell, Rebecca and Parker, Vicki and Giles, Michelle",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: In an effort to reduce tracheostomy-related complications, many acute care facilities have implemented specialist tracheostomy teams. Some studies, however, generate only mixed support for the connection between tracheostomy teams and patient outcomes. This suggests that the effect of collaborative teamwork in tracheostomy care is still not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms through which an interprofessional team approach can improve the management of patients with a tracheostomy. DESIGN: The achievement of this research objective requires the collection of rich empirical data, which indicates the use of a qualitative methodology. A case study approach provided an opportunity to collect a wealth of data on tracheostomy team activities and dynamics. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected on an interprofessional tracheostomy team in a large tertiary referral hospital in Australia. The team was composed of clinical nurse consultants, a physiotherapist, a speech pathologist, a dietician, a social worker and medical officers. METHODS: Data were collected through a focus group and one-to-one, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and thematic analysis was used to analyse experiences of tracheostomy team members. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis resulted in two main themes: interprofessional protocol development and implementation; and interprofessional decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that tracheostomy teams enhance consistency of care through the development and implementation of interprofessional protocol. In addition, such team allow more efficient and effective communication and decision-making consequent to the collocation of diverse professionals. These findings provide new insight into the role of tracheostomy teams in successfully implementing complex protocol and the explanatory mechanisms through which interprofessional teams may generate positive outcomes for tracheostomy patients.",2013,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.11.008,50,4,536-542,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and *Patient Care Team and *Interprofessional Relations and *Tracheostomy,NA,NA,2013/04//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Morata_2018_Joofadnu,JOUR,An evolutionary concept analysis of futility in health care,"Morata, Lauren",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To report a concept analysis of futility in health care. BACKGROUND: Each member of the healthcare team: the physician, the nurse, the patient, the family and all others involved perceive futility differently. The current evidence and knowledge in regard to futility in health care manifest a plethora of definitions, meanings and interpretations without consensus. DESIGN: Concept analysis. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched included Medline, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Academic Search Premier, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PsycINFO. Search terms included ""futil*,"" ""concept analysis,"" ""concept,"" ""inefficacious,"" ""non-beneficial,"" ""ineffective"" and ""fruitless"" from 1935-2016 to ensure a historical perspective of the concept. A total of 106 articles were retained to develop the concept. METHODS: Rogers' evolutionary concept analysis was used to evaluate the concept of futility from ancient medicine to the present. RESULTS: Seven antecedents (the patient/family autonomy, surrogate decision-making movement, the patient-family/physician relationship, physician authority, legislation and court rulings, catastrophic events and advancing medical technology) lead to four major attributes (quantitative, physiologic, qualitative, and disease-specific). Ultimately, futile care could lead to consequences such as litigation, advancing technology, increasing healthcare costs, rationing, moral distress and ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSION: Futility in health care demonstrates components of a cyclical process and a consensus definition is proposed. A framework is developed to clarify the concept and articulate relationships among attributes, antecedents and consequences. Further testing of the proposed definition and framework are needed.",2018,10.1111/jan.13526,74,6,1289-1300,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,communication and Humans and ethics and quality of life and Attitude of Health Personnel and Family/*psychology and Decision Making/*ethics and Quality of Life/psychology and Health Personnel/*psychology and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and nurse-patient relationships and concept analysis and Medical Futility/*ethics/*psychology and patient advocacy,NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kelly_2011_Joofadnu,JOUR,The dimensions of nursing surveillance: a concept analysis,"Kelly, Lesly and Vincent, Deborah",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of an analysis of the concept of nursing surveillance. BACKGROUND: Nursing surveillance, a primary function of acute care nurses, is critical to patient safety and outcomes. Although it has been associated with patient outcomes and organizational context of care, little knowledge has been generated about the conceptual and operational process of surveillance. DATA SOURCES: A search using the CINAHL, Medline and PubMed databases was used to compile an international data set of 18 papers and 4 book chapters published from 1985 to 2009. REVIEW METHODS: Rodger's evolutionary concept analysis techniques were used to analyse surveillance in a systems framework. This method focused the search to nursing surveillance (as opposed to other medical uses of the term) and used a theoretical framework to guide the analysis. RESULTS: The examination of the literature clarifies the multifaceted nature of nursing surveillance in the acute care setting. Surveillance involves purposeful and ongoing acquisition, interpretation and synthesis of patient data for clinical decision-making. Behavioural activities and multiple cognitive processes are used in surveillance in order for the nurse to make decisions for patient safety and health maintenance. A systems approach to the analysis also demonstrates how organizational characteristics and contextual factors influence the process in the acute care environment. CONCLUSION: This conceptual analysis describes the nature of the surveillance process and clarifies the concept for effective communication and future use in health services research.",2011,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05525.x,67,3,652-661,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and Decision Making and Clinical Competence and Hospitalization/economics and Safety Management/organization & administration and *Nurse's Role and *Nursing Assessment and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration/standards and *Systems Theory and Emergency Nursing/*organization & administration/standards and Workplace/organization & administration,NA,NA,2011/03//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jerpseth_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Older patients with late-stage COPD: Their illness experiences and involvement in decision-making regarding mechanical ventilation and noninvasive ventilation,"Jerpseth, Heidi and Dahl, Vegard and Nortvedt, Per and Halvorsen, Kristin",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the illness experiences of older patients with late-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to develop knowledge about how patients perceive their preferences to be taken into account in decision-making processes concerning mechanical ventilation and/or noninvasive ventilation. BACKGROUND: Decisions about whether older patients with late-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will benefit from noninvasive ventilation treatment or whether the time has come for palliative treatment are complicated, both medically and ethically. Knowledge regarding patients' values and preferences concerning ventilation support is crucial yet often lacking. DESIGN: Qualitative design with a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach. METHODS: The data consist of qualitative in-depth interviews with 12 patients from Norway diagnosed with late-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The data were analysed within the three interpretative contexts described by Kvale and Brinkmann. RESULTS: The participants described their lives as fragile and burdensome, frequently interrupted by unpredictable and frightening exacerbations. They lacked information about their diagnosis and prognosis and were often not included in decisions about noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that these patients are highly vulnerable and have complex needs in terms of nursing care and medical treatment. Moreover, they need access to proactive advanced care planning and an opportunity to discuss their wishes for treatment and care.

McKenna_2014_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Situation awareness in undergraduate nursing students managing simulated patient deterioration,"McKenna, Lisa and Missen, Karen and Cooper, Simon and Bogossian, Fiona and Bucknall, Tracey and Cant, Robyn",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: Nursing work often occurs in complex and potentially hazardous settings. Awareness of patient and practice environments is an imperative for nurses in practice. OBJECTIVES: To explore nursing students' situation awareness while engaging in simulated patient deterioration scenarios. DESIGN: The educational process of FIRST(2)ACT was the model for the nurse intervention. Situation awareness was measured quantitatively using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment tool. Four domains were measured: physiological perception (patient parameters), global perception (surroundings), comprehension (interpretation of information), and projection (forecasting outcomes). SETTINGS: Clinical laboratories at each of three participating universities. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven nursing students from three Australian universities. METHODS: Between March and July 2012, students participated in three video-recorded simulation events, in which a trained actor played patient roles and groups of three students worked as teams. To measure situation awareness, following the simulation each team leader was taken to a separate room and asked to report on a question set regarding the patient's vital signs, bedside setting and medical diagnosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, situation awareness was low (41%). Of the four domains, physiological perceptions scored the lowest (26%) and projection the highest (59%). Final year nursing students may not have well developed situation awareness skills, especially when dealing with these types of scenarios. Education providers need to consider ways to assist students to fully develop this attribute.

Tobiano_2015_Injoofnust,JOUR,Patient participation in nursing care on medical wards: An integrative review,"Tobiano, Georgia and Marshall, Andrea and Bucknall, Tracey and Chaboyer, Wendy",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Patient participation is a way for patients to engage in their nursing care. In view of the possible link between patient participation and safety, there is a need for an updated review to assess patient participation in nursing care. OBJECTIVES: To investigate patients' and nurses' perceptions of and behaviours towards patient participation in nursing care in the context of hospital medical wards. DESIGN: Integrative review. DATA SOURCES: Three search strategies were employed in August 2013; a computerised database search of Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Medline and PsychINFO; reference lists were hand-searched; and forward citation searching was executed. REVIEW METHODS: After reviewing the studies, extracting study data and completing summary tables the methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool by two reviewers. Reviewers met then to discuss discrepancies as well as the overall strengths and limitations of the studies. Discrepancies were overcome through consensus or a third reviewer adjudicated the issue. Within and across study analysis and synthesis of the findings sections was undertaken using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Four themes were identified - enacting participation, challenges to participation, promoting participation and types of participation. Most studies included were conducted in Europe. The majority of studies used qualitative methodologies, with all studies sampling patients; nurses were included in three studies. Data were largely collected using self-reported perceptions; two studies included observational data. Methodological issues included a lack of reflexivity, un-validated data collection tools, sampling issues and low response rates. CONCLUSIONS: On medical wards, patients and nurses desire, perceive or enact patient participation passively. Challenging factors for patient participation include patients' willingness, nurses' approach and confusion around expectations and roles. Information-sharing was identified as an activity that promotes patient participation, suggesting nurses encourage active communication with patients in practice. Involving patients in assessment and care planning may also enhance patient participation. For education, enhancing nurses' understanding of the attributes of patient participation, as well as patient-centred care approaches may be beneficial for medical ward nurses. From here, researchers need to examine ways to overcome the barriers to patient participation; further nurse participants and observational data is required on medical wards.",2015,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.02.010,52,6,1107-1120,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Communication and Humans and Patient participation and Patient engagement and Review and Patient-centred care and *Patient Participation and Nursing Staff, Hospital and Shared decision-making and Patient involvement and *Nursing Care and Consumer participation and Cooperative behaviour and Nurse-patient relations",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hsu_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Triggers and decision-making patterns for receiving total knee arthroplasty among older adults with knee osteoarthritis: A qualitative descriptive study,"Hsu, Kuo-Yao and Tsai, Yun-Fang and Yeh, Wen-Ling and Chen, Dave W. and Chen, Ching-Yen and Wang, Yi-Wen",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore triggers of and decision-making patterns for older adults with knee osteoarthritis to receive total knee arthroplasty. BACKGROUND: Older adults with knee osteoarthritis pain are often reluctant to undergo total knee arthroplasty until their physical health and psychological health have deteriorated. This delay may lead to poor long-term outcomes after the surgery. Thus, it is important to help these older adults decide to undergo total knee arthroplasty in an appropriate time frame. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: Older adult outpatients scheduled to receive total knee arthroplasty within 1 month (N = 79) were recruited by convenience from two medical centres and one regional hospital in northern Taiwan. Data were collected in individual interviews using a semistructured guide and analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The main triggers for older adults to receive total knee arthroplasty were severe pain and inability to walk. We identified four decision-making patterns for undergoing total knee arthroplasty: tried everything to relieve pain and surgery was the last choice; previously received total knee arthroplasty; perceived oneself as still young and wanted to enjoy life; and adjusted work characteristics, but in vain. CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers of older patients with knee osteoarthritis must carefully assess their characteristics, especially age, occupation and previous total knee arthroplasty, to guide them in deciding to undergo total knee arthroplasty. Clinicians also need to provide appropriate information about osteoarthritis care, pain medications, total knee arthroplasty, the relationship between knee osteoarthritis pain and quality of life, as well as the relationship between preoperative status and postoperative long-term outcomes for older adults to maintain their quality of life.

Secondary to study the impact of sociodemographic and clinical variables in the two groups. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The study involved 130 diabetes outpatients and 127 diabetic foot ulcers patients. Health-related quality of life was measured with the generic questionnaire Short Form-36, consisting of eight dimensional scores. All scores were adjusted for differences in age and gender (estimated marginal means). Differences were compared with anova calculations, by the use of Predictive Analytics Software, PASW (version 17.0). RESULTS: This study confirms that health-related quality of life differs significantly between disease subgroups when measured with Short Form-36. Diabetic foot ulcers had a major negative impact on 7/8 subscales on the Short Form-36 compared to the diabetes outpatients group. health-related quality of life decreased with increasing amount of complications and comorbidity in the diabetes outpatients group, with cardiovascular complications being the most pronounced predictor of lower health-related quality of life scores. CONCLUSION: Patients who have developed diabetic foot ulcers reports much poorer health-related quality of life than compared to diabetes outpatients. Factors linked to the development of late complications were not detected in the diabetic foot ulcers group, such as cardiovascular comorbidity and neuropathy.

Hickman_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,Advance directives lessen the decisional burden of surrogate decision-making for the chronically critically ill,"Hickman, Ronald L. Jr and Pinto, Melissa D.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify the relationships between advance directive status, demographic characteristics and decisional burden (role stress and depressive symptoms) of surrogate decision-makers (SDMs) of patients with chronic critical illness. BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of advance directives among Americans has increased, SDMs are ultimately responsible for complex medical decisions of the chronically critically ill patient. Decisional burden has lasting psychological effects on SDMs. There is insufficient evidence on the influence of advance directives on the decisional burden of surrogate decision-makers of patients with chronic critical illness. DESIGN: The study was a secondary data analysis of cross-sectional data. Data were obtained from 489 surrogate decision-makers of chronically critically ill patients at two academic medical centres in Northeast Ohio, United States, between September 2005-May 2008. METHODS: Data were collected using demographic forms and questionnaires. A single-item measure of role stress and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale were used to capture the SDM's decisional burden. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, chi-square and path analyses were performed. RESULTS: Surrogate decision-makers who were nonwhite, with low socioeconomic status and low education level were less likely to have advance directive documentation for their chronically critically ill patient. The presence of an advance directive mitigates the decisional burden by directly reducing the SDM's role stress and indirectly lessening the severity of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Most SDMs of chronically critically ill patients will not have the benefit of knowing the patient's preferences for life-sustaining therapies and consequently be at risk of increased decisional burden. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Study results are clinically useful for patient education on the influence of advance directives. Patients may be informed that SDMs without advance directives are at risk of increased decisional burden and will require decisional support to facilitate patient-centred decision-making.",2014,10.1111/jocn.12427,23,5-6,756-765,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Chronic Disease and role stress and *Decision Making and *Critical Illness and *Proxy and advance directives and *Advance Directives and depressive symptoms and chronically critically ill and decisional burden and path analysis and surrogate decision-makers,NA,NA,2014/03//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: End-of-life care for critically ill patients, of whom nearly 20% will die in critical care, remains somewhat problematic (Truog et al. 2008). End-of-life care is an established domain in cancer; however, research has not been conducted previously into dying, critically ill cancer patients' experiences. DESIGN: Qualitative, phenomenological in-depth interviews were undertaken. METHODS: Phenomenology was used to explore experiences of 27 participants: surviving patients at high risk of dying, bereaved families, oncologists, palliative and critical care consultants, and nurses. Purposive sampling from a UK critical care unit was carried out. In-depth interviews were taped analysed using Van Manen's phenomenological analysis framework. RESULTS: A phenomenological interpretation of dying in cancer critical illness, and the impact on opportunities for end-of-life care, is presented. Three main themes included: dual prognostication; the meaning of decision-making; and care practices at end of life: choreographing a good death. End-of-life care was an emotive experience for all participants; core tenets for good end-of-life care included comfort, less visible technology, privacy and dignity. These findings are discussed in relation to end-of-life care, cancer and critical illness. CONCLUSION: The speed of progressing towards dying in critical illness is often unknown and subsequently affects potential for end-of-life care. Caring was not unique to nurses and end-of-life care in critical care came with considerable emotional cost. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is an opportunity for nurses to use the care of patients dying in critical care to develop specialist knowledge and lead in care, but it requires mastery and reconciliation of both technology and end-of-life care. Healthcare professionals can help facilitate acceptance for families and patients, particularly regarding involvement in decisions and ensuring patient advocacy.",2013,10.1111/jocn.12095,22,9-10,1442-1454,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Decision Making and Prognosis and United Kingdom and Patients/*psychology and Family/*psychology and *Terminal Care and *Critical Care and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Medical Staff, Hospital/*psychology",NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schalkers_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,Health professionals' perspectives on children's and young people's participation in health care: a qualitative multihospital study,"Schalkers, Inge and Parsons, Cathleen S. and Bunders, Joske F. G. and Dedding, Christine",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate healthcare professionals' perspectives on child participation in paediatric hospital care and their opinions on improving participation practices. BACKGROUND: Some scholars argue that the decision-making capacities of children largely depend on the attitudes of healthcare professionals rather than on the children's own competences. Healthcare professionals' perspectives on children's participation in hospital care remain largely unexplored. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design. METHODS: Healthcare professionals (n = 32) from 10 paediatric wards in the Netherlands participated in semi-structured interviews. Shier's Pathways to Participation model (2001) was used to guide the interviews. RESULTS: Participation is not a term that is frequently used by professionals; however, they feel familiar with the ideas underlying the term, and it is perceived as being at the core of their work. Professionals believe that high levels of participation are possible in basic care for children. Participation in medical decision-making is considered to be more complex and subject to a number of reservations and restrictions. The participants expressed a strong need to enhance child participation in service evaluation and to increase the respect for and understanding of the rights of children to participate outside of the paediatric unit, including in the surgery and emergency departments. CONCLUSION: Children do not currently participate in the assessment of hospital services. Creative methods that support the role of children in evaluating and improving the quality of paediatric hospital care and services should be developed. Hospital-wide policies could help to promote understanding of child participation among all professionals caring for children in hospitals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Based on international agreements that the Netherlands has ratified, professionals have the duty to facilitate child participation in hospital care. Concrete opportunities and ideas on how to accomplish this goal in practice are provided, and areas for improvement are identified.",2016,10.1111/jocn.13152,25,7-8,1035-1044,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Age Factors and Netherlands and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Patient Participation and shared decision-making and paediatrics and child-centred care and *Hospitals, Pediatric and child participation and health professionals' perspectives",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Klemmt_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,Wishes and needs of nursing home residents and their relatives regarding end-of-life decision-making and care planning-A qualitative study,"Klemmt, Malte and Henking, Tanja and Heizmann, Esther and Best, Lukas and van Oorschot, Birgitt and Neuderth, Silke",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore wishes and needs, such as existing and preferred communication processes, of residents and relatives regarding medical and nursing planning at the end of life. BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents are a relevant target group for advance care planning (ACP) due to their high age and multimorbidity. Their relatives seem to be important partners in terms of communication and their documentation of wishes and needs. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: Thirty-two guideline-based interviews with nursing home residents (n = 24) and relatives (n = 8) were conducted in nursing homes in Germany (n = 7). All interviews were analysed by content-structured content analysis. The COREQ checklist was used to document reporting of the study. RESULTS: Residents particularly express wishes and needs regarding their health, like the desire to maintain or improve one's current state of health and to be active and mobile and also regarding their social situation, for example the well-being of relatives and beloved ones. A limited group of people was identified with whom residents spoke about issues such as preparedness and self-determination. These were mainly their relatives. Relatives themselves have a need for more communication. Various communication barriers could be identified. CONCLUSION: Residents express diverse and partly explicit wishes and needs. Although many of the respondents had already drafted advanced directives, the demand for offers of communication to plan ahead for the end of life remains clear. The results indicate the unconditional participation of relatives and people close to the residents, if they are available. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Derivations for a target group-related ACP concept in the study region are identified. Besides the involvement of relatives, nurses could also be involved in the communication and decision-making process of residents in nursing homes under certain conditions.",2020,10.1111/jocn.15291,29,13-14,2663-2674,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and autonomy and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Germany and Interpersonal Relations and nursing home and Nursing Homes and Homes for the Aged and *Decision Making and Family/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology and family and Advance Directives/*psychology and nurses and Advance Care Planning/*standards",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Newbold_2008_Injoofnust,JOUR,The production economics of nursing: a discussion paper,"Newbold, David",International journal of nursing studies,"Nursing is numerically the largest health profession providing direct care, and this, plus the imperative for effective cost control, makes their costs and impact a legitimate study focus and policy target. Production theory techniques can help nurse executives maximize outcome and minimize costs, yet little of such evidence currently exists in mainstream nursing workforce research. The balance of available evidence supports an inverse association between nurse staffing levels and adverse outcomes. However, 'adequate' staffing levels may be perceived as expensive and some providers may try to reduce them. The response, in some US and Australian states, is legislation to force hospitals to implement mandatory minimum patient-to-nurse (P/N) ratios. In this paper, existing data from Aiken et al. [2003. Education levels of hospital nurses and patient mortality. Journal of the American Medical Association 290, 1617-1623] is re-interpreted using production theory, to illustrate the possible relationship between two key workforce variables ""Staff Level"" and ""Staff Mix"", and clinical outcome, and show how this informs decision making. Consistent with other studies, this suggests that diminishing returns to each variable exist. This preliminary analysis suggests that increasing the number of graduate RNs in the workforce might be the most cost-effective way to expand the nursing workforce. However, more detailed and rigorous research is needed to estimate speciality specific cost and production functions and compute the optimal solution. This can predict the most cost-effective staff combination for a set outcome, or the set of inputs yielding best outcome for a given budget. With this, nurse executives can systematically maintain service quality or safety in the most economical way.",2008,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2007.01.007,45,1,120-128,eng,0020-7489,"Humans and Budgets and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Models, Economic and Educational Status and Workload and Efficiency, Organizational and Predictive Value of Tests and Decision Making, Organizational and *Hospital Mortality and *Clinical Competence and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*organization & administration and Safety Management/organization & administration and *Nursing Staff, Hospital/education/organization & administration and Models, Nursing and Nurse Administrators/organization & administration and Nursing Administration Research/*organization & administration and Personnel Downsizing/organization & administration and Personnel Staffing and Scheduling/*organization & administration and Quality Assurance, Health Care/organization & administration",NA,NA,2008/01//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Beccaria_2014_Nurseductoda,JOUR,The interrelationships between student approaches to learning and group work,"Beccaria, Lisa and Kek, Megan and Huijser, Henk and Rose, Jayln and Kimmins, Lindy",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: As part of the process of nursing students becoming 'work ready' within future health care teams, students need the skills to work collaboratively. In higher education, establishing group work assignments is a teaching method to develop group work skills. Not only is group work an important teaching method to develop effective group work skills but it is also used to activate deep learning. However, to date, there has been a lack of research on the impact of group work on student approaches to learning. This study aimed to examine the interrelationships between students, group work characteristics, and their approaches to learning. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey design was used, before and after a targeted academic skills development intervention, which had a specific focus on the development of group work skills. The sample involved first year undergraduate nursing students undertaking a Bachelor of Nursing programme at a regional university in Australia. A total of 92 students completed the pre-survey, and 102 students completed the post-survey. METHOD: Data were collected using quantitative surveys. RESULTS: Metacognitive awareness was found to best predict a deep approach to learning. Young age and experiencing discomfort in group work were two predictors of a surface approach to learning. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that nurse educators should develop strategies that support students' metacognitive awareness in relation to group work, and also support those students who feel less comfortable in working with others.",2014,10.1016/j.nedt.2014.02.006,34,7,1094-1103,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Young Adult and Australia and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Cooperative Behavior and *Learning and Educational Measurement/methods and *Group Processes and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Nursing education and Education, Nursing/methods and First-year experience and Group work and Student approaches to learning",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ladak_2013_Injoofnust,JOUR,Family-centered rounds in Pakistani pediatric intensive care settings: non-randomized pre- and post-study design,"Ladak, Laila Akbar and Premji, Shahirose Sadrudin and Amanullah, Muhammad Muneer and Haque, Anwarul and Ajani, Khairulnissa and Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Involvement of family in bedside rounds is one strategy to implement family-centered care to help families get clear information about their child, and be actively involved in decision-making about care. However in developing countries such as Pakistan, daily bedside rounds include the physician, residents, medical students and a nurse/technician. Parents are not currently a part of these rounds. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether family-centered rounds improve parents' and health care professionals' satisfaction, decrease patient length of stay, and improve time utilization when compared to traditional practice rounds in a population with a low literacy rate, socioeconomic status, and different cultural values and beliefs. DESIGN: A non-randomized before-after study design. SETTING: A private hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 82 parents, whose children were hospitalized for a minimum of 48h, and 25 health care professionals able to attend two consecutive rounds. METHODS: During the before phase, traditional bedside rounds were practiced; and during after phase, family-centered rounds were practiced. Parents and health care professionals completed a questionnaire on the second day of rounds. An observational form facilitated data collection on length of stay and time utilization during. RESULTS: Parents' ratings during the family-centered rounds were significantly higher for some parental satisfaction items: evidence of team work (p=0.007), use of simple language during the rounds (p=0.002), feeling of inclusion in discussion at rounds (p=0.03), decision making (p=0.01), and preference for family-centered rounds (p=<0.001). No significant differences were found in health care professionals' satisfaction between rounds. Patient length of stay was significantly reduced in the family-centered rounds group, while no significant difference was found in the duration of rounds. Family-centered rounds served as an opportunity for parents to correct/add to patient history or documentation. CONCLUSION: Parents were satisfied with both forms of rounds; however, they appeared to have a greater preference for family-centered rounds than health care professionals. Family-centered rounds were a resource for Pakistani parents, enabling direct communication with the medical team without impacting on the time required to complete rounds. Family-centered rounds may improve quality of care such as decreasing length of stay or preventing critical incidents.",2013,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.05.009,50,6,717-726,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Male and Child and Patient Care Team and Patient Satisfaction and Job Satisfaction and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and Pakistan and *Intensive Care Units, Pediatric and Hospitals, Private/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper identifies the framework used by two universities, in Sweden and the United States. Virtual learning environments and meaningful learning activities can be constructed using web-based learning platforms. The goal for this initiative was 'internationalisation on home plan' for nursing faculty and students that opened up internationalised learning opportunities for all students, including those who do not participate in study abroad/mobility activities. This broader opportunity supports the development of cultural awareness and understanding of global health care practices and the nursing profession on mutual topics of concern, in this case patient safety. Learning activities and learning outcomes can be stipulated. The pedagogical framework was compatible with the Bologna Process' constructive alignment, deep learning and a student focus. The student nurses were not only given the opportunity to explore the learning objective of patient safety and participate in an international collaboration with another university, but also gained university academic credit for fulfilling the task. There is a great gain in using virtual collaboration and learning modules that are embedded in courses for the purpose of 'internationalisation on home plan' since not all students can participate in student mobility activities.",2016,10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.012,41,NA,50-53,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"United States and Curriculum and Humans and User-Computer Interface and Universities and Sweden and *Internet and Models, Educational and Education, Distance/*methods and *International Cooperation and *Education, Nursing and *International Educational Exchange and Collaborative learning and Higher nurse education and Internationalisation on home plan and Virtual learning",NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To obtain a snapshot of European nurses' assessments of their hospital work environments and quality of care in order to identify promising strategies to retain nurses in hospital practice and to avoid quality of care erosions related to cost containment. DESIGN: Cross sectional surveys of 33,659 hospital medical-surgical nurses in 12 European countries. SETTING: Surveyed nurses provided care in 488 hospitals in Belgium, England, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: All nurses were surveyed from medical-surgical units 30 or more hospitals from geographically representative samples of hospitals in each country, except for Ireland and Norway, where all hospitals were selected, and Sweden, where nearly all hospitals were included by sampling all medical-surgical nurses who were members of the Swedish Nursing Association. METHODS: Percentages are provided for each of the nurse and hospital characteristics reported. RESULTS: There was wide variation across countries in the percentages of hospital nurses that were bachelor's prepared (range 0-100%), in patient to nurse average workloads (3.7-10.2) and skill mix (54-82% nurses). More than one in five nurses (11-56%) were dissatisfied with their jobs in most countries, and dissatisfaction was pronounced with respect to wages, educational opportunities and opportunities for advancement. Sizable percentages (19-49%) of nurses intended to leave their jobs, though the percentage that thought it would be easy to find another job varied greatly across countries (16-77%). Nurse concerns with workforce management and adequate resources were widespread. While most nurses did not give their hospitals poor grades on patient safety, many doubted that safety was a management priority. Nurses reported that important nursing tasks were often left undone because of lack of time, and indicated that adverse events were not uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse shortages can be expected when national economies improve unless hospital work environments improve. Wide variation in nurse staffing and skill mix suggests a lack of evidence-based decision making. Additional research is warranted on the impact of these variations in nurse resources on patient outcomes.",2013,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.11.009,50,2,143-153,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Europe and Attitude of Health Personnel and Medical Errors and Clinical Competence and *Quality of Health Care and Personnel Staffing and Scheduling and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Workplace",NA,NA,2013/02//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Critical care nurses are responsible for detecting and rapidly acting upon changes in patients' clinical condition. Nurses use medical devices including bedside physiologic monitors to assist them in their practice. Customising alarm settings on these devices can help nurses better monitor their patients and reduce the number of clinically irrelevant alarms. As a result, customisation may also help address the problem of alarm fatigue. However, little is known about nurses' clinical reasoning with respect to customising physiologic monitor alarm settings. DESIGN: This article is an in-depth report of the qualitative arm of a mixed methods study conducted using an interpretive descriptive methodological approach. METHODS: Twenty-seven nurses were purposively sampled from three intensive care units in an academic medical centre. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone and were analysed using thematic analysis. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) reporting guidelines were used. RESULTS: Four themes were identified from the interview data: unit alarm culture and context, nurse attributes, motivation to customise and customisation ""know-how."" A conceptual model demonstrating the relationship of these themes was developed to portray the factors that affect nurses' customisation of alarms. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to drawing on clinical data, nurses customised physiologic monitor alarms based on their level of clinical expertise and comfort. Nurses were influenced by the alarm culture on their clinical unit and colleagues' and patients' responses to alarms, as well as their own technical understanding of the physiologic monitors. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results of this study can be used to design strategies to support the application of clinical reasoning to alarm management, which may contribute to more appropriate alarm customisation practices and improvements in safety.",2019,10.1111/jocn.14866,28,15-16,3033-3041,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and patient safety and Qualitative Research and monitoring and Academic Medical Centers and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and *Clinical Alarms and physiologic and intensive care units and clinical alarms and critical care nursing and Critical Care Nursing/*methods and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods/psychology",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Heart failure self-care is integral to maintain and manage health, and may prevent unnecessary HF hospitalisations. Nevertheless, self-care remains challenging for patients, and using vignettes offer a new perspective to understand patient HF self-care decision-making. DESIGN: This qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted as part of a mixed methods study. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 20) to elicit patient decisions about self-care in responses to three vignettes, which varied in symptom severity. Content analysis was used to extract quotes describing participant responses. RESULTS: Participants were on average 60 years old, primarily male, African American, unemployed and highly symptomatic (NYHA Class III or IV). Overall, participants were able to identify when symptoms required a decision to seek urgent medical attention, but had difficulty identifying the appropriate decision to make in response to less acute symptoms such as swelling. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms other than shortness of breath were challenging for patients to interpret and manage appropriately.

Reimer_2010_Joofadnu,JOUR,Flight nursing expertise: towards a middle-range theory,"Reimer, Andrew P. and Moore, Shirley M.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper presents a middle-range Theory of Flight Nursing Expertise. BACKGROUND: Rotary-wing (helicopter) medical transport has grown rapidly in the USA since its introduction, particularly during the past 5 years. Patients once considered too sick to transport are now being transported more frequently and over longer distances. Many limitations are imposed by the air medical transport environment and these require nurses to alter their practice. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Medline, CINAHL, secondary referencing and an Internet search from 1960 to 2008 for studies related to the focal concepts in flight nursing. DISCUSSION: The middle-range Theory of Flight Nursing Expertise is composed of nine concepts (experience, training, transport environment of care, psychomotor skills, flight nursing knowledge, cue recognition, pattern recognition, decision-making and action) and their relationships. Five propositions describe the relationships between those concepts and how they apply to flight nursing expertise. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: After empirical testing, this theory may be a useful tool to assist novice flight nurses to attain the skills necessary to provide safe and competent care more efficiently, and may aid in designing curricula and programmes of research. CONCLUSION: Research is needed to determine the usefulness of this theory in both rotary and fixed-wing medical transport settings, and to examine the similarities and differences related to expertise needed for different flight nurse team compositions. Curriculum and training innovations can result from increased understanding of the concepts and relationships proposed in this theory.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05269.x,66,5,1183-1192,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Decision Making and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Psychomotor Performance and *Critical Care and Nurses/*psychology and *Professional Competence and Recognition, Psychology and *Air Ambulances and *Nursing Theory",NA,NA,2010/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Subramanian_2012_Joofclnu,JOUR,Challenges faced by nurses in managing pain in a critical care setting,"Subramanian, Pathmawathi and Allcock, Nick and James, Veronica and Lathlean, Judith",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: To explore nurses' challenges in managing pain among ill patients in critical care. BACKGROUND: Pain can lead to many adverse medical consequences and providing pain relief is central to caring for ill patients. Effective pain management is vital since studies show patients admitted to critical care units still suffer from significant levels of acute pain. The effective delivery of care in clinical areas remains a challenge for nurses involved with care which is dynamic and constantly changing in critically ill. DESIGN: Qualitative prospective exploratory design. METHODS: This study employed semi structured interviews with nurses, using critical incident technique. Twenty-one nurses were selected from critical care settings from a large acute teaching health care trust in the UK. A critical incident interview guide was constructed from the literature and used to elicit responses. RESULTS: Framework analysis showed that nurses perceived four main challenges in managing pain namely lack of clinical guidelines, lack of structured pain assessment tool, limited autonomy in decision making and the patient's condition itself. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' decision making and pain management can influence the quality of care given to critically ill patients. It is important to overcome the clinical problems that are faced when dealing with pain experience. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a need for nursing education on pain management.

Milton.Wildey_2010_Joofclnu,JOUR,Care of acutely ill older patients in hospital: clinical decision-making,"Milton-Wildey, Kathleen and O'Brien, Louise",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the nursing care of older hospitalised patients and how the nurses providing care understood the clinical decision-making around this care. BACKGROUND: One of the challenges confronting nurses is how best to manage the care required by increasing numbers of older people with complex problems and illnesses being admitted to hospitals. DESIGN: This qualitative study used multiple methods of data collection that included observations, interviews and, where needed, review of the hospital records of older patients. METHOD: Twenty-seven registered nurses participated from across five hospital units. Data were analysed thematically to understand how nurses cared for older patients. RESULTS: The interpretative analysis yielded three major themes that emerged in relation to nursing care of older patients: knowing about care; optionalising care; and blaming. Participants were knowledgeable and potentially competent in providing care required by older patients in hospital. However, they admitted that they optionalised care by making decisions about which patients to care for and how much care should be provided. Participants rationalised these decisions through laying blame on the hospital organisation, needing social time with colleagues and preferring medically oriented technical interventions. CONCLUSION: Nurses experienced tension between professional and ethical nursing responsibilities and the lack of challenge and reward associated with the care of this group of patients. They attended to the more highly valued medical interventions and substituted time to care for older patients by socialisation with colleagues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study draws attention to the discrepancy between stated and practice values in the care of hospitalised older patients.

BACKGROUND: Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Minister for Health reason to commission a study into the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, nursing homes and homecare organizations. This is the first quantitative study from the perspective of nurses. Previous quantitative studies were conducted under physicians and information on the role of nurses was obtained indirectly. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent in 2003 to 500 district nurses employed in 55 homecare organizations. The absolute response rate was 86.0% and 81.6% (408) could be used for analysis. RESULTS: In 22.3% of 278 cases, the district nurse was the first with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In about half (49.8%) of 267 cases nurses were not involved in the general practitioner's decision-making process, and in only 13.3% of 264 cases, did they attend the administration of the lethal drugs. District nurses had provided some degree of aftercare to the surviving relatives in 80.3% of 264 cases.

Despins_2010_Joofadnu,JOUR,Detection of patient risk by nurses: a theoretical framework,"Despins, Laurel A. and Scott-Cawiezell, Jill and Rouder, Jeffrey N.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a description of a theoretical framework of how nurses detect and interpret patient risk signals in the context of organizational attitudes and procedures related to patient safety. BACKGROUND: The ability to detect when patients are at increased risk for harm is a challenge faced by nurses worldwide. How nurses are able to discriminate patient risk warning signals from background noise is not well understood. Also, the impact of system-level factors on nurses' signal detection capabilities has not been investigated. DATA SOURCES: Computerized database searches were used to identify nursing, organizational science, and cognitive psychology literature from 1964 to 2009 pertinent to the framework. DISCUSSION: The patient risk detection theory synthesizes concepts of signal detection theory and high reliability theory. Signal detection theory explains the decision-making processes of nurses as they scan for signals of potential patient harm. High reliability theory explains how nurses' signal detection capacities are facilitated when healthcare settings operate as high reliability organizations making patient safety the top priority. CONCLUSION: The patient risk detection theory facilitates understanding of both individual and organizational factors that influence nurses' ability to detect risk in complex healthcare settings. It can be used to guide research on interventions to enhance signal detection by nurses and increase patient safety in today's complex care environments. The theory can also be used to guide design of training programmes that permit nurses to develop practical skills in signal detection.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05215.x,66,2,465-474,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Safety Management and Risk Assessment and Models, Theoretical and *Decision Making and Delivery of Health Care/*standards and *Risk and *Clinical Competence and *Signal Detection, Psychological and Medical Errors/nursing/prevention & control and Nursing Staff, Hospital/organization & administration/psychology/*standards",NA,NA,2010/02//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Farrell_2017_Injoofnust,JOUR,Are nurse-led chemotherapy clinics really nurse-led? An ethnographic study,"Farrell, Carole and Walshe, Catherine and Molassiotis, Alex",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: The number of patients requiring ambulatory chemotherapy is increasing year on year, creating problems with capacity in outpatient clinics and chemotherapy units. Although nurse-led chemotherapy clinics have been set up to address this, there is a lack of evaluation of their effectiveness. Despite a rapid expansion in the development of nursing roles and responsibilities in oncology, there is little understanding of the operational aspects of nurses' roles in nurse-led clinics. OBJECTIVES: To explore nurses' roles within nurse-led chemotherapy clinics. DESIGN: A focused ethnographic study of nurses' roles in nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, including semi-structured interviews with nurses. SETTINGS: Four chemotherapy units/cancer centres in the UK PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to select four cancer centres/units in different geographical areas within the UK operating nurse-led chemotherapy clinics. Participants were 13 nurses working within nurse-led chemotherapy clinics at the chosen locations. METHODS: Non-participant observation of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, semi-structured interviews with nurse participants, review of clinic protocols and associated documentation. RESULTS: 61 nurse-patient consultations were observed with 13 nurses; of these 13, interviews were conducted with 11 nurses. Despite similarities in clinical skills training and prescribing, there were great disparities between clinics run by chemotherapy nurses and those run by advanced nurse practitioners. This included the number of patients seen within each clinic, operational aspects, nurses' autonomy, scope of practice and clinical decision-making abilities. The differences highlighted four different levels of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, based on nurses' autonomy and scope of clinical practice. However, this was heavily influenced by medical consultants. Several nurses perceived they were undertaking holistic assessments, however they were using medical models/consultation styles, indicating medicalization of nurses' roles. CONCLUSIONS: Four different levels of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics were identified, illustrating disparities in nurses' roles. Although clinics are run by nurses they are often controlled by medical consultants, which can reduce nurses' autonomy and negatively impact on patient care.",2017,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.01.005,69,NA,1-8,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Cancer and Humans and United Kingdom and Qualitative research and Anthropology, Cultural and Clinical Competence and Nurse's Role and Ethnography and Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use and Chemotherapy and *Practice Patterns, Nurses' and Advanced nursing practice and Cancer Care Facilities/*organization & administration and Neoplasms/*drug therapy/nursing and Nurse-led clinics and Nurse's roles",NA,NA,2017/04//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Laging_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Recognition and assessment of resident' deterioration in the nursing home setting: A critical ethnography,"Laging, Bridget and Kenny, Amanda and Bauer, Michael and Nay, Rhonda",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the recognition and assessment of resident deterioration in the nursing home setting. BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of research exploring how nurses and personal-care-assistants manage a deteriorating nursing home resident. DESIGN: Critical ethnography. METHODS: Observation and semi-structured interviews with 66 participants (general medical practitioners, nurses, personal-care-assistants, residents and family members) in two Australian nursing homes. The study has been reported in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. RESULTS: The value of nursing assessment is poorly recognised in the nursing home setting. A lack of clarity regarding the importance of nursing assessments associated with resident care has contributed to a decreasing presence of registered nurses and an increasing reliance on personal-care-assistants who had inadequate skills and knowledge to recognise signs of deterioration. Registered nurses experienced limited organisational support for autonomous decision-making and were often expected to undertake protocol-driven decisions that contributed to potentially avoidable hospital transfers. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses need to demonstrate the importance of assessment, in association with day-to-day resident care and demand standardised, regulated, educational preparation of an appropriate workforce who are competent in undertaking this role. Workforce structures that enhance familiarity between nursing home staff and residents could result in improved resident outcomes. The value of nursing assessment, in guiding decisions at the point of resident deterioration, warrants further consideration.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14292,27,7-8,1452-1463,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Humans and Adult and Aged and Delivery of Health Care and Australia and Anthropology, Cultural and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Nurse's Role and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Nursing Homes and *Clinical Deterioration and nurses and *Nursing Assessment and nurse roles and *Homes for the Aged and geriatric nursing and hospital transfer and hospitalisation and nurse assistant and nurse staff and nursing assessment and Nursing Assistants/organization & administration and nursing homes* and nursing roles and Nursing Staff/organization & administration and nursing workforce and scope of practice",NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

Munroe_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,A structured framework improves clinical patient assessment and nontechnical skills of early career emergency nurses: a pre-post study using full immersion simulation,"Munroe, Belinda and Curtis, Kate and Murphy, Margaret and Strachan, Luke and Considine, Julie and Hardy, Jennifer and Wilson, Mark and Ruperto, Kate and Fethney, Judith and Buckley, Thomas",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the new evidence-informed nursing assessment framework HIRAID (History, Identify Red flags, Assessment, Interventions, Diagnostics, reassessment and communication) on the quality of patient assessment and fundamental nontechnical skills including communication, decision making, task management and situational awareness. BACKGROUND: Assessment is a core component of nursing practice and underpins clinical decisions and the safe delivery of patient care. Yet there is no universal or validated system used to teach emergency nurses how to comprehensively assess and care for patients. DESIGN: A pre-post design was used. METHODS: The performance of thirty eight emergency nurses from five Australian hospitals was evaluated before and after undertaking education in the application of the HIRAID assessment framework. Video recordings of participant performance in immersive simulations of common presentations to the emergency department were evaluated, as well as participant documentation during the simulations. Paired parametric and nonparametric tests were used to compare changes from pre to postintervention. RESULTS: From pre to postintervention, participant performance increases were observed in the percentage of patient history elements collected, critical indicators of urgency collected and reported to medical officers, and patient reassessments performed. Participants also demonstrated improvement in each of the four nontechnical skills categories: communication, decision making, task management and situational awareness. CONCLUSION: The HIRAID assessment framework improves clinical patient assessments performed by emergency nurses and has the potential to enhance patient care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: HIRAID should be considered for integration into clinical practice to provide nurses with a systematic approach to patient assessment and potentially improve the delivery of safe patient care.",2016,10.1111/jocn.13284,25,15-16,2262-2274,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Communication and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and Australia and patient safety and Clinical Competence and emergency nursing and *Nursing Assessment and *Simulation Training and nursing assessment and clinical skills and Emergency Nursing/*education and emergency service, hospital and nontechnical skills and nursing model",NA,NA,2016/08//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wu_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,Decision-making among the substitute decision makers in intensive care units: An investigation of decision control preferences and decisional conflicts,"Wu, Feixia and Zhuang, Yiyu and Chen, Xiangping and Wen, Huan and Tao, Wenwen and Lao, Yuewen and Zhou, Hongchang",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To explore decision control preferences and decisional conflicts and to analyse their association among the surrogate decision makers in the intensive care unit. DESIGN: The study carried out a cross-sectional survey among the surrogates. METHODS: The participants were 115 surrogate decision makers of critical patients, from August to September 2019. A Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to assess decision control preferences and decisional conflicts, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to examine their association. RESULTS: Of the 115 surrogate decision makers, 51.3% preferred a collaborative role, and 63.48% were somewhat unsure about making decisions. Logistic regression analysis identified decision control preferences was associated with surrogates' age, education level, and personality traits, while decisional conflicts was associated with surrogates' age, education level, character, medical expense burden, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score. Cohen's kappa statistics showed a bad concordance of decision-making expectations and actuality, with kappa values of 0.158 (p < .05). Wherein surrogates who experienced discordance between their preferred and actual roles, have relatively higher decisional conflicts. CONCLUSION: This study identified individual differences of surrogate decision makers in decision control preferences and decisional conflicts. These results imply that incorporation of the individual decision preferences and communication styles into care plans is an important first step to develop high quality decision support.

Doherty_2009_Injoofnust,JOUR,A qualitative study of health service reform on nurses' working lives: learning from the UK National Health Service (NHS),"Doherty, Carole",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The need for efficiency and cost effectiveness in healthcare is of international concern and has been an important influence to changes in nursing skill mix in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. This article investigates the impact that the British Government's strategy designed to reform the NHS has had on nurses' day-to-day working lives. Nurses have been presented as key players in changing the culture of the NHS and the government has sought to provide them with greater empowerment primarily through skill mix changes. However, government policy may have resulted in greater productivity not greater empowerment for nurses who have often been required to compensate for loss of medical capacity as a consequence of the reductions in junior doctors' hours in line with the European Working Time Directive. Furthermore, what constitutes 'genuine' nursing has been difficult to define and 'caring' difficult to measure. Thus even without work intensification nurses may believe that health service reform has been disempowering by its focus on quantitative targets. METHODS: This article is based on data from interviews with nurses in three English hospitals providing acute care. It compares and contrasts the perceptions of ward sisters, specialist nurses and staff nurses. RESULTS: Uncertainty concerning what is the proper task of a nurse has been reinforced by skill mix changes which have resulted in staff nurses and ward sisters perceiving that they are 'losing nursing'. However, the article shows distinct intra-occupational outcomes. In particular specialist nurses believe that NHS reform has provided greater empowerment by increasing their authority in clinical decision-making. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the consequences of government strategy have been inconsistent for front-line staff often combining empowerment, disempowerment and work intensification. This article provides empirical evidence which contributes to a debate about whether and why 'caring' may have become a lost art in nursing. It also demonstrates the possible effects on nursing of using skill mix change as a method for gaining greater workforce efficiency and as a response to medical staff shortages.",2009,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.01.014,46,8,1134-1142,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Organizational Culture and Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Efficiency and United Kingdom and Efficiency, Organizational and Nurses/psychology and Power, Psychological and *Health Care Reform and State Medicine/*organization & administration and *Nursing",NA,NA,2009/08//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: If abnormal physiology is left untreated, the patient may develop cardiac arrest. Nurses in general wards are those who perceive any clinical deterioration in patients. DESIGN: A descriptive, quantitative design was selected. METHODS: An anonymous survey with 13 multiple choice questions was distributed to 150 randomly selected nurses working in general medical and surgical wards of a large tertiary hospital in Athens, Greece. After explanation of the purposes of the study, 94 nurses (response ratio: 62%) agreed to respond to the questionnaire. RESULTS: Categories with the greatest nursing concern were patients with heart rate<40/minute, an atypical thoracic pain, foreign body airway obstruction and bronchial secretions, respiratory rate<5/minute and heart rate=100/minute. However, almost 50% of nurses were able to accurately identify the critical nursing action for patients with respiratory rate<4/minute, 72% for patients with airway obstruction and 73% for patients with chest pain. Nurses who had graduated from a four-year educational programme identified clinical situations that necessitated medical emergency team activation in a significantly higher rate and also scored significantly higher in questions concerning clinical evaluation than nurses who had graduated from a two-year educational programme. CONCLUSION: Activation of the medical emergency team is influenced by factors such as level of education and cardiopulmonary resuscitation courses attendance. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Graduating from a four-year educational programme helps nurses identify emergencies. However, irrespective of the educational programme they have followed, undertaking a basic life support or advanced life support provider course is critical as it helps them identify cardiac or respiratory emergencies.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04080.x,21,17-18,2668-2678,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Workforce and Reproducibility of Results and *Decision Making and *Patient Care Team and *Emergency Medical Services and Greece and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ICDSF was based on a model of clinical reasoning. Teaching student nurses to reason clinically is important as poor clinical reasoning skills can lead to ""failure-to rescue"" of deteriorating patients. The framework of the ICDSF was based on nursing concepts to encourage deep learning and transferability of knowledge. The principles of active student participation, situated cognition to solve problems, authenticity, and cognitive rehearsal were used to develop the ICDSF. The ICDSF was designed in such a way that students moved through it in a step-wise fashion and were required to achieve competency at each step before proceeding to the next. The quality of the ICDSF was evaluated using a questionairre survey, students' written comments and student assessment measures on a pilot and the ICDSF. Overall students were highly satisfied with the clinical scenarios of the ICDSF and believed they were an interesting and useful way to engage in authentic clinical learning. They also believed the ICDSF was useful in developing cognitive skills such as clinical reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making. Some reported issues were the need for good technical support and the lack of face to face contact when using e-learning.

DESIGN: This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with parallel arms. METHODS: The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating hospital on 1 August 2018. Frail elders and their carer if any are enrolled during hospitalization, and undergo randomization after discharged. The intervention group receives a 2-week video-supported nurse-led advance care planning programme (N = 149) while the control group receives a 2-week health education program at home (N = 149). Follow-up surveys via telephone at 1 and 6 months measure outcomes regarding end-of-life decision-making from both the patients and the carers. CONCLUSION: Advance care planning discussion is to understand patient's values, preferences and treatment for care on their anticipation of future deterioration. Treatment options for end-of-life care may not be well-received especially elders because in the discussion process, technical medical terms are presented in an abstract, hypothetical way that are hard to understand.

Coombs_2012_Injoofnust,JOUR,Challenges in transition from intervention to end of life care in intensive care: a qualitative study,"Coombs, Maureen A. and Addington-Hall, Julia and Long-Sutehall, Tracy",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Providing quality end of life care is a challenging area in intensive care practice. The most demanding aspect for doctors and nurses in this setting is not the management of care at end of life per se, but facilitating the transition from active intervention to palliation and finally, end of life care. Whilst there is understanding about some aspects of this transition, recognition of the complex and inter-related processes that work to shift the patient's trajectory from cure to end of life care is required. This is important in order to work towards solutions for issues that continue to pose problems for health care professionals. OBJECTIVES: To identify the challenges for health care professionals when moving from a recovery trajectory to an end of life trajectory in intensive care. DESIGN: Qualitative methods of enquiry. METHODS AND SETTING: Single semi-structured interviews with 13 medical staff and 13 nurses associated with 17 decedents who underwent treatment withdrawal in intensive care were carried out. Participants were drawn from two Intensive Care Units in a large university-affiliated hospital in England. FINDINGS: Patients who died in intensive care appeared to follow a three-stage end of life trajectory: admission with hope of recovery; transition from intervention to end of life care; a controlled death. The transition from intervention to end of life care was reported as being the most problematic and ambiguous stage in the end of life trajectory, with potential for conflict between medical teams, as well as between doctors and nurses. CONCLUSIONS: End of life care policy emphasises the importance of end of life care for all patients regardless of setting. These findings demonstrate that in intensive care, there is need to focus on transition from curative intervention to end of life care, rather than end of life care itself so that effective and timely decision making underpins the care of the 20% of intensive care patients who die in this setting each year.",2012,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.10.019,49,5,519-527,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"England and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Interviews as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and *Continuity of Patient Care and Critical Care/*organization & administration and Terminal Care/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hoyle_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Treatment targets in emergency departments: nurses' views of how they affect clinical practice,"Hoyle, Louise and Grant, Aimee",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To understand nurses' views and experiences of four-hour treatment targets in the emergency department and how this impacts clinical decision-making throughout acute secondary care hospitals. BACKGROUND: In many countries, national treatment targets in the emergency department have been introduced. However, research and a recent enquiry into poor clinical care in one hospital in the UK have highlighted that patient care may be compromised by the need to meet these targets. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study as part of a case study approach. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 nurses working in UK secondary care hospitals which had an emergency department. Nurses were purposively sampled from three specialties: emergency arenas (emergency department, n = 5; medical assessment n = 4 surgical receiving n = 2) (n = 11), surgical wards (n = 11) and medical wards (n = 9). RESULTS: Nurses in emergency arenas reported considerable burden, in terms of a very high workload and pressure from senior staff to meet the target. Respondents reported that negative impact on patient care for the majority of patients, excluding the most sick, for whom emergency arena nurses reported that they ensured received appropriate treatment, regardless of breaching treatment targets. Around half of the nurses working outside emergency arenas felt pressure and amended their work practices to enable colleagues in emergency arenas to meet treatment targets. CONCLUSIONS: Four-hour targets were not viewed as clinically helpful by the majority of nurses, some of whom questioned their appropriateness for patient care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Policy makers and senior managers should consider the suitability of treatment targets in the emergency department, particularly in relation to working conditions for nurses and other health professionals and its potential for negative impacts on patient care. While targets remain in place, senior nurses and managers should support nurses who breach the target to provide optimum clinical care.",2015,10.1111/jocn.12835,24,15-16,2211-2218,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"health care and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and United Kingdom and nursing care and qualitative and Workforce and Clinical Competence and emergency department and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Emergency Service, Hospital and *Nursing Staff, Hospital and discretion and State Medicine and emergency care and *Workload and nurses and health care administration and targets and work environment",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Recent definitions of collaboration in the literature describe it as being based on communication, shared decision-making and the respect and equality of team members. However, research demonstrates a tension between this theoretical ideal and how collaboration between nurse practitioners and medical practitioners occurs in practice. Different socialization processes of the two professions and legislative requirements influence collaborative practice. The way these two professions overcome traditional boundaries and realize collaborative practice in the primary healthcare setting needs to be examined. DESIGN: Mixed methods multiple case study including up to six sites with a minimum of six and a maximum of 20 participants in total. METHODS: Data on collaborative practice between nurse practitioners and medical practitioners in primary health care will be collected in three phases: (1) two-week direct observation in the practice setting to capture actual behaviour and context; (2) questionnaire to measure dimensions of collaboration; and (3) one-to-one semi-structured interviews with nurse practitioners, medical practitioners and practice managers to record experiences, perceptions and understanding of collaboration. DISCUSSION: Triangulation of findings will generate a comprehensive understanding of how collaboration between nurse practitioners and medical practitioners in Australia occurs in the primary care setting. The results of this study will inform nurse practitioners, medical practitioners practice managers and policy makers on successful models of collaboration.",2014,10.1111/jan.12269,70,5,1184-1193,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,collaboration and Surveys and Questionnaires and primary health care and *Interpersonal Relations and *Physician-Nurse Relations and Primary Health Care/*organization & administration and *Nurse Practitioners and nurse practitioner and *Medical Staff and collaborative behaviour and collaborative practice and cooperative behaviour and interdisciplinary care,NA,NA,2014/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Spiers_2014_Injoofnust,JOUR,Graduate nurses' learning trajectories and experiences of problem based learning: a focused ethnography study,"Spiers, J. A. and Williams, B. and Gibson, B. and Kabotoff, W. and McIlwraith, D. and Sculley, A. and Richard, E.",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Problem-based learning seeks to foster active, collaborative and self directed learning. It is increasingly utilized in health professional education; however, it is difficult to ascertain effectiveness. Empirically, student satisfaction does not match academic achievement but the reasons for this are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experience trajectories and satisfaction of graduates who had completed an undergraduate problem-based learning nursing program. DESIGN AND METHODS: Qualitative focused ethnography using individual and group semi-structured interviews. Categories and themes were identified using inductive constant comparison. A comparative matrix analysis of differing levels of the two core processes illuminated specific experience profiles. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Forty five program graduates who had graduated between one and nine years previously from a Western Canadian program offered at four academic sites. The sample was mostly female (n=37), aged 26-30 years (n=23) and graduated 5-8 years previously (n=20). RESULTS: Levels of satisfaction with the program varied markedly. Two core processes contributed to this: ""understanding"" and ""valuing"" problem-based learning. Specific experience profiles included: ""Happy as fish in water"" which represents those who understood and valued the approach, and flourished; ""I'll do it but I won't like it"" reflects those who understood and could adjust to the academic context but did not particularly value it; ""I just want to be a nurse"" characterized those who consistently disliked and resisted the process but endured in order to graduate. Each profile was characterized by attitudes, intentions, learning preferences and program satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: We theorize an underlying mechanism explaining these diverse levels of satisfaction are differing orientations to studying. This approach to understanding how students typically approach learning is strongly linked to perceptions of academic quality and program satisfaction in higher education research, although it has been neglected in nursing problem-based learning research. Orientations to studying include reproductive surface learning, deep learning for understanding and meaning, and strategic approaches to maximize desired objectives. These orientations are congruent with the descriptive typologies developed in this research. This provides an effective explanation as to why some students adapt easily and flourish in problem-based learning contexts, while others continually struggle to adapt. Further research is needed to determine the relationship between deep, surface, and strategic orientations to study and student satisfaction in nursing programs.",2014,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2014.03.002,51,11,1462-1471,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Education and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Anthropology, Cultural and Alberta and *Problem-Based Learning and *Education, Nursing, Graduate and Orientation to studying and Problem-based learning and Student satisfaction",NA,NA,2014/11//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hunter_2008_Joofadnu,JOUR,Learning how we learn: an ethnographic study in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Hunter, Cynthia Louise and Spence, Kaye and McKenna, Kate and Iedema, Rick",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to identify how nurse clinicians learn with and from each other in the workplace. BACKGROUND: Clinicians' everyday practices and interactions with each other have recently been targeted as areas of research, because it is there that quality of care and patient safety are achieved. Orientation of new nurses and doctors into a specialty unit often results in stress. METHOD: An ethnographic approach was used, including a 12-month period of fieldwork observations involving participation and in-depth interviews with nurse, doctor and allied health clinicians in their workplace. The data were collected in 2005-2006 in a paediatric teaching hospital in Australia. FINDINGS: The findings were grouped into four dimensions: orientation of nurses, orientation of medical registrars, preceptoring and decision-making. The orientation of new staff (nursing and medical) is a complex and multi-layered process which accommodates multiple kinds of learning, in addition to formal learning. Workplace learning also can be informal, incidental, interpersonal and interactive. Interactive and interpersonal learning and the transfer of knowledge include codified and tacit knowledge as well as intuitive understandings of 'how we do things here'. CONCLUSION: Research into how nurses learn is crucial for illuminating learning that is non-formal and less recognized than more formal kinds. To provide a safe practice environment built on a foundation of knowledge and best practice, there needs to be an allocation of time in the busy workday for learning and reflection.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04632.x,62,6,657-664,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Cooperative Behavior and Australia and Attitude of Health Personnel and Infant, Newborn and Workplace and *Intensive Care Units, Neonatal and Medical Staff, Hospital/*education and Physician-Nurse Relations and Education, Nursing, Continuing/methods and Neonatal Nursing/*education and Nurse Clinicians/*education",NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Eley, Robert and Hughes, James A. and Sinnott, Michael",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To assess the medication knowledge of emergency department nurses and determine the factors affecting their nurse-initiated medication practices. BACKGROUND: Nurse-initiated medications is a vital practice for all nurses in emergency departments which improves pain assessment, provides safe pain management and reduces time-to-analgesia and other meaningful treatments. DESIGN: Mixed methods. Between September 2014-January 2015, data were collected by questionnaire assessing medication knowledge and face-to-face interviews determining factors affecting practice. RESULTS: Nurse-initiated medications frequency of the Registered Nurses ranged from 0-36 times per week dependent on employed hours and emergency department area worked. Medication knowledge was consistent among nurses, but there was an overall deficit in nurses' knowledge of mechanism of action. Four major themes were identified from the 24 interviews: patient-centred care, caution and safety as principles of practice; continuing support and education; improvement of practice over time. All nurses regard the practice positively and to be extremely beneficial to patients. Although apprehensive at the start of their nurse-initiated medications practice, confidence improved with exposure and experience. Nurses sought additional information from colleagues and the available evidence-based resources. CONCLUSION: Medication knowledge is not the sole determinant of nurse-initiated medications practice.

Lin_2019_Joofadnu,JOUR,"Perceptions of patient participation in symptom management: A qualitative study with cancer patients, doctors, and nurses","Lin, Cen and Cohen, Emma and Livingston, Patricia M. and Botti, Mari",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To explore people with cancer, doctors', and nurses' understanding of and attitudes toward, patient participation in symptom management. BACKGROUND: In health service policies worldwide, patients are recognized as the important members of the treatment care team. The concept of patient participation can be understood from a variety of perspectives, reflecting the limited conceptual clarity and poor congruence between patients' and clinicians' understanding. DESIGN: A qualitative study conducted using individual interviews. METHODS: Forty one people with cancer, five doctors, and seven nurses were recruited from two oncological medical units of a cancer specialized hospital in Shanghai, China between November 2013 - March 2014. Individual interviews were semi-structured. Data were analysed through framework analysis. RESULTS: Patient participation was perceived as a mutual interaction requiring contribution from both patients and clinicians. Three main themes were uncovered: (a) information exchange is the key to patient participation; (b) negotiated decision-making can be achieved in various ways; and (c) patients' self-management can be a form of patient participation. Patient participation was recognized by both patients and clinicians as an important component of cancer care, however concerns relating to patients' limited knowledge and their ability to negotiate treatment decisions existed among most of the patients, doctors, and nurses. CONCLUSION: This study identified the wide range of activities where patient participation can occur in the context of cancer care. Positive recognition of patients' roles in treatment and care should be advocated among both patients and clinicians to facilitate patients' participation in their own care and enhance clinicians' skills in involving patients.",2019,10.1111/jan.13853,75,2,412-422,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"China and decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Qualitative Research and patient participation and information exchange and Attitude of Health Personnel and cancer and patient involvement and Nurse-Patient Relations and Patients/*psychology and Physicians/*psychology and Patient Participation/*psychology and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and patient engagement and symptom management and Neoplasms/*psychology/*therapy and nurses and doctors and qualitative approaches",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Blakeman_2019_Joofadnu,JOUR,An integrative review of the theory of unpleasant symptoms,"Blakeman, John R.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore how the theory of unpleasant symptoms (TOUS) has been used in the methodological design and analysis of symptom research. DESIGN: An integrative review, using Whittemore and Knafl's approach. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted between 26 January-10 February 2018. Databases included CINAHL Complete, PubMed, Proquest Nursing and Allied Health Source, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, Academic Search Complete and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic approach to searching, screening and analysing the literature was applied. The matrix method, content analysis, constant comparison, counting and clustering were used. RESULTS: Sixty-four records were included. Most studies were quantitative, cross-sectional, instrument-based and conducted in the USA. Various symptoms and patient populations were represented and each of the TOUS concepts were explored. CONCLUSION: Although the theory has a role to play in furthering symptom science, attention should be paid to the areas of the model and of symptom research that have received less attention. More complex statistical approaches and big data will help to illuminate symptom experiences. Additional focus on intervention studies and all symptom dimensions will help to advance symptom science research. IMPACT: This review is the first to provide a comprehensive, systematic summary of the uses of the TOUS across the research literature to date. This theory is a diverse, holistic middle-range theory capable of being applied to multiple symptoms and populations. Researchers should consider using the theory as a conceptual framework for studies to advance symptom science and explore symptoms holistically.",2019,10.1111/jan.13906,75,5,946-961,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and literature review and theory and nursing and Aged, 80 and over and Research Design and models and palliative care and *Disease Management and signs and symptoms and *Nursing Theory and *Models, Nursing and integrative review and middle-range theory and Nursing Care/*standards and Nursing Research/*standards and theoretical and theory of unpleasant symptoms",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Maxwell_2020_Injoofnust,JOUR,"Receptivity of Hospitalized Older Adults and Family Caregivers to Prognostic Information about Aging, Injury, and Frailty: A Qualitative Study","Maxwell, Cathy A. and Mixon, Amanda S. and Conner, Elizabeth and Phillippi, Julia C.",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is the leading prognosticator for poor outcomes and palliative care among older adults. Delivery of negative prognostic information entails potentially difficult conversations about decline and death. OBJECTIVE: The study aims were to: 1) examine hospitalized older adults' and family caregivers' receptivity to general (vs. individualized) prognostic information about frailty, injury, and one-year outcomes; and 2) determine information needs based on prognostic information. DESIGN: Provision of general prognostic information followed by semi-structured interview questions. We deductively analyzed qualitative data within the context of problematic integration theory. SETTING: An academic medical center in the Southeast region of the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was utilized to obtain a distribution of patients across the frailty continuum (non-frail [N=10], pre-frail [N=9], frail [9=6]). Twenty-five older adults (<e2><89><a5> age 65) hospitalized for a primary injury (e.g. fall) and 15 family caregivers of hospitalized patients were enrolled. METHODS: Hospitalized older patients and family caregivers were shown prognostic information about one-year outcomes of injured older adults in the form of simple pictographs. Semi-structured interview questions were administered immediately afterwards. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Demographic and medical information data were used to contextualize the responses during analysis. RESULTS: Overall, participants (patients [56%], caregivers [73%]) were open to receiving prognostic information. A small number of family caregivers (N=3) expressed reservations about the frankness of the information and suggested delivery through a softer approach or not at all. Qualitative data was coded using categories and constructs of problematic integration theory. Four codes (personalizing the evidence, vivid understanding, downhill spiral, realities of aging) reflected probabilistic and evaluative orientation categories of problematic integration theory. One code (fatalism vs. hope) represented manifestations of ambivalence and ambiguity in the theory; and another code (exceptionalism) represented divergence and impossibility. Two codes (role of thought processes, importance of faith) reflected forms of resolutions as described in problematic integration theory. Information needs based on prognostic information revealed four additional codes: give it to me straight, what can I do? what can I expect? and how can I prevent decline? A consistently reported desire of both patients and caregivers was for honesty and hope from providers. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of general prognostic information in conversations about aging, injury, frailty and patient outcomes. Incorporating prognostic information into communication aids can facilitate shared decision making before end-of-life is imminent.",2020,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103602,109,NA,103602,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and Aged and Prognosis and Aging and Frailty and Qualitative Research and Frail Elderly and *Caregivers and Older adults and *Frailty and Injury and Prognostic Information,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clinical decision support systems are believed to have the potential to improve care and to change the behaviour of healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a multi-faceted tailored strategy to implement an electronic clinical decision support system for pressure ulcer prevention improves adherence to recommendations for pressure ulcer prevention in nursing homes. DESIGN: Two-armed randomized controlled trial in a nursing home setting in Belgium. The trial consisted of a 16-week implementation intervention between February and June 2010, including one baseline, four intermediate, and one post-testing measurement. Primary outcome was the adherence to guideline-based care recommendations (in terms of allocating adequate pressure ulcer prevention in residents at risk). Secondary outcomes were the change in resident outcomes (pressure ulcer prevalence) and intermediate outcomes (knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals). SETTING: Random sample of 11 wards (6 experimental; 5 control) in a convenience sample of 4 nursing homes in Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 464 nursing home residents and 118 healthcare professionals participated. METHODS: The experimental arm was involved in a multi-faceted tailored implementation intervention of a clinical decision support system, including interactive education, reminders, monitoring, feedback and leadership. The control arm received a hard-copy of the pressure ulcer prevention protocol, supported by standardized 30 min group lecture. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention arm were significantly more likely to receive fully adequate pressure ulcer prevention when seated in a chair (F=16.4, P=0.003). No significant improvement was observed on pressure ulcer prevalence and knowledge of the professionals. While baseline attitude scores were comparable between both groups [exp. 74.3% vs. contr. 74.5% (P=0.92)], the mean score after the intervention was 83.5% in the experimental group vs. 72.1% in the control group (F=15.12, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The intervention was only partially successful to improve the primary outcome. Attitudes improved significantly while the knowledge of the healthcare workers remained unsatisfactorily low.

Weng_2012_Joofclnu,JOUR,Family caregiver distress with children having rare genetic disorders: a qualitative study involving Russell-Silver Syndrome in Taiwan,"Weng, Hsin-Ju and Niu, Dau-Ming and Turale, Sue and Tsao, Lee-Ing and Shih, Fu-Jong and Yamamoto-Mitani, Noriko and Chang, Chun-Chi and Shih, Fu-Jin",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: To extend nursing knowledge of distress experienced by family caregivers of children with rare genetic disorders, by exploring the perspectives of caregivers of children with Russell-Silver Syndrome in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: Caring for a child with a rare genetic disorder often has profound effects on families, especially when diagnosis and treatment is complex or not yet well developed, such as that in Russell-Silver Syndrome (or Silver-Russell syndrome). This disorder causes dwarfism and developmental difficulties, requiring long-term care planning. Previous research has focused mostly on medical care, but little is known about families' perspectives of caring difficulties, the help they need and nursing care required. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative approach was used to inform this study. METHODS: Family caregivers, whose children were undergoing medical care in a leading Taiwan medical centre, were invited to participate in face-to-face, in-depth interviews. Data were analysed by content analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen caregivers including 11 mothers, two fathers and two grandmothers participated. Five major themes and 13 sub-themes of care-giving distress were identified: endless psychological worries; the lengthy process to confirm a medical diagnosis; adjustment efforts in modifying family roles; dilemmas in deciding between Western or Chinese traditional medicine; and negative responses to society's concerns. Their primary sources of support were spouses, parents and health professionals, accordingly. CONCLUSION: Complex physio-psycho-social and decision-making distress in caring for children with a rare genetic disorder were systematically revealed from the perspectives of ethnic-Chinese family caregivers. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Long-term care plans for children with a rare genetic disorder such as Russell-Silver Syndrome need to focus on positive dynamic family interactions, life-stage development and family caregiver support. Research on care-giving in rare genetic disorders is also warranted across cultures and countries to develop a substantial knowledge basis for nursing practice.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03583.x,21,1-2,160-169,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Child and Taiwan and Caregivers/*psychology and Family/*psychology and *Stress, Psychological and Silver-Russell Syndrome/*nursing",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Stevenson_2012_Joofadnu,JOUR,Nurses' perceptions of an electronic patient record from a patient safety perspective: a qualitative study,"Stevenson, Jean E. and Nilsson, Gunilla",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: The overall aim of this study was to explore nurses' perceptions of using an electronic patient record in everyday practice, in general ward settings. This paper reports on the patient safety aspects revealed in the study. BACKGROUND: Electronic patient records are widely used and becoming the main method of nursing documentation. Emerging evidence suggests that they fail to capture the essence of clinical practice and support the most frequent end-users: nurses. The impact of using electronic patient records in general ward settings is under-explored. METHOD: In 2008, focus group interviews were conducted with 21 Registered Nurses. This was a qualitative study and the data were analysed by content analysis. At the time of data collection, the electronic patient record system had been in use for approximately 1 year. FINDINGS: The findings related to patient safety were clustered in one main category: 'documentation in everyday practise'. There were three sub-categories: vital signs, overview and medication module. Nurses reported that the electronic patient record did not support nursing practice when documenting crucial patient information, such as vital signs.

BACKGROUND: In the final stage of dementia disease, the persons are often cared for at nursing homes and they often die there. The research concurs that a palliative approach to end-of-life care is essential but there are still some limitations regarding research about what constitutes the end-of-life care provided to persons affected by dementia in Sweden. DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative method with a retrospective approach. METHOD: Nursing records (n = 50) and medical records (n = 50) were retrospectively reviewed in two nursing homes. The analysis was conducted using deductive and inductive content analysis. Three phases of The Liverpool Care Pathway; Initial assessment, Continuous assessment and Follow-up, were used deductively to first sort the text in the records, then the text in each phase was further analysed with inductive content analysis. Four categories and 11 subcategories described the content in the records. RESULTS: The end-of-life care was described in the healthcare records based on such categories as decision-making, participation and communication, assessment and prevention of symptom and following up after the residents had died. CONCLUSION: Paticularly, physical symptoms were documented and, to a lesser degree, psychological or existential/spiritual needs.

C. and Zuurmond, Wouter W. A. and Perez, Roberto S. G. M.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a nationwide study conducted to assess experiences of nurses involved in palliative sedation at home after introduction of a physicians' guideline for palliative sedation. BACKGROUND: Most studies investigating the practice of palliative sedation focus on physicians' practices and attitudes. However, little is known about experiences and attitudes of nurses. METHODS: A web-based structured questionnaire was offered to 387 nurses providing medical technical care in 2007, assessing their experiences concerning decision-making, treatment policy and communication, focussing on the last patient receiving palliative sedation. RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by 201 nurses (response rate 52%). The majority of respondents agreed with the indication for palliative sedation. However, 21% reported to have refused carrying out a palliative sedation in the preceding year. The general practitioner was not present at the start of palliative sedation in a third of the cases, but was available when needed. The sedation was considered insufficiently effective by 42% of the respondents. According to a third of the respondents, the level of sedation was not related to the required level of symptom relief nor were changes in dosage based on the severity of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Although the guideline for palliative sedation appears to be followed adequately in the majority of cases with respect to indication for palliative sedation and reportage.

Van.Otterloo_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,Maternal risk during pregnancy: a concept analysis,"Van Otterloo, Lucy R. and Connelly, Cynthia D.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To report an analysis of the concept of maternal risk and explore implications for practice using Walker and Avant's eight step method analysis. BACKGROUND: Although mortality during pregnancy is a relatively rare occurrence, serious maternal morbidities are increasingly present in today's pregnant population. Risk factors have been identified that increase the potential for morbidities and subsequent care modalities have been implemented to decrease this risk. However, despite the wide use of the term 'risk' in the medical and nursing literature, determining a common definition is difficult. Differences in the understanding of risk during pregnancy can hinder the ability to provide consistent and appropriate care. DESIGN: Concept analysis. METHODS: A search of the English literature was completed using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar for years 2000-2014 using the keywords 'risk', 'maternal' and 'pregnancy'. RESULTS: Three defining attributes of risk were identified: chance of injury/loss, cognitive recognition and the decision-making processes. The antecedent of risk is the ability to understand the situation and cognitive ability to think about the potential consequences and adverse outcomes. Consequences of risk include the actual action taken as a result of the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: This paper contributes to the understanding of risk allowing for the development of an individualised plan of care for each pregnant woman and empowering the nurse to advocate for appropriate care. Findings in this analysis assist nurses in bridging the gap in communication between the provider's and pregnant woman's interpretation of risk. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The analysis of risk resulted in the identification of differences in perceptions of risk that can potentially result in miscommunication between provider and pregnant woman and increase the risk of inadequate or incomplete care.",2016,10.1111/jocn.13294,25,17-18,2393-2401,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Concept Formation and *Risk Assessment and *Maternal Mortality and pregnancy and *Practice Patterns, Nurses' and concept analysis and Models, Nursing and maternal risk and maternity nursing and Obstetric Nursing and Pregnancy Complications/*mortality/nursing",NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hov_2007_Joofclnu,JOUR,Being an intensive care nurse related to questions of withholding or withdrawing curative treatment,"Hov, Reidun and Hedelin, Birgitta and Athlin, Elsy",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to acquire a deeper understanding of what it is to be an intensive care nurse in situations related to questions of withholding or withdrawing curative treatment. BACKGROUND: Nurses in intensive care units regularly face critically ill patients. Some patients do not benefit from the treatment and die after days or months of apparent pain and suffering. A general trend is that withdrawal of treatment in intensive care units is increasing. Physicians are responsible for decisions concerning medical treatment, but as nurses must carry out physicians' decisions, they are involved in the consequences. DESIGN AND METHODS: The research design was qualitative, based on interpretative phenomenology. The study was carried out at an adult intensive care unit in Norway. Data were collected by group interviews inspired by focus group methodology. Fourteen female intensive care nurses participated, divided into two groups. Colaizzi's model was used in the process of analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed four main themes which captured the nurses' experiences: loneliness in responsibility, alternation between optimism and pessimism, uncertainty--a constant shadow and professional pride despite little formal influence. The essence of being an intensive care nurse in the care of patients when questions were raised concerning curative treatment or not, was understood as 'being a critical interpreter and a dedicated helper.' CONCLUSIONS: The findings underpin the important role of intensive care nurses in providing care and treatment to patients related to questions of withholding or withdrawing curative treatment.

Sanders_2008_Joofclnu,JOUR,Parents' narratives about their experiences of their child's reconstructive genital surgeries for ambiguous genitalia,"Sanders, Caroline and Carter, Bernie and Goodacre, Lynne",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: The aim of this study was to initiate an exploration of parents' understanding and experiences of their child's reconstructive genital surgeries for ambiguous genitalia. BACKGROUND: The determination of gender for a child born with ambiguous genitalia is a complex medical and social process influenced by biological, psychological, social and cultural factors. Two main approaches exist; one promotes interventions (optimal gender policy) while the other suggests delaying interventions (informed consent policy) until the child can contribute to the decision. METHODS: An exploratory narrative inquiry design was chosen. Data were collected through narrative interviews with a purposive non-random sample of 10 parents of eight children (aged 0-11 years) who had ambiguous genitalia. RESULTS: Parents' stories reflected strong protective instincts towards their children along with feelings of shock and disbelief. Parents' social construction of gender influenced their attitudes and beliefs about their child's ambiguous genitalia and the need for surgery. Parents' desired to be 'good parents' and do what they perceived as 'right' for their child. They considered genital surgery as a necessity primarily relying on medical advice to guide them at times of uncertainty and confusion. Parents rarely shared stories about their child's surgeries/genitalia outside of the couple relationship and these stories were often referred to as 'secrets'. CONCLUSION: Having a child with ambiguous genitalia was perceived as problematic and brought about changes in roles, responsibilities, goals and social status as a parent beyond those usually associated with parenthood. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These early findings help increase awareness of parents' experiences and of the problems and emotional challenges that parents face when their child is born with genital ambiguity.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02006.x,17,23,3187-3195,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Child and Decision Making and Family and *Narration and Parents/*psychology and Genitalia/*surgery and Urogenital Surgical Procedures/*psychology,NA,NA,2008/12//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cadorin_2017_Joofadnu,JOUR,Developing an instrument to measure emotional behaviour abilities of meaningful learning through the Delphi technique,"Cadorin, Lucia and Bagnasco, Annamaria and Tolotti, Angela and Pagnucci, Nicola and Sasso, Loredana",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To identify items for a new instrument that measures emotional behaviour abilities of meaningful learning, according to Fink's Taxonomy. BACKGROUND: Meaningful learning is an active process that promotes a wider and deeper understanding of concepts. It is the result of an interaction between new and previous knowledge and produces a long-term change of knowledge and skills. To measure meaningful learning capability, it is very important in the education of health professionals to identify problems or special learning needs. For this reason, it is necessary to create valid instruments. DESIGN: A Delphi Study technique was implemented in four phases by means of e-mail. METHODS: The study was conducted from April-September 2015. An expert panel consisting of ten researchers with experience in Fink's Taxonomy was established to identify the items of the instrument. Data were analysed for conceptual description and item characteristics and attributes were rated. Expert consensus was sought in each of these phases. An 87<c2><b7>5% consensus cut-off was established. RESULTS: After four rounds, consensus was obtained for validation of the content of the instrument 'Assessment of Meaningful learning Behavioural and Emotional Abilities'. This instrument consists of 56 items evaluated on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Foundational Knowledge, Application, Integration, Human Dimension, Caring and Learning How to Learn were the six major categories explored. CONCLUSIONS: This content validated tool can help educators (teachers, trainers and tutors) to identify and improve the strategies to support students' learning capability, which could increase their awareness of and/or responsibility in the learning process.",2017,10.1111/jan.13273,73,9,2208-2218,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"deep learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and nursing and Delphi Technique and Delphi technique and measurement and Health Personnel/*education and *Emotions and *Learning and Education, Nursing/*methods and consensus and meaningful learning and significant learning and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Psychometrics/*instrumentation/*methods",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ley_2019_Joofclnu,JOUR,The dose of physical activity to minimise functional decline in older general medical patients receiving 24-hr acute care: A systematic scoping review,"Ley, Lenore and Khaw, Damien and Duke, Maxine and Botti, Mari",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify evidence for a recommended and feasible activity dose to minimise functional decline in older hospitalised general medical patients. BACKGROUND: Quality 24-hr care of older patients involves balancing activity to minimise functional decline, with rest to aid recovery. However, there is limited guidance regarding an optimal type and dose of activity to minimise functional decline in hospitalised elders receiving acute medical care. DESIGN: A systematic search and scoping review of the literature were conducted following Joanna Briggs methodological guidance. METHODS: The results were reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. Study bias was determined using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. RESULTS: Fifteen primary studies of variable design, rigour and potential for bias were included. Study contexts were general medical wards (n = 11, 73.3%), Acute care of the elderly unit (n = 3, 20%) and a nursing unit (n = 1, 6.7%) located in tertiary referral acute hospitals. Most participants were aged 75-84 years (n = 10, 66%), had variable medical diagnoses and samples were either physically capable (n = 4, 26.7%) of limited physical capability (n = 1, 6.7%) or of mixed capability to mobilise independently (n = 10, 66.7%). Walking at least twice a day for approximately 20 min in total appeared to be associated with less functional decline in older patients of variable physical capabilities, and the overall efficacy of twice-daily exercise to reduce functional decline was supported. CONCLUSION: The evidence tentatively supported walking for hospitalised elders, irrespective of physical capability, and based on one RCT, suggested likely benefits of graduated exercise in dependent elders. Insufficient evidence limits prescription of optimal doses of physical activity to minimise functional decline. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review could provide evidence for nurses to promote function in older patients by specifying a dose of physical activity to be undertaken in hospital.",2019,10.1111/jocn.14872,28,17-18,3049-3064,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Hospitalization and Humans and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and evidence-based practice and Exercise/*physiology and *Clinical Deterioration and acute care and older patients and Critical Care Nursing/*methods and Acute Disease/nursing and clinical-decision-making and daily activities of living and exercise intervention and gerontology and hospital care and medical nursing and quality and safety",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: An exploratory cross-sectional study design. METHODS: A mailed letter recruited participants with data collection occurring on a secure online survey platform between November 2017-February 2018. Data analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics and stepwise linear regression. RESULTS: Palliative care nurse attitudes towards medical assistance in dying were explained by perceived expertise in the social domain of palliative care, personal importance of religion/faith, professional importance of religion/faith, and nursing designation. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the perceived importance of religion, versus religious affiliation alone, as significant in influencing provider attitudes towards assisted dying. Further research is needed to understand differences in attitudes between Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses and how the social domain of palliative care influences nurse attitude. IMPACT: Organizations must prioritize nursing input, encourage open interprofessional dialogue and provide support for ethical decision-making, practice decisions, and conscientious objection surrounding medical assistance in dying.

Shepherd_2018_Injoofnust,JOUR,"Knowledge of, and participation in, advance care planning: A cross-sectional study of acute and critical care nurses' perceptions","Shepherd, Jan and Waller, Amy and Sanson-Fisher, Rob and Clark, Katherine and Ball, Jean",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Nurses have a core role in facilitating discussions and enacting decisions about end-of-life issues for patients in hospitals. Nurses' own knowledge and attitudes may influence whether they engage in meaningful end-of-life conversations with patients. AIMS: To determine in a sample of nurses working in acute and critical care hospital wards: 1) their knowledge of advance care planning, including the authority of substitute decision-makers and legal validity of advance directives; 2) their own participation in advance care planning decision-making practices; and 3) associations between nurses' socio-demographic characteristics; clinical expertise; and knowledge and behaviour in relation to advance care planning practices. DESIGN: Questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted with 181 registered and enrolled nurses employed in acute and critical care wards of three metropolitan hospitals in Australia. RESULTS: Nurses were least knowledgeable about items relating to the authority of medical (56%) and financial (42%) substitute decision-makers. Few nurses had prepared advance directives (10%) or appointed medical (23%) or financial (27%) decision-makers, when compared to discussing end-of-life wishes (53%) or organ donation (75%). Overall, 15% of nurses had not engaged in any advance care planning practices. Nurses who had cared for 11-30 dying patients in the last six months were more likely to have an increased knowledge score. Older nurses were more likely to participate in a greater number of advance care planning practices and an increase in shifts worked per week led to a significant decrease in nurses' participation. CONCLUSION: Nurses have a key role in providing advice and engaging dying patients and their families in advance care planning practices. Nurses' own knowledge and rates of participation are low. Further education and support is needed to ensure that nurses have an accurate knowledge of advance care planning practices, including how, when and with whom wishes should be discussed and can be enacted.",2018,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2018.06.005,86,NA,74-81,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Hospitals and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Pilot Projects and Nurses and Knowledge and Focus Groups and New South Wales and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Advance Care Planning and Advance care planning and Terminal care and *Critical Care Nursing and Legal guardians and Nursing staff",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Choi_2018_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Effects of using mobile device-based academic electronic medical records for clinical practicum by undergraduate nursing students: A quasi-experimental study,"Choi, Mona and Lee, HyeongSuk and Park, Joon Ho",Nurse education today,"INTRODUCTION: The academic electronic medical record (AEMR) system is applied with the expectation that nursing students will be able to attain competence in healthcare decision-making and nursing informatics competencies. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the advantage of applying mobile devices to clinical practicum. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effect of an experiment that introduced a mobile AEMR application for undergraduate nursing students in their practicum. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used. The subjects were 75 third-year nursing students enrolled in clinical practicum and were divided into an experimental (practicum with AEMR) and a control (conventional practicum) group. Nursing informatics competencies, critical thinking disposition, and satisfaction with clinical practicum were measured before and after the clinical practicum for each group. The usability of the AEMR application was also examined for the experimental group after the experiment. RESULTS: After the experiment, the experimental group showed a significant increase in the informatics knowledge domain of nursing informatics competencies in the post-test. The difference in critical thinking between the experimental and control groups was not statistically significant. Regarding satisfaction with the clinical practicum, the experimental group exhibited a significantly higher level of satisfaction in ""preparation of a diagnostic test or laboratory test and understanding of the results"" and ""nursing intervention and documentation"" than the control group. Students who participated in the practicum using the AEMR application considered it useful. CONCLUSIONS: The AEMR application was an effective educational method for practicing the immediate documentation of students' observations and interventions and was available at the patients' bedsides. To improve critical thinking, it is necessary to apply a variety of approaches when solving clinical problems.",2018,10.1016/j.nedt.2017.11.018,61,NA,112-119,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,"Electronic health records and Humans and Female and Male and Young Adult and Nursing and Students and Nursing Informatics and Clinical Competence and Computers, Handheld and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and Nursing informatics and Mobile application and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate and *Preceptorship and Clinical competence and Computer-Assisted Instruction/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Trapani_2016_Joofadnu,JOUR,Dual agency in critical care nursing: Balancing responsibilities towards colleagues and patients,"Trapani, Josef and Scholes, Julie and Cassar, Maria",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To explore critical care nurses' decisions to seek help from doctors. BACKGROUND: Despite their well-documented role in improving critically ill patients' outcomes, research indicates that nurses rarely take decisions about patients' treatment modalities on their own and constantly need to seek advice or authorization for their clinical decisions, even for protocol-guided actions. However, research around the factors related to, and the actual process of, such referrals is limited. DESIGN: A grounded theory study, underpinned by a symbolic interactionist perspective. METHODS: Data collection took place in a general intensive care unit between 2010 - 2012 and involved: 20 hours of non-participant and 50 hours of participant observation; ten informal and ten formal interviews; and two focus groups with ten nurses, selected by purposive and theoretical sampling. Data analysis was guided by the dimensional analysis approach to generating grounded theory. FINDINGS: Nurses' decisions to seek help from doctors involve weighing up several occasionally conflicting motivators. A central consideration is that of balancing their moral obligation to safeguard patients' interests with their duty to respect doctors' authority. Subsequently, nurses end up in a position of dual agency as they need to concurrently act as an agent to medical practitioners and patients. CONCLUSION: Nurses' dual agency relationship with patients and doctors may deter their moral obligation of keeping patients' interest as their utmost concern. Nurse leaders and educators should, therefore, enhance nurses' assertiveness, courage and skills to place patients' interest at the forefront of all their actions and interactions.",2016,10.1111/jan.13008,72,10,2468-2481,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"decision-making and Humans and grounded theory and seeking help and Intensive Care Units and Critical Care and *Decision Making and *Nursing Staff, Hospital and critical care and nurses and *Critical Care Nursing and dimensional analysis and dual agency and principal-agent theory and referral",NA,NA,2016/10//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a structured, nurse-led post-discharge advance care planning programme on congruence between the end-of-life care preferences of the patient and family members, decisional conflicts and the documentation of care preferences. DESIGN: A two-arm parallel-group randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 230 dyads comprising community-dwelling patients screened by the Gold Standards Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance and their designated family members. METHODS: Patients in the experimental group participated in a structured advance care planning programme administered by a trained nurse during three weekly home visits following hospital discharge. In contrast, the post-discharge home visits provided to the control group focused on self-care management as attention control. The study outcomes were the dyadic congruence regarding end-of-life care preferences, the patients' level of decisional conflict regarding end-of-life decision-making and the documentation of these preferences at baseline and 1 and 6 months after enrolment. Generalised estimating equation models were used to compare changes in the outcomes between the groups across time. RESULTS: At baseline, few participants had ever heard of advance directives (12/460, 2.6%) and few patients had ever discussed end-of-life issues with family members (34/230, 14.8%). After six months, the experimental group exhibited a greater increase in dyadic congruence regarding various end-of-life care preferences than the control group (Ps < 0.04). The experimental group also exhibited a greater improvement in decisional conflict at 6 months relative to the control group (P = 0.003). However, the groups did not differ significantly in terms of changes in any outcomes after one month. The experimental group had significantly higher rates of completion of advance directives and electronic medical record documentation of do-not-attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a nurse-led structured advance care planning programme could effectively improve dyadic congruence regarding end-of-life care preferences, reduce patients' decisional conflict and increase the documentation of care preferences. The findings underscored the importance of supporting nurses to introduce advance care planning at an earlier time that enable patients with sufficient time to contemplate end-of-life issues, empower patients to deliberate their choices and engage patients and their family members in open discussion.",2018,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2018.07.008,87,NA,26-33,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Communication and Decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Patient empowerment and Aged, 80 and over and *Patient Discharge and Independent Living and Family/*psychology and *Terminal Care and Hong Kong and *Advance Care Planning and Advance care planning and End-of-life care and Conflict, Psychological and Nurse",NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the factors that influence intensive care patient discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ethnographic study was undertaken in an Australian metropolitan tertiary hospital that had a 14-bed level 3 intensive care unit. Intensive care and acute care unit medical and nursing staff, and other hospital staff who were involved in the intensive care patient discharge process participated in this study. A total of 28 discharges were observed, and 56 one on one interviews were conducted. METHODS: Data collection techniques including direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and collection of existing documents were used. Activity theory was the theoretical framework that underpinned this study. FINDINGS: Three patient activity systems were identified: intensive care patient discharge activity, acute care unit accepting patient activity, and hospital bed management activity. Analysis of the interactions among these activity systems revealed conflicting objects (goals), communication breakdowns, and teamwork issues. CONCLUSION: Discharge delay was found to be a significant problem, which was associated with limited acute care unit bed availability. Strategies to improve acute care unit bed availability are needed. Routine after-hours ICU discharge could raise patient safety concerns which need to be considered. All team members' input in discharge decision making should be encouraged. Problems identified in clinical handover call for actions to change the handover practice.

Saunders_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Translating knowledge into best practice care bundles: a pragmatic strategy for EBP implementation via moving postprocedural pain management nursing guidelines into clinical practice,"Saunders, Hannele",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe quantitative and qualitative best evidence as sources for practical interventions usable in daily care delivery in order to integrate best evidence into clinical decision-making at local practice settings. To illustrate the development, implementation and evaluation of a pain management nursing care bundle based on a clinical practice guideline via a real-world clinical exemplar. BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of evidence-based practice requires consistent integration of best evidence into daily clinical decision-making. Best evidence comprises high-quality knowledge summarised in systematic reviews and translated into guidelines. However, consistent integration of guidelines into care delivery remains challenging, partly due to guidelines not being in a usable form for daily practice or relevant for the local context. DESIGN: A position paper with a clinical exemplar of a nurse-led, evidence-based quality improvement project to design, implement and evaluate a pain management care bundle translated from a national nursing guideline. METHODS: A pragmatic approach to integrating guidelines into daily practice is presented. Best evidence from a national nursing guideline was translated into a pain management care bundle and integrated into daily practice in 15 medical-surgical (med-surg) units of nine hospitals of a large university hospital system in Finland. CONCLUSIONS: Translation of best evidence from guidelines into usable form as care bundles adapted to the local setting may increase implementation and uptake of guidelines and improve quality and consistency of care delivery.

Hoglund_2019_Joofclnu,JOUR,The ambulance nurse experiences of non-conveying patients,"Hoglund, Erik and Schroder, Agneta and Moller, Margareta and Andersson-Hagiwara, Magnus and Ohlsson-Nevo, Emma",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore ambulance nurses' (ANs) experiences of non-conveying patients to alternate levels of care. BACKGROUND: Increases in ambulance utilisation and in the number of patients seeking ambulance care who do not require medical supervision or treatment during transport have led to increased nonconveyance (NC) and referral to other levels of care. DESIGN: A qualitative interview study was conducted using an inductive research approach. METHODS: The study was conducted in a region in the middle of Sweden during 2016-2017. Twenty nurses were recruited from the ambulance departments in the region. A conventional content analysis was used to analyse the interviews. The study followed the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: The ANs experienced NC as a complex and difficult task that carried a large amount of responsibility. They wanted to be professional, spend time with the patient and find the best solution for him or her. These needs conflicted with the ANs' desire to be available for assignments with a higher priority. The ANs could feel frustrated when they perceived that ambulance resources were being misused and when it was difficult to follow the NC guidelines. CONCLUSION: If ANs are expected to nonconvey patients seeking ambulance care, they need a formal mandate, knowledge and access to primary health care.

Andersen.Hollekim_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,Narratives of patient participation in haemodialysis,"Andersen-Hollekim, Tone and Solbjor, Marit and Kvangarsnes, Marit and Hole, Torstein and Landstad, Bodil J.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To explore how working-age adults experience patient participation in hospital haemodialysis. BACKGROUND: End-stage kidney disease is a progressive, chronic condition imposing patients with high treatment burdens and low health-related quality of life. Patients face multiple medical decisions related to living with kidney failure. Given their frequent interaction with health services, patient participation may be of special value. DESIGN: Qualitative design with a narrative approach. METHODS: In 2018, eleven patients aged 35-64 years undergoing hospital haemodialysis participated in individual interviews. All interviews were analysed using a narrative approach. Reporting followed the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. FINDINGS: The patients' narratives of participation comprised three themes following their healthcare trajectory: Informed, but not involved in treatment choices; Duality of care and control; and Frail trust reflecting collaborative deficiencies. The patients received good information about dialysis, but were not involved in choice of treatment modality. Professional work, as well as the nature of treatment, contributed to restricted patient autonomy. Patients' trust suffered from collaborative deficiency generating delays in their treatment trajectories, and patients extended their responsibility into the coordination of transitions as a way of coping with these issues. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified challenges related to patient involvement and interdisciplinary collaboration. Involving patients through dialogue and acknowledging their experiences, preferences and lifestyles may strengthen the mutual patient-professional understanding of treatment. Despite increased focus on seamless trajectories, patients face obstacles regarding interdisciplinary collaboration and coordination of health services. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings indicate a want of individually customised care for people requiring dialysis. Patients need to be involved in the choice of treatment modality as well as decisions related to the current treatment. Information must include potential consequences of the different treatment modalities. Health services need to strengthen collaboration in order to secure treatment continuity and patient involvement.",2020,10.1111/jocn.15238,29,13-14,2293-2305,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and patient participation and Adaptation, Psychological and Patient Preference and *Quality of Life and *Patient Participation and Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy and renal dialysis and healthcare trajectory and narration and Renal Dialysis/nursing/*psychology and working-age adults",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Emsfors_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Nursing actions that create a sense of good nursing care in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration,"Emsfors, Asa and Christensson, Lennart and Elgan, Carina",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe nursing actions performed by nurses that create a sense of good nursing care in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. BACKGROUND: People who suffer from wet age-related macular degeneration risk central vision loss. Treatment with antivascular endothelial growth factor is the only available option at present that preserves vision and no definitive cure currently exists. Patients feel that they are compelled to accept this treatment because they might otherwise become blind. DESIGN: An explorative and descriptive design based on the critical incident technique was used. METHOD: Interviews with 16 Swedish patients who all had received intravitreal treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration. RESULTS: Two main areas of good nursing care were identified: 'Being perceived as an individual' and 'Being empowered'. The first area was divided into two categories: being respectful and being engaged. Being respectful was observed when nurses had a benevolent attitude towards their patients and answered questions kindly and politely. Patients saw themselves as individuals when nurses were available for conversation and focused on them. The second area was divided into two categories: encouraging participation and creating confidence. Encouraging participation refers to when nurses provided information continuously. Nurses instilled confidence and trust in their patients by keeping promises and by being honest. CONCLUSIONS: A respectful interaction between patients and caregivers is necessary for patients to obtain beneficial health care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patient interviews revealed important information about nursing actions that created a sense of good nursing care in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration.

We mailed anonymous questionnaires to physicians who signed the death certificates and asked them to report on ELDs, including nurses' involvement. RESULTS: Response rate was 59% (n=2950). Physicians reported nurses involved in decision making more often in institutions than at home, and more often in care homes for the elderly than in hospitals (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.15, 2.52). This involvement was more frequently when physicians intended to hasten the patient's death than when they had no such intention (institutions: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.41, 2.99; home: OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.19, 3.49). In institutions, this involvement was also more likely where patients were of lower rather than higher education (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.49, 5.84). The administering of life-ending drugs by nurses, as reported by physicians was also found more frequently in institutions than at home, and in institutions more frequently with lower rather than higher educated patients (p=.037). CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise questions about physicians' perception of the nurse's role in ELDs, but also about physicians' skills in interacting with all patients. Education and guidelines for physicians and nurses are needed to optimize good communication and to promote a clearer assignment of responsibilities concerning the execution of those decisions.",2008,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2007.06.005,45,7,1022-1031,eng,0020-7489,Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Belgium and Nurse-Patient Relations and *Terminal Care and *Nurses and *Death Certificates,NA,NA,2008/07//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Astroth_2013_Joofclnu,JOUR,Qualitative exploration of nurses' decisions to activate rapid response teams,"Astroth, Kim S. and Woith, Wendy M. and Stapleton, Stephen J. and Degitz, R. Joseph and Jenkins, Sheryl H.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers and facilitators to nurses' decisions regarding activation of rapid response teams (RRTs) in hospitals. BACKGROUND: Hospitalised patients in the United States who experience cardiopulmonary arrest seldom recover. Most of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration prior to cardiopulmonary arrest. RRTs have been shown to decrease the incidence of cardiopulmonary arrest by bringing needed resources to unstable patients. Despite the evidence in support of the activation of RRTs, nurses do not always use this resource. Nurses' decisions to activate or not to activate the RRT are not clearly understood. DESIGN: We used a qualitative design for this study. METHODS: A purposive sample of 15 medical/surgical nurses was recruited from a small medical centre in the Midwest. Researchers used semistructured, open-ended questions to elicit subject responses regarding facilitators and barriers to activating RRTs. RESULTS: Themes emerged and were categorised as facilitators and barriers to calling the RRT. Facilitators and barriers were then subdivided into distinct subthemes: RRT characteristics and unit culture. The expertise of the RRT members and support and encouragement from nursing unit colleagues and leaders emerged as two potential facilitators. Communication of the RRT members and calling the physician first emerged as two potential barriers. We also identified educational factors that were not clearly facilitators or barriers to calling the RRT. CONCLUSIONS: Further study is needed using quantitative designs with larger sample sizes. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses can build upon knowledge of facilitators and barriers related to RRT characteristics and nursing unit culture.",2013,10.1111/jocn.12067,22,19-20,2876-2882,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,communication and Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Qualitative Research and Midwestern United States and *Decision Making and nurse and Nursing Staff/*psychology and *Hospital Rapid Response Team and qualitative design and rapid response team,NA,NA,2013/10//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Coad_2008_Joofadnu,JOUR,Is children's choice in health care rhetoric or reality? A scoping review,"Coad, Jane E. and Shaw, Karen L.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a scoping review examining children and young people's health services with respect to choice in order to inform future development of choice initiatives. BACKGROUND: The importance of including children and young people in the choice agenda reflects the increasing acknowledgement that, individually and collectively, they are important consumers of health care in their own right. Data sources. A scoping review of all major health and medical research databases was undertaken using current guidelines to identify original relevant research papers and grey literature sources from 1990 to 2006. REVIEW METHODS: Reference Manager software was used to collate, summarize, categorize, store and retrieve the search results. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were read in full and descriptively summarized using a data extraction sheet. Each paper was repeatedly selected using a snowballing approach until saturation was reached. Results. Children and young people want more say in the planning and development of appropriate hospital and community health services. However, little evaluative research was found about whether these choices are acted upon and lead to more responsive services. CONCLUSION: Choice for children and young people is viewed as a positive development in health care and many innovative examples of their involvement in decision-making were found. These illustrated that, given the opportunity, children and young people are willing and able to make decisions about their healthcare services. However, there is a long way to go before the rhetoric of the choice agenda is realized.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04801.x,64,4,318-327,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and United Kingdom and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and *Patient Participation and *Child Health Services and Child Advocacy",NA,NA,2008/11//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lamb_2019_Joofadnu,JOUR,Nurses' use of conscientious objection and the implications for conscience,"Lamb, Christina and Evans, Marilyn and Babenko-Mould, Yolanda and Wong, Carol and Kirkwood, Ken",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To explore the meaning of conscience for nurses in the context of conscientious objection (CO) in clinical practice. DESIGN: Interpretive phenomenology was used to guide this study. DATA SOURCES: Data were collected from 2016 - 2017 through one-on-one interviews from eight nurses in Ontario. Iterative analysis was conducted consistent with interpretive phenomenology and resulted in thematic findings. REVIEW METHODS: Iterative, phased analysis using line-by-line and sentence highlighting identified key words and phrases. Cumulative summaries of narratives thematic analysis revealed how nurses made meaning of conscience in the context of making a CO. RESULTS: Conscience issues and CO are current, critical issues for nurses. For Canadian nurses this need has been recently heightened by the national legalization of euthanasia, known as Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada. Ethics education, awareness, and respect for nurses' conscience are needed in Canada and across the profession to support nurses to address their issues of conscience in professional practice. CONCLUSION: Ethical meaning emerges for nurses in their lived experiences of encountering serious ethical issues that they need to professionally address, by way of conscience-based COs. IMPACT: This is the first study to explore what conscience means to nurses, as shared by nurses themselves and in the context of CO. Nurse participants expressed that support from leadership, regulatory bodies, and policy for nurses' conscience rights are indicated to address nurses' conscience issues in practice settings.",2019,10.1111/jan.13869,75,3,594-602,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and ethics and qualitative research and Ontario and nursing and *Ethics, Nursing and conscientious objection and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*ethics/*psychology and conscience and Conscientious Refusal to Treat/*ethics and human rights and moral decision-making and Nursing Care/*ethics/*psychology and phenomenology",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Thompson_2009_Joofclnu,JOUR,Nurses' critical event risk assessments: a judgement analysis,"Thompson, Carl and Bucknall, Tracey and Estabrookes, Carole A. and Hutchinson, Alison and Fraser, Kim and de Vos, Rien and Binnecade, Jan and Barrat, Gez and Saunders, Jane",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS: To explore and explain nurses' use of readily available clinical information when deciding whether a patient is at risk of a critical event. BACKGROUND: Half of inpatients who suffer a cardiac arrest have documented but unacted upon clinical signs of deterioration in the 24 hours prior to the event. Nurses appear to be both misinterpreting and mismanaging the nursing-knowledge 'basics' such as heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygenation. Whilst many medical interventions originate from nurses, up to 26% of nurses' responses to abnormal signs result in delays of between one and three hours. METHODS: A double system judgement analysis using Brunswik's lens model of cognition was undertaken with 245 Dutch, UK, Canadian and Australian acute care nurses. Nurses were asked to judge the likelihood of a critical event, 'at-risk' status, and whether they would intervene in response to 50 computer-presented clinical scenarios in which data on heart rate, systolic blood pressure, urine output, oxygen saturation, conscious level and oxygenation support were varied. Nurses were also presented with a protocol recommendation and also placed under time pressure for some of the scenarios. The ecological criterion was the predicted level of risk from the Modified Early Warning Score assessments of 232 UK acute care inpatients. RESULTS: Despite receiving identical information, nurses varied considerably in their risk assessments. The differences can be partly explained by variability in weightings given to information. Time and protocol recommendations were given more weighting than clinical information for key dichotomous choices such as classifying a patient as 'at risk' and deciding to intervene. Nurses' weighting of cues did not mirror the same information's contribution to risk in real patients. Nurses synthesized information in non-linear ways that contributed little to decisional accuracy. The low-moderate achievement (R(a)) statistics suggests that nurses' assessments of risk were largely inaccurate; these assessments were applied consistently among 'patients' (scenarios). Critical care experience was statistically associated with estimates of risk, but not with the decision to intervene. CONCLUSION: Nurses overestimated the risk and the need to intervene in simulated paper patients at risk of a critical event. This average response masked considerable variation in risk predictions, the need for action and the weighting afforded to the information they had available to them. Nurses did not make use of the linear reasoning required for accurate risk predictions in this task. They also failed to employ any unique knowledge that could be shown to make them more accurate. The influence of time pressure and protocol recommendations depended on the kind of judgement faced suggesting then that knowing more about the types of decisions nurses face may influence information use. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Practice developers and educators need to pay attention to the quality of nurses' clinical experience as well as the quantity when developing judgement expertise in nurses. Intuitive unaided decision making in the assessment of risk may not be as accurate as supported decision making. Practice developers and educators should consider teaching nurses normative rules for revising probabilities (even subjective ones) such as Bayes' rule for diagnostic or assessment judgements and also that linear ways of thinking, in which decision support may help, may be useful for many choices that nurses face. Nursing needs to separate the rhetoric of 'holism' and 'expertise' from the science of predictive validity, accuracy and competence in judgement and decision making.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02191.x,18,4,601-612,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Adult and Risk Assessment and United Kingdom and Likelihood Functions and *Nurses,NA,NA,2009/02//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Carabez_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,"'Nurses don't deal with these issues': nurses' role in advance care planning for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients","Carabez, Rebecca and Scott, Megan",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We used a question from the Healthcare Equality Index to explore nurses' knowledge and understanding of medical advance directives, medical power of attorney and other legal documents for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients. BACKGROUND: Until the landmark ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and same-sex couples have had limited relationship rights as only a few states recognised marriages and provided legal protections for same-sex couples. Health care providers' knowledge of and attitudes towards advance care planning plays a significant role in determining whether or not individuals successfully complete advance directives, yet advance care planning for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals is poorly understood among both health care providers and same-sex couples. DESIGN: These data were part of a larger research study that explored the current state of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-sensitive nursing practice. METHOD: Undergraduate nursing students recruited and interviewed nurse key informants (n = 268) about medical advance directives, medical power of attorney and other legal documents for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients. RESULTS: Nearly 50% of key informants indicated a lack of knowledge of advance directives, over 26% reported the difficulties nurses face regarding advance directives are the same for both lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and heterosexual patients, and nearly 25% indicated difficulties including having to decide who has the legal right to make decisions for the patient. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the need for education and training for practising nurses in advance care planning for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients and same-sex couples. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses are in a position to act as educators, advocates and decision makers for their patients.

G. and Huijer Abu-Saad, Huda and van Wijmen, Frans C. B. and Spreeuwenberg, Cor and Ter Meulen, Ruud H. J.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: To report a study on the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in hospitals, conducted as part of a wider study on the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions. BACKGROUND: Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Dutch Minister for Health reason to commission a study on the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, homecare and nursing homes. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent in 2003 to 692 nurses employed in 73 hospital locations. The response suitable for analysis was from 532 (76.9%) nurses. Data were quantitatively analysed using spss version 11.5 for Windows. RESULTS: In almost half of the cases (45.1%), the nurse was the first with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Consultations between physicians and nurses quite often took place (78.8%). In several cases (15.4%), nurses themselves administered the euthanatics with or without a physician. It is not self-evident that hospitals have guidelines concerning euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide. CONCLUSIONS: In the decision-making process, the consultation between the physician and the nurse needs improvement. In administering the euthanatics, physicians should take responsibility and should not leave these actions to nurses. Guidelines may play an important role to improve the collaboration between physicians and nurses and to prevent procedural, ethical and legal misunderstandings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses in clinical practice are often closely involved in the last stage of a person's life. Consequently, they are often confronted with caring for patients requesting euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. The results provide relevant information and may help nurses in defining their role in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, especially in case these practices should become legalised.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02145.x,17,12,1618-1626,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Qualitative Research and Organizational Policy and Health Services Needs and Demand and Netherlands and Nursing Methodology Research and Nurse-Patient Relations and Nursing Evaluation Research and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Health Policy/legislation & jurisprudence and Nurse's Role/*psychology and Physician-Nurse Relations and *Euthanasia/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and *Suicide, Assisted/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Advance Care Planning/ethics/organization & administration and Nursing Staff, Hospital/ethics/*organization & administration/*psychology",NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: The rise in non-directed donors and their ability to initiate kidney chains offer a novel approach to help alleviate the overextended kidney transplant wait list in the USA. However, little is known about the non-directed donors' motivations, characteristics and experiences. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative-dominant study and used a grounded theory approach to analyse data. METHODS: Thirty participants completed in-depth interviews between April 2013-April 2015. Three analysts independently read and coded interview transcripts. Grounded theory techniques were used to develop descriptive categories and identify topics related to the non-directed donors donation experience. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 30 non-directed donorss discussed the topic of spirituality and religiosity when describing their donation experiences, regardless of whether they were actively practising a religion at the time of donation. Specifically, three themes were identified within spirituality and religiosity: motivation to donate, support in the process, and justification of their donation decisions postdonation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study are the first to describe how spirituality and religiosity influenced the experiences of U.S. non-directed donorss and may help improve non-directed donors educational resources for future spiritual or religious non-directed donors, and the overall non-directed donors donation experience in efforts to increase the living donor pool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Spirituality and religiosity are often overlooked yet potentially influential factors in Western medicine, as demonstrated through the experiences of Jehovah's Witnesses and their religious restrictions while undergoing surgery and the beliefs of Christian Scientists against taking medications and receiving medical procedures. Understanding needs of non-directed donors specifically with spirituality and religiosity can better position kidney transplant centres and teams to improve predonation screening of non-directed donor candidates and provide support services during the donation process.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14223,27,7-8,1662-1672,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and qualitative study and United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and grounded theory and health services research and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and *Decision Making and *Motivation and beliefs and Living Donors/*psychology and *Spirituality and *Altruism and transplantation and Christianity/*psychology and Kidney Transplantation/*psychology",NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Allison_2013_Injoofnust,JOUR,Surgery in young adults with inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative account,"Allison, Marion and Lindsay, James and Gould, Dinah and Kelly, Daniel",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease comprises two major intestinal disorders, Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. When medical management cannot control the disease, surgery is necessary. Having an operation is a major concern for young people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Some may try to avoid or defer it. Despite this, afterwards they may have a significant improvement in quality of life. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore the experiences of young people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease who have had, or are about to have, surgery for their condition. DESIGN AND METHOD: Narrative study using semi structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four young adults aged between 18 and 25 (11 male and 13 female) with Inflammatory Bowel Disease who had undergone or were awaiting surgery from one tertiary referral centre in the United Kingdom. FINDINGS: Key factors that affected young people as they approached and adjusted to an operation were elicited which provided an understanding of this change in their lives from their own perspective. The prospect of having an operation, particularly the fear of a stoma, generated anxiety and concern for many of these young people. As young adults, participants tended to want to be involved in deciding when their surgery should occur and to have their opinions considered. The data revealed the different types of support that were given to these participants, what they found helpful and the function that they served. Gender differences were identified in the nature of support required from partners and in body image concerns. Issues and concerns were identified which can be addressed in clinical nursing practice to prepare young adults for this life changing event. These helped to explain how young people viewed the prospect, impact and experience of surgery. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study revealed new information relating to the experience of surgery in young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease including their perceptions of the event itself, their decision making, their greatest concerns, the support they require and their ways of coping. Since there is little published work regarding how surgery affects this particular patient group, the study should be of interest to specialist nurses who are closely involved in the care of young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",2013,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2013.04.003,50,11,1566-1575,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Surgery and Stress, Psychological and Adaptation, Psychological and *Narration and Young people and Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/psychology/*surgery and Narrative study",NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ong_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,The trajectory of experience of critical care nurses in providing end-of-life care: A qualitative descriptive study,"Ong, Keh Kiong and Ting, Kit Cheng and Chow, Yeow Leng",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To understand the perceptions of critical care nurses towards providing end-of-life care. BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing interest in end-of-life care in the critical care setting. In Singapore, approximately half of deaths in the hospital occur during critical care. While nurses are well positioned to provide end-of-life care to patients and their family members, they faced barriers to providing end-of-life care. Also, providing end-of-life care has profound positive and negative psychological effects on nurses, with the latter being more prominent. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design. METHOD: Data collection was performed in a medical intensive care unit of a public tertiary hospital in Singapore. Ten registered nurses were purposively sampled and interviewed individually using a semi-structured interview guide. A codebook was developed to guide coding, and data were thematically analysed. Rigour was maintained. RESULTS: Nurses went through a trajectory of experience. They experienced the culture of care and developed dissatisfaction with it. The tension shaped their perception and meaning of life and death, and they developed mechanisms to reach resolution. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight on nurses' perception as a trajectory of experience and raised several implications on clinical practice, policy and research. There is a need to alleviate the tension nurses face and to facilitate coming to terms with the tension by improving the culture of care and supporting nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses could be involved more in decision-making and empowered to start end-of-life care conversations within the team and with family members. Communication with family members and between nurses and doctors could be improved. Support for nurses providing end-of-life care could be enhanced through promoting social networks, education and bereavement support.

However, only a few studies have developed nursing-relevant tools that help busy clinicians to identify information they need at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: This study developed and validated one of the first automated natural language processing applications to extract wound information (wound type, pressure ulcer stage, wound size, anatomic location, and wound treatment) from free text clinical notes. METHODS AND DESIGN: First, two human annotators manually reviewed a purposeful training sample (n=360) and random test sample (n=1100) of clinical notes (including 50% discharge summaries and 50% outpatient notes), identified wound cases, and created a gold standard dataset. We then trained and tested our natural language processing system (known as MTERMS) to process the wound information. Finally, we assessed our automated approach by comparing system-generated findings against the gold standard. We also compared the prevalence of wound cases identified from free-text data with coded diagnoses in the structured data. RESULTS: The testing dataset included 101 notes (9.2%) with wound information. The overall system performance was good (F-measure is a compiled measure of system's accuracy=92.7%), with best results for wound treatment (F-measure=95.7%) and poorest results for wound size (F-measure=81.9%). Only 46.5% of wound notes had a structured code for a wound diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The natural language processing system achieved good performance on a subset of randomly selected discharge summaries and outpatient notes. In more than half of the wound notes, there were no coded wound diagnoses, which highlight the significance of using natural language processing to enrich clinical decision making. Our future steps will include expansion of the application's information coverage to other relevant wound factors and validation of the model with external data.",2016,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.09.013,64,NA,25-31,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Electronic health records and Automation and Humans and Medical informatics and Natural language processing and *Natural Language Processing and Point-of-Care Systems and Hospital Information Systems and Electronic Data Processing/*methods and *Wounds and Injuries and Nursing informatics and Heart Diseases/*complications and Pressure ulcer and Wound,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic bibliographic databases. REVIEW METHODS: Evidence was extracted from original studies, and integrated in a narrative synthesis guided by the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews. Personal domains were clustered into themes using a modified Delphi technique. RESULTS: A total of 584 articles were screened. 65 unique studies (80 articles) matched our inclusion criteria of which seven were conducted within nursing/midwifery faculties. Six in 10 studies featured applicants to medical school. Across selection processes, we identified 32 personal domains assessed by MMIs, the most frequent being: communication skills (84%), teamwork/collaboration (70%), and ethical/moral judgement (65%). Domains capturing ability to cope with stressful situations (14%), make decisions (14%), and resolve conflict in the workplace (13%) featured in fewer than ten studies overall. Intra- and inter-disciplinary inconsistencies in domain profiles were noted, as well as differences by entry level. MMIs deployed in nursing and midwifery assessed compassion and decision-making more frequently than in all other disciplines. Own programme philosophy and professional body guidance were most frequently cited (~50%) as sources for personal domains; a blueprinting process was reported in only 8% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing, midwifery and allied healthcare professionals should develop their theoretical frameworks for MMIs to ensure they are evidence-based and fit-for-purpose. We suggest a re-evaluation of domain priorities to ensure that students who are selected, not only have the capacity to offer the highest standards of care provision, but are able to maintain these standards when facing clinical practice and organisational pressures.",2018,10.1016/j.nedt.2018.01.016,64,NA,56-64,eng,1532-2793 0260-6917,Humans and Selection and Domains and Interviews as Topic and Health care professional and Choice Behavior and Health Personnel/*education and *School Admission Criteria and *Narration and Midwifery/*education and Compassion fatigue and Attributes and Multiple mini interviews,NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,Nurse Educ Today,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shelton_2016_Nurseductoda,JOUR,Students who developed logical reasoning skills reported improved confidence in drug dose calculation: Feedback from remedial maths classes,"Shelton, Chris",Nurse education today,"BACKGROUND: The safe administration of drugs is a focus of attention in healthcare. It is regarded as acceptable that a formula card or mnemonic can be used to find the correct dose and fill a prescription even though this removes any requirement for performing the underlying computation. Feedback and discussion in class reveal that confidence in arithmetic skills can be low even when students are able to pass the end of semester drug calculation exam. OBJECTIVE: To see if confidence in the understanding and performance of arithmetic for drug calculations can be increased by emphasising student's innate powers of logical reasoning after reflection. DESIGN: Remedial classes offered for students who have declared a dislike or lack of confidence in arithmetic have been developed from student feedback adopting a reasoning by logical step methodology. Students who gave up two hours of their free learning time were observed to engage seriously with the learning methods, focussing on the innate ability to perform logical reasoning necessary for drug calculation problems. Working in small groups allowed some discussion of the route to the answer and this was followed by class discussion and reflection. RESULTS: The results were recorded as weekly self-assessment scores for confidence in calculation. A self-selecting group who successfully completed the end of semester drug calculation exam reported low to moderate confidence in arithmetic. After four weeks focussing on logical skills a significant increase in self-belief was measured. This continued to rise in students who remained in the classes. CONCLUSION: Many students hold a negative belief regarding their own mathematical abilities.

Knowles_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,Evaluation of the implementation of a bowel management protocol in intensive care: effect on clinician practices and patient outcomes,"Knowles, Serena and McInnes, Elizabeth and Elliott, Doug and Hardy, Jennifer and Middleton, Sandy",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a multifaceted implementation of a bowel management protocol on outcomes for intensive care patients, in particular the incidence of constipation and diarrhoea, and on clinicians' bowel management practices. BACKGROUND: Complications associated with poor bowel management for critically ill patients result in adverse outcomes. Implementation of protocols requires strategies proven to change clinician behaviour. DESIGN: Before and after study. METHODS: Our bowel management protocol was implemented using three evidence-based elements: education sessions, printed educational materials in the form of a fact sheet and reminders. We retrospectively collected data from patients' medical records admitted at two time points within three Sydney metropolitan intensive care units (preimplementation, n = 101; postimplementation, n = 107). RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the incidence of constipation and diarrhoea pre and postimplementation of the protocol. Seventy-two per cent (n = 73) of patients preimplementation and 70% (n = 75) of patients postimplementation experienced one or more episodes of constipation (bowels not open for 72 hours or greater), and 16% (n = 16) of patients preimplementation and 20% (n = 21) of patients postimplementation experienced one or more episodes of diarrhoea. There was a slight nonsignificant increase in bowel assessment on admission by medical officers postimplementation (pre, 47%, n = 48; post, 60%, n = 64). CONCLUSION: Targeted multifaceted implementation of a bowel management protocol did not have an impact on the incidence of constipation or diarrhoea for intensive care patients or on clinician practices. The lack of impact on patient outcomes may be due to clinicians' nonadherence to our bowel management protocol. Reasons clinicians' practices did not change may include the influences of clinical decision-making on behaviour. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights difficulties inherent in changing clinician behaviour and practices to improve patient outcomes despite using an evidence-based multifaceted implementation strategy. Further research is required to ascertain the most effective implementation strategies.",2014,10.1111/jocn.12448,23,5-6,716-730,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Retrospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and *Critical Care and intensive care and protocol and bowel management and clinician practices and constipation and Constipation/therapy and Diarrhea/therapy and diarrhoea and medical record audit,NA,NA,2014/03//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Duffield_2010_Joofclnu,JOUR,"Staffing, skill mix and the model of care","Duffield, Christine and Roche, Michael and Diers, Donna and Catling-Paull, Christine and Blay, Nicole",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to explore whether nurse staffing, experience and skill mix influenced the model of nursing care in medical-surgical wards. BACKGROUND: Methods of allocating nurses to patients are typically divided into four types: primary nursing, patient allocation, task assignment and team nursing. Research findings are varied in regard to the relationship between these models of care and outcomes such as satisfaction and quality. Skill mix has been associated with various models, with implications for collegial support, teamwork and patient outcomes. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data collected on 80 randomly selected medical-surgical wards in 19 public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia during 2004-2005. METHODS: Nurses (n = 2278, 80.9% response rate) were surveyed using The Nursing Care Delivery System and the Nursing Work Index-Revised. Staffing and skill mix was obtained from the ward roster and other data from the patient record. Models of care were examined in relation to these practice environment and organisational variables. RESULTS: The models of nursing care most frequently reported by nurses in medical-surgical wards in this study were patient allocation (91%) and team nursing (80%). Primary nursing and task based models were unlikely to be practised. Skill mix, nurse experience, nursing workload and factors in the ward environment significantly influenced the model of care in use. Wards with a higher ratio of degree qualified, experienced registered nurses, working on their 'usual' ward were more likely to practice patient allocation while wards with greater variability in staffing levels and skill mix were more likely to practice team nursing. CONCLUSIONS: Models of care are not prescriptive but are varied according to ward circumstances and staffing levels based on complex clinical decision making skills. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Variability in the models of care reported by ward nurses indicates that nurses adapt the model of nursing care on a daily or shift basis, according to patients' needs, skill mix and individual ward environments.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03225.x,19,15-16,2242-2251,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Workforce and New South Wales and *Models, Organizational and *Clinical Competence and *Nursing and *Hospitals, Public/organization & administration and *Personnel Staffing and Scheduling",NA,NA,2010/08//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Freitas_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,Surgical count process for prevention of retained surgical items: an integrative review,"Freitas, Patricia Scotini and Silveira, Renata Cristina de Campos Pereira and Clark, Alexander Michael and Galvao, Cristina Maria",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To analyse the evidence reported in the literature concerning the surgical count process for surgical sponges, surgical instruments and sharps and to identify knowledge gaps for future research on the surgical count process. BACKGROUND: The surgical count process stands out among the practices advocated by the World Health Organization to ensure surgical safety. The literature indicates that this practice should be performed in all surgical processes. However, surgical items are still retained. DESIGN: Integrative review. METHODS: The literature search was conducted in the PubMed, CINAHL and LILACS databases and included studies on the surgical count process published in English, Spanish and Portuguese from January 2003-December 2013. RESULTS: A total of 28 primary studies were included in the sample, allowing the knowledge on the surgical count process to be summarised and grouped into three categories: risk factors for retained surgical items, how the surgical count process should be performed in the intraoperative period and the accompanying technologies that collaborate to improving the manual count process. CONCLUSIONS: The correct implementation of the surgical count process by the perioperative nurse may contribute to preventing retained surgical items, thereby improving surgical patient safety.

Kooker_2011_Joofclnu,JOUR,Successful strategies to improve RN retention and patient outcomes in a large medical centre in Hawaii,"Kooker, Barbara Molina and Kamikawa, Cynthia",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to describe an assessment of a major retention initiative implemented at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, in response to the nursing workforce shortage in the state. BACKGROUND: After tracking the situation for several years, nursing leadership at the medical centre critically analysed their registered nurse retention data. The retention rate among new nurses in their first year of employment was only 55<c2><b7>97%. DESIGN: A training programme was initiated to improve registered nurse retention and patient care outcomes with external funding from the US Health Resources and Services Administration. METHOD: New nurses were supported via additional training and clinical coaches beyond the basic orientation period. Leadership skills of nurse managers were expanded to strengthen their role in retention of new nurses. Four inpatient nursing units became Magnet Pilot Units to demonstrate progress towards achievement of Magnet standards and improvement of patient outcomes. RESULTS: From 2005-2009, first-year-registered nurse retention improved from 55<c2><b7>97-68<c2><b7>20%; registered nurse vacancy rate decreased from 11<c2><b7>26-2<c2><b7>19%; patient satisfaction increased from 84<c2><b7>6-87<c2><b7>8%; registered nurse satisfaction-autonomy improved from 43<c2><b7>55-49<c2><b7>29; registered nurse satisfaction-decision-making went from 41<c2><b7>13-47<c2><b7>97%; and nosocomial decubitus ulcer rate decreased from 15<c2><b7>3-6<c2><b7>7% in the intensive care units. CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated resources and targeted activities can make a difference in outcomes for both nurses and patients. Keys to success included engaging staff, having high expectations coupled with high support, providing data to unit-level staff to measure improvements emphasising renewed accountability and maintaining the focus on quality patient care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When the goal is to provide the highest level of quality patient care, professional development of staff and managers is important to meet performance expectations and achieve target clinical goals.

Jones_2015_Injoofnust,JOUR,"Unfinished nursing care, missed care, and implicitly rationed care: State of the science review","Jones, Terry L. and Hamilton, Patti and Murry, Nicole",International journal of nursing studies,"OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this review of unfinished care were to: (1) compare conceptual definitions and frameworks associated with unfinished care and related synonyms (i.e. missed care, implicitly rationed care; and care left undone); (2) compare and contrast approaches to instrumentation; (3) describe prevalence and patterns; (4) identify antecedents and outcomes; and (5) describe mitigating interventions. METHODS: A literature search in CINAHL and MEDLINE identified 1828 articles; 54 met inclusion criteria. Search terms included: implicit ration*, miss* care, ration* care, task* undone, and unfinish*care. Analysis was performed in three phases: initial screening and sorting, comprehensive review for data extraction (first author), and confirmatory review to validate groupings, major themes, and interpretations (second author). RESULTS: Reviewed literature included 42 quantitative reports; 7 qualitative reports; 1 mixed method report; and 4 scientific reviews. With one exception, quantitative studies involved observational cross-sectional survey designs. A total of 22 primary samples were identified; 5 involved systematic sampling. The response rate was >60% in over half of the samples. Unfinished care was measured with 14 self-report instruments. Most nursing personnel (55-98%) reported leaving at least 1 task undone. Estimates increased with survey length, recall period, scope of response referent, and scope of resource scarcity considered. Patterns of unfinished care were consistent with the subordination of teaching and emotional support activities to those related to physiologic needs and organizational audits. Predictors of unfinished care included perceived team interactions, adequacy of resources, safety climate, and nurse staffing. Unfinished care is a predictor of: decreased nurse-reported care quality, decreased patient satisfaction; increased adverse events; increased turnover; decreased job and occupational satisfaction; and increased intent to leave. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: Unfinished care is a significant problem in acute care hospitals internationally. Prioritization strategies of nurses leave patients vulnerable to unmet educational, emotional, and psychological needs. Key limitations of the science include the threat of common method/source bias, a lack of transparency regarding the use of combined samples and secondary analysis, inconsistency in the reporting format for unfinished care prevalence, and a paucity of intervention studies.",2015,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.02.012,52,6,1121-1137,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Decision making and Health services and Resource allocation and Medical errors and Workload and Delivery of health care and Health care rationing and Nursing process and *Health Care Rationing and *Nursing Care and Care left undone and Missed care,NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Adderley_2015_Injoofnust,JOUR,Community nurses' judgement for the management of venous leg ulceration: a judgement analysis,"Adderley, Una J. and Thompson, Carl",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: Nurses caring for the large numbers of people with leg ulceration play a key role in promoting quality in health via their diagnostic and treatment clinical judgements. In the UK, audit evidence suggests that the quality of these judgements is often sub optimal. Misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment choices are likely to affect healing rates, patients' quality of life, patient safety and healthcare costs. OBJECTIVES: To explore the diagnostic judgements and treatment choices of UK community nurses managing venous leg ulceration. DESIGN: A judgement analysis based on Brunswik's psychological Lens Model theory. SETTING: UK community and primary care nursing services. PARTICIPANTS: 18 community generalist nurses working in district (home) nursing teams and general practitioner services and 18 community tissue viability specialist nurses. METHODS: During 2011 and 2012, 36 nurses made diagnostic judgements and treatment choices in response to 110 clinical scenarios. Scenarios were generated from real patient cases and presented online using text and wound photographs. The consensus judgements of a panel of nurses with advanced knowledge of leg ulceration judged the same scenarios and provided a standard against which to compare the participants. Correlations and logistic regression models were constructed to generate various indices of judgement and decision ""performance"": accuracy (R(a)), consistency (R(s)) and information use (G) and uncertainty (R(e)). RESULTS: Taking uncertainty into account, nurses could theoretically have achieved a diagnostic level of accuracy of 0.63 but the nurses only achieved an accuracy of 0.48. For the treatment judgement (whether applying high compression was warranted) nurses could have achieved an accuracy of 0.88 but achieved only an accuracy of 0.49. This may have been due to the nurses giving insufficient weight to the diagnostic cues of medical history and appearance of the leg and ulcer and insufficient weight to the treatment cues of type of leg ulcer and pain. CONCLUSION: Clinical judgements and decisions made by nurses managing leg ulceration are complex and uncertain and some of the variability in judgements and choices can be explained by the ways in which nurses process the information and handle the uncertainties, present in clinical encounters.",2015,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2014.09.004,52,1,345-354,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Decision making and Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Research and United Kingdom and *Community Health Nursing and Bandages and Community health nursing and Judgement analysis and Leg ulcer and Leg Ulcer/*nursing and Varicose ulcer and Varicose Ulcer/*nursing and Wound healing,NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zanchetta_2007_Injoofnust,JOUR,Patterns in information strategies used by older men to understand and deal with prostate cancer: an application of the modelisation qualitative research design,"Zanchetta, Margareth Santos and Perreault, Michel and Kaszap, Margot and Viens, Chantal",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: The increasing need of older individuals to safely self-manage their chronic illnesses requires that they clearly understand health-related information. Thus, this study examined health literacy as lived by men with prostate cancer (PC), rather than as assessed by professionals. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe, analyse, and understand informational strategies of men with PC. The main objective was to describe these strategies according to self-assessed levels of functional health literacy and thus create an inventory of strategy characteristics. DESIGN: The modelisation qualitative research design framed this inquiry. SETTINGS: Montreal and Laval, province of Quebec, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: The purposive sample comprised 15 French-Canadian men aged 61-83, most of whom were enroled in a PC support group. Recruitment and selection was assisted by the support group's chairman and a volunteer recruiter. Selection criteria were medical diagnosis of localised PC, childhood spent in Quebec, ability to self-assess functional health literacy, effective oral communication in French, no use of psychotropic drugs, and normal time and space orientation. METHODS: Data collection involved semi-structured interviews and drawing of genograms and ecomaps. The qualitative-data-analysis software Atlas. ti (Version 4.1 for Windows) was used to code the interview data. Findings were also subjected to content analysis. Six volunteers examined and confirmed the authors' interpretation of the findings. RESULTS: Functional health literacy was cultivated throughout participants' lives and nourished by their social and cultural resources. A history of reading at home, interest in learning, supportive family and elementary school environments developed open-minded, critical-information-seeking older men. The findings did not support any association among formal education, level of health literacy, and ways of dealing with PC-related information. The construction of information networks provided participants with knowledge and with emotional and spiritual support to cope with PC. Men with different levels of health literacy had both unique and similar information strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' decisions to adopt specific information strategies were influenced by awareness of impacts of PC on men's lives, construction and maintenance of information networks, as well as participants' critique of health information. Through their information strategies, participants regained decision-making power over their bodies and destinies, and then redefined their social roles.",2007,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2006.03.018,44,6,961-972,eng,0020-7489,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Quebec and *Self Care and *Social Support and *Patient Education as Topic and *Prostatic Neoplasms and *Educational Status",NA,NA,2007/08//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
George_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,A nurse prescriber-led protocol for anaemia management in established haemodialysis patients: A retrospective study,"George, Sani and McCann, Margaret",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a nurse prescriber-led protocol compared to a traditional physician-led nonprotocol-based approach had on maintaining targeted haemoglobin levels in patients on maintenance haemodialysis. BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and has a profound impact on the patients' well-being. Current practices place a greater emphasis on the decision-making role of nurses in renal anaemia management. The introduction of nurse prescribing in this area is a relatively new concept. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design, covering an eight-month period pre- and post introduction of a nurse prescriber-led anaemia protocol; study adheres to the STROBE Statement. METHODS: Using a nonprobability convenience sample, data extracted from the medical records and electronic patient records system (eMed) related to 74 patients at a single outpatient haemodialysis centre located within an acute general teaching hospital. The primary outcome was patients' haemoglobin level pre- and post introduction of the protocol. Secondary outcomes included erythropoietin-stimulating agent and iron dosage, and serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between pre- and post protocol serum haemoglobin level and erythropoietin-stimulating agent dosage. Under the management of the nurse prescriber, patients experienced a significant improvement in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels and required significantly less intravenous iron dosage. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first of its kind, found that patients receiving haemodialysis experience a significant improvement in iron indices while receiving a significantly lower amount of intravenous iron when managed by a nurse prescriber. Furthermore, the nurse prescribers' decision-making capacity is as effective as a physician-led nonprotocol-based approach in achieving haemoglobin target levels.

Kim_2015_Joofadnu,JOUR,Defining attributes of patient safety through a concept analysis,"Kim, Linda and Lyder, Courtney H. and McNeese-Smith, Donna and Leach, Linda Searle and Needleman, Jack",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: The aim of this study was to report an analysis of the concept of patient safety. BACKGROUND: Despite recent increase in the number of work being done to clarify the concept and standardize measurement of patient safety, there are still huge variations in how the term is conceptualized and how to measure patient safety data across various healthcare settings and in research. DESIGN: Concept analysis. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Plus using the terms 'patient safety' in the title and 'concept analysis,' 'attributes' or 'definition' in the title and or abstract. All English language literature published between 2002-2014 were considered for the review. METHODS: Walker and Avant's method guided this analysis. RESULTS: The defining attributes of patient safety include prevention of medical errors and avoidable adverse events, protection of patients from harm or injury and collaborative efforts by individual healthcare providers and a strong, well-integrated healthcare system. The application of Collaborative Alliance of Nursing Outcomes indicators as empirical referents would facilitate the measurement of patient safety. CONCLUSION: With the knowledge gained from this analysis, nurses may improve patient surveillance efforts that identify potential hazards before they become adverse events and have a stronger voice in health policy decision-making that influence implementation efforts aimed at promoting patient safety, worldwide. Further studies are needed on development of a conceptual model and framework that can aid with collection and measurement of standardized patient safety data.",2015,10.1111/jan.12715,71,11,2490-2503,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and Quality of Health Care and patient safety and nursing and Interprofessional Relations and Nurse's Role and Patient Safety/*standards and Delivery of Health Care/standards and nurse and Medical Errors/prevention & control and concept analysis and Nursing Care/methods/*standards,NA,NA,2015/11//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Studies conducted throughout the world over the past 30 years indicate that family needs are still neglected. Unmet needs of family members of patients in the intensive care unit lead to dissatisfaction with care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHOD: A total of 70 family members of critically ill patients were included in this study conducted in a medical intensive care unit in Israel between October 2007-September 2008, using a structured interview. Three outcomes measured by the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit Inventory were regressed separately for baseline variables and family needs met subscales as measured by the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to detect factors that could have predicted each outcome. FINDINGS: The results showed differences between the perceived importance and the perceived met needs of family members. Satisfaction with care was positively related to meeting all needs domains except the information need. However, satisfaction with information and decision-making was related only to meeting information and emotional support needs.

Shanley_2011_Joofclnu,JOUR,Decisions about transferring nursing home residents to hospital: highlighting the roles of advance care planning and support from local hospital and community health services,"Shanley, Christopher and Whitmore, Elizabeth and Conforti, David and Masso, Janine and Jayasinghe, Sanjay and Griffiths, Rhonda",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore current practice and opportunities to improve practice in decision-making about transfer of nursing home residents to hospital. BACKGROUND: Nursing home staff are often faced with the decision of whether to send a resident to hospital for medical treatment. While many residents will benefit from going to hospital, there are also several risks associated with this. This study sought to add to the existing body of research on this issue by seeking the views of nursing home managers, who are the persons most frequently involved in making these decisions. DESIGN: Qualitative design using purposive, quota sampling. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with 41 nursing home managers from south-western Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: Factors affecting the decision to transfer a resident to hospital include acuteness of their condition; level and style of medical care available; role of family members; numbers, qualifications and skills mix of staff; and concern about criticism for not transferring to hospital. Two factors that have not featured as strongly in previous research are the roles of advance care planning and support from local hospital and community health services. CONCLUSION: While transferring a nursing home resident to hospital is often necessary, there are many situations where they could be cared for in the nursing home; therefore, avoid complications associated with being in hospital. Apart from a range of factors already identified in the literature, this study has highlighted the important role that advance care planning and support from local health services can play in reducing unnecessary transfers to hospital. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There are several strategies that nursing homes and local health authorities can adopt to promote advance care planning and build better support systems between the two sectors, thereby reducing the numbers of residents who need to be transferred to hospital for their health care.",2011,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03635.x,20,19-20,2897-2906,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Clinical Competence and *Hospitalization and Personnel Staffing and Scheduling and *Advance Care Planning and *Patient Transfer and *Nursing Homes and *Hospital Administration and Community Health Services/*organization & administration,NA,NA,2011/10//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rohde_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Nurses' clinical reasoning practices that support safe medication administration: An integrative review of the literature,"Rohde, Emily and Domm, Elizabeth",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To review the current literature about nurses' clinical reasoning practices that support safe medication administration. BACKGROUND: The literature about medication administration frequently focuses on avoiding medication errors. Nurses' clinical reasoning used during medication administration to maintain medication safety receives less attention in the literature. As healthcare professionals, nurses work closely with patients, assessing and intervening to promote mediation safety prior to, during and after medication administration. They also provide discharge teaching about using medication safely. Nurses' clinical reasoning and practices that support medication safety are often invisible when the focus is medication errors avoidance. DESIGN: An integrative literature review was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 5, 2005 and 546) five-stage review of the 11 articles that met review criteria. This review is modelled after Gaffney et al.'s (Journal of Clinical Nursing, 25, 2016 and 906) integrative review on medical error recovery. METHODS: Health databases were accessed and systematically searched for research reporting nurses' clinical reasoning practices that supported safe medication administration. The level and quality of evidence of the included research articles were assessed using The Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale(C). RESULTS: Nurses have a central role in safe medication administration, including but not limited to risk awareness about the potential for medication errors. Nurses assess patients and their medication and use knowledge and clinical reasoning to administer medication safely. Results indicated nurses' use of clinical reasoning to maintain safe medication administration was inadequately articulated in 10 of 11 studies reviewed. CONCLUSION: Nurses are primarily responsible for safe medication administration. Nurses draw from their foundational knowledge of patient conditions and organisational processes and use clinical reasoning that supports safe medication practice. There was minimal evidence clearly articulating nurses' clinical reasoning used to support medication safety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review focused on finding evidence of nurses' clinical reasoning that supported safe medication administration.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14077,27,3-4,e402-e411,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and patient safety and medication management and clinical decision-making and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Judgment and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Nurse's Role and nurse roles and clinical reasoning and clinical judgement and Medication Errors/*nursing/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lambe_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Emergency nurses' decisions regarding frequency and nature of vital sign assessment,"Lambe, Katherine and Currey, Judy and Considine, Julie",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the factors emergency nurses use to inform their decisions regarding frequency and nature of vital sign assessment. BACKGROUND: Research related to clinical deterioration and vital sign assessment in the emergency department is in its infancy. Studies to date have explored the frequency of vital sign assessment in the emergency department; however, there are no published studies that have examined factors that emergency nurses use to inform their decisions regarding frequency and nature of ongoing vital sign assessment. DESIGN: A prospective exploratory design was used. Data were collected using a survey consisting of eight patient vignettes. METHODS: The study was conducted in one emergency department in metropolitan Melbourne. Participants were emergency nurses permanently employed at the study site. RESULTS: A 96% response rate was achieved (n = 47/49). The most common frequency of patient reassessment nominated by participants was 15 or 30 minutely, with an equal number of participants choosing these frequency intervals. Abnormality in initial vital sign parameters was the most common factor identified for choosing either a 15- or 30-minute assessment interval. Frequency of assessment decisions was influenced by years of emergency nursing experience in one vignette and level of postgraduate qualification in three vignettes. Heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were all nominated by over 80% of participants as vital signs that participants considered important for reassessment. The frequency and nature of vital signs selected varied according to vignette content. There were significant negative correlations between assessment of conscious state and years of nursing experience and assessment of respiratory rate and years of emergency nursing experience. Level of postgraduate qualification did not influence selection of parameters for reassessment. CONCLUSION: Emergency nurses are tailoring vital sign assessment to patients' clinical status, and nurses are integrating known vital sign data into vital sign decision-making. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Accurate assessment and interpretation of vital sign data is fundamental to patient safety.

Bagnasco_2016_Joofadnu,JOUR,Investigating the use of Barrows Cards to improve self-management and reduce healthcare costs in adolescents with blood cancer: a pilot study,"Bagnasco, Annamaria and Calza, Simona and Petralia, Paolo and Aleo, Giuseppe and Fornoni, Laura and Sasso, Loredana",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To test if the Barrows Cards method improves adherence to immunosuppressive therapy self-management following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in adolescents affected by blood cancer and reduce costs. BACKGROUND: Chronically ill adolescents need to be helped to improve self-management, make sure they can confidently and safely manage therapy at home and reduce readmissions and costs. We identified the Barrows Cards method, originally used to test decision-making skills and critical thinking in medical students. In this pilot study, we tested the efficacy of the Barrows Cards Method in improving adhesion to immunosuppressive therapy in a group of adolescents following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and analysed its cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: A mixed-method study. METHODS: The Barrows Cards method is an educational intervention based on the theory of problem-based learning that uses at least 15 cards specially designed to teach participants how to manage a specific problem. We piloted the Barrows cards method in terms of adherence to immunosuppressive therapy and self-management in a group of 17 adolescents affected by blood cancer before being discharged. Participants were enrolled between 2013-2015. Activity Based Costing was used to analyse the cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The Barrows Cards method significantly improved adherence to immunosuppressive therapy in blood cancer adolescents and reduced readmissions. We also showed how this method could significantly reduce healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required, but the Barrows Cards method could be effectively used by nurses to improve self-management in chronic patients and reduce health costs.",2016,10.1111/jan.12883,72,4,754-758,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and Adolescent and Medication Adherence and Chronic Disease and Decision Making and Health Care Costs and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Pilot Projects and problem-based learning and chronic illness and nursing and safety and costs and self-management and patient education and barrows cards and Hematologic Neoplasms/economics/*nursing and Immunosuppressive Agents/economics/therapeutic use and Patient Education as Topic/economics/methods and Self Care/economics/*standards,NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bunkenborg_2013_Joofadnu,JOUR,Impact of professionalism in nursing on in-hospital bedside monitoring practice,"Bunkenborg, Gitte and Samuelson, Karin and Akeson, Jonas and Poulsen, Ingrid",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This article reports a study exploring nursing practice of monitoring in-hospital patients including intra- and interprofessional communication and collaboration. BACKGROUND: Sub-optimal care in general in-hospital wards may lead to admission for intensive care, cardiac arrest, or sudden death. Reasons may include infrequent measurements of vital parameters, insufficient knowledge of their predictive values, and/or sub-optimal use of Medical Emergency Teams. This study was designed to improve understanding of nursing practice and to identify changes required to support nursing staff in improving standards of clinical monitoring practice and patient safety in general in-hospital wards. DESIGN: The study was designed as a qualitative descriptive clinical study, based on method triangulation including structured individual observations and semi-structured individual interviews. METHODS: In the spring of 2009, structured observations and semi-structured interviews of 13 nurses were carried out at a university hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The observational notes and interview transcriptions were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: One theme (Professionalism influences nursing monitoring practice) and two sub-themes (Knowledge and skills and Involvement in clinical practice through reflections) were identified. Three categories (Decision-making, Sharing of knowledge, and Intra- and interprofessional interaction) were found to be associated with the theme, the sub-themes, and with each other. CONCLUSION: Clinical monitoring practice varies considerably between nurses with different individual levels of professionalism. Future initiatives to improve patient safety by further developing professionalism among nurses need to embrace individual and organizational attributes to strengthen their practice of in-hospital patient monitoring and management.",2013,10.1111/jan.12003,69,7,1466-1477,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Denmark and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Prospective Studies and Qualitative Research and Patient Safety and Interprofessional Relations and Vital Signs and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Quality of Health Care and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*organization & administration and Monitoring, Physiologic/*nursing",NA,NA,2013/07//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shih_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,The effect of caregiver's and nurse's perception of a patient's discharge readiness on postdischarge medical resource consumption,"Shih, Tsung-Ying and Lin, Li-Chan and Wu, Shiao-Chi and Yang, Man-Hua",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to validate patient's primary caregiver and their nurse's perception of patient discharge readiness assessment and their association with postdischarge medical consumption. DESIGN: The study employed a descriptive research, prospective longitudinal study design. METHOD: The study was performed in a ward of a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan, from June 2017-May 2018. Obtained data were analysed using an independent t test, one-way ANOVA and logistic regression approach. RESULTS/FINDINGS: The number of comorbidities and the number of days of hospital stay were positively associated with post discharge emergency room visits. Caregiver readiness for hospital discharge had significant negative correlation with patient's 30-day readmission. Both caregiver and nurse readiness for the hospital discharge scale score were not factors associated with the patients' 30-day emergency room visit. CONCLUSION: Based on the research findings, to assess the discharge readiness as perceived by caregivers at patients' discharge is recommended. IMPACT: Caregiver and nurse scores on readiness for hospital discharge showed a significant positive correlation. The higher the score of a caregiver's readiness for a patient's hospital discharge, the lower the 30-day readmission rate. Family-centred care enables patients to safely pass though the transition phase from hospital to community and reduces the postrelease consumption of medical resources. The discharge readiness perceived by caregivers should be included in any decision-making.",2020,10.1111/jan.14329,76,6,1355-1363,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and caregiver and Guidelines as Topic and readmission and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Taiwan and perception and Caregivers/psychology and emergency and Nursing Staff, Hospital/psychology and nurse and Aftercare/*economics/*psychology and hospital discharge and Patient Discharge/*economics/*standards/*statistics & numerical data and Patient Readmission/*economics/*statistics & numerical data and readiness",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rowbotham_2012_Joofadnu,JOUR,Challenges to nurse prescribers of a no-antibiotic prescribing strategy for managing self-limiting respiratory tract infections,"Rowbotham, Samantha and Chisholm, Anna and Moschogianis, Susie and Chew-Graham, Carolyn and Cordingley, Lis and Wearden, Alison and Peters, Sarah",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To report a qualitative study of the experiences of nurse prescribers in managing patients with self-limiting respiratory tract infections. BACKGROUND: Patients frequently attend primary care with respiratory tract infections. Although a no-prescribing strategy is recommended for these consultations, general practitioners frequently prescribe antibiotics, citing non-clinical reasons such as patient pressure. Nurses increasingly manage people with respiratory tract infections, but research has not yet explored their experiences within such consultations. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups. METHODS: Fifteen semi-structured interviews and three focus groups (n=5, n=4, and n=12) with a purposive sample of nurse prescribers (n=34) and other non-medical prescribers (n=2) were conducted between November 2009-November 2010. A qualitative approach was used to develop conceptual categories from the dataset, and emerging themes were explored in subsequent interviews/focus groups. FINDINGS: Although participants reported experiencing numerous challenges within these consultations, they believed that they possessed some of the communication skills to deal effectively with patients without prescribing antibiotics. Participants reported that protocols supported their decision-making and welcomed the benefits of peer support in dealing with 'demanding' patients. However, the newness of nurses and other non-medical prescribers to the prescribing role meant that some were cautious in dealing with patients with respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSION: Training for nurses and other non-medical prescribers should focus on building their confidence and skills to manage people with respiratory tract infections without recourse to antibiotics. Further work should seek to explore which strategies are most effective in managing respiratory tract infections while maintaining patient satisfaction with care.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.05960.x,68,12,2622-2632,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and United Kingdom and Patient Satisfaction and Qualitative Research and Patient Education as Topic and Drug Utilization and Narration and *Guideline Adherence and *Anti-Bacterial Agents and Nurse Practitioners/education and *Practice Patterns, Nurses' and Common Cold/drug therapy/nursing and Inappropriate Prescribing/nursing/*prevention & control and Respiratory Tract Infections/drug therapy/*nursing",NA,NA,2012/12//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effects of all known nonpharmacological interventions for cancer-related cognitive impairment, and to rank the best intervention options for adult non- central nervous system cancer patients with cancer-related cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Systematic review with a new analytic approach of network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Six electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials from January 2010 to July 2019. REVIEW METHODS: Literature screening, data extraction and quality appraisal was undertaken systematically by two independent reviewers. Quantitative network meta-analysis performed to analyze key study outcomes. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of interventions on subjective cognitive function, and the secondary outcome was the safety of nonpharmacological interventions for cancer-related cognitive impairment. RESULTS: There were 29 eligible randomized controlled trials searched, and a total of 10 interventions identified. All 29 randomized controlled trials that were included had no reported significant adverse events, therefore, these 10 nonpharmacological interventions are safe for cancer-related cognitive impairment management. In terms of effectiveness, the pooled overall effects were in favor of these 10 nonpharmacological interventions. The most effective interventions included meditation, cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, and exercise interventions, with a mean difference of effective size plus 95% confidence interval 10.26 (1.53, 19.00), 5.02 (1.41, 8.63), 4.88 (0.65, 9.11), and 3.82 (0.52, 7.13), respectively. Other treatment effects did not show statistically significant differences.

Chung_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,"Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale of caring nurse-patient interaction competence","Chung, Hui-Chun and Hsieh, Tsung-Cheng and Chen, Yueh-Chih and Chang, Shu-Chuan and Hsu, Wen-Lin",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the construct validity and reliability of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale, which can be used to determine clinical nurses' competence. The results can also serve to promote nursing competence and improve patient satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Nurse-patient interaction is critical for improving nursing care quality. However, to date, no relevant validated instrument has been proposed for assessing caring nurse-patient interaction competence in clinical practice. This study adapted and validated the Chinese version of the caring nurse-patient interaction scale. DESIGN: A cross-cultural adaptation and validation study. METHODS: A psychometric analysis of the four major constructs of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale was conducted on a sample of 356 nurses from a medical centre in China. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis were adopted to extract the main components, both the internal consistency and correlation coefficients were used to examine reliability and a confirmatory factor analysis was adopted to verify the construct validity. RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit results of the model were strong. The standardised factor loadings of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale ranged from 0.73-0.95, indicating that the validity and reliability of this instrument were favourable. Moreover, the 12 extracted items explained 95.9% of the measured content of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale. CONCLUSIONS: The results serve as empirical evidence regarding the validity and reliability of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect scale. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hospital nurses increasingly demand help from patients and their family members in identifying health problems and assisting with medical decision-making. Therefore, enhancing nurses' competence in nurse-patient interactions is crucial for nursing and hospital managers to improve nursing care quality. The Chinese caring nurse-patient interaction scale can serve as an effective tool for nursing and hospital managers to evaluate the caring nurse-patient interaction confidence of nurses and improve inpatient satisfaction and quality of care.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14196,27,17-18,3287-3297,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"China and Humans and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and interaction and Psychometrics and patient satisfaction and Patient Satisfaction and Reproducibility of Results and care and Factor Analysis, Statistical and *Cross-Cultural Comparison and Clinical Competence/*standards and Empathy and *Nurse-Patient Relations and Translations and nursing competence",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wang_2019_Injoofnust,JOUR,Predictors of successful discharge from intensive care units in older adults aged 80 years or older: A population-based study,"Wang, Pei-Yi and Takemura, Naomi and Xu, Xinyi and Cheung, Denise Shuk Ting and Lin, Chia-Chin",International journal of nursing studies,"BACKGROUND: We determined the long-term outcomes of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients and investigated the predictors of successful discharge for <e2><89><a5>6 months among older adults aged <e2><89><a5>80 years in Taiwan. OBJECTIVES: To identify the predictors of ICU admission in patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years and the predictors of and optimal cutoff predictive discharge score (PDS) for ICU successful discharge in patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years. DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 282,269 individuals aged <e2><89><a5>80 years collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2001 to 2013. METHODS: Demographic and clinical parameters, Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI), hospital type, and post-discharge outcomes of ICU patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years were obtained from their medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze and identify the predictors of successful discharge and treatments received by critically ill patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years admitted to the ICU. The optimal cutoff PDS for successful discharge in older adults were calculated by Youden Index. Results 65,756 ICU admissions were documented, of which 21% (n = 13,825) were for adults aged <e2><89><a5>80 years. The successful discharge rate among ICU patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years (57.2%) was significantly lower than that among those aged 18-64 and 65-79 years (81.7% and 71.5%, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed the following predictors of successful discharge for <e2><89><a5>6 months after ICU admission in adults aged <e2><89><a5>80 years: younger age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94-0.96), shorter ICU length of stay (adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.88-0.92), lower CCI (adjusted OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.90-0.93), and no life-sustaining treatments received (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.68-0.84; mechanical ventilation: adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.57-0.71; use of inotropic agents: adjusted OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.34-0.41). The optimal cutoff PDS in older adults was 6 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.72-0.74). CONCLUSION: This is the first population-based study investigating the post-discharge outcomes of ICU patients aged <e2><89><a5>80 years. Advanced age was a predictive factor of unsuccessful discharge from the ICU. Nevertheless, more than half of this vulnerable population survived for at least 6 months after discharge. Therefore, age should not be the sole criterion when considering ICU admission and deciding curative treatments for critically ill older adults. Comprehensive assessment and effective communication with patients and their families are also crucial in clinical decision-making for critically ill older adults.",2019,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.04.007,100,NA,103339,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and *Patient Discharge and Taiwan and *Intensive Care Units and Intensive care and Critical care and 80 and over and Octogenarians and Oldest old",NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dierick.van.Daele_2011_Joofclnu,JOUR,Is it economically viable to employ the nurse practitioner in general practice?,"Dierick-van Daele, Angelique T. M. and Steuten, Lotte M. G. and Romeijn, Arla and Derckx, Emmy W. C. C. and Vrijhoef, Hubertus J. M.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS: This article provides insight into the potential economic viability of nurse practitioner employment in Dutch general practices. BACKGROUND: General practitioners face the challenging task of finding the most efficient and effective mix of professionals in general practice to accommodate future care demands within scarce health care budgets. To enable informed decision-making about skill mix issues, economic information is needed. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD: A descriptive and explorative design was chosen to study the economic viability of nurse practitioner employment in general practice. The conditions under which the nurse practitioner is able to earn back his/her own cost of employment were identified. Preferences and expectations of general practitioners and health insurers about nurse practitioner reimbursement were made transparent. RESULTS: Although general practitioners and health insurers acknowledge the importance of the nurse practitioner in accommodating primary care demands, they have polarised views about reimbursement. The employment of nurse practitioners is seldom economically viable in current practices. It requires a reallocation of (80% of) the general practitioner's freed up time towards practice growth (12% number of patients). CONCLUSION: The economic viability of the nurse practitioner has proven difficult to achieve in every day health care practice. This study provided insight into the complex interaction of the (cost) parameters that result in economic viability and feeds a further discussion about the content of the nurse practitioner role in general practice based on optimal quality of care vs. efficiency. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Effective and efficient health care can only be provided if the actual care needs of a population provide the basis for deciding which mix of professionals is best equipped to deal with the changing and increasing demand of care.

van.der.Riet_2009_Joofclnu,JOUR,A discourse analysis of difficult clinical situations in relation to nutrition and hydration during end of life care,"van der Riet, Pamela and Higgins, Isabel and Good, Phillip and Sneesby, Ludmilla",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The following discussion builds upon a previous publication that reported on the perceptions and discourses of palliative care nurses and doctors in relation to nutrition and hydration at the end of life. The aim of this paper is to report the discourses of nurses and doctors in relation to the challenges they faced when managing the care of patients with severe brain injury vs. the clearer cut situations when caring for terminally ill patients with cancer. The objectives of the study were to: explore the tensions in the discourses during end of life care, explore the challenges regarding nutrition and hydration at the end of life. BACKGROUND: The decision to withdraw life support seems to be made more readily than the decision to withdraw nutrition and hydration at the end of life. The abatement of nutrition and hydration during the terminal phase of life is a controversial issue for a range reasons. Indeed, whilst it is accepted practice in the palliative care setting, nurses and doctors often struggle with the idea. DESIGN: The design for this study used discourse analysis framed by a post structural framework. METHOD: Focus groups were conducted with nurses working in palliative care units. Single interviews were conducted with doctors from a tertiary palliative care unit. RESULTS: The findings revealed contesting discourses involving quality of life and the prolongation of life. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of food and fluid has profound emotional and social meanings for patients and families. The study reported here examined these issues with health professionals. The findings point to the challenges and tensions faced by health professionals in relation to decision making and medical hydration during end of life care. The concern is that tensions arise when decisions need to be made and how best to make these. The contesting discourses for nurses and doctors when nutrition and hydration is ceased involve maintaining quality of life vs. the prolongation of life. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Medical and nursing staff have different attitudes and beliefs towards end of life care. Tensions arise when decisions need to be made based on quality of life or prolongation of life. The successful merging of curative and palliative care is not without challenges.

Murfield_2021_Injoofnust,JOUR,Mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions for family carers of older adults: A scoping review,"Murfield, Jenny and Moyle, Wendy and O'Donovan, Analise",International journal of nursing studies,"OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the current use of mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions with family carers of older adults, to aid primary healthcare practitioners in their decision-making around referral to wider healthcare services. The study was guided by four research questions: what interventions are currently used; whom they are used with; why they are used; and their evidence-base in terms of acceptability and effectiveness. DESIGN: A scoping study using the methodological frameworks of Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. DATA SOURCES: Searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINHAL, PsycINFO), reference lists of relevant articles, and journal websites were conducted in June 2019. Search terms were developed via an iterative process, and included medical subject headings and keywords relating to mindfulness and compassion, interventions, and family carers. REVIEW METHODS: Articles were included if: written in English; published in a peer-reviewed journal; employed quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method research designs; and described a mindfulness- and/or compassion-based intervention for adults identified as a family carer of an older adult. Data from included studies were charted (using a purposively-designed template), and descriptively analysed in relation to the study's research questions. RESULTS: From 2005 unique records, 32 primary studies were included. Seven types of mindfulness- or compassion-based interventions were broadly described within studies, including: mindfulness-based stress reduction (n = 13), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n = 3), meditation interventions (n = 9), acceptance and commitment therapy (n = 1), dialectical behaviour therapy (n = 1), compassion-focused therapy (n = 1), and study-specific interventions involving a combination of mindfulness and/or compassion (n = 4). Studies sampled a total of n = 991 participants and targeted six family carer sub-groups: dementia (n = 23), cancer (n = 5), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 1), chronic conditions (n = 1), cirrhosis (n = 1), and Parkinson's disease (n = 1). A variety of health outcomes were assessed across interventions, with the most common being depression (n = 26), anxiety (n = 15), burden (n = 15), quality of life (n = 14), and stress (n = 11). The evidence-base for each intervention was insufficient and too heterogeneous to make clear statements regarding effectiveness. However, based on these findings, interventions show some potential utility in supporting family carers in their role and, given a collective rate of attrition (18%), may do so in a way that is acceptable to carers. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping study highlighted the nascent use of mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions with family carers of older adults, and provided important substantive detail about what each intervention entails. Based on current evidence, a number of implications for research and practice are presented.",2021,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.103495,116,NA,103495,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and Aged and Mental health and Caregivers and Mindfulness and Quality of Life and Family caregiver and Empathy and Self-care and *Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and *Mindfulness and Acceptance and commitment therapy and Compassion,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chang_2012_Joofclnu_1,JOUR,Comparison of nurse practitioners' perceptions of required competencies and self-evaluated competencies in Taiwan,"Chang, I.-Wen and Shyu, Yea-Ing and Tsay, Pei-Kwei and Tang, Woung-Ru",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper is a report of a study conducted to investigate differences between nurse practitioners' perceptions of the importance of required competencies and their self-evaluated existing competencies, and the main factors influencing these differences. BACKGROUND: The difference between nurse practitioners' perceptions of required competencies and their existing competencies has never been investigated. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether these two competencies differ. DESIGN: A nationwide survey study was authorised by the Department of Health (DOH) in Taiwan. METHODS: For this nationwide survey study, the Questionnaire of Competencies in the Nurse Practitioner's Role was mailed to all nurse practitioners who qualified for the first annual national NP licence exam in Taiwan. Of 582 questionnaires distributed, 374 valid questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 64.2%. RESULTS: The scores for required competencies were all higher than existing competencies. The competencies with largest differences were (in increasing order) clinical research, direct care, and leadership and reform. The competencies with smallest differences were (in ascending order) medical assistance, communication and coordination, and ethical decision-making. Differences in the total score between required and existing competencies were significantly influenced by nurse practitioners' age, seniority as nurse practitioner, whether the nurse practitioners' institution had a nurse practitioner advancement system, and the number of patients under their care. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse practitioners' perceptions of the importance of their expected role competencies were significantly greater in most cases than their actual competencies.

Sterke_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Increased care demand and medical costs after falls in nursing homes: A Delphi study,"Sterke, Carolyn Shanty and Panneman, Martien J. and Erasmus, Vicki and Polinder, Suzanne and van Beeck, Ed F.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To estimate the increased care demand and medical costs caused by falls in nursing homes. BACKGROUND: There is compelling evidence that falls in nursing homes are preventable. However, proper implementation of evidence-based guidelines to prevent falls is often hindered by insufficient management support, staff time and funding. DESIGN: A three-round Delphi study. METHODS: A panel of 41 experts, all working in nursing homes in the Netherlands, received three online questionnaires to estimate the extra hours of care needed during the first year after the fall. This was estimated for ten falls categories with different levels of injury severity, in three scenarios, that is a best-case, a typical-case and a worst-case scenario. We calculated the costs of falls by multiplying the mean amount of extra hours that the participants spent on the care for a resident after a fall with their hourly wages. RESULTS: In case of a noninjurious fall, the extra time spent on the faller is on average almost 5 hr, expressed in euros that add to <e2><82><ac> 193. The extra staff time and costs of falls increased with increasing severity of injury. In the case of a fracture of the lower limb, the extra staff time increased to 132 hr, expressed in euros that is <e2><82><ac> 4,604.

BACKGROUND: Early sepsis detection exhibits clinical significance to practitioners and patients. Thorough and timely clinical observations, along with a willingness of nurses to call for help, are pivotal to survival of hospitalised patients. This project examined effects of modified early warning scoring system tool usage on patient mortality and failure to rescue events in hospitalised adult medical-surgical/telemetry patients as reported in the literature. DESIGN: A comprehensive review and evaluation of published peer-reviewed literature was conducted. METHODS: Electronic databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through 2014. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were identified for review. Evidence ratings included 6% (1) Level I, 44% (8) Level IV, 6% (1) Level V, 33% (6) Level VI and 11% (2) Level VII. Six reported mortality predictive value and/or reduction, three measured impact on emergency calls, and four reported impact on mortality and rapid response team utilisation. CONCLUSION: While modified early warning scoring system tools have been widely adopted and are recommended for utility in detection of inpatients at-risk for clinical deterioration, limited high-level data and no clinical trials linking use of modified early warning scoring system tool usage to robust outcomes were found. Established criteria for validating modified early warning scoring system criteria, organisational-specific reliability testing and multi-site trials are recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Development of all-cause illness screening tools, including sepsis, is imperative. The clinical picture may be quantified with scoring tools to assist nurses' clinical decision-making, thus leading to improved outcomes and decreased incidence of failure to rescue. Clinical outcomes of interest should be measured and reported in peer-reviewed literature to disseminate the impact on clinical outcomes.",2015,10.1111/jocn.12952,24,23-24,3343-3354,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Hospitalization and Humans and Adult and sepsis and Research Design and Early Diagnosis and *Failure to Rescue, Health Care and early warning scoring and EWSS and MEWS and modified early warning system and Sepsis/*diagnosis/*mortality/therapy",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Peters_2010_Joofclnu,JOUR,Reasons why women choose a medical practice or a women's health centre for routine health screening: worker and client perspectives,"Peters, Kathleen",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This article aims to explore the stories and perceptions of consumers and health care workers in an area with a low uptake rate of women's health screening. Further, this article explores what factors influence women's choices for women's health screening in relation to the type of services they access. BACKGROUND: Routine women's health screening, using mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing, is known to assist in the early detection of cancer and thereby has the potential to increase positive health outcomes for women. However, traditionally, compliance rates to women's health screening are lower than desired because of multiple barriers. Previous studies have largely been quantitative and few have been conducted in areas of low compliance to women's health screening. Furthermore, previous research has not identified the type of service offered, or gender of the professional providing this service, as potential barriers to women's health screening. DESIGN: Qualitative, storytelling design. METHOD: Participants from a socioeconomically disadvantaged area were recruited into the study via media releases. Data were collected during conversational, face to face interviews which were between 30 and 90 minutes in duration, digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. During the process of analysis, dominant stories became obvious through the repetition or emphasis of women's accounts, and it is these stories that are presented in the findings. RESULTS: Findings suggest that women's decisions about care for routine health screening are guided by three major concerns. Women are seeking a woman friendly and woman-centred service, a safe environment and continuity of care. All these factors informed women's decision-making around where to seek care for routine health screening. CONCLUSIONS: Additional specialised women's health services are required to meet the needs of women. The provision of accessible women-centred environments has the potential to enhance compliance with women's health screening. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is possible that generalist medical practises as well as specialised women's health centres can provide woman-centred care. This as well as further access to education and training that supports nurses to become specialised competent and confident women's health practitioners may enhance screening rates.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03245.x,19,17-18,2557-2564,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Health Promotion and Aged and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Mammography and Vaginal Smears and Papanicolaou Test and *Choice Behavior and *Women's Health Services and *Family Practice and Anecdotes as Topic and *Mass Screening,NA,NA,2010/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

To our best knowledge, no previous studies have modelled the relationships among breastfeeding attitude, health-related quality of life and maternal obesity among multi-ethnic pregnant women; the current study attempts to fill this research gap. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationships among maternal characteristics, health-related quality of life and breastfeeding attitude amidst normal weight and overweight/obese pregnant women using a multi-group structural equation modelling approach. DESIGN: Exploratory cross-sectional design was used. SETTING: Antenatal clinics of a university-affiliated hospital PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women were invited to participate; 708 (78.8%) agreed to participate in the study. METHODS: We examined a hypothetical model on the basis of integrating the concepts of a breastfeeding decision-making model, theory of planned behaviour-based model for breastfeeding and health-related quality of life model among 708 multi-ethnic pregnant women in Singapore. The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey were used to measure breastfeeding attitude and health-related quality of life, respectively. RESULTS: Two structural equation models demonstrated that better health-related quality of life, higher monthly household income, planned pregnancy and previous exclusive breastfeeding experience were significantly associated with positive breastfeeding attitude among normal and overweight/obese pregnant women. Among normal weight pregnant women, those who were older with higher educational level were more likely to have positive breastfeeding attitude. Among overweight/obese pregnant women, Chinese women with confinement nanny plan were less likely to have positive breastfeeding attitude. No significant difference existed between normal weight and overweight/obese pregnant women concerning estimates of health-related quality of life on breastfeeding attitude (Critical Ratio=-0.193). The model satisfactorily fitted the data (Incremental Fit Index=0.924, Tucker-Lewis Index=0.905, Comparative Fit Index=0.921 and Root Means Square Error of Approximation=0.025). Health-related quality of life was found to affect breastfeeding attitude in multi-ethnic pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: This relationship implied the importance of early culturally specific interventions to enhance health-related quality of life for improving positive breastfeeding attitude among pregnant women across different ethnic groups.",2017,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.12.004,67,NA,71-82,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,"Humans and Female and Adult and Obesity and Pregnancy and Hospitals, University and Overweight and Pregnancy Complications and *Quality of Life and *Attitude to Health and *Ethnicity and Health-related quality of life and Breast Feeding/*psychology and Breastfeeding attitude and Multi-group structural equation modelling and Obesity/*complications",NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

The program has shown promising results, but has never been tested with a rigorous research design. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to test the effectiveness of the Pain Resource Nurse program. Hypothesized outcomes included improvements in nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and assessment practices, and in patients' participation in decision-making, adequacy of pain management, pain severity, time spent in severe pain, pain interference, and satisfaction. DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A 650-bed university hospital in Iceland Participants: The sample consisted of a) patients <e2><89><a5>18 years of age, native speaking, hospitalized for at least 24h, alert and able to participate; and b) registered nurses who worked on the participating units. METHODS: Twenty three surgical and medical inpatient units were randomly assigned to the Pain Resource Nurse program (n=12) or to wait list control (n=11). The American Pain Society Outcome Questionnaire and the Knowledge and Attitudes Survey were used to collect data from patients and nurses respectively. Baseline data (T1) for patients were collected simultaneously on all units, followed by data collection from nurses. Then randomization took place, and the Pain Resource Nurse program was instituted. Ten months later, follow up (T2) data were collected, after which the nurses on the control group units received the Pain Resource Nurse program. RESULTS: At baseline, data were collected from 305 of the 396 eligible patients and at follow up from 326 of the 392 eligible patients, a 77% and 83% response rate respectively. At baseline, 232 of 479 eligible nurses responded and at follow-up 176 of the eligible 451 nurses responded, a 49% and 39% response rate, respectively. A nested mixed model analysis of covariance revealed that the intervention was successful in changing pain assessment practices, with pain assessment using standardized measures increasing from 13% to 25% in the intervention group while decreasing from 21% to 16% in the control group. None of the other hypothesized improvements were found. CONCLUSIONS: The Pain Resource Nurse program was successful in improving nurses' use of standardized measures for pain assessment. No effects were found on patient outcomes; pain was both prevalent and severe at both time points. Only minimal improvements were noted in response to this evidence-based staff development program.

Kerr_2020_Joofadnu,JOUR,"Advanced Nurse Practitioners' (Emergency) perceptions of their role, positionality and professional identity: A narrative inquiry","Kerr, Lisa and Macaskill, Ann",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To explore Advanced Nurse Practitioners' (ANP) (Emergency) perceptions of their role, positionality and professional identity. BACKGROUND: Advanced nursing practice was formally established in the Republic of Ireland in 2001 with 336 ANPs currently registered, projection increasing to a critical mass of 750 by 2021. Advanced practitioners (Emergency) give full emergency care for a specific cohort of clients with unscheduled, undifferentiated and undiagnosed conditions. DESIGN: Qualitative narrative inquiry using Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field and capital as the theoretical framework was undertaken. METHODS: Data were collected in 10 in-depth interviews and thematic analysis applied. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged: participants' career pathways, personal and professional transitions, role dimensions and core concepts, and position in the organization and emergent professional identity. Role transitioning and a change in habitus, field and capital revealed the uniqueness of their nursing role. Minimizing waiting times, timely patient care and patient satisfaction were key performance indicators. A heightened awareness regarding higher-level decision-making, autonomy and accountability is integral to advanced practice. CONCLUSION: This study presents unique insights into the ANP role covering recruitment, organizational culture changes required and support to ease transition emerged. IMPACT: Better understanding the motivation to undertake the role, the transition experience and use of advanced practice skills sets will inform the targets for the future recruitment and retention of ANPs are met nationally and internationally. Dissatisfaction with previous management roles and wanting to be clinically close to patients were motivations to follow an advanced practice clinical career trajectory. Positionality and emergent professional identity are key enablers ensuring that advanced practitioners' roles demonstrate the attributes of advanced practice. Educators could use the findings to develop recruitment, retention and progression strategies.

Jerofke.Owen_2019_Joofclnu,JOUR,Patients' perspectives on engaging in their healthcare while hospitalised,"Jerofke-Owen, Teresa and Dahlman, Jennifer",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine patients' experiences and preferences for engaging in their healthcare while hospitalised. BACKGROUND: Promoting patient engagement or involvement in healthcare has become an important component of contemporary, consumer-oriented approaches to quality care. Previous research on patient engagement highlights that preferences for engagement are not assessed while hospitalised, leading to patient role confusion and frustration. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with patients from January-March 2017 to examine their experiences and preferences for engaging in their care while hospitalised on medical-surgical units in the United States. Inductive thematic analysis was used to uncover the themes from the interview transcriptions. The reporting of research findings followed the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Seventeen patients, eight male and nine female, aged between 19-83 years old were interviewed. Patients had a difficult time articulating how they participated in their care while hospitalised, with the majority stating there were few decisions to be made. Many patients felt that decisions were made prior to or during hospitalisation for them. Patients described their engagement through the following themes: sharing the subjective, involvement of family, information-gathering, constraints, ""I let them take care of me,"" and variability. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement is a dual responsibility of both nurses and patients. Patients' experiences highlight that engagement preferences and experiences are not universal between patients, speaking to the importance of assessing patient preferences for engagement in health care upon hospital admission. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The articulation of what patients actually experience in the hospital setting contributes to improve nursing practice by offering insight into what is important to the patient and how best to engage with them in their care. The constraints that patients reported facing related to their healthcare engagement should be used to inform the delivery of future engagement interventions in the acute care setting.",2019,10.1111/jocn.14639,28,1-2,340-350,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and nursing care and patient participation and Aged, 80 and over and Patient Preference and *Hospitalization and Patient Participation/*psychology and acute care and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*organization & administration and patients' experience and Chronic Disease/nursing/psychology",NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: Data collections were conducted between September 2017 - June 2018. Twenty-nine patients aged 41-82 years (85.8% men) participated in the interviews lasting 40-60 min. The verbatim transcriptions of the semi-structured interview data were analysed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Good-life was described as 'present with physical and financial independence,' 'not burdensome to the family,' 'completed life responsibility', and 'helping others.' Some participants described good-death as 'prepared death' while others considered it as 'sudden death during sleep.' All participants wanted to have a painless death and not burden the family. Advance care planning was a new concept to many participants. It was likened to 'insurance.' Some participants believed that decision-making on life-sustaining treatment should be done by their family, not themselves, because of economic or emotional distress. Some participants wanted to discuss medical and non-medical care services to reduce the burden on self and family. CONCLUSION: Family is key when it comes to the meaning of good-life and good-death. Cultural adaptation is necessary to meet the advance care planning needs of Koreans with non-cancerous chronic diseases. IMPACT: Successfully implementing advance care planning in Koreans with non-cancerous chronic diseases depends on how it is adapted to the disease-specific characteristics compared with cancer, and the cultural norms and social context.

Jorgensen_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,The conditions of possibilities for recovery: A critical discourse analysis in a Danish psychiatric context,"Jorgensen, Kim and Praestegaard, Jeanette and Holen, Mari",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the conditions for the possibilities of recovery in a Danish mental healthcare practice, expressed from the perspective of nurses. The results and discussion of the study help to make visible and explore the muddle of conceptualisations of recovery in mental healthcare practice. BACKGROUND: Few studies examine the possibilities of recovery for inpatients and outpatients in mental health centres from a nursing perspective. DESIGN: A qualitative design using a critical social constructionist frame of understanding, in which the real world is considered as a series of social constructions. METHOD: A Fairclough-inspired critical discourse analysis was chosen as the analytical strategy. The analysis is comprised of ten interviews in mental health care and notes, written by nurses, in medical records of ten patients with a mental illness admitted to a mental healthcare centre in 2016-2017. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used as a guideline to secure accurate and complete reporting of the study (See Appendix S1). RESULTS: From the findings of the textual analysis and the analysis of the discourse practice, it seems clear that the social relations and structures relating to recovery in Danish psychiatry are steered and controlled by discourses that reflect, in general terms, the essence of the core of neoliberal ideology. CONCLUSION: Recovery is generally articulated from an overall discourse of neoliberalism with its embedded discourses of paternalism, biomedicine, self-care and holism. All these discourses coexist in nursing practice, but the paternalistic discourse becomes the framework for the conditions for the possibility of how recovery is expressed in practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be supported to seek clarity in the understanding and operationalisation of a recovery-oriented approach, if the agenda is to be truly adopted and strengthened.",2020,10.1111/jocn.15311,29,15-16,3012-3024,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Denmark and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and user involvement and Qualitative Research and patient participation and clinical decision-making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and discourse analysis and *Nurse-Patient Relations and recovery and clinical-research approaches and Mental Disorders/*nursing/rehabilitation and mental health nursing and Psychiatric Nursing/organization & administration,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Carolan_2007_Joofclnu,JOUR,Health literacy and the information needs and dilemmas of first-time mothers over 35 years,"Carolan, Mary",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to highlight the information-based dilemmas of a particular group of healthcare patients, first-time mothers over 35 years. BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of health-related information and a move towards greater public access to health information as an important step towards patient education and empowerment. Information technologies, such as the Internet, have added considerable momentum to this trend. Many health professionals now consider the provision of detailed health information to patients as requisite for informed decision making. Within the literature there is some emphasis on the importance of patient understanding of information received; however, to date, few studies have considered information over-consumption as problematic. METHODS: Using in-depth interviews, a sample of 22 first-time mothers over 35 years was interviewed over three junctures: 35 weeks gestation, 10-14 days postpartum and six to eight months postpartum. Three focus group interviews of midwives and maternal and child health nurses were also conducted. This paper was undertaken as part of a larger project to evaluate the experience of first mothering over 35 years. RESULTS: Mothers in this study were found to have access to large volumes of health information. This tendency was driven by both the women and the health professionals who cared for them. Midwives and maternal and child health nurses revealed a tendency to provide older first-time mothers with considerable health information of a medical orientation, understanding that this is what the women required. However, despite common perceptions of empowerment, the consumption of medical-type information proved frightening and many mothers described feeling overwhelmed by 'knowing too much'. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the limited understanding of the information needs of a growing group of childbearing women, first-time mothers over 35 years. By providing an insight into the 'downside' of extensive health information, nursing staff, in particular, may consider the amount and type of information they distribute. Some suggestions are offered to health professionals to ameliorate the information-based dilemmas of these women. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the number of childbearing women over 35 years continues to grow, it is important for health professionals to understand the particular needs of this group. In doing so, doctors, midwives and maternal and child health nurses may be in a position to provide more meaningful maternal support.",2007,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01600.x,16,6,1162-1172,eng,0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Educational Status and Pregnancy and Parity and Qualitative Research and Adaptation, Psychological and Age Factors and Focus Groups and Infant, Newborn and Nursing Methodology Research and Victoria and *Attitude to Health and *Pregnant Women/psychology and *Maternal Age and *Mothers/education/psychology and *Patient Education as Topic/organization & administration and Infant Care and Maternal-Child Nursing and Needs Assessment/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2007/06//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

How to prevent deep vein thrombosis is a general concern in clinical practice. However, it remains uncertain whether the risk factors for deep vein thrombosis would be affected by different bed-rest durations. Solving this issue will be invaluable for the provision of more rational medical care to prevent deep vein thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether risk factors for deep vein thrombosis are affected by bed-rest durations and to identify different risk factors in groups with different bed-rest durations. DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter case-control study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter study was conducted in wards with high rates of bed rest in 25 general hospitals in China. Participants were bedridden patients from these wards. METHODS: Bedridden patients were identified from the research database of bedridden patients' major immobility complications. These data were collected from prospective descriptive studies by a standardized web-based online case report form. Cases were defined as bedridden patients who suffered deep vein thrombosis during hospitalization (n=186). Each case was matched with three controls, bedridden patients who did not suffer deep vein thrombosis in the same center with the same bed-rest duration (n=558). Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and multivariate conditional logistic regression models were employed. RESULTS: Among 23,985 patients, the overall incidence of deep vein thrombosis during hospitalization was 1.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that for patients with bed-rest duration of 4 weeks or less, older age (odds ratio [OR] =1.027, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.013-1.041) and being in a surgical department (OR=2.527, 95% CI 1.541-4.144) were significantly associated with increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Female sex (OR=4.270, 95% CI 1.227-14.862), smoking (OR=10.860, 95% CI 2.130-55.370), and special treatment (OR=3.455, 95% CI 1.006-11.869) were independent factors predicting deep vein thrombosis for patients with bed-rest durations from 5 to 8 weeks. For those with bed-rest durations from 9 to 13 weeks, Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR=1.612, 95% CI 1.090-2.385) was the only independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis varied among patients with different bed-rest durations. This finding is helpful for nurses to increase their awareness of prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients with different bed-rest durations, and lays a more solid foundation for clinical decision making.",2021,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103825,114,NA,103825,eng,1873-491X 0020-7489,Humans and Female and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Case-Control Studies and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Risk factor and China/epidemiology and *Bed Rest/adverse effects and *Venous Thrombosis/epidemiology/etiology and Bed rest and Case-control study and Deep vein thrombosis and Lower limb,NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,Int J Nurs Stud,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Telephone triage plays an important role in managing demand for health care. Important questions are whether triage decisions are appropriate and patients comply with them. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Cochrane Clinical Trials Database, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc Info were searched between 1980-June 2010. LITERATURE REVIEW: Rapid Evidence Synthesis. REVIEW METHODS: The principles of rapid evidence assessment were followed. RESULTS: We identified 54 relevant papers: 26 papers reported appropriateness of triage decision, 26 papers reported compliance with triage decision, and 2 papers reported both. Nurses triaged calls in most of the studies (n=49). Triage decisions rated as appropriate varied between 44-98% and compliance ranged from 56-98%. Variation could not be explained by type of service or method of assessing appropriateness. However, inconsistent definitions of appropriateness may explain some variation. Triage decisions to contact primary care may have lower compliance than decisions to contact emergency services or self care. CONCLUSION: Telephone triage services can offer appropriate decisions and decisions that callers comply with. However, the association between the appropriateness of a decision and subsequent compliance requires further investigation and further consideration needs to be given to the minority of calls which are inappropriately managed. We suggest that a definition of appropriateness incorporating both accuracy and adequacy of triage decision should be encouraged.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.06052.x,68,12,2610-2621,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Physicians and Humans and Primary Health Care and Decision Making and Nurses and Emergency Medical Services and Telephone and *Telemedicine and *Quality of Health Care and *Triage and *Patient Compliance and *Hotlines,NA,NA,2012/12//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: In health care, vignettes or cases scenarios are core to problem-based learning, common in practice guideline development processes, and increasingly being used in patient or care-giver studies of chronic or life-threatening illnesses. A large number of behavioural, psycho-social and clinical factors can be relevant in such decision problems. Unbiased methods for choosing what factors to include are needed, when it is not possible to include all relevant combinations of factors in the vignettes. METHOD: The factors to be considered, number of levels or categories for each factor, and desired number of scenarios were decided in advance. An algorithm was used first to create the full factorial data set, and then a random subset of combinations was generated, according to predefined criteria, based on maximizing determinants. The subset of combinations was incorporated into written vignettes. The study was conducted in 2004-2005. FINDINGS: Application of the method yielded diverse and balanced scenarios that covered the full range of factors to be considered for a project to elicit health providers' processes in diet counselling for dyslipidemia. CONCLUSION: The approach is flexible, decreases possible researcher bias in the creation of vignettes, and can improve statistical power in survey research. This novel application of study design methodology merits consideration when vignettes are being developed to elicit opinions or decisions in studies of complex health issues.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05055.x,65,9,1937-1945,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Pilot Projects and *Medical Records and Problem-Based Learning/*methods and *Research Design,NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lennon_2016_Joofadnu,JOUR,Risk perception in pregnancy: a concept analysis,"Lennon, Suzanne Lydia",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To report an analysis of the concept of risk perception in pregnancy. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are increasingly exposed to the view that pregnancy and childbirth are intrinsically dangerous, requiring medical monitoring and management. Societal pressures are applied to women that dictate appropriate behaviours during pregnancy. These changes have resulted in increased perception of risk for pregnant women. DESIGN: Walker and Avant's method was selected to guide this analysis. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed articles published in English from CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed and Psychinfo. No date limits were applied. METHODS: Thematic analysis was conducted on 79 articles. Attributes, antecedents and consequences of the concept were identified. RESULTS: The attributes of the concept are the possibility of harm to mother or infant and beliefs about the severity of the risk state. The physical condition of pregnancy combined with the cognitive ability to perceive a personal risk state is antecedents. Risk perception in pregnancy influences women's affective state and has an impact on decision-making about pregnancy and childbirth. There are limited empirical referents with which to measure the concept. CONCLUSION: Women today know more about their developing infant than at any other time in history; however, this has not led to a sense of reassurance. Nurses and midwives have a critical role in assisting pregnant women, and their families make sense of the information they are exposed to. An understanding of the complexities of the concept of risk perception in pregnancy may assist in enabling nurses and midwives to reaffirm the normalcy of pregnancy.",2016,10.1111/jan.13007,72,9,2016-2029,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and nursing and Pregnancy and risk perception and *Attitude to Health and *Risk and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Midwifery and *Delivery, Obstetric and nurses and concept analysis and midwife and midwives and pregnancy and pregnant and risk attitudes",NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mohammed.Iddrisu_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,"Frequency, nature and timing of clinical deterioration in the early postoperative period","Mohammed Iddrisu, Suad and Considine, Julie and Hutchinson, Anastasia",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To establish the frequency of clinical deterioration in the early postoperative period in patients who have undergone general or orthopaedic surgery. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, clinical deterioration is a significant problem in acute care settings. Early recognition and response to clinical deterioration is one of the ten National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards in Australia. However, there is limited understanding of the frequency of clinical deterioration in surgical patients. METHODS: A point prevalence study was conducted from September-October 2014. The records of 100 consecutive in patients admitted for orthopaedic (n = 48) or general surgery (n = 52) to a health service in Melbourne, Australia, were audited. The frequency of clinical deterioration episodes was summarised using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two patient groups were equivalent except that orthopaedic patients were older than the general surgery patients (median age 71 [IQR 19] years vs. 62 [IQR 17] years). There were 17 medical emergency team calls and 23 calls for urgent clinical review in 28 patients. The main indications for emergency calls were hypotension (26%), fever (19%), hypoxia (15%), tachycardia (13%) and altered blood glucose level (11%). The majority of episodes were managed on the ward, and there were one ICU transfer and no cardiac arrest calls. CONCLUSION: One in four patients experienced early postoperative clinical deterioration. Hypotension was the most common trigger for escalation of care highlighting a need to optimise fluid and haemodynamic management of postoperative patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Haemodynamic instability leading to the activation of rapid response systems is very common in the immediate postoperative period. There is the need for locally tailored interventions to optimise fluid management and decrease incidence of further complications.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14611,27,19-20,3544-3553,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Hospitalization and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Australia and patient safety and Aged, 80 and over and Incidence and clinical decision-making and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology and *Clinical Deterioration and emergency and acute care and Heart Arrest/epidemiology and Hypotension/epidemiology and Orthopedic Procedures/*adverse effects and postoperative care and quality & safety and surgical nursing",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Young_2017_Joofclnu,JOUR,Shared care requires a shared vision: communities of clinical practice in a primary care setting,"Young, Jessica and Egan, Tony and Jaye, Chrystal and Williamson, Martyn and Askerud, Anna and Radue, Peter and Penese, Maree",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To understand how a vision of care is formed and shared by patients and the primary care professionals involved in their care. BACKGROUND: To achieve the best health outcomes, it is important for patients and those who care for them to have a mutual understanding about what is important to the patient in their everyday life and why, and what care is necessary to realise this vision. Shared or team care does not necessarily translate to a consistent and integrated approach to a patient's care. An individual patient's care network of clinical and lay participants can be conceptualised as the patient's own 'Community of Clinical Practice' of which they are the central member. DESIGN: Working alongside a long-term conditions nursing team, we conducted a focused ethnography of nine 'Communities of Clinical Practice' in one general practice setting. METHOD: Participant observation, in-depth qualitative interviews with 24 participants including nine patients, and the patients' medical records. Data were analysed using a template organising style. FINDINGS: Primary care professionals' insight into a patient's vision of care evolves through a deep knowing of the patient over time; this is shared between 'Community of Clinical Practice' members, frequently through informal communication and realised through respectful dialogue. These common values - respect, authenticity, autonomy, compassion, trust, care ethics, holism - underpin the development of a shared vision of care. CONCLUSIONS: A patient's vision of care, if shared, provides a focus around which 'Community of Clinical Practice' members cohere. Nurses play an important role in sharing the patient's vision of care with other participants. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A shared vision of care is an aspirational concept which is difficult to articulate but with attentiveness, sustained authentic engagement and being driven by values, it should evolve amongst the core participants of a 'Community of Clinical Practice'.",2017,10.1111/jocn.13762,26,17-18,2689-2702,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"communication and Humans and Delivery of Health Care and patient-centred care and Patient Satisfaction and Qualitative Research and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Empathy and *Nurse-Patient Relations and care networks and communities of clinical practice and interprofessional care and Nursing Care/*methods and Primary Care Nursing/*methods and shared care and shared decision-making shared vision of care, teamwork",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grundy_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,Constructing a problem and marketing solutions: A critical content analysis of the nature and function of industry-authored oral health educational materials,"Grundy, Quinn and Cussen, Cliodna and Dale, Craig",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To document the nature of industry-authored educational materials focused on oral health; and analyse how they construct the relationships between nurses and industry. BACKGROUND: Nurses frequently rely on pharmaceutical and medical device companies for continuing education. However, industry-sponsored education is a key aspect of multi-faceted promotional campaigns and may introduce bias into clinical decision-making. DESIGN: Critical qualitative content analysis reported according to the COREQ checklist. METHODS: We purposively sampled educational documents from the websites of 4 major manufacturers of oral health products for acute care. Two researchers analysed each document using an open-ended coding form. We conducted an interpretive analysis using inductive coding methods. RESULTS: We included 63 documents that emphasised the importance of education in the form of training, expert guidance, evidence syntheses and protocols to support oral care practices. Industry promoted its relationship with nursing as an oral health authority through three dominant messages: (1) Pneumonia is a source of morbidity, mortality and treatment costs, which informed nurses about a critical problem; (2) Comprehensive oral care reduces pneumonia risk, which instructed nurses about product-oriented solutions; and (3) Frequent oral care is important, which emphasised compliance to standardised protocols. These messages formed an accountability logic that prompted clinicians to address a problem for which the company's products served as a solution. In doing so, industry validated dominant administrative concerns including compliance, while promoting product uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Industry-authored educational materials may promote industry interests, rather than nursing or patient agendas. Dependence on industry's information and product solutions may have unintended, negative consequences for nursing practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Though industry's educational materials present as convenient, helpful and evidence-based, they may serve to redirect care processes in ways that reinforce company goals rather than clinical priorities. Nurses should seek independent sources of continuing education where possible.",2020,10.1111/jocn.15510,29,23-24,4697-4707,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and content analysis and evidence-based practice and *Oral Health and nursing practice and *Marketing and qualitative approaches and hospital care and *Health Education and competency-based education and critical research approaches and interpretive research and oral care and practice-based learning,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Morphet_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Aged care residents in the emergency department: the experiences of relatives,"Morphet, Julia and Decker, Kelly and Crawford, Kimberley and Innes, Kelli and Williams, Allison Fiona and Griffiths, Debra",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of relatives who had a family member in an aged care facility subsequently transferred to an emergency department. BACKGROUND: The provision of timely and relevant patient information is vital for assessment and management of older patients presenting to the emergency department from aged care facilities. Older people are commonly accompanied by relatives who are an important resource for emergency department staff, providing medical information and assisting with treatment decisions. Investigating the experiences of relatives may provide key information to enable improvements in the delivery of emergency department care. DESIGN: This study used a descriptive qualitative design. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 24 relatives of residents who were transferred from an aged care facility to an emergency department in Victoria, Australia in the previous three years. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. RESULTS: Relatives reflected on four main themes following their emergency department visit: The need for clear communication; The role of relatives in emergency department care; How older people are perceived in the health care system and an Ability to provide specialised care. CONCLUSIONS: Many people link their emergency department experience to the quality of communication with emergency department staff, and participants in this study felt satisfied with their visit when they were included in discussions about treatment, and their role was recognised by staff members. In contrast, participants were dissatisfied with the care provided to their family member when staff members failed to communicate with them, or recognise their role in the care of the family member. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings of this study emphasise the importance of effective communication between emergency department staff and family members, in relation to treatment and end-of-life care.",2015,10.1111/jocn.12954,24,23-24,3647-3653,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Communication and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Australia and Qualitative Research and Age Factors and older people and emergency department and Patient Transfer and *Emergency Service, Hospital and Family/*psychology and family and *Health Services for the Aged",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Alosco_2014_Joofclnu,JOUR,Executive dysfunction is independently associated with reduced functional independence in heart failure,"Alosco, Michael L. and Spitznagel, Mary Beth and Raz, Naftali and Cohen, Ronald and Sweet, Lawrence H. and Colbert, Lisa H. and Josephson, Richard and van Dulmen, Manfred and Hughes, Joel and Rosneck, Jim and Gunstad, John",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the independent association between executive function with instrumental activities of daily living and health behaviours in older adults with heart failure. BACKGROUND: Executive function is an important contributor to functional independence as it consists of cognitive processes needed for decision-making, planning, organising and behavioural monitoring. Impairment in this domain is common in heart failure patients and associated with reduced performance of instrumental activities of daily living in many medical and neurological populations. However, the contribution of executive functions to functional independence and healthy lifestyle choices in heart failure patients has not been fully examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five heart failure patients completed a neuropsychological battery and echocardiogram. Participants also completed the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale and reported current cigarette use. RESULTS: Hierarchical regressions revealed that reduced executive function was independently associated with worse instrumental activity of daily living performance with a specific association for decreased ability to manage medications. Partial correlations showed that executive dysfunction was associated with current cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that executive dysfunction is associated with poorer functional independence and contributes to unhealthy behaviours in heart failure. Future studies should examine whether heart failure patients benefit from formal organisation schema (i.e. pill organisers) to maintain independence.

Easterlow_2010_Joofclnu,JOUR,Implementing and standardising the use of peripheral vascular access devices,"Easterlow, Dean and Hoddinott, Phill and Harrison, Stephanie",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a change initiative relating to the use of peripheral intravenous cannulae on healthcare-acquired infections in an acute hospital trust in London, UK. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of healthcare-acquired infections has increased in the UK in recent years. Causal factors include poor practice and declining standards of cleanliness and hygiene in healthcare settings. DESIGN: Implementation of a change management initiative. METHODS: A baseline audit was conducted to identify areas for change. Based on the audit findings, a change initiative was implemented which included the introduction of a new, non-ported needle-safe cannula, together with changes in practices relating to peripheral intravenous cannulae care. RESULTS: In the eight months postintroduction of the new cannulae, decreases of 53% and 35% were reported in the number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and healthcare-acquired infection cases, respectively, compared with the same period prior to implementation. Audits results also demonstrated considerable improvements in practices relating to cannula care following implementation of the change initiative. CONCLUSIONS: A change in culture, the adoption of a non-ported cannula and improvements in practices relating to peripheral intravenous cannulae care led to significant reductions in healthcare-acquired infections during the period of the study. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The adoption of appropriate cannulae and administration sets to minimise infection risk can help to reduce the incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and healthcare-acquired infection cases resulting from peripheral venous cannulation. Training and support to encourage the adoption of best practice, in conjunction with regular follow-up audits, can lead to a reduction in infection rates and general improvements in the quality of peripheral line care.

Atienza.Carrasco_2020_Joofclnu,JOUR,Experiences and outcomes following diagnosis of congenital foetal anomaly and medical termination of pregnancy: A phenomenological study,"Atienza-Carrasco, Jose and Linares-Abad, Manuel and Padilla-Ruiz, Maria and Morales-Gil, Isabel Maria",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIM: To determine and describe the experiences of pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of chromosomopathy and/or foetal malformation during a prenatal check-up and who decide to legally terminate the pregnancy. BACKGROUND: When a pregnancy is terminated, the woman must cope with frustrated motherhood. The psychological consequences of this will largely depend on the care and support provided by health professionals. When a congenital anomaly is diagnosed, a patient-centred communication helps understanding, influences adaptation to the new situation and ensures the person concerned has sufficient (autonomy or independence or ability) to make appropriate decisions. METHODS: A qualitative study, based on a phenomenological approach, was carried out through nonparticipant observation and semi-structured interviews with 27 obstetric patients. NVivo 11 software was used, and content analysis was performed. The manuscript was developed using the COREQ guidelines to inform qualitative studies. RESULTS: The clinical relationship may be affected by communication problems such as patients' perceptions of scarce emotional involvement by obstetricians, by poor psychosocial support during the termination of the pregnancy and by insufficient follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSION: Nurses are in a privileged position to promote the empowerment of affected women. It is necessary to improve aspects related to the privacy of patients and the awareness and training of the interdisciplinary team in interpersonal communication. Post-loss follow-up is recommended to assess individual needs, thus facilitating an optimal approach to ease the grieving process. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: During the prenatal diagnosis, the existence of a fetal anomaly is emphasized, but support and follow up of the mother may be neglected; therefore, exhaustive knowledge about the obstetric history, the state of health and the expectations of patients is as important as a multidisciplinary team trained in counseling strategies and with a comprehensive care plan that covers all areas, especially those that control maternal emotions.",2020,10.1111/jocn.15162,29,7-8,1220-1237,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and qualitative research and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Counseling and Nurse-Patient Relations and Pregnant Women/*psychology and Patient-Centered Care/*methods and pregnancy and Mothers/psychology and Prenatal Diagnosis/*psychology and nurse-patient relations and Abortion, Eugenic/psychology and congenital abnormalities and eugenic abortions and genetic counselling",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

A. and van Moorselaar, Reindert Jeroen A. and Verdonck-de Leeuw, Irma M.",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a patient decision aid and to prepare an overview of requirements for implementation. BACKGROUND: We developed a decision aid that fits the preferences of patients and health care professionals to ensure adequate uptake in clinical practice. DESIGN: A participatory design approach was used to acquire insight into preferences regarding the content and design of a decision aid and into barriers and aspects of the decision aid that facilitate implementation in clinical practice. METHODS: Three focus group interviews with patients, their partners and health care professionals were conducted. A prototype of the decision aid was developed and presented to patients (n = 14) and health care professionals (n = 13) in semi-structured interviews. Patients (n = 5) participated in a usability study. Data were analysed by two independent coders. RESULTS: Health care professionals considered medical information on treatments and side effects as the most important aspect to be included in the decision aid. Patients also focused on nonmedical considerations, such as location. Both expected the decision aid to support patients in making a treatment choice. According to health care professionals, the oncology nurse was the most suitable to discuss the decision aid with patients, while some patients preferred to discuss the patient decision aid with the urologist. The main barrier to implementation of the decision aid was said to be the expectation that it is time and money consuming, while the incorporation of the decision aid into clinical guidelines and basing the content on these guidelines, would promote implementation. CONCLUSIONS: By using a participatory design approach a patient decision aid was designed to meet patients' and health care professionals' needs. Insight was also gained on requirements for implementation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Wide-scale implementation of decision aids is desirable. An overview is provided of requirements for implementation to successfully incorporate a decision aid into clinical practice.",2016,10.1111/jocn.13120,25,7-8,1131-1144,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and participatory design and implementation and Focus Groups and Attitude of Health Personnel and Patient Selection and Patient Preference and *Decision Support Techniques and *Patient Participation and Prostatic Neoplasms/*therapy and decision aid and shared decision-making and prostate cancer,NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lyneham_2009_Joofadnu,JOUR,Expert nursing practice: a mathematical explanation of Benner's 5th stage of practice development,"Lyneham, Joy and Parkinson, Camillus and Denholm, Carey",Journal of advanced nursing,"TITLE: Expert nursing practice: a mathematical explanation of Benner's 5th stage of practice development. AIM: This paper is a theoretical discussion of a mathematical explanation for Benner's theory of practice development. BACKGROUND: Benner's practice development theory demonstrates how a nurse moves from a beginning, rule-based practice through to expert care. Her notion of expert practice as intuitive has not been well-accepted or understood in nursing. A new description of expert practice includes three types of intuitive practice (cognitive, transitional and embodied), the development of which are dependent on knowledge, experience and reflective time. DATA SOURCES: This paper is based on phenomenological research conducted in 2000-2003 and Benner's publications, as well as recent discussions about the relationship between mathematics and phenomenology. DISCUSSION: The mathematical explanation for Benner's theory of practice development relates reflective time and knowledge to the mathematical power of experience and links the unique components of intuitive practice to expert care. On reaching expert practice, the three types of intuition include previously identified themes (knowledge, experience, connection, feeling, syncretism and trust) as differentials along the reflective time axis. When graphically represented, expert practice becomes a three-dimensional figure as practice becomes more complex, rather than a two-dimensional one as seen in previous stages. CONCLUSION: Having the intuitive component of expert practice further clarified from Benner's first vision confirms it as a valid component of practice. It is important to recognize that experience is a powerful component of practice and that it is essential to the development of expertise. Although this discussion has been nested within nursing practice, it has wide implications for medical, psychological and educational practice.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05091.x,65,11,2477-2484,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and *Decision Making and Clinical Competence/*standards and Practice, Psychological and *Intuition and *Nursing Theory and *Models, Nursing and Career Mobility",NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ackerson_2009_Joofadnu,JOUR,A decision theory perspective on why women do or do not decide to have cancer screening: systematic review,"Ackerson, Kelly and Preston, Stephanie D.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a review in which decision theory from economics and psychology was applied to understand why some women with access to care do not seek cancer screening. BACKGROUND: Mammography and cervical smear testing are effective modes of cancer screening, yet many women choose not to be screened. Nurses need to understand the reasons behind women's choices to improve adherence. DATA SOURCES: Research papers published between January 1994 and November 2008 were identified using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE and PsycINFO data bases. The search was performed using the following terms: cervical cancer screening, breast cancer screening, decision, choice, adherence and framing. Forty-seven papers were identified and reviewed for relevance to the search criteria. METHODS: Nineteen papers met the search criteria. For each paper, reasons for obtaining or not obtaining cancer screening were recorded, and organized into four relevant decision theory principles: emotions, Prospect Theory, optimism bias and framing. FINDINGS: All women have fears and uncertainty, but the sources of their fears differ, producing two main decision scenarios. Non-adherence results when women fear medical examinations, providers, tests and procedures, do not have/seek knowledge about risk and frame their current health as the status quo. Adherence is achieved when women fear cancer, but trust care providers, seek knowledge, understand risk and frame routine care as the status quo. CONCLUSION: Nurses need to address proactively women's perceptions and knowledge about screening by openly and uniformly discussing the importance and benefits.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.04981.x,65,6,1130-1140,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"United States and Humans and Female and United Kingdom and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Fear and Sweden and *Decision Making and Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*diagnosis and *Decision Theory and Mammography/psychology and Mass Screening/*psychology and Vaginal Smears/psychology",NA,NA,2009/06//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Trainer_2017_Joofadnu,JOUR,"Elective surgery to save my life: rethinking the ""choice"" in bariatric surgery","Trainer, Sarah and Benjamin, Tonya",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to explicate the processes by which a patient's choice to undergo bariatric surgery is made to feel like a medical necessity, to explore the ways widespread societal stigmatization of weight and bariatric surgery shapes patient and provider discourse about surgery and to discuss patient rationalizations of the choice to have surgery. BACKGROUND: Severe obesity is currently highly stigmatized. Bariatric surgery has become an increasingly used option for individuals seeking to lose drastic amounts of weight. The surgery itself, however, remains stigmatized across many diverse settings. DESIGN: This research design is centred on an ethnographic study of bariatric surgery patients who undergo surgery at a particular bariatric clinic in the American Southwest. METHODS: Data collection included repeated ethnographic interviews with 35 individuals enrolled in the bariatric programme over the past 5 years. The interviews were supplemented by extensive participant observation, starting in 2014 to date. Thematic analysis of fieldnotes and transcribed interviews followed. RESULTS: People who have bariatric surgery for weight-loss may trade one type of stigma for another. Thus, individuals who qualify for bariatric surgery based on weight alone may be reluctant to explore the surgery as a viable option. This research also shows that younger women are more likely to face the effects of weight-related stigma, which has an impact on their motivations for undergoing bariatric surgery. CONCLUSION: Stigma - both weight-related and surgery-related - needs to be addressed at a larger level, in terms of policy and in clinical bariatric programmes.",2017,10.1111/jan.13193,73,4,894-904,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and ethnography and Attitude to Health and obesity and *Social Stigma and Health Promotion/*methods and Patients/*psychology and *Motivation and nurse and Elective Surgical Procedures/*psychology and stigma and Bariatric Surgery/*psychology and bariatric and cross-disciplinary and medicalization and Obesity, Morbid/*psychology/*surgery and Southwestern United States",NA,NA,2017/04//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

F. and Yan, Bryan B. Y.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This study aims to evaluate the effects of a nurse-coordinated, empowerment-based integrated care model on self-care behaviours and psychosocial outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and to explore how this intervention affects patients' self-care behaviours and quality of life. DESIGN: This mixed-methods study comprises a randomized controlled trial and an exploratory qualitative study. METHODS: A total of 392 community-dwelling patients aged <e2><89><a5>65 years with a confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, a high stroke risk and no oral anticoagulants treatment will be recruited from the medical outpatient clinics of a university-affiliated hospital. The patients will be randomly allocated to intervention or control groups, which will receive treatment via the nurse-coordinated integrated care model or standard care, respectively. We hypothesize that compared with patients receiving standard care, atrial fibrillation patients exposed to the nurse-coordinated care model will be more likely to achieve compatible patient and physician decisions regarding the use of oral anticoagulants, better changes in medication adherence, anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life after the intervention. A subsample of 30 participants in the intervention group will also participate in a qualitative interview to provide their views and perceptions about the intervention. The ethical approval has obtained on 5 July 2018. This study is supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 29 June 2018. DISCUSSION: This study will uniquely adopt an empowerment-based approach to equip patients as active agents in atrial fibrillation management through a nurse-coordinated integrated care model that comprehensively addresses their needs. IMPACT: Patients with atrial fibrillation are currently receiving inadequate guideline-recommended care. This study will address this important evidence-practice gap by optimizing oral anticoagulant prescription and therapeutic effects and promotes effective patient self-care, so as to achieve worldwide reductions in atrial fibrillation-related morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burdens.

Four focus groups of 2-5 surgical nurses (n = 14) were conducted to explore the nurses' perception of their role in managing deterioration over the first 72 hr postoperatively. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed and key themes identified. RESULTS: Nurses demonstrated a high level of awareness of their role in recognising and responding to early signs of deterioration. The themes that arose from the focus group interviews were ""struggling with blood pressure,"" and ""we know our patient is sick."" The nurses were confident about the clinical indicators of deterioration and the appropriate channels to use to escalate care. Using track and trigger observation charts enabled nurses to identify deteriorating patients prior to the patient fulfilling rapid response system escalation criteria. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of a collective team approach to preventing, recognising and responding to clinical deterioration across the whole patient journey. Initiatives to ensure accurate written and verbal communication between medical and nursing staff warrants further assessment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses working in acute surgical wards are highly engaged in the process of recognising and responding to clinical deterioration in post-operative patients. Many nurses reported being able to anticipate deterioration occurring but are required by current organisational frameworks to escalate care to rapid response systems. How nurses anticipate and manage deterioration prior to the patient fulfilling rapid response system criteria warrants further investigation.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14331,27,9-10,1920-1930,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"decision-making and Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Australia and Qualitative Research and *Clinical Deterioration and *Nurse's Role and *Nurse-Patient Relations and quality and safety and critical incidents and Monitoring, Physiologic/*nursing and surgical nursing and Nursing Assessment/methods and post-operative nursing and post-operative sequelae",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gray_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,Hospital in the Home nurses' recognition and response to clinical deterioration,"Gray, Erika and Currey, Judy and Considine, Julie",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To obtain an understanding of how Hospital in the Home (HITH) nurses recognise and respond to clinical deterioration in patients receiving care at home or in their usual place of residence. BACKGROUND: Recognising and responding to clinical deterioration is an international safety priority and a key nursing responsibility. Despite an increase in care delivery in home environments, how HITH nurses recognise and respond to clinical deterioration is not yet fully understood. DESIGN: A prospective, descriptive exploratory design was used. A survey containing questions related to participant characteristics and 10 patient scenarios was used to collect data from 47 nurses employed in the HITH units of three major health services in Melbourne, Australia. The 10 scenarios reflected typical HITH patients and included medical history and clinical assessment findings (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, conscious state and pain score). RESULTS: The three major findings from this study were that: (i) nurse and patient characteristics influenced HITH nurses' assessment decisions; (ii) the cues used by HITH nurses to recognise clinical deterioration varied according to the clinical context; and (iii) although HITH nurses work in an autonomous role, they engage in collaborative practice when responding to clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION: Hospital in the Home nurses play a fundamental role in patient assessment, and the context in which they recognise and respond to deterioration is markedly different to that of hospital nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The assessment, measurement and interpretation of clinical data are a nursing responsibility that is crucial to early recognition and response to clinical deterioration. The capacity of HITH services to care for increasing numbers of patients in their home environment, and to promptly recognise and respond to clinical deterioration should it occur, is fundamental to safety within the healthcare system. Hospital in the Home nurses are integral to a sustainable healthcare system that is responsive to dynamic changes in public health policies, and meets the healthcare needs of the community.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14076,27,9-10,2152-2160,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and risk assessment and Prospective Studies and Australia and nursing and *Clinical Deterioration and *Nurse's Role and clinical deterioration and patient assessment and *Nursing Process and Community Health Nursing/*methods and home care services and home nursing and Hospital in the Home nursing and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods/*nursing and Nurses, Community Health",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Liu_2016_Joofclnu,JOUR,"Creating opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and patient-centred care: how nurses, doctors, pharmacists and patients use communication strategies when managing medications in an acute hospital setting","Liu, Wei and Gerdtz, Marie and Manias, Elizabeth",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the communication strategies that nurses, doctors, pharmacists and patients use when managing medications. BACKGROUND: Patient-centred medication management is best accomplished through interdisciplinary practice. Effective communication about managing medications between clinicians and patients has a direct influence on patient outcomes. There is a lack of research that adopts a multidisciplinary approach and involves critical in-depth analysis of medication interactions among nurses, doctors, pharmacists and patients. DESIGN: A critical ethnographic approach with video reflexivity was adopted to capture communication strategies during medication activities in two general medical wards of an acute care hospital in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: A mixed ethnographic approach combining participant observations, field interviews, video recordings and video reflexive focus groups and interviews was employed. Seventy-six nurses, 31 doctors, 1 pharmacist and 27 patients gave written consent to participate in the study. Data analysis was informed by Fairclough's critical discourse analytic framework. FINDINGS: Clinicians' use of communication strategies was demonstrated in their interpersonal, authoritative and instructive talk with patients. Doctors adopted the language discourse of normalisation to standardise patients' illness experiences. Nurses and pharmacists employed the language discourses of preparedness and scrutiny to ensure that patient safety was maintained. Patients took up the discourse of politeness to raise medication concerns and question treatment decisions made by doctors, in their attempts to challenge decision-making about their health care treatment. In addition, the video method revealed clinicians' extensive use of body language in communication processes for medication management. CONCLUSIONS: The use of communication strategies by nurses, doctors, pharmacists and patients created opportunities for improved interdisciplinary collaboration and patient-centred medication management in an acute hospital setting. Language discourses shaped and were shaped by complex power relations between patients and clinicians and among clinicians themselves. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinicians need to be encouraged to have regular conversations to talk about and challenge each other's practices. More emphasis should be placed on ensuring that patients are given opportunities to voice their concerns about how their medications are managed.",2016,10.1111/jocn.13360,25,19-20,2943-2957,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Physicians and Humans and Pharmacists and ethnography and Anthropology, Cultural and interdisciplinary and Video Recording and Victoria and *Communication and *Patient-Centered Care and *Interprofessional Relations and Nursing Staff, Hospital and communication strategies and language discourse and medication interactions and Medication Therapy Management/organization & administration and video reflexivity",NA,NA,2016/10//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chang_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,"A review of nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and ability to communicate the risks and benefits of complementary and alternative medicine","Chang, Hsiao-Yun and Chang, Huai-Lu",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study reviewed existing literature to investigate how frequently nurses include complementary and alternative forms of medicine in their clinical practice. In so doing, we investigated nurses' knowledge of and attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine as well as their ability to communicate the risks and benefits of these therapies with patients. BACKGROUND: Little information is available concerning nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine or how they incorporate these therapies into their practice. In addition, little is known about the ability of nurses to communicate the risks and benefits of complementary and alternative medicine to their patients. STUDY DESIGN: This study used a scoping review method to map and synthesise existing literature. DATA SOURCES: Both electronic and manual searches were used to identify relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2014. REVIEW METHODS: The review was conducted in five stages: (1) identification of research question(s), (2) locate studies, (3) selection of studies, (4) charting of data, and (5) collating, summarising, and reporting of results. RESULTS: Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria for this review, among which 53<c2><b7>7% referenced how frequently nurses include complementary and alternative medicine in their practice. We found that 66<c2><b7>4% of nurses had positive attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine; however, 77<c2><b7>4% did not possess a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks and benefits. In addition, nearly half of the respondents (47<c2><b7>3-67<c2><b7>7%) reported feeling uncomfortable discussing complementary and alternative medicine therapies with their patients. CONCLUSION: The lack of knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine among nurses is a cause for concern, particularly in light of its widespread application. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this study suggest that health care professionals need to promote evidence informed decision-making in complementary and alternative medicine practice and be knowledgeable enough to discuss complementary and alternative medicine therapies. Without involvement of complementary and alternative medicine communication on the part of our profession, we may put our patients at risk of uninformed and without medical guidance.",2015,10.1111/jocn.12790,24,11-12,1466-1478,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Communication and Humans and review and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and nurses and *Complementary Therapies and complementary and alternative medicine",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aghakhani_2018_Joofadnu,JOUR,Women's attitudes to safe-induced abortion in Iran: Findings from a pilot survey,"Aghakhani, Nader and Cleary, Michelle and Zarei, Abbas and Lopez, Violeta",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To explore attitudes to safe-induced abortion among pregnant women in Iran. BACKGROUND: In Islamic teachings, abortion is generally forbidden. However in specific circumstances, abortion may be permitted and currently, in Iran, the law allows termination of pregnancy only if three specialist physicians confirm that the pregnancy outcome may be harmful for the mother during pregnancy or after birth. DESIGN: Pilot, descriptive survey. METHODS: A 15-item structured questionnaire focusing on attitudes to safe-induced abortion was developed and pilot tested. Participants were pregnant women who were referred to the Legal Medical Centre (July-December 2015) to obtain permission for abortion. On obtaining their informed consent, the women were asked to respond to each item if they agreed (Yes) or disagreed (No). Only their age, education, employment, marital status and religion were obtained. RESULTS: Of the 80 survey participants referred for a safe-induced abortion, 90% were carrying foetuses with a diagnosed congenital malformation and 10% were experiencing complications of pregnancy that endangered their health. The majority of women (85%) perceived abortion to be dangerous to health; 86% indicated that partners should be involved in decision-making about abortion, while 83% believed that public health officials should have complete control of abortion law. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to improve women's and couples' awareness and practice of effective contraceptive methods. Further research is needed to better understand the complex issues that lead to unintended pregnancies and abortions considering religious beliefs and cultural and legal contexts.",2018,10.1111/jan.13393,74,1,61-64,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and survey and Employment and Educational Status and contraception and nursing and Pregnancy and Iran and Informed Consent and *Attitude to Health and pregnancy and family planning and Marital Status and Islam and legislation and Abortion, Induced/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Muslim women and Women/*psychology and abortion and induced abortion",NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vaismoradi_2011_Joofadnu,JOUR,Nurses' experiences of uncertainty in clinical practice: a descriptive study,"Vaismoradi, Mojtaba and Salsali, Mahvash and Ahmadi, Fazlollah",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This paper is a report of a qualitative descriptive study of nurses' experiences of uncertainty in clinical practice. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty as a complex phenomenon is inherent in many nursing and medical encounters and can vary along different dimensions. Despite the existence of studies on the theoretical definitions of uncertainty, few studies have been conducted to explore nurses' experiences in this regard and strategies employed by them to encounter situations of uncertainty in nursing practice. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2009 with 18 female bachelor's degree nurses working in a teaching hospital in an urban area of Iran. Content analysis was used to identify themes. FINDINGS: The data analysis resulted in three main themes: 'unclear domain of practice', 'compatibility with uncertainty', 'psychological reactions to uncertainty'. The second theme consisted of two categories: 'losing sensitivity' and 'avoiding trouble'. The themes were not mutually exclusive or independent, but rather overlapping and intertwined. The themes and their related categories summarized the nurses' experiences of uncertain situations and the way they used to present efficacious care and meet patients' needs in spite of being immersed in uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Enhanced awareness and increased understanding about uncertainty can be important factors in improving nursing work environment and the quality of care presented to patients. The findings will be helpful for nurse managers to educate and prepare nurses in order to encounter uncertain situations in practice.",2011,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05547.x,67,5,991-999,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Physician's Role and Qualitative Research and Adaptation, Psychological and Models, Psychological and Iran and Attitude of Health Personnel and Job Satisfaction and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Uncertainty and *Physician-Nurse Relations and Nurse's Role/*psychology and Hospitals, Teaching/organization & administration and Burnout, Professional/psychology and Clinical Nursing Research",NA,NA,2011/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Burns_2018_Joofadnu,JOUR,Enhanced early warning system impact on nursing practice: A phenomenological study,"Burns, Kathleen A. and Reber, Tracey and Theodore, Karen and Welch, Brenda and Roy, Debra and Siedlecki, Sandra L.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To determine how an enhanced early warning system has an impact on nursing practice. BACKGROUND: Early warning systems score physiologic measures and alert nurses to subtle changes in patient condition. Critics of early warning systems have expressed concern that nurses would rely on a score rather than assessment skills and critical thinking to determine the need for intervention. Enhancing early warning systems with innovative technology is still in its infancy, so the impact of an enhanced early warning system on nursing behaviours or practice has not yet been studied. DESIGN: Phenomenological design. METHODS: Scripted, semistructured interviews were conducted in September 2015 with 25 medical/surgical nurses who used the enhanced early warning system. Data were analysed using thematic analysis techniques (coding and bracketing). Emerging themes were examined for relationships and a model describing the enhanced early warning system experience was developed. FINDINGS: Nurses identified awareness leading to investigation and ease of prioritization as the enhanced early warning system's most important impact on their nursing practice. There was also an impact on organizational culture, with nurses reporting improved communication, increased collaboration, increased accountability and proactive responses to early changes in patient condition. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than hinder critical thinking, as many early warning systems' critics claim, nurses in this study found that the enhanced early warning system increased their awareness of changes in a patient's condition, resulting in earlier response and reassessment times. It also had an impact on the organization by improving communication and collaboration and supporting a culture of proactive rather than reactive response to early signs of deterioration.",2018,10.1111/jan.13517,74,5,1150-1156,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Clinical Alarms and critical thinking and nurses and nursing practice and early warning system and phenomenology and Nursing Care/*methods and patient deterioration",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Endacott_2010_Joofadnu,JOUR,"Final-year nursing students' ability to assess, detect and act on clinical cues of deterioration in a simulated environment","Endacott, Ruth and Scholes, Julie and Buykx, Penny and Cooper, Simon and Kinsman, Leigh and McConnell-Henry, Tracy",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: This is a report of a study investigating processes used by final-year nursing students to recognize and act on clinical cues of deterioration in a simulated environment. BACKGROUND: Initial decisions about patients who are deteriorating in medical and surgical wards are often made by newly qualified nurses and doctors, increasing the risk of clinical error. There has been an emphasis on the use of teams in simulation; however, signs of deterioration are missed by individual clinicians. METHODS: During July 2008, final-year undergraduate nursing students in Australia attended a simulation laboratory for 1<c2><b7>5 hours and completed a knowledge questionnaire and two (mannequin-based) scenarios simulating deteriorating patients with hypovolaemic and septic shock. Scenarios were video-recorded and reflective interviews conducted. Additionally, scenarios were stopped around the midpoint to ascertain students' level of Situation Awareness. RESULTS: Fifty-one students participated in the study, providing a total of 102 videoed scenarios and 51 interviews. Thematic analysis of video data and reflective interviews identified considerable differences in processes used by students to identify cues. Four aspects of cue recognition were evident: initial response, differential recognition of cues, accumulation of signs and diversionary activity. CONCLUSION: Nursing skills training should emphasize the importance of trends in identifying and acting on deterioration and the need for systematic assessment in stressful situations. Nursing curricula should focus on enhancing the ability to piece information together, including linking pathophysiology with patient assessment, and identify trends, rather than seeing observations as parallel to each other.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05417.x,66,12,2722-2731,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Decision Making and Disease Progression and Acute Disease and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Clinical Competence/*standards and Educational Measurement/methods and Vital Signs/physiology and *Video Recording and Cues and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Emergencies/*nursing and Manikins and Education, Nursing/methods and Nursing Assessment/methods/*standards",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Patient- and family-centred care is gaining interest, with a shift from provider-centric norms to care arranged around patients' and relatives individual beliefs and needs. This is expected to have a positive influence on the quality of care. Communication is one of the most important factors impacting the perceived quality of care in the intensive care unit from the perspective of patients' relatives. New interventions have been introduced to help the patients' relatives to meet their communication needs. DESIGN: A time-trend quantitative design. METHODS: Two convenience samples of relatives were included (in 2012 and 2013) in four different intensive care units from a large university medical centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Survey data from 211 relatives (75% net response rate in 2012) and 123 relatives (66% net response rate in 2013) were used for the analysis. The second measurement showed significant improvements regarding informational aspects of care, clarification of roles in participatory caretaking and shared decision-making. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the additional support offered to patients' relatives increased perceived quality of care, particularly with respect to informational needs. However, patient- and family-centred care still requires a change in the mindset of healthcare professionals. This new point of view should overcome perceived barriers and foster a culture of partnership with patients' relatives in the intensive care unit. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Training in providing psychosocial support for the needs of relatives leads to a stronger perception of patient-centredness.",2017,10.1111/jocn.13669,26,19-20,3212-3223,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,communication and Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and quality of care and Netherlands and intensive care unit and Family/*psychology and critical care and Intensive Care Units/*standards and Patient-Centered Care/*methods and nurses and relatives and Health Personnel/standards and Critical Illness/*nursing and family support and patient- and family-centred care,NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: This is a study of 20 inpatients in two medical and two surgical wards at an academic health science centre in Melbourne, Australia. Semi-structured interviews were recorded and analysed using content analysis. FINDINGS: Three themes were identified: (a) 'understanding the medication' established large variation in participants' understanding of their pre-admission medication and current medication; (b) 'ownership of medication administration' showed that few patients had considered an alternative to their current regimen; only some were interested in taking more control; and (c) 'supporting discharge from hospital' showed that most patients desired written medication instructions to be explained by a health professional. Family involvement was important for many. CONCLUSION: There was significant diversity of opinion from participants about their involvement in medication management in hospital. Patient preferences for inclusion need to be identified on admission where appropriate. Education about roles and responsibilities of medication management is required for health professionals, patients and families to increase inclusion and engagement across the health continuum and support transition to discharge. IMPACT STATEMENT: Little is known about patient preferences for participation in medication administration and hospital discharge planning. Individual patient understanding of and interest in participation in medication administration varies.

Saevareid_2021_Joofadnu,JOUR,Nursing home residents with cognitive impairment can participate in advance care planning: A qualitative study,"Saevareid, Trygve J. L. and Pedersen, Reidar and Thoresen, Lisbeth",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: To describe advance care planning in nursing homes when residents with cognitive impairment and/or their next of kin participated and identify associated challenges. DESIGN: A qualitative study of nine advance care planning conversations in four Norwegian nursing home wards. During the implementation of advance care planning, we purposively sampled residents with cognitive impairment, their next of kin and healthcare personnel. The implementation followed a ""whole-ward"" approach aimed at involving the whole ward in fostering an inclusive, holistic advance care planning discussion. Involving as many residents as possible, preferably together with their next of kin, were central. METHODS: From observed and audio-recorded advance care planning conversations that took place from November 2015 to June 2016, we conducted a thematic analysis of the transcripts and field notes. Reporting adhered to the COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: Residents actively relayed their preferences regarding healthcare and end-of-life issues, despite the cognitive impairment. Next of kin provided constructive support and conversations were largely resident-focused. However, involving residents was also challenging, findings included: residents' preferences were often vague, relevant medical information from healthcare personnel lacked and the next of kin were sometimes unaware of the resident's previously held preferences. Moreover, residents tended to focus more on the past and present than the future end-of-life care. CONCLUSIONS: Residents with cognitive impairment can participate actively and meaningfully in advance care planning, if the healthcare personnel actively listens. However, several challenges can arise. Supported decision-making can improve communication and resident involvement, reinforcing a relational understanding of autonomy. IMPACT: Persons with cognitive impairment should be invited to participate in advance care planning. Their participation may make its benefits and more person-centred care attainable to persons that are often not involved. Successful involvement of persons with cognitive impairment in advance care planning may rely on robust implementation.",2021,10.1111/jan.14661,77,2,879-888,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,Humans and qualitative research and nursing and Qualitative Research and Norway and nursing home and Nursing Homes and long-term care and *Advance Care Planning and advance care planning and cognitive impairment and relational autonomy and *Cognitive Dysfunction and whole-system approach,NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Powell_2013_Joofadnu,JOUR,Can you see me? Experiences of nurses working night shift in Australian regional hospitals: a qualitative case study,"Powell, Idona",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To report a study that explored the experiences of night-shift nurses, focusing on employee interrelationships and work satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Night-shift nurses are a critical component in hospital care making it essential to understand the experiences that give meaning to their work and understand how these nurses and the organization can benefit from their contribution to hospital care. A literature review revealed minimal research in this area. DESIGN: Qualitative case study. METHOD: A qualitative case study using semi-structured interviews and self-completed diaries was conducted in 2010 in regional public hospitals in Australia. Participants were 14 nurses working nights half or more of their shifts in medical or surgical wards. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis identified four major areas of concern: work relationships, work environment, work practices and lifestyle impact. Notably, work relationships were most meaningful for nurses on the same shift; night-shift nurses experienced working conditions inferior to their daytime counterparts including a perception of minimal leadership. Despite limited education opportunities, night shift provided opportunity for professional growth for some nurses with a slippage in skills for others; night shift provided flexibility for family and social activities, yet impeded these same activities, primarily due to pervasive fatigue. Night-shift nurses considered their role critical, yet believed that they were poorly regarded. CONCLUSION: The strong interpersonal relationships developed between night-shift workers need to be capitalized on whilst developing a more effective leadership model, improved work environment, more equitable professional development, and genuine recognition of the critical role of night nurses.",2013,10.1111/jan.12079,69,10,2172-2184,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and nursing and Hospitals, Public and Attitude of Health Personnel and New South Wales and Interpersonal Relations and Workplace and Professional Practice and Nurses/*psychology and Work Schedule Tolerance/*psychology and nurses and work environment and *Job Satisfaction and work relationships",NA,NA,2013/10//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Home enteral tube feeding is well recognised as a valuable therapeutic option for patients requiring nutritional support following discharge from hospital. The number of patients discharged from hospital and receiving home enteral tube feeding increases annually in Taiwan. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHOD: Participants (n = 607) were chosen from one free-standing home care agency and three hospital-based home care departments in Taipei. A review of the patients' records to gather demographic data, medical diagnosis, length of home care and length of intubation prior to the home visit was conducted. A face-to-face interview was conducted at the time of the home visit. FINDINGS: The prevalence rate of home enteral tube feeding was 70.3% (n = 427). Of the 427 tube-fed subjects, 93.4% were fed with a nasogastric tube. The most common reasons for refusing to use percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy were 'too old to suffer from an operation', 'worried about wound infection or leakage after performing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy' and 'to keep subjects' body integrity'. Stroke, no dementia, poor activities of daily living and poor cognitive status were significant predictors of being tube-fed, while higher education and better cognitive status were significant predictors of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy use. CONCLUSION: The reasons patients refused to use percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy reflect the influence of cultural values and the level of patients' education, which home health care nurses need to discuss with patients in detail.

Bristow_2018_Joofclnu,JOUR,The rural mother's experience of caring for a child with a chronic health condition: An integrative review,"Bristow, Sally and Jackson, Debra and Shields, Linda and Usher, Kim",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify and review the literature on rural mothers' experiences in caring for a child with a chronic health condition. BACKGROUND: Families living with a child who has a chronic health condition experience many challenges; these are often amplified for families living in rural areas, where issues such as the distance from services add further challenges the family must manage. Like many children, rural children with chronic health conditions are primarily cared for by their mothers. The additional strain of geography creates its own unique experiences for mothers who need to access the high-quality care that their child requires. DESIGN: Integrative literature review using the Equator PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: A search of databases; Cochrane, CINAHL, Ovid, PubMed, ProQuest Health and Medicine, Informit and Scopus for studies published between 2005-2016 using an integrative review approach. A total of 1,484 studies were identified with an additional six studies found through snowballing. The search resulted in seven studies being meeting the inclusion criteria after using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. RESULTS: Data from the seven articles were analysed, and the mothers' experiences were synthesised into five themes: ""struggling for resources,"" ""barriers in accessing services,"" ""strain of decision-making,"" ""mother's physical and emotional breakdown"" and ""the daily management of family activities"". These five themes formed the basis of this article. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that mothers from rural areas face additional barriers related to their rurality, including transportation difficulties, socioeconomic status and social isolation, and are challenged by limited access to specialty medical services, educators and allied health professionals. The literature review outcome will assist in informing nursing practice through identifying and allocating resources to reduce these barriers; rural mother experience will assist in enabling the child to reach their full developmental potential. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a need for health professionals to understand the challenges and barriers rural mothers face in accessing services. Nurses can assist rural mothers to navigate and access the appropriate services in order to reduce health inequity, increase accessibility to services and reduce rural disadvantage for their child. Nurses and health professionals are in an ideal position to develop future models of care that optimise health outcomes and enable equity and access to services for rural children with chronic conditions similar to those experienced by their urban counterparts.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14360,27,13-14,2558-2568,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and children and Geography and Infant, Newborn and *Health Services Accessibility and *Child Health Services and Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data and Mothers/*psychology and rural and Chronic Disease/*psychology/*therapy and chronic health condition and mothers",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA

Initial phase in the development of a patient-reported outcome measure,"Strickland, Louise H. and Kelly, Laura and Hamilton, Thomas W. and Murray, David W. and Pandit, Hemant G. and Jenkinson, Crispin",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the patients' perspective of surgery and early recovery when undergoing lower limb (hip or knee) arthroplasty. BACKGROUND: Lower limb arthroplasty is a commonly performed procedure for symptomatic arthritis, which has not responded to conservative medical treatment. Each patient's perspective of the surgical process and early recovery period impacts on their quality of life. DESIGN: Open, semistructured qualitative interviews were used to allow for a deeper understanding of the patient perspective when undergoing a hip or knee arthroplasty. METHODS: Following ethical approval, 30 patients were interviewed between August and November 2016 during the perioperative period while undergoing an elective hip or knee arthroplasty (n = 30). The interviews were performed between the day of surgery and a nine-week postoperative clinic appointment. Data were analysed using an in-depth narrative thematic analysis method. NVivo qualitative data analysis software was used. RESULTS: Seven main themes evolved from the interviews: ""improving function and mobility"", ""pain"", ""experiences of health care"", ""support from others"", ""involvement and understanding of care decisions"", ""behaviour and coping"" and ""fatigue and sleeping"". CONCLUSIONS: The early postoperative recovery period is of vital importance to all surgical patients. This is no different for the orthopaedic patient. However, identifying key self-reported areas of importance from patients can guide clinical focus for healthcare professionals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To have specific patient-reported information regarding key areas of importance during the perioperative phase is invaluable when caring for the orthopaedic surgical patient. It gives insight and understanding in to this increasing population group. This study has also served as a starting point in the development of a questionnaire which could be used to assess interventions in the lower limb arthroplasty population. These results will influence both items and content of the questionnaire.",2018,10.1111/jocn.14086,27,13-14,2598-2608,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"qualitative study and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and United Kingdom and surgery and Aged, 80 and over and Postoperative Period and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Quality of Life/*psychology and *Patient Satisfaction and arthroplasty and Elective Surgical Procedures/*psychology and nursing research and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*psychology and Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*psychology and patients' perspective and postoperative recovery and quality of recovery and total hip replacement and total knee replacement and unicompartmental knee replacement",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Henoch_2012_Joofclnu,JOUR,Perception of quality of care: comparison of the views of patients' with lung cancer and their family members,"Henoch, Ingela and Lovgren, Malin and Wilde-Larsson, Bodil and Tishelman, Carol",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore potential differences within dyads of patients' with lung cancer and family members' judgment of different aspects of quality of care and relationships between quality of care and personal and health-related characteristics. BACKGROUND: High quality of care is important for acceptable quality of life in patients in palliative care. If patients are unable to participate in quality of care assessments or decision-making, family members might often act as proxies, despite the complicated nature of their own situation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. METHOD: A patient and family member version of the abbreviated questionnaire Quality from Patients' Perspective, with additional items about perceived health and opinions about care, was mailed to members of the Swedish lung cancer Patient Organisation. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to identify potential differences within 51 patient-family member dyads' quality of care ratings. Relationships between Quality from Patients' Perspective dimensions and demographic and health-related variables were examined with Spearman's correlations. RESULTS: Patient-family member dyads had high levels of agreement in ratings of perceived reality of quality of care. Family members generally rated the subjective importance of individual items higher than did the patient in the dyad, with significant difference in the dimension 'socio-cultural approach'. Older patients were found to rate the physical-technical conditions higher than younger patients, in relation to perceived reality but not subjective importance. Women family members were found to rate the subjective importance of medical-technical competence, identity-oriented approach and socio-cultural approach significantly higher than men did. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lung cancer and their family members agree in ratings of the perceived reality, but they differ more in ratings of the subjective importance of quality of care. When patients are unable to communicate their preferences, family members' opinions could be used as proxies concerning concrete aspects of quality of care. Concerning more subjective aspects, family members' ratings should be interpreted with precaution, as it could diverge from patients' own opinion. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The perceptions of the importance of different aspects of quality of care were less related to health status than were judgments of quality of care received. This might suggest that the care patients received fulfilled neither the patients' nor family members' expectations, which is an important message to healthcare professionals and which would demand further exploration.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03923.x,21,3-4,585-594,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and *Quality of Health Care and *Family and Lung Neoplasms/*psychology,NA,NA,2012/02//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sherwin_2018_Joofadnu,JOUR,Layperson's knowledge and perceptions of irritable bowel syndrome as potential barriers to care,"Sherwin, LeeAnne B.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the layperson's knowledge and perceptions regarding the aetiology, pathogenesis, prevalence, medical evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Diagnosis acceptance and adherence to treatment is influenced by the views of the patient's social networks. Little is known how these networks influence those with irritable bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of two-hundred four laypersons, ages 18-80 years without an irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis. METHODS: Data were collected May 2016-March 2017. Laypersons without a diagnosis of IBS self-reported their knowledge and perceptions about IBS. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Participants were able to identify many symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome however held misconceptions regarding the development of irritable bowel syndrome as noted by the endorsement of genetics, environment and diet or alcohol/smoking behaviours as specific causes. Further misconceptions held included the belief that irritable bowel syndrome was associated with an increased risk for the development of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Contrary to current guidelines, many thought a gastroenterologist was the only person appropriate to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome and objective testing, such as colonoscopy, was necessary to establish a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Laypersons have an understanding of the symptoms associated with IBS; however, hold numerous misconceptions regarding the aetiology, role of the healthcare provider, necessary testing and risks associated with irritable bowel syndrome. These misconceptions are inconsistent with current guidelines and practices.

BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction. DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals' management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016.

Lai_2008_Joofclnu,JOUR,Intensive care unit staff nurses: predicting factors for career decisions,"Lai, Hui-Ling and Lin, Ya-Ping and Chang, Hui-Kuan and Wang, Shu-Chen and Liu, Yun-Ling and Lee, Huei-Chen and Peng, Tai-Chu and Chang, Fwu-Mei",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to understand the factors related to intention to leave their job among intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in eastern Taiwan and to make between-group comparisons between an intention to leave and an intention to stay as well as to predict the influencing factors that affect ICU staff nurses' intention to leave. BACKGROUND: Nurses' intention to leave their job may have an important impact on the actual turnover of nurses. The issue has always been of concern to nursing executives. Only limited empirical studies in the area have been investigated in an Asian culture context and particularly the eastern Taiwan region. METHODS: A cross-sectional predictive study was performed during 2005 with 130 nurses recruited from two ICUs at a medical centre. A researcher-designed questionnaire based on the Cooper's model with structured interviews was used to determine each nurse's characteristics and their intention to leave their job. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the various factors associated with this. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 100%; 63 (48.9%) revealed that they intended to leave their jobs. The findings were that their self-rated health status, the number of diseases, the level of happiness, the presence of depression, job satisfaction, sleep quality, type of license and their unit were significantly associated with an intention to leave (p = 0.05-0.001). Depression and sleep quality proved to be the most significant predictors of ICU staff nurses' intention to leave their job. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there is a need to take steps to improve nurses' health-related quality of life and to develop effective strategies to improve nurse retention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A succinct validated instrument would help identify the important factors that predict ICU nurses' intention to leave their job, which may result in job disengagement. Predictors found in this study may be used as outcome variables for developing such an effective method of improving nurse retention in ICUs.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02180.x,17,14,1886-1896,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Adult and Health Status and Cross-Sectional Studies and Logistic Models and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Happiness and Models, Psychological and Health Services Needs and Demand and Nursing Methodology Research and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Taiwan and Depression/psychology and Quality of Life/psychology and *Intention and Occupational Health and Burnout, Professional/psychology and *Job Satisfaction and *Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and *Personnel Turnover/statistics & numerical data and Nursing Staff, Hospital/education/organization & administration/*psychology and Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology",NA,NA,2008/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
Allen_2015_Joofclnu,JOUR,Severity and duration of pain after colonoscopy and gastroscopy: a cohort study,"Allen, Penny and Shaw, Elissa and Jong, Anne and Behrens, Heidi and Skinner, Isabelle",Journal of clinical nursing,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence, severity, location and duration of pain post-colonoscopy, and to explore possible associations between pain, demographic variables and diagnostic findings. The study also sought to provide information to guide decision-making on CO2 insufflation. BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy with sedation is a common day surgery procedure in Australia. Attendance for colonoscopy is influenced by patient expectations, particularly about pain. Research on post-colonoscopy pain has focussed on pain experienced immediately post-procedure, with few studies investigating pain beyond 24 hours. DESIGN: Follow-up study using patient-completed Pain Numerical Rating Scales. METHODS: Patients undergoing colonoscopy at a single hospital day surgery unit were invited to complete Pain Numerical Rating Scales (where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain) three times daily for three days post-colonoscopy. RESULTS: Among the 277 participants, 124 (45%) reported pain at any time during follow-up. Twenty-one (8%) participants experienced pain on each of the three days. Pain was most commonly experienced in the hypogastric and iliac regions. The severity of pain was low, with only 33 participants self-administering analgesics (paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) during follow-up. Participants who had both colonoscopy and gastroscopy were not more likely to report pain overall. However, they were more likely to report pain on days 2 and 3 and were also more likely to take analgesics. Pain was not associated with procedure duration, abdominal pressurisation, removal of polyps, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease or the presence of benign or malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates that fewer than half of the patients undergoing colonoscopy will experience post-procedure pain and that just over one in ten patients will require analgesics. Patients undergoing both gastroscopy and colonoscopy are more likely to experience pain for longer and require over-the-counter analgesics. The low prevalence of pain suggests that room air insufflation is an acceptable alternative to more expensive CO2 . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings provide evidence for nurses and clinicians to advise patients about the likelihood of experiencing pain post-colonoscopy, and the characteristics of this pain. Nurses may reassure patients that pain is not more likely among patients diagnosed with colorectal disease or malignancy. Patients who have persistent pain for longer than 24 hours post-colonoscopy should be advised to seek medical care to investigate the cause of their pain.",2015,10.1111/jocn.12817,24,13-14,1895-1903,eng,1365-2702 0962-1067,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Time Factors and Cohort Studies and Australia and surgery and Prevalence and Aged, 80 and over and pain and Pain Measurement and colonoscopy and Analgesics/therapeutic use and Carbon Dioxide and Colonoscopy/*adverse effects and Acetaminophen/therapeutic use and gastroscopy and Gastroscopy/*adverse effects and Insufflation and Pain, Postoperative/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology and post-operative pain",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,J Clin Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
De.Meyer_2019_Joofadnu,JOUR,PROTECT - Trial: A cluster RCT to study the effectiveness of a repositioning aid and tailored repositioning to increase repositioning compliance,"De Meyer, Dorien and Van Hecke, Ann and Verhaeghe, Sofie and Beeckman, Dimitri",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: To study the effectiveness of tailored repositioning and a turning and repositioning system on: (a) nurses' compliance to repositioning frequencies; (b) body posture of patients after repositioning; (c) incidence of pressure ulcers and incontinence-associated dermatitis; (d) nurses' and patients' preferences, comfort and acceptability; and (e) budget impact. BACKGROUND: Patient-tailored systematic repositioning is key in pressure ulcer prevention. To date, a clinical decision-making tool is lacking and compliance to pressure ulcer prevention guidelines is low. Research concerning commercially available turning and repositioning systems is lacking. DESIGN: Multicentre, cluster, three-arm, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven patients at risk of pressure ulcer development were recruited at 29 wards in 16 hospitals between February 2016 and December 2017. Wards were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group. RESULTS: Nurses' compliance to repositioning frequencies increased significantly in the experimental groups when patients were cared for in bed (94.6% vs. 69% and 84.9% vs. 71.4%). Applying the turning and repositioning system was associated with significantly more correctly positioned patients (30-45<c2><b0> tilted side-lying position) (69.6% vs. 34.6%). Few pressure ulcers and incontinence-associated dermatitis incidents occurred. Both patients and nurses were positive about the intervention. Higher labour costs related to repositioning in bed were found in the control group. CONCLUSION: This was the first study investigating the effect of tailored repositioning and the use of a repositioning aid to increase nurses' compliance to repositioning. The results were in favour of the interventions yet demonstrating the importance of follow-up and education.

Hutchinson_2010_Joofadnu,JOUR,Community care assessment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Hutchinson, Anastasia F. and Thompson, Michelle A. and Brand, Caroline A. and Black, Jim and Anderson, Gary P. and Irving, Louis B.",Journal of advanced nursing,"AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a clinical algorithm to assess chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation severity in a community setting. BACKGROUND: An important aspect of community management of exacerbations is assessing patient safety. Although researchers have investigated risk factors for rapid deterioration, there is a lack of evidence validating clinical measures of exacerbation severity. METHODS: This was a prospective, community-based cohort study of patients enrolled in the Melbourne Longitudinal Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cohort. The outreach team collected data on symptom severity at baseline and exacerbation onset using the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale, St George Quality-of-Life Questionnaire and Symptom Severity Index. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were monitored from 2003 to 2005. There were 148 exacerbations: 121 (82%) were treated at home and 27 (17<c2><b7>5%) required hospitalization. An ordinal logistic regression model demonstrated that a combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity with dyspnoea and wheeze severity at exacerbation onset could differentiate severe from milder episodes [(OR 7<c2><b7>69, 95%CI: 3<c2><b7>9-11<c2><b7>5, P < 0<c2><b7>01), area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0<c2><b7>75 (95%CI: 0<c2><b7>65-0<c2><b7>86)]. CONCLUSION: The majority of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations can be safely managed in a community setting, but clinical assessment alone may not be sufficient to identify all patients who will develop complications such as respiratory failure. Further research is needed to validate clinical assessment and decision-making algorithms for community-management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05436.x,66,11,2490-2499,eng,1365-2648 0309-2402,"Hospitalization and Humans and Longitudinal Studies and Algorithms and Quality of Life and Severity of Illness Index and Ambulatory Care and Patient Selection and *Decision Support Techniques and *Disease Progression and *Nurse Practitioners and *Community Health Services and Dyspnea/complications and Nursing Assessment/*methods and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis/nursing/*physiopathology and Respiratory Sounds/diagnosis",NA,NA,2010/11//undefined,J Adv Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA
