Stone_2016_Joofcrca,JOUR,Actuating critical care therapeutics,"Stone, David J. and Csete, Marie",Journal of critical care,"Viewing the intensive care unit (ICU) as a control system with inputs (patients) and outputs (outcomes), we focus on actuation (therapies) of the system and how to enhance our understanding of status of patients and their trajectory in the ICU. To incorporate the results of these analytics meaningfully, we feel that a reassessment of predictive scoring systems and of ways to optimally characterize and display the patient's ""state space"" to clinicians is important. Advances in sensing (diagnostics) and computation have not yet led to significantly better actuation, and so we focus on ways that data can be used to improve actuation in the ICU, in particular by following therapeutic burden along with disease severity. This article is meant to encourage discussion about how the critical care community can best deal with the data they see each day, and prepare for recommendations that will inevitably arise from application of major federal and state initiatives in big data analytics and precision medicine.",2016,10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.05.002,35,NA,90-95,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,"Risk and United States and Risk analysis and Humans and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Critical Care/*standards and APACHE and *Critical Pathways and *Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Intensive Care Units/standards and Predictive monitoring and Risk stratification and Systemic inflammation and Therapeutic load",NA,NA,2016/10//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

He_2020_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Early Sepsis Prediction Using Ensemble Learning With Deep Features and Artificial Features Extracted From Clinical Electronic Health Records,"He, Zhengling and Du, Lidong and Zhang, Pengfei and Zhao, Rongjian and Chen, Xianxiang and Fang, Zhen",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is caused by infection and subsequent overreaction of immune system and will severely threaten human life. The early prediction is important for the treatment of sepsis. This report aims to develop an early prediction method for sepsis 6 hours ahead on the basis of clinical electronic health records. DATA SOURCES: Challenge data are released by PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 and obtained from ICU patients in three separate hospital systems. Part of the data from two datasets, including 40,336 subjects, are publicly available, and the remaining are used as hidden test set. A normalized utility score defined by the organizing committee is used for model performance evaluation. STUDY SELECTION: The supervised machine learning is applied to tackle this challenge. Specifically, we establish the prediction model under the framework of ensemble learning by integrating the artificial features based on clinical prior knowledge of sepsis with deep features automatically extracted by long short-term memory neural network. DATA EXTRACTION: Forty clinical variables, including eight vital signs, 26 laboratory values, and six demographics, were measured and recorded once an hour for each individual, and the binary label (0 or 1) was simultaneously provided for each item. DATA SYNTHESIS: The proposed model was evaluated by 30-fold cross-validation. The sensitivity, specificity, and normalized utility score were 0.641 <c2><b1> 0.022, 0.844 <c2><b1> 0.007, and 0.401 <c2><b1> 0.019 on publicly available datasets, respectively. The final normalized utility score our team (UCAS_DataMiner) has obtained was 0.313 on full hidden test set (0.406, 0.373, and -0.215 on test set A, B, and C, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We realized a 6-hour ahead early-onset prediction of sepsis on the basis of clinical electronic health record by ensemble learning. The results indicated the proposed model functioned well in the early prediction of sepsis. In particular, ensemble learning had a significant (p < 0.01) improvement than any single model in performance.",2020,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004644,48,12,e1337-e1342,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Reproducibility of Results and Artificial Intelligence and Early Diagnosis and Supervised Machine Learning and Neural Networks, Computer and Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data and *Deep Learning and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and Sepsis/*diagnosis/etiology",NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shillan_2019_Critcare.LonEngl,JOUR,Use of machine learning to analyse routinely collected intensive care unit data: a systematic review,"Shillan, Duncan and Sterne, Jonathan A. C. and Champneys, Alan and Gibbison, Ben","Critical care (London, England)","BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) face financial, bed management, and staffing constraints. Detailed data covering all aspects of patients' journeys into and through intensive care are now collected and stored in electronic health records: machine learning has been used to analyse such data in order to provide decision support to clinicians. METHODS: Systematic review of the applications of machine learning to routinely collected ICU data. Web of Science and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify candidate articles: those on image processing were excluded. The study aim, the type of machine learning used, the size of dataset analysed, whether and how the model was validated, and measures of predictive accuracy were extracted. RESULTS: Of 2450 papers identified, 258 fulfilled eligibility criteria. The most common study aims were predicting complications (77 papers [29.8% of studies]), predicting mortality (70 [27.1%]), improving prognostic models (43 [16.7%]), and classifying sub-populations (29 [11.2%]). Median sample size was 488 (IQR 108-4099): 41 studies analysed data on > 10,000 patients. Analyses focused on 169 (65.5%) papers that used machine learning to predict complications, mortality, length of stay, or improvement of health. Predictions were validated in 161 (95.2%) of these studies: the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was reported by 97 (60.2%) but only 10 (6.2%) validated predictions using independent data. The median AUC was 0.83 in studies of 1000-10,000 patients, rising to 0.94 in studies of > 100,000 patients. The most common machine learning methods were neural networks (72 studies [42.6%]), support vector machines (40 [23.7%]), and classification/decision trees (34 [20.1%]). Since 2015 (125 studies [48.4%]), the most common methods were support vector machines (37 studies [29.6%]) and random forests (29 [23.2%]). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of publication of studies using machine learning to analyse routinely collected ICU data is increasing rapidly. The sample sizes used in many published studies are too small to exploit the potential of these methods. Methodological and reporting guidelines are needed, particularly with regard to the choice of method and validation of predictions, to increase confidence in reported findings and aid in translating findings towards routine use in clinical practice.",2019,10.1186/s13054-019-2564-9,23,1,284,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,Machine learning and Artificial intelligence and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Female and Male and Adult and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and Data Analysis and Intensive care unit and Machine Learning/*standards/trends and Routinely collected data,NA,NA,2019/08/22/,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cho_2020_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Detecting Patient Deterioration Using Artificial Intelligence in a Rapid Response System,"Cho, Kyung-Jae and Kwon, Oyeon and Kwon, Joon-Myoung and Lee, Yeha and Park, Hyunho and Jeon, Ki-Hyun and Kim, Kyung-Hee and Park, Jinsik and Oh, Byung-Hee",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: As the performance of a conventional track and trigger system in a rapid response system has been unsatisfactory, we developed and implemented an artificial intelligence for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest, denoted the deep learning-based early warning system. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of an artificial intelligence-based early warning system with that of conventional methods in a real hospital situation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study was conducted at a hospital in which deep learning-based early warning system was implemented. PATIENTS: We reviewed the records of adult patients who were admitted to the general ward of our hospital from April 2018 to March 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The study population included 8,039 adult patients. A total 83 events of deterioration occurred during the study period. The outcome was events of deterioration, defined as cardiac arrest and unexpected ICU admission. We defined a true alarm as an alarm occurring within 0.5-24 hours before a deteriorating event. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve, number needed to examine, and mean alarm count per day as comparative measures. The deep learning-based early warning system (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.865; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.066) outperformed the modified early warning score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.682; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.010) and reduced the number needed to examine and mean alarm count per day by 69.2% and 59.6%, respectively. At the same specificity, deep learning-based early warning system had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. CONCLUSIONS: The developed artificial intelligence based on deep-learning, deep learning-based early warning system, accurately predicted deterioration of patients in a general ward and outperformed conventional methods. This study showed the potential and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in an rapid response system, which can be applied together with electronic health records.

Zador_2019_Critcare.LonEngl,JOUR,Multimorbidity states associated with higher mortality rates in organ dysfunction and sepsis: a data-driven analysis in critical care,"Zador, Zsolt and Landry, Alexander and Cusimano, Michael D. and Geifman, Nophar","Critical care (London, England)","BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a complex medical problem and a major challenge in healthcare. Diagnostics and outcome predictions are focused on physiological parameters with less consideration given to patients' medical background. Given the aging population, not only are diseases becoming increasingly prevalent but occur more frequently in combinations (""multimorbidity""). We hypothesized the existence of patient subgroups in critical care with distinct multimorbidity states. We further hypothesize that certain multimorbidity states associate with higher rates of organ failure, sepsis, and mortality co-occurring with these clinical problems. METHODS: We analyzed 36,390 patients from the open source Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. Morbidities were defined based on Elixhauser categories, a well-established scheme distinguishing 30 classes of chronic diseases. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patient subgroups based on demographics, admission type, and morbidity compositions and compared the prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and inpatient mortality for each subgroup. RESULTS: We identified six clinically distinct multimorbidity subgroups labeled based on their dominant Elixhauser disease classes. The ""cardiopulmonary"" and ""cardiac"" subgroups consisted of older patients with a high prevalence of cardiopulmonary conditions and constituted 6.1% and 26.4% of study cohort respectively. The ""young"" subgroup included 23.5% of the cohort composed of young and healthy patients. The ""hepatic/addiction"" subgroup, constituting 9.8% of the cohort, consisted of middle-aged patients (mean age of 52.25, 95% CI 51.85-52.65) with the high rates of depression (20.1%), alcohol abuse (47.75%), drug abuse (18.2%), and liver failure (67%). The ""complicated diabetics"" and ""uncomplicated diabetics"" subgroups constituted 9.4% and 24.8% of the study cohort respectively. The complicated diabetics subgroup demonstrated higher rates of end-organ complications (88.3% prevalence of renal failure). Rates of organ dysfunction and sepsis ranged 19.6-69% and 12.5-46.7% respectively in the six subgroups. Mortality co-occurring with organ dysfunction and sepsis ranges was 8.4-23.8% and 11.7-27.4% respectively. These adverse outcomes were most prevalent in the hepatic/addiction subgroup. CONCLUSION: We identify distinct multimorbidity states that associate with relatively higher prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and co-occurring mortality. The findings promote the incorporation of multimorbidity in healthcare models and the shift away from the current single-disease paradigm in clinical practice, training, and trial design.",2019,10.1186/s13054-019-2486-6,23,1,247,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Cohort Studies and Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction Scores and Data analytics and Multimorbidity and Critical Care/methods/trends and Latent class analysis and Multimorbidity/*trends and Multiple Organ Failure and Sepsis/*complications/*mortality,NA,NA,2019/07/08/,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Delahanty_2018_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Development and Evaluation of an Automated Machine Learning Algorithm for In-Hospital Mortality Risk Adjustment Among Critical Care Patients,"Delahanty, Ryan J. and Kaufman, David and Jones, Spencer S.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Risk adjustment algorithms for ICU mortality are necessary for measuring and improving ICU performance. Existing risk adjustment algorithms are not widely adopted. Key barriers to adoption include licensing and implementation costs as well as labor costs associated with human-intensive data collection. Widespread adoption of electronic health records makes automated risk adjustment feasible. Using modern machine learning methods and open source tools, we developed and evaluated a retrospective risk adjustment algorithm for in-hospital mortality among ICU patients. The Risk of Inpatient Death score can be fully automated and is reliant upon data elements that are generated in the course of usual hospital processes. SETTING: One hundred thirty-one ICUs in 53 hospitals operated by Tenet Healthcare. PATIENTS: A cohort of 237,173 ICU patients discharged between January 2014 and December 2016. DESIGN: The data were randomly split into training (36 hospitals), and validation (17 hospitals) data sets. Feature selection and model training were carried out using the training set while the discrimination, calibration, and accuracy of the model were assessed in the validation data set. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Model discrimination was evaluated based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve; accuracy and calibration were assessed via adjusted Brier scores and visual analysis of calibration curves. Seventeen features, including a mix of clinical and administrative data elements, were retained in the final model. The Risk of Inpatient Death score demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.94) and calibration (adjusted Brier score = 52.8%) in the validation dataset; these results compare favorably to the published performance statistics for the most commonly used mortality risk adjustment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Low adoption of ICU mortality risk adjustment algorithms impedes progress toward increasing the value of the healthcare delivered in ICUs. The Risk of Inpatient Death score has many attractive attributes that address the key barriers to adoption of ICU risk adjustment algorithms and performs comparably to existing human-intensive algorithms. Automated risk adjustment algorithms have the potential to obviate known barriers to adoption such as cost-prohibitive licensing fees and significant direct labor costs. Further evaluation is needed to ensure that the level of performance observed in this study could be achieved at independent sites.",2018,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003011,46,6,e481-e488,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Hospital Mortality and Algorithms and Models, Statistical and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and *Unsupervised Machine Learning and Risk Adjustment/methods",NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johnson_2013_Critcaremedi,JOUR,A new severity of illness scale using a subset of Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation data elements shows comparable predictive accuracy,"Johnson, Alistair E. W. and Kramer, Andrew A. and Clifford, Gari D.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Severity of illness scores have gained considerable interest for their use in predicting outcomes such as mortality and length of stay. The most sophisticated scoring systems require the collection of numerous physiologic measurements, making their use in real-time difficult. A severity of illness score based on a few parameters that can be captured electronically would be of great benefit. Using a machine-learning technique known as particle swarm optimization, we attempted to reduce the number of physiologic parameters collected in the Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation IV system without losing predictive accuracy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of ICU admissions from 2007 to 2011. SETTING: Eighty-six ICUs at 49 U.S. hospitals where an Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation IV system had been installed. PATIENTS: 81,087 admissions, of which 72,474 did not have any missing values. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Machine-learning algorithms were used to come up with the minimal set of variables that were capable of yielding an accurate severity of illness score: the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score. Predictive models of ICU mortality using Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score were developed on admissions during 2007-2009 and validated on admissions during 2010-2011. The most parsimonious Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score consisted of seven physiologic measurements, elective surgery, age, and prior length of stay. Predictive models of ICU mortality using Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and calibrated well. CONCLUSIONS: A reduced severity of illness score had discrimination and calibration equivalent to more complex existing models. This was accomplished in large part using machine-learning algorithms, which can effectively account for the nonlinear associations between physiologic parameters and outcome.",2013,10.1097/CCM.0b013e31828a24fe,41,7,1711-1718,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Chronic Disease and Sensitivity and Specificity and Artificial Intelligence and ROC Curve and Racial Groups and Length of Stay and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and APACHE and *Health Status Indicators,NA,NA,2013/07//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable.

METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted in Russia from 2010 to 2017, and included high-risk neuro-ICU patients. We utilized relative risk analysis, regressions, and ML to identify factors associated with HAVM development. RESULTS: 2286 patients of all ages were included, 216 of them had HAVM. The cumulative incidence of HAVM was 9.45% [95% CI 8.25-10.65]. The incidence of EVD-associated HAVM was 17.2 per 1000 EVD-days or 4.3% [95% CI 3.47-5.13] per 100 patients. Combining all three methods, we selected four important factors contributing to HAVM development: EVD, craniotomy, superficial surgical site infections after neurosurgery, and CSF leakage. The ML models performed better than regressions. CONCLUSION: We first reported HAVM incidence in a neuro-ICU in Russia. We showed that tree-based ML is an effective approach to study risk factors because it enables the identification of nonlinear interaction across factors.

METHODS: The questionnaire was developed on the basis of a theoretical framework and discussion with ICU staff. It was pretested among 15 ICU nurses and physicians. A field test was conducted in 4 interdisciplinary ICUs of one university hospital Descriptive item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and reliability and validity analysis were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 174 of 284 ICU staff participated in the field test (61% response). Factor analysis indicated a 7-factor solution: (1) collaboration in the EOL context, (2) role clarity in the EOL context, (3) work-related interruptions of communication with families, (4) emotional support, (5) stress by involvement in EOL decision making and communication with families, (6) stress by work overload, and (7) taking initiative toward EOL decision making. Internal consistency of the scales was acceptable (range, 0.69-0.85). Construct validity was shown by relationships of the scales to several constructs, for example, satisfaction with EOL decision making and emotional exhaustion.

However, few have been studied in an intensive care unit setting. The objectives of this study were to develop a Web-based decision aid for family members of patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation and to evaluate its usability and acceptability. METHODS: Using an iterative process involving 48 critical illness survivors, family surrogate decision makers, and intensivists, we developed a Web-based decision aid addressing goals of care preferences for surrogate decision makers of patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation that could be either administered by study staff or completed independently by family members (Development Phase). After piloting the decision aid among 13 surrogate decision makers and seven intensivists, we assessed the decision aid's usability in the Evaluation Phase among a cohort of 30 surrogate decision makers using the Systems Usability Scale (SUS). Acceptability was assessed using measures of satisfaction and preference for electronic Collaborative Decision Support (eCODES) versus the original printed decision aid. RESULTS: The final decision aid, termed 'electronic Collaborative Decision Support', provides a framework for shared decision making, elicits relevant values and preferences, incorporates clinical data to personalize prognostic estimates generated from the ProVent prediction model, generates a printable document summarizing the user's interaction with the decision aid, and can digitally archive each user session. Usability was excellent (mean SUS, 80 <c2><b1> 10) overall, but lower among those 56 years and older (73 <c2><b1> 7) versus those who were younger (84 <c2><b1> 9); p = 0.03.

In the past decades, there has been a marked increase in overall survival of children with cancer. However, children whose treatment includes hematopoietic stem cell transplantation still represent a subpopulation with a higher risk of mortality. These improvements in mortality are accompanied by an increase in complications, such as respiratory and cardiovascular insufficiencies as well as neurological problems that may require an admission to the pediatric intensive care unit where most supportive therapies can be provided. It has been shown that ventilatory and cardiovascular support along with renal replacement therapy can benefit pediatric hemato-oncology patients if promptly established. Even if admissions of these patients are not considered futile anymore, they still raise sensitive questions, including ethical issues. To support the discussion and potentially facilitate the decision-making process, we propose an algorithm that takes into account the reason for admission (surgical versus medical) and the hemato-oncological prognosis. The algorithm then leads to different types of admission: full-support admission, ""pediatric intensive care unit trial"" admission, intensive care with adapted level of support, and palliative intensive care. Throughout the process, maintaining a dialogue between the treating physicians, the paramedical staff, the child, and his parents is of paramount importance to optimize the care of these children with complex disease and evolving medical status.",2012,10.1186/2110-5820-2-14,2,1,14,eng,2110-5820,NA,NA,NA,2012/06/12/,Ann Intensive Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and May, Addison K. and Waitman, Lemuel R. and Ozdas, Asli and Gadd, Cynthia S.",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for intensive insulin therapy (IIT) generate recommendations using blood glucose (BG) values manually transcribed from testing devices to computers, a potential source of error. We quantified the frequency and effect of blood glucose transcription mismatches on IIT protocol performance. METHODS: We examined 38 months of retrospective data for patients treated with CDSS IIT in two intensive care units at one teaching hospital. A manually transcribed BG value not equal to a corresponding device value was deemed mismatched. For mismatches we recalculated CDSS recommendations using device BG values. We compared matched and mismatched data in terms of CDSS alerts, blood glucose variability, and dosing. RESULTS: Of 189,499 CDSS IIT instances, 5.3% contained mismatched BG values. Mismatched data triggered 93 false alerts and failed to issue 170 alerts for nurses to notify physicians. Four of six BG variability measures differed between matched and mismatched data. Overall insulin dose was greater for matched than mismatched [matched 3.8 (1.6-6.0), median (interquartile range, IQR), versus 3.6 (1.6-5.7); p < 0.001], but recalculated and actual dose were similar. In mismatches preceding hypoglycemia, recalculated insulin dose was significantly lower than actual dose [recalculated 2.7 (0.4-5.0), median (IQR), versus 3.5 (1.4-5.6)]. In mismatches preceding hyperglycemia, recalculated insulin dose was significantly greater than actual dose [recalculated 4.7 (3.3-6.2), median (IQR), versus 3.3 (2.4-4.3); p < 0.001].

METHODS: A public online, non-profit database of the Federation of Law Societies of Canada was searched for relevant Consent and Capacity Board decisions from 2003 to 2012. In total, 1486 cases were collected, and purposive sampling identified a total of 29 decisions regarding use of life-sustaining treatments at end of life. Using modified grounded theory, decisions were read and analyzed from a central SoC concept to understand definitions of benefit, rationales for case adjudication, and repercussions of legal recourse in conflict resolution. RESULTS: Medical benefit was clearly defined, and its role in determining SoC, transparent. Perceptions of variability in SoC were enhanced by physicians in intractable conflicts seeking legal validation by framing SoC issues as ""best interest"" determinations. The results reveal some key problems in recourse to the Consent and Capacity Board for clinicians, patients and substitute decision makers in such conflict situations.

RESULTS: The response rate was 53%. Of all respondents, 91% reported being confronted with the topic at least once a month. Although all reported limiting cardiopulmonary resuscitation, almost no one reported limiting artificial hydration. Half of nurses and junior physicians felt uncertain about the decision-making process. Junior physicians were most dissatisfied with their training for this task and expressed the highest fear of litigation. Nurses were less satisfied than physicians with the communication process. Both nurses and relatives were not routinely involved in decision making. There is no standardized documentation practice, and many notes are not readily accessible to nurses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Speakers from invited faculty of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine Congress that took place in Durban (2013), with an interest in ethics, were approached to participate in an ethics round table. Key domains of health care professional end-of-life decision making were defined, explored by discussion, and then questions related to current practice and opinion developed and subsequently answered by round-table participants to establish the presence or absence of agreement. RESULTS: Agreement was established for the desirability for early goal-of-care discussions and discussions between health care professionals to establish health care provider consensus and confirmation of the grounds for WH/WD, before holding formal WH/WD discussions with patients/surrogates. Nurse and other health care professional involvement were common in most but not all countries/regions.

A position paper outlining critical care pharmacist activities was last published in 2000. Since that time, significant changes in healthcare and critical care have occurred. DESIGN: The Society of Critical Care Medicine, American College of Clinical Pharmacy Critical Care Practice and Research Network, and the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists convened a joint task force of 15 pharmacists representing a broad cross-section of critical care pharmacy practice and pharmacy administration, inclusive of geography, critical care practice setting, and roles. The Task Force chairs reviewed and organized primary literature, outlined topic domains, and prepared the methodology for group review and consensus. A modified Delphi method was used until consensus (> 66% agreement) was reached for each practice recommendation. Previous position statement recommendations were reviewed and voted to either retain, revise, or retire. Recommendations were categorized by level of ICU service to be applicable by setting and grouped into five domains: patient care, quality improvement, research and scholarship, training and education, and professional development. MAIN RESULTS: There are 82 recommendation statements: 44 original recommendations and 38 new recommendation statements. Thirty-four recommendations represent the domain of patient care, primarily relating to critical care pharmacist duties and pharmacy services. In the quality improvement domain, 21 recommendations address the role of the critical care pharmacist in patient and medication safety, clinical quality programs, and analytics. Nine recommendations were made in the domain of research and scholarship. Ten recommendations were made in the domain of training and education and eight recommendations regarding professional development. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care pharmacists are essential members of the multiprofessional critical care team. The statements recommended by this taskforce delineate the activities of a critical care pharmacist and the scope of pharmacy services within the ICU.

METHODS: The study was undertaken on medical patients admitted to a specialist cancer hospital ICU over 6 months. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to explore quality of transition to EOLC using documentary evidence. Clinical parameters on ICU admission were reviewed to determine if they could be used to identify patients who were likely to transition to EOLC during their ICU stay. RESULTS: Of 85 patients, 44.7% transitioned to EOLC during their ICU stay. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the patients' records demonstrated that there was collaborative decision-making between teams, patients and families during transition to EOLC. However, 51.4 and 40.5% of patients were too unwell to discuss transition to EOLC and DNACPR respectively. In the EOLC cohort, 76.3% died in ICU, but preferred place of death known in only 10%.

Regardless, the workflow of every physician team in every academic medical centre has been irrevocably altered. We explored the use of cognitive task analysis (CTA) techniques, most commonly used in other high-stress and time-sensitive environments, to analyse key cognitive activities in critical care medicine. The study objective was to assess the usefulness of CTA as an analytical tool in order that physician cognitive tasks may be understood and redistributed within the work-hour limited medical decision-making teams. METHODS: After approval from each Institutional Review Board, two intensive care units (ICUs) within major university teaching hospitals served as data collection sites for CTA observations and interviews of critical care providers. RESULTS: Five broad categories of cognitive activities were identified: pattern recognition; uncertainty management; strategic vs. tactical thinking; team coordination and maintenance of common ground; and creation and transfer of meaning through stories. CONCLUSIONS: CTA within the framework of Naturalistic Decision Making is a useful tool to understand the critical care process of decision-making and communication. The separation of strategic and tactical thinking has implications for workflow redesign. Given the global push for work-hour limitations, such workflow redesign is occurring.

Clark and Gower, Emily and Young, Michael",Journal of critical care,"INTRODUCTION: Family members of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit face significant morbidity. It may be the decision-making process that plays a significant role in the psychological morbidity associated with being a surrogate in the ICU. We hypothesize that family members facing end-of-life decisions will have more decisional conflict and decisional regret than those facing non-end-of-life decisions. METHODS: We enrolled a sample of adult patients and their surrogates in a tertiary care, academic medical intensive care unit. We queried the surrogates regarding decisions they had made on behalf of the patient and assessed decision conflict. We then contacted the family member again to assess decision regret. RESULTS: Forty (95%) of 42 surrogates were able to identify at least 1 decision they had made on behalf of the patient. End-of-life decisions (defined as do not resuscitate [DNR]/do not intubate [DNI] or continuation of life support) accounted for 19 of 40 decisions (47.5%). Overall, the average Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) score was 21.9 of 100 (range 0-100, with 0 being little decisional conflict and 100 being great decisional conflict). The average DCS score for families facing end-of-life decisions was 25.5 compared with 18.7 for all other decisions. Those facing end-of-life decisions scored higher on the uncertainty subscale (subset of DCS questions that indicates level of certainty regarding decision) with a mean score of 43.4 compared with all other decisions with a mean score of 27.0. Overall, very few surrogates experienced decisional regret with an average DRS score of 13.4 of 100. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all surrogates enrolled were faced with decision-making responsibilities on behalf of his or her critically ill family member. In our small pilot study, we found more decisional conflict in those surrogates facing end-of-life decisions, specifically on the subset of questions dealing with uncertainty.

Perren and Rosand, Jonathan",Journal of critical care,"PURPOSE: We hypothesize that intensive care unit (ICU) families frequently perceive that they have received inconsistent information from staff about their relatives and that these inconsistencies influence abilities to make medical decisions, as well as satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in the neurosciences and medical ICU at a university hospital. One hundred twenty-four family members of adult patients surviving to ICU discharge completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions of inconsistent information. RESULTS: Of 193 eligible patients, 64.2% had family complete the survey. Thirty-one respondents (25.0%; 95% confidence interval, 7.7) reported at least 1 instance of inconsistent information during their family member's admission, with no difference between the neurosciences ICU (21.5%; 9.3) and the medical ICU (31.1%; 14.1; P = .28). Of those who did receive inconsistent information, 38.7% (95% confidence interval, 18.2) reported multiple episodes and 74.2% (16.3) indicated that episodes occurred within the first 48 hours of admission. These episodes had an adverse effect, with 19.4% (14.7) indicating that they affected satisfaction and 9.7% (11.0) indicating that they made decision making difficult.

We sought to understand how these perceptions and experiences have changed in the past decade because both medical education and American society have focused more on this domain. METHOD: We surveyed 2 internal medicine resident cohorts at a large academic medical center in 1995 and 2005. Residents were asked of their beliefs about survival after CPR, perceived patient understanding, and regret after attempted resuscitation. Residents in 2005 reported more numerical experience with CPR. Current internal medicine residents are more optimistic than the 1995 cohort about survival after an inpatient cardiac arrest. They believe that far fewer patients and families understand resuscitation but report less regret about attempting to resuscitate patients. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data reveal potential changes in the attitudes of resident physicians toward CPR. The perceived poor understanding among decision makers calls into question the standard of informed consent. Despite this, residents report less regret leading one to ask what factors may underlie this response.",2009,10.1016/j.jcrc.2007.12.012,24,1,141-144,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Kentucky and Decision Making and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Patient Education as Topic and Survival Rate and Academic Medical Centers and Informed Consent and Advance Care Planning and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Family/psychology and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/education/mortality/statistics & numerical data/trends and *Internal Medicine/education/trends and Heart Arrest/mortality/*therapy and Internship and Residency/*trends and Medical Staff, Hospital/education/*psychology/trends",NA,NA,2009/03//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lesieur_2015_Anofinca,JOUR,Withholding or withdrawal of treatment under French rules: a study performed in 43 intensive care units,"Lesieur, Olivier and Leloup, Maxime and Gonzalez, Frederic and Mamzer, Marie-France",Annals of intensive care,"BACKGROUND: In France, decisions to limit treatment fall under the Leonetti law adopted in 2005. Leading figures from the French world of politics, science, and justice recently claimed for amendments to the law, considering it incomplete. This study, conducted before any legislative change, aimed to investigate the procedural aspects of withholding/withdrawing treatment in French ICUs and their adequacy with the existing law. METHODS: The characteristics of patients qualified for a withholding/withdrawal procedure were prospectively collected in 43 French ICUs. The study period (60 or 90 days under normal operating conditions) took place in the first half of 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, 777 (14 %) of 5589 admitted patients and 584 (52 %) of 1132 patients dying in the ICU had their treatment withheld or withdrawn. Whereas 344 patients had treatment(s) withheld (i.e., not started or not increased if already engaged), 433 had one or more treatment(s) withdrawn. Withdrawal of treatment was applied in 156 of 223 (70 %) brain-injured patients, compared to 277 of 554 (50 %) patients with other reasons for admission (p < 0.01). At the time of the decision-making, the patient's wishes were known in 181 (23 %) of the 777 cases in one or more different way(s): 73 (9.4 %) from the patient, 10 (1.3 %) by advance directives, 10 (1.3 %) through a designated trusted person, and 108 (13.9 %) reported by the family or close relatives. An external consultant was involved in less than half of all decisions (356 of 777, 46 %). Of the 777 patients qualified for a withholding/withdrawal procedure, 133 (17 %) were discharged alive from the hospital (126 after withholding, 7 after withdrawal). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of deaths in the study population occurred after a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment. Among patients under withholding/withdrawal procedures, brain-injured subjects were more likely to undergo a withdrawal procedure. The prevalence of advance directives and designated trusted persons was low. Because patients' preferences were unknown in more than three quarters of cases, decisions remained primarily based on medical judgment. Limitations, especially withholding of treatment, did not preclude survival and hospital discharge.",2015,10.1186/s13613-015-0056-x,5,1,56,eng,2110-5820,NA,NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,Ann Intensive Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Second, they were hospitalized in intensive care unit at our institution between 2006 and 2014. The ""criterion standard"" for diagnosis was formal cognitive evaluation supplemented by input from an expert neurologist. Using all available EMR data, we developed and improved our algorithms in the derivation cohort and validated them in the independent validation cohort. RESULTS: Of 993 participants who underwent formal cognitive testing and were hospitalized in intensive care unit, we selected 151 participants at random to form the derivation and validation cohorts. The automated electronic search algorithm for cognitive impairment was 94.3% sensitive and 93.0% specific. The search algorithms for dementia achieved respective sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 99%. EMR search algorithms significantly outperformed International Classification of Diseases codes.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of ICU family members and providers of patients admitted to 4 medical-surgical ICUs from September 2014 to March 2015. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 63 (62%) family members and 258 (43%) providers. Provider respondents included physicians (9%), nurses (56%), respiratory therapists (24%), and other ICU team members (11%). Although 38% of providers estimated only moderate family member interest in participating in rounds, 97% of family members expressed high interest. Family members and providers reported listening (95% vs 96%; P=.594) and sharing information about the patient (82% vs 82%; P=.995) as appropriate roles for family members during rounds, but differed in their perceptions on asking questions (75% vs 86%; P=.043) and participating in decision making (36% vs 59%; P=.003).

The main objectives of the study were to assess how the presence of relatives is viewed by patients, health care providers, and relatives themselves and to evaluate the perception of the level of intrusiveness into the personal sphere during admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a longitudinal and prospective design, qualitative questionnaires were submitted concomitantly to patients, relatives, and health care providers consecutively over a 6-month period. The study was conducted in the 4 ICUs of the public hospitals of Canton Ticino (Switzerland).

Accordingly, the present study applies machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy for this patient subset. METHODS: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results. RESULTS: For the ICU mortality, the random forest model showed the highest AUC (0.784 [0.744-0.825]), and the artificial neural network and extreme gradient boost models demonstrated the next best results (0.776 [0.735-0.818]). The AUC of the random forest model was higher than 0.611 (0.583-0.640), 0.677 (0.651-0.703), and 0.722 (0.677-0.767), as achieved by APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC, respectively.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 168 features were extracted on hourly basis. Explainable artificial intelligence sepsis predictor model was trained to predict sepsis in real time. Impact of each feature on hourly sepsis prediction was explored in-depth to show the interpretability. The algorithm demonstrated the final clinical utility score of 0.364 in this challenge when tested on the full hidden test sets, and the scores on three separate test sets were 0.430, 0.422, and -0.048, respectively.

We analyzed transcripts to develop a coding framework for whether and how trials were discussed. RESULTS: Trials were offered in 15% of conferences. We identified 2 types: (1) time-limited trials, defined as continuing all intensive, life-sustaining treatments, with a plan to reassess after a defined time period based on prespecified clinical milestones, and (2) symptom-limited trials, defined as using basic medical care aimed at survival (rather than purely comfort-focused treatment) once ventilatory support is withdrawn, with a plan to reassess based on patient symptoms. Clinicians frequently did not inform surrogates about key elements of the trial such as criteria by which the effectiveness of the trial would be evaluated and possible next steps based on trial results.

We can expect that conflicts are even more likely to arise in situations where difficult medical decisions have to be made, such as critical medical situations in hospital. However, in-depth research on this topic is rather scarce. During critical care patients are often unable to communicate. We have therefore investigated factors contributing to conflicts between healthcare professionals and family members from ethnic minority groups in critical medical situations in hospital. METHODS: Ethnographic fieldwork was done in one intensive care unit of a multi-ethnic urban hospital in Belgium over 6 months (January 2014 to June 2014). Data were collected through negotiated interactive observation, in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals, from patients' medical records, and by making notes in a logbook. Data were analysed by using grounded theory procedures. RESULTS: Conflicts were essentially related to differences in participants' views on what constitutes 'good care' based on different care approaches. Healthcare professionals' views on good care were based predominantly on a biomedical care model, whereas families' views on good care were mainly inspired by a holistic lifeworld-oriented approach. Giving good care, from the healthcare professionals' point of view, included great attention to regulations, structured communication, and central decision making. On the other hand, good care from the families' point of view included seeking exhaustive information, and participating in end-of-life decision making. Healthcare professionals' biomedical views on offering good care were strengthened by the features of the critical care context whereas families' holistic views on offering good care were reinforced by the specific characteristics of families' ethno-familial care context, including their different ethno-cultural backgrounds. However, ethno-cultural differences between participants only contributed to conflicts in confrontation with a triggering critical care context. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts cannot be exclusively linked to ethno-cultural differences as structural, functional characteristics of critical care substantially contribute to the development of conflicts. Therefore, effective conflict prevention should not only focus on ethno-cultural differentness but should also take the structural organizational characteristics of the critical care context sufficiently into account.",2015,10.1186/s13054-015-1158-4,19,NA,441,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Anthropology, Cultural and Cultural Diversity and *Intensive Care Units and Health Personnel/psychology and *Professional-Family Relations and *Communication Barriers and *Conflict, Psychological and Attitude of Health Personnel/*ethnology and Family/*ethnology/psychology",NA,NA,2015/12/22/,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gulcher_2016_Anofinca,JOUR,Elevated C-reactive protein levels at ICU discharge as a predictor of ICU outcome: a retrospective cohort study,"Gulcher, S. Sophie and Bruins, Nynke A. and Kingma, W. Peter and Boerma, E. Christiaan",Annals of intensive care,"BACKGROUND: Before discharging a patient from the ICU, an adequate patient evaluation is needed to detect individuals as high risk for unfavorable outcome. A pro- or anti-inflammatory status is a potential risk factor for an adverse outcome, and elevated CRP concentrations have shown to correlate with organ failure. Several studies have been performed to evaluate the use of CRP as a marker of post-ICU prognosis. Results are seemingly conflicting, and it is worthwhile to investigate these markers further as CRP is an adequate marker of pro- and anti-inflammatory status of the patient. We aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated CRP levels at ICU discharge are associated with an increased risk of ICU readmission and in-hospital mortality in patients with a prolonged ICU stay. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a single-center hospital with an 18-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU. Patients discharged alive from the ICU with at least 48-h ICU length of stay were evaluated. Patients were distributed into two groups: 'high CRP' (<e2><89><a5>75 mg/L) and 'low CRP' (<75 mg/L) at ICU discharge. We assessed the difference in adverse outcome (ICU readmission and/or in-hospital mortality) between these groups. RESULTS: A total of 998 patients were included. Compared to the 'low CRP' group, patients in the 'high CRP' group had a higher readmission rate (13.1 vs. 7.4 %; p = 0.003). The post-ICU mortality rate in the 'high CRP' group and 'low CRP' group was 6.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively; p = 0.127. Combined readmission and mortality rates were significantly higher in the 'high CRP' group in comparison with the 'low CRP' group (17.9 vs. 10.1 %; p = 0.001). Hospital mortality in patients readmitted to the ICU was significantly higher than in non-readmitted patients (20 vs. 4.3 %; p < 0.001). Strikingly, the 'high CRP' group had significantly lower APACHE II and SOFA scores at ICU admission compared to the 'low CRP' group. This highlights the potential for ICU-acquired risk factors, including CRP. CONCLUSIONS: A high CRP concentration (<e2><89><a5>75 mg/L) within 24 h before ICU discharge is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome post-ICU discharge. However, CRP at discharge represents only a very moderate risk factor and may not be used for individual clinical decision-making.",2016,10.1186/s13613-016-0105-0,6,1,5,eng,2110-5820,C-reactive protein and ICU discharge and Inflammatory markers and Outcome and Readmission,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,Ann Intensive Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to the patient's critical condition and continuous monitoring on the ICU, not all pDDIs are clinically relevant. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) warning for irrelevant pDDIs could result in alert fatigue and overlooking important signals. Therefore, our aim was to describe the frequency of clinically relevant pDDIs (crpDDIs) to enable tailoring of CDSSs to the ICU setting. MATERIALS & METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective observational study, we used medication administration data to identify pDDIs in ICU admissions from 13 ICUs. Clinical relevance was based on a Delphi study in which intensivists and hospital pharmacists assessed the clinical relevance of pDDIs for the ICU setting. RESULTS: The mean number of pDDIs per 1000 medication administrations was 70.1, dropping to 31.0 when considering only crpDDIs. Of 103,871 ICU patients, 38% was exposed to a crpDDI. The most frequently occurring crpDDIs involve QT-prolonging agents, digoxin, or NSAIDs. CONCLUSIONS: Considering clinical relevance of pDDIs in the ICU setting is important, as only half of the detected pDDIs were crpDDIs. Therefore, tailoring CDSSs to the ICU may reduce alert fatigue and improve medication safety in ICU patients.",2021,10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.11.020,62,NA,124-130,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,Patient safety and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Pharmacoepidemiology and Intensive Care Units and *Pharmaceutical Preparations and Medication safety and Drug Interactions and Clinical decision support and *Critical Care and Intensive care and Drug-drug interactions,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some IMCU patients deteriorate and require medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission. In 2012, staff in the Johns Hopkins IMCU expressed concern that patient acuity and the threshold for MICU admission were too high. Further, shared triage decision-making between residents and supervising physicians did not consistently occur. METHODS: To improve our triage process, we used a 4Es quality improvement framework (engage, educate, execute, evaluate) to (1) educate residents and fellows regarding principles of triage and (2) facilitate real-time communication between MICU residents conducting triage and supervising physicians. RESULTS: Among patients transferred from the IMCU to the MICU during baseline (n=83;July-December 2012) and intervention phases (n=94;July-December 2013), unadjusted mortality decreased from 34% to 21% (p=0.06). After adjusting for severity of illness, admitting diagnosis, and bed availability, the odds of death were lower during the intervention vs. baseline phase (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.11-0.98).

METHODS: We conducted a 4-week mixed methods case study at each AMC in 2008-2009 involving direct observation of patient care during rounds in the main medical ICU, semi-structured interviews with staff, patients, and families, and collection of artifacts (e.g., patient lists, standardized forms). We compared patterns of decision making regarding initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of LST using tests of proportions and grounded theory analysis of field note and interview transcripts. RESULTS: We observed 80 patients [26 (32.5 %) <e2><89><a5>65 years old] staffed by 4 attendings, and interviewed 23 staff and 3 patients/families at the low-intensity AMC (LI-AMC), and observed 73 patients [26 (35.6 %) <e2><89><a5>65 years old] staffed by 4 attending physicians and interviewed 26 staff and 4 patients/families at the high-intensity AMC (HI-AMC). LST initiation among patients over 65 was similar, except feeding tubes (0 % LI-AMC versus 31 % HI-AMC, p = 0.002). The LI-AMC was more likely to use a time-limited trial of LST, followed by withdrawal (27 vs. 8 %, p = 0.01) and to have a known outcome of death (31 vs. 4 %, p < 0.001). We identified qualitative differences in goals of LST, the determination of ""dying,"" concern about harms of commission versus omission, and physician self-efficacy for LST decision making.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the burden of psychological trauma experienced by patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) as perceived by clinicians to assess factors that can impede its recognition and treatment in the ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two distinct role-specific Web-based surveys were administered to critical care physicians and nurses in medical and surgical ICUs of 2 academic medical centers. Responses were analyzed in the domains of psychological trauma, exacerbating/mitigating factors, and provider-patient communication. RESULTS: A survey was completed by 43 physicians and 55 nurses with a response rate of 62% and 37%, respectively. Among physicians, 65% consistently consider the psychological state of the patient in decision making; 77% think it is important to introduce a system to document psychological state of ICU patients; 56% would like to have more time to communicate with patients; 77% consistently spend extra time at bedside besides rounds and often hold patient's hand/reassure them. Notably, for the question about the average level of psychological stress experienced by a patient in the ICU (with 0=no stress and 100=worst stress imaginable) during initial treatment stage and by the end of the ICU stay, median assessment by both physicians and nurses was 80 for the initial stress level and 68 for the stress level by the end of the ICU stay. Among nurses, 69% always try to minimize noise and 73% actively promote patient's rest. Physicians and nurses provided multiple specific suggestions for improving ICU environment and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Both physicians and nurses acknowledge that they perceive that critically ill patients experience a high level of psychological stress that persists throughout their period of illness.

However, the number and types of decisions made by intensivists have not been well characterized. We sought to describe intensivist decision making and determine how the number and types of decisions are affected by patient, provider, and systems factors. DESIGN: Direct observation of intensivist decision making during patient rounds. SETTING: Twenty-four-bed academic medical ICU. SUBJECTS: Medical intensivists leading patient care rounds. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During 920 observed patient rounds on 374 unique patients, intensivists made 8,174 critical care decisions (mean, 8.9 decisions per patient daily, 102.2 total decisions daily) over a mean of 3.7 hours. Patient factors associated with increased numbers of decisions included a shorter time since ICU admission and an earlier slot in rounding order (both p < 0.05). Intensivist identity explained the greatest proportion of variance in number of decisions per patient even when controlling for all other factors significant in bivariable regression. A given intensivist made more decisions per patient during days later in the 14-day rotation (p < 0.05). Female intensivists made significantly more decisions than male intensivists (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intensivists made over 100 daily critical care decisions during rounds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered mail-based surveys to determine the respondents' probability of either requesting an ICU transfer (generalist respondents) or offering an ICU transfer (intensivist respondents). Respondents randomly received clinical vignettes that were identical except for the number of available ICU beds (one or seven available ICU beds). Respondents also made predictions about the patient's outcomes. RESULTS: Among generalists and intensivists, there were wide ranges in decisions about ICU transfer. In the Generalist ICU request study, the average probability of transfer with one versus seven available ICU beds was 52.2% and 58.5% (P = .41), respectively. In the Intensivist ICU offer study, the average probability of transfer with one versus seven available ICU beds was 62.5% and 57.4% (P = .24), respectively.

Although numerous RWD algorithms exist, accurate detection remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a novel fusion algorithm (Automated Electrocardiogram Selection of Peaks, or AESOP) that combines the strengths of several well-known algorithms to provide a more reliable real-time solution to the RWD problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved the ECGs of 108 prehospital patient records and 32 ECGs from a conscious sedated porcine model of hemorrhagic shock. The criterion standard for validation was manual verification of R waves. RESULTS: For 108 human ECG records, the AESOP algorithm overall outperformed each of its component algorithms. In addition, for 32 swine ECG records, AESOP achieved an R-wave sensitivity of 97.9% and a positive predictive value of 97.5%, again outperforming its component algorithms.

DESIGN: International, multicenter, retrospective study. SETTING: Five ICUs in France and Brazil, two located in cancer centers, two in university affiliated and one in general hospitals. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients aged > 18 years, with underlying solid cancers (known before admission to the ICU or diagnosed during the stay in the ICU), admitted to the participating ICUs and discharged alive from the ICU from January 2006 to December 2011 were included in this study. Patients admitted after scheduled surgery or to secure procedure were excluded. Variables of interest were in-hospital and day-120 post-ICU mortality among patients discharged alive from the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A total of 1053 patients aged 63 years (54-71) (median [IQR]) were included. Most of the patients were of the male gender (66.8%). The in-ICU, in-hospital, and four-month post-ICU discharge mortalities were, respectively, 41.3, 60.7, and 65.8%. Among patients discharged alive from the ICU, in multivariate analysis, factors associated with four months post-ICU discharge mortality were type of cancer (OR from 0.25 to 0.52 when compared to lung cancers), systemic extension of the disease (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.87-3.45), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.80-3.59), for vasopressors (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.66-3.29), or renal replacement therapy (OR 1.54; 95% CI 0.99-2.38).

Triage requires careful weighing of the benefits and risks involved in ICU admission while striving to guarantee fair distribution of available resources. We must ensure that the patients who occupy ICU beds are those most likely to benefit from the ICU's specialized technology and professionals. Although prognosticating is not an exact science, preference should be given to patients who are more likely to survive if admitted to the ICU but unlikely to survive or likely to have more significant morbidity if not admitted. To provide general guidance for intensivists in ICU triage decisions, a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine addressed 4 basic questions regarding this process. The team made recommendations and concluded that triage should be led by intensivists considering input from nurses, emergency medicine professionals, hospitalists, surgeons, and allied professionals. Triage algorithms and protocols can be useful but can never supplant the role of skilled intensivists basing their decisions on input from multidisciplinary teams.

Even though we seek to develop more collegial interprofessional approaches to care and health decision-making, there are many barriers to successfully managing complex decisions. The aim of this study is to better understand how emotions influence the end-of-life decision-making process among professionals working in ICU. DESIGN: Qualitative study with clinical interviews. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using interpretative phenomenological analysis. SETTING: Two independent ICUs at the ""Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal."" SUBJECTS: Ten physicians and 10 nurses. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the end-of-life decision-making process, families and patients restructure the decision-making frame by introducing a strong emotional dimension. This results in the emergence of new challenges quite different from the immediacy often associated with intensive care. In response to changes in decision frames, physicians rely on their relationship with the patient's family to assist with advanced care decisions. Nurses, however, draw on their relationship and proximity to the patient to denounce therapeutic obstinacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that during the end-of-life decision-making process, nurses' feelings toward their patients and physicians' feelings toward their patients' families influence the decisions they make. Although these emotional dimensions allow nurses and physicians to act in a manner that is consistent with their professional ethics, the professionals themselves seem to have a poor understanding of these dimensions and often overlook them, thus hindering collegial decisions.",2017,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002710,45,12,2023-2030,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Emotions and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Canada and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Intensive Care Units and *Decision Making and Terminal Care/*psychology and *Interprofessional Relations and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Medical Staff, Hospital/*psychology",NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, objective methods for identifying these ICU patient subgroups are lacking. We used a machine learning approach to empirically identify ICU patient subgroups through clustering analysis and evaluate whether these groups might represent appropriate targets for care redesign efforts. DESIGN: We performed clustering analysis using data from patients' hospital stays to retrospectively identify patient subgroups from a large, heterogeneous ICU population. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a healthcare delivery system serving 3.9 million members. PATIENTS: ICU patients 18 years old or older with an ICU admission between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, at one of 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used clustering analysis to identify putative clusters among 5,000 patients randomly selected from 24,884 ICU patients. To assess cluster validity, we evaluated the distribution and frequency of patient characteristics and the need for invasive therapies. We then applied a classifier built from the sample cohort to the remaining 19,884 patients to compare the derivation and validation clusters. Clustering analysis successfully identified six clinically recognizable subgroups that differed significantly in all baseline characteristics and clinical trajectories, despite sharing common diagnoses. In the validation cohort, the proportion of patients assigned to each cluster was similar and demonstrated significant differences across clusters for all variables.

Limitation of life-sustaining therapy, by either withholding or withdrawing support, is an ethically acceptable and common worldwide practice. The purpose of the present study was to examine the frequency, types, and rationale of limiting life support in Greek intensive care units (ICUs), the clinical and demographic parameters associated with it, and the participation of relatives in decision making. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in eight Greek multidisciplinary ICUs. We studied all consecutive ICU patients who died, excluding those who stayed in the ICU less than 48 hours or were brain dead. RESULTS: Three hundred six patients composed the study population, with a mean age of 64 years and a mean APACHE II score on admission of 21. Of study patients, 41% received full support, including unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); 48% died after withholding of CPR; 8%, after withholding of other treatment modalities besides CPR; and 3%, after withdrawal of treatment. Patients in whom therapy was limited had a longer ICU (P < 0.01) and hospital (P = 0.01) length of stay, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) on admission (P < 0.01), a higher APACHE II score 24 hours before death (P < 0.01), and were more likely to be admitted with a neurologic diagnosis (P < 0.01). Patients who received full support were more likely to be admitted with either a cardiovascular (P = 0.02) or trauma diagnosis (P = 0.05) and to be surgical rather than medical (P = 0.05). The main factors that influenced the physician's decision were, when providing full support, reversibility of illness and prognostic uncertainty, whereas, when limiting therapy, unresponsiveness to treatment already offered, prognosis of underlying chronic disease, and prognosis of acute disorder. Relatives' participation in decision making occurred in 20% of cases and was more frequent when a decision to provide full support was made (P < 0.01). Advance directives were rare (1%). CONCLUSIONS: Limitation of life-sustaining treatment is a common phenomenon in the Greek ICUs studied. However, in a large majority of cases, it is equivalent to the withholding of CPR alone. Withholding of other therapies besides CPR and withdrawal of support are infrequent.

Uy_2013_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Physicians' decision-making roles for an acutely unstable critically and terminally ill patient,"Uy, Jamie and White, Douglas B. and Mohan, Deepika and Arnold, Robert M. and Barnato, Amber E.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: There is substantial variation in use of life sustaining technologies in patients near the end of life but little is known about variation in physicians' initial ICU admission and intubation decision making processes. Our objective is to describe variation in hospital-based physicians' communication behaviors and decision-making roles for ICU admission and intubation decisions for an acutely unstable critically and terminally ill patient. DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of transcribed simulation encounters from a multi-center observational study of physician decision making. The simulation depicted a 78-year-old man with metastatic gastric cancer and life threatening hypoxia. He has stable underlying preferences against ICU admission and intubation that he or his wife will report if asked. We coded encounters for communication behaviors (providing medical information, eliciting preferences/values, engaging the patient/surrogate in deliberation, and providing treatment recommendations) and used a previously-developed framework to classify subject physicians into four -mutually-exclusive decision-making roles: informative (providing medical information only), facilitative (information + eliciting preferences/values + guiding surrogate to apply preferences/values), collaborative (information + eliciting + guiding + making a recommendation) and directive (making an independent treatment decision). SETTING: Simulation centers at 3 US academic medical centers. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four emergency physicians, 37 hospitalists, and 37 intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Subject physicians average 12.4 years (SD 9.0) since graduation from medical school. Of 98 physicians (39%), 38 physicians sent the patient to the ICU, and 9 of 98 (9%) ultimately decided to intubate. Most (93 of 98 [95%]) provided at least some medical information, but few explained the short-term prognosis with (26 of 98 [27%]) or without intubation (37 of 98 [38%]). Many (80 of 98 [82%]) elicited the patient's intubation preferences, but few (35 of 98 [36%]) explored the patient's broader values. Based on coded behaviors, we categorized 1 of 98 (1%) as informative, 48 of 98 (49%) as facilitative, 36 of 98 (37%) as collaborative, and 12 of 98 (12%) as directive; 1 of 98 (1%) could not be placed into a category. No observed physician characteristics predicted decision-making role. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the physicians played a facilitative or collaborative role, although a greater proportion assumed a directive role in this time-pressured scenario than has been documented in nontime-pressured ICU family meetings, suggesting that physicians' roles may be context dependent.",2013,10.1097/CCM.0b013e318287f0dd,41,6,1511-1517,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Communication and Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Prognosis and Intensive Care Units and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and Physicians/*psychology and Critical Illness/*therapy and Patient Simulation and Neoplasm Metastasis and Terminal Care/*methods and Intubation, Intratracheal and Life Support Care/methods and Hypoxia/therapy and Stomach Neoplasms/pathology/therapy",NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

To determine whether ethical climate is associated with the intention to leave after adjustment for country, ICU and clinicians characteristics. METHODS: Perceptions of the ethical climate among clinicians working in 68 adult ICUs in 12 European countries and the US were measured using a self-assessment questionnaire, together with job characteristics and intent to leave as a sub-analysis of the Dispropricus study. The validated ethical decision-making climate questionnaire included seven factors: not avoiding decision-making at end-of-life (EOL), mutual respect within the interdisciplinary team, open interdisciplinary reflection, ethical awareness, self-reflective physician leadership, active decision-making at end-of-life by physicians, and involvement of nurses in EOL. Hierarchical mixed effect models were used to assess associations between these factors, and the intent to leave in clinicians within ICUs, within the different countries. RESULTS: Of 3610 nurses and 1137 physicians providing ICU bedside care, 63.1% and 62.9% participated, respectively. Of 2992 participating clinicians, 782 (26.1%) had intent to leave, of which 27% nurses, 24% junior and 22.7% senior physicians. After adjustment for country, ICU and clinicians characteristics, mutual respect OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.66- 0.90), open interdisciplinary reflection (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.62-0.86]) and not avoiding EOL decisions (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.77-0.98]) were all associated with a lower intent to leave. CONCLUSION: This is the first large multicenter study showing an independent association between clinicians' intent to leave and the quality of the ethical climate in the ICU. Interventions to reduce intent to leave may be most effective when they focus on improving mutual respect, interdisciplinary reflection and active decision-making at EOL.",2020,10.1007/s00134-019-05829-1,46,1,46-56,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,"Decision-making and United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Europe and Attitude of Health Personnel and Ethics, Medical and *Intention and Respect and Health Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Organizational Culture and Critical Care/*ethics/psychology/standards and Ethical climate and Intensive Care Units/ethics/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data and Intent to leave and Interdisciplinary reflection",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, little is known about when and how patients and families are engaged in treatment decision-making over the longitudinal course of a critical illness. We sought to characterize patterns of treatment decision-making by evaluating clinician discourse in the electronic health record of critically ill adults who develop chronic critical illness or die in an ICU. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We conducted qualitative content analysis of the electronic health record of 52 adult patients, admitted to a medical ICU in a tertiary medical center from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. We included patients who met a consensus definition of chronic critical illness (26 patients) and a matched sample who died or transitioned to hospice care in the ICU before developing chronic critical illness (26 patients). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Characterization of clinician decision-making discourse documented during the course of an ICU stay. Clinician decision-making discourse in the electronic health record followed a single, consistent pattern across both groups. Initial decisions about admission to the ICU focused on specific interventions that can only be provided in an ICU environment (intervention-focused decisions). Following admission, the documented rationale for additional treatments was guided by physiologic abnormalities (physiology-centered decisions). Clinician discourse transitioned to documented engagement of patients and families in decision-making when treatments failed to achieve specified physiologic goals. The phrase ""goals of care"" is common in the electronic health record and is used to indicate poor prognosis, to describe conflict with families, and to provide rationale for treatment limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinician discourse in the electronic health record reveals that patient physiology strongly guides treatment decision-making throughout the longitudinal course of critical illness. Documentation of patient and family engagement in treatment decision-making is limited until available medical treatments fail to achieve physiologic goals.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003711,47,6,784-791,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Communication and Humans and Electronic Health Records and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Chronic Disease and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Patient Care Planning and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Intensive Care Units and Organ Dysfunction Scores and *Decision Making, Shared and *Professional-Family Relations and Critical Illness/*therapy and Life Support Care",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Stricker_2009_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Family satisfaction in the intensive care unit: what makes the difference?,"Stricker, Kay H. and Kimberger, Oliver and Schmidlin, Kurt and Zwahlen, Marcel and Mohr, Ulrike and Rothen, Hans U.",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: To assess family satisfaction in the ICU and to identify parameters for improvement. METHODS: Multicenter study in Swiss ICUs. Families were given a questionnaire covering overall satisfaction, satisfaction with care and satisfaction with information/decision-making. Demographic, medical and institutional data were gathered from patients, visitors and ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 996 questionnaires from family members were analyzed. Individual questions were assessed, and summary measures (range 0-100) were calculated, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Summary score was 78 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD) for overall satisfaction, 79 +/- 14 for care and 77 +/- 15 for information/decision-making. In multivariable multilevel linear regression analyses, higher severity of illness was associated with higher satisfaction, while a higher patient:nurse ratio and written admission/discharge criteria were associated with lower overall satisfaction. Using performance-importance plots, items with high impact on overall satisfaction but low satisfaction were identified. They included: emotional support, providing understandable, complete, consistent information and coordination of care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, proxies were satisfied with care and with information/decision-making. Still, several factors, such as emotional support, coordination of care and communication, are associated with poor satisfaction, suggesting the need for improvement.

Early prediction can improve sepsis outcomes with appropriate interventions. With the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019, we aimed to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm with high prediction performance and clinical interpretability for prediction of sepsis onset during critical care in real-time. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The dataset was collected from three ICUs in three different U.S. hospitals. Two of them were publicly available for model development (offline) and one was used for testing (online). PATIENTS: Forty-thousand three-hundred thirty-six ICU patients from the two model development databases and 24,819 from the test database. There are up to 40 hourly-recorded clinical variables for each ICU stay. The Sepsis-3 criteria were used to confirm sepsis onset. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three-hundred twelve features were constructed hourly as the input of our proposed Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction. Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction first estimates the likelihood of sepsis onset for each hour of an ICU stay in the following 6 hours, and then makes a binary prediction with three time-phased cutoff values. On the internal validation set, the utility score (official challenge measurement) achieved by Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction was 0.430. On the test set, the utility score reached was 0.354. Furthermore, Time-phAsed machine learning model for Sepsis Prediction provides an intuitive way to illustrate the impact of the input features on the outcome prediction, which makes it clinically interpretable.

E. and Moutel, G.",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: Since the 2005 French law on end of life and patients' rights, it is unclear whether practices have evolved. We investigated whether an intensive communication strategy based on this law would influence practices in terms of withholding and withdrawing treatment (WWT), and outcome of patients hospitalised in intensive care (ICU). METHODS: This was a single-centre, two-period study performed before and after the 2005 law. Between these periods, an intensive strategy for communication was developed and implemented, comprising regular meetings and modalities for WWT. We examined medical records of all patients who died in the ICU or in hospital during both periods. RESULTS: In total, out of 2,478 patients admitted in period 1, 678 (27%) died in the ICU and 823/2,940 (28%) in period 2. In period 1, among patients who died in the ICU, 45% died subsequent to a decision to WWT versus 85% in period 2 (p < 0.01). Among these, median time delay between ICU admission and initiation of decision-making process was significantly different (6-7 days in period 1 vs. 3-5 days in period 2, p < 0.05). Similarly, median time from admission to actual WWT decision was significantly shorter in period 2 (11-13 days in period 1 vs. 4-6 days in period 2, p < 0.05). Finally, median time from admission to death in the ICU subsequent to a decision to WWT was 13-15 days in period 1 versus 7-8 days in period 2, p < 0.05. Reasons for WWT were not significantly different between periods. CONCLUSION: Intensive communication brings about quicker end-of-life decision-making in the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a clinical prediction tool for hospital mortality to improve future end-of-life decision making for very elderly patients who are admitted to Canadian ICUs. DESIGN: This was a prospective, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Data from 1033 very elderly medical patients admitted to 22 Canadian academic and nonacademic ICUs were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: A univariate analysis of selected predictors to ascertain prognostic power was performed, followed by multivariable logistic regression to derive the final prediction tool. MAIN RESULTS: We included 1033 elderly patients in the analyses. Mean age was 84.6<c2><b1>3.5 years, 55% were male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 23.1<c2><b1>7.9, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 5.3<c2><b1>3.4, median ICU length of stay was 4.1 (interquartile range, 6.2) days, median hospital length of stay was 16.2 (interquartile range, 25.0) days, and ICU mortality and all-cause hospital mortality were 27% and 41%, respectively. Important predictors of hospital mortality at the time of ICU admission include age (85-90 years of age had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 1.63 [1.04-2.56]; >90 years of age had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 2.64 [1.27-5.48]), serum creatinine (120-300 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 1.57 [1.01-2.44]; >300 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 5.29 [2.43-11.51]), Glasgow Coma Scale (13-14 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 2.09 [1.09-3.98]; 8-12 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 2.31 [1.34-3.97]; 4-7 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 5.75 [3.02-10.95]; 3 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 8.97 [3.70-21.74]), and serum pH (<7.15 had an odds ratio of hospital mortality of 2.44 [1.07-5.60]).

Kendall.Gallagher_2017_Joofcrca,JOUR,A nursing perspective of interprofessional work in critical care: Findings from a secondary analysis,"Kendall-Gallagher, Deborah and Reeves, Scott and Alexanian, Janet A. and Kitto, Simon",Journal of critical care,PURPOSE: This article presents a secondary analysis of nurse interviews from a 2-year comparative ethnographic study exploring cultures of collaboration across intensive care units (ICU). Critically ill patients rely on their interprofessional health care team to communicate and problem-solve quickly to give patients the best outcome available. Critical care nurses function at the hub of patient care giving them a distinct perspective of how interprofessional interactions impact collaborative practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of a subset of primary qualitative data is appropriate when analysis extends rather than exceeds the primary study aim. Primary ethnographic data included 178 semistructured interviews of ICU professionals from 8 medical-surgical ICUs in North America; purposeful maximum variation sampling was used to represent each profession accurately. Fifteen anonymized ICU nurse interview transcripts were coded iteratively to identify emerging themes impacting interprofessional collaborative practice. RESULTS: Findings suggest that quality of interprofessional collaboration is a product of a multitude of factors occurring at multiple levels within the organization. Managerial and organizational factors related to ICU nurse training and staffing may impede development of nurses' interprofessional skills. CONCLUSION: Deliberative development of ICU nurses' interprofessional skills is essential if nursing is to move from primary coordinator to active collaborator in patient management.,2017,10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.10.007,38,NA,20-26,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,"Humans and Cooperative Behavior and Ontario and Interviews as Topic and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Interprofessional Relations and Teamwork and Patient Care Team/*organization & administration and Clinical decision making and Critical care and *Practice Patterns, Nurses' and Interprofessional collaboration and Critical Care/organization & administration and Critical Illness/*nursing and Interprofessional",NA,NA,2017/04//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

William 3rd and Umscheid, Craig A.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Develop and implement a machine learning algorithm to predict severe sepsis and septic shock and evaluate the impact on clinical practice and patient outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort for algorithm derivation and validation, pre-post impact evaluation. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital system in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: All non-ICU admissions; algorithm derivation July 2011 to June 2014 (n = 162,212); algorithm validation October to December 2015 (n = 10,448); silent versus alert comparison January 2016 to February 2017 (silent n = 22,280; alert n = 32,184). INTERVENTIONS: A random-forest classifier, derived and validated using electronic health record data, was deployed both silently and later with an alert to notify clinical teams of sepsis prediction. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULT: Patients identified for training the algorithm were required to have International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes for severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive blood culture during their hospital encounter with either a lactate greater than 2.2 mmol/L or a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 29% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer.

Senior intensive care doctors (consultants) were presented with pairs of patient profiles and asked to prioritize one of the patients in each task for admission to ICU. A multinomial logit and a latent class logit model was used for the data analyses. SETTING: Online survey across U.K. intensive care. SUBJECTS: Intensive care consultants working in NHS hospitals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the factors investigated, patient's age had the largest impact at admission followed by the views of their family, and severity of their main comorbidity. Physiologic measures indicating severity of illness had less impact than the gestalt assessment by the ICU registrar. We identified four distinct decision-making patterns, defined by the relative importance given to different factors. CONCLUSIONS: ICU consultants vary in the importance they give to different factors in deciding who to prioritize for ICU admission. Transparency regarding which factors have been considered in the decision-making process could reduce variability and potential inequity for patients.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003903,47,11,1522-1530,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and United Kingdom and Comorbidity and Age Factors and Severity of Illness Index and *Patient Admission and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Intensive Care Units and *Medical Staff, Hospital and *Triage and Professional-Family Relations",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
van.Lieshout_2008_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Decision making in interhospital transport of critically ill patients: national questionnaire survey among critical care physicians,"van Lieshout, Erik Jan and de Vos, Rien and Binnekade, Jan M. and de Haan, Rob and Schultz, Marcus J. and Vroom, Margreeth B.",Intensive care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the relative importance of clinical and transport-related factors in physicians' decision-making regarding the interhospital transport of critically ill patients. METHODS: The medical heads of all 95 ICUs in The Netherlands were surveyed with a questionnaire using 16 case vignettes to evaluate preferences for transportability; 78 physicians (82%) participated. The vignettes varied in eight factors with regard to severity of illness and transport conditions. Their relative weights were calculated for each level of the factors by conjoint analysis and expressed in beta. The reference value (beta = 0) was defined as the optimal conditions for critical care transport; a negative beta indicated preference against transportability. RESULTS: The type of escorting personnel (paramedic only: beta = -3.1) and transport facilities (standard ambulance beta = -1.21) had the greatest negative effect on preference for transportability. Determinants reflecting severity of illness were of relative minor importance (dose of noradrenaline beta = -0.6, arterial oxygenation beta = -0.8, level of peep beta = -0.6). Age, cardiac arrhythmia, and the indication for transport had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Escorting personnel and transport facilities in interhospital transport were considered as most important by intensive care physicians in determining transportability. When these factors are optimal, even severely critically ill patients are considered able to undergo transport. Further clinical research should tailor transport conditions to optimize the use of expensive resources in those inevitable road trips.",2008,10.1007/s00134-008-1023-x,34,7,1269-1273,eng,0342-4642 1432-1238,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Netherlands and APACHE and *Decision Making and Physicians/*psychology and *Critical Illness and Patient Transfer/methods/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2008/07//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Physicians from 11 ICUs at a university hospital completed a survey presenting a patient in a vegetative state with no family or advance directives. Questions addressed approaches to EOL care, as well physicians' personal, professional and EOL educational characteristics. RESULTS: The response rate was 89%, with 105 questionnaires analyzed. Mean age was 38 <c2><b1> 8 years, with a mean of 14 <c2><b1> 7 years since graduation. Physicians who did not apply do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were less likely to have attended EOL classes than those who applied written DNR orders [0/7 vs. 31/47, OR = 0.549 (0.356-0.848), P = 0.001]. Physicians who involved nurses in the decision-making process were more likely to be ICU specialists [17/22 vs. 46/83, OR = 4.1959 (1.271-13.845), P = 0.013] than physicians who made such decisions among themselves or referred to ethical or judicial committees. Physicians who would apply ""full code"" had less often read about EOL [3/22 vs. 11/20, OR = 0.0939 (0.012-0.710), P = 0.012] and had less interest in discussing EOL [17/22 vs. 20/20, OR = 0.210 (0.122-0.361), P < 0.001], than physicians who would withdraw life-sustaining therapies. Forty-four percent of respondents would not do what they believed was best for their patient, with 98% of them believing a less aggressive attitude preferable. Legal concerns were the leading cause for this dichotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Physician education about EOL is associated with variability in EOL decisions in the ICU.

N.","Critical care (London, England)","Current care guidelines recommend glucose control (GC) in critically ill patients. To achieve GC, many ICUs have implemented a (nurse-based) protocol on paper. However, such protocols are often complex, time-consuming, and can cause iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Computerized glucose regulation protocols may improve patient safety, efficiency, and nurse compliance. Such computerized clinical decision support systems (Cuss) use more complex logic to provide an insulin infusion rate based on previous blood glucose levels and other parameters. A computerized CDSS for glucose control has the potential to reduce overall workload, reduce the chance of human cognitive failure, and improve glucose control. Several computer-assisted glucose regulation programs have been published recently. In order of increasing complexity, the three main types of algorithms used are computerized flowcharts, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), and Model Predictive Control (MPC). PID is essentially a closed-loop feedback system, whereas MPC models the behavior of glucose and insulin in ICU patients. Although the best approach has not yet been determined, it should be noted that PID controllers are generally thought to be more robust than MPC systems. The computerized Cuss that are most likely to emerge are those that are fully a part of the routine workflow, use patient-specific characteristics and apply variable sampling intervals.",2009,10.1186/cc8023,13,5,223,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,"Humans and Quality of Health Care and Glycemic Index and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and *Intensive Care Units and Blood Glucose/drug effects/*metabolism and Hyperglycemia/prevention & control and Hypoglycemia/prevention & control and Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2009///,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rubin_2014_Joofcrca,JOUR,Racial differences in withdrawal of mechanical ventilation do not alter mortality in neurologically injured patients,"Rubin, Michael A. and Dhar, Rajat and Diringer, Michael N.",Journal of critical care,"PURPOSE: Racial differences in withdrawal of mechanical ventilation (WMV) have been demonstrated among patients with severe neurologic injuries. We ascertained whether such differences might be accounted for by imbalances in socioeconomic status or disease severity, and whether such racial differences impact hospital mortality or result in greater discharge to long-term care facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated WMV among 1885 mechanically ventilated patients with severe neurologic injury (defined as Glasgow Coma Scale <9), excluding those progressing to brain death within the first 48 hours. RESULTS: Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation was less likely in nonwhite patients (22% vs 31%, P < .001). Nonwhites were younger and were more likely to have Medicaid or no insurance, live in ZIP codes with low median household incomes, be unmarried, and have greater illness severity; but after adjustment for these variables, racial difference in WMV persisted (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.76). Nonwhite patients were more likely to die instead with full support or progress to brain death, resulting in equivalent overall hospital mortality (40% vs 42%, P = .44). Among survivors, nonwhites were more likely to be discharged to long-term care facilities (27% vs 17%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates of nonwhite neurologically injured patients chose WMV less often even after correcting for socioeconomic status and other confounders. This difference in end-of-life decision making does not appear to alter hospital mortality but may result in more survivors left in a disabled state.",2014,10.1016/j.jcrc.2013.08.023,29,1,49-53,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Socioeconomic Factors and Age Factors and Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data and Medical ethics and Glasgow Coma Scale and Racial Groups/*statistics & numerical data and Brain Injuries/*ethnology and Brain injury and Racial disparity and Ventilator Weaning/*statistics & numerical data and Withdrawal of ventilation,NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Convenience sample of patients and relatives administered after discharge from 70 participating ICUs in eight European countries (1,398 evaluable responses). The structured questionnaire included 21 characteristics of medical competence categorised as 'medical knowledge and skills', 'communication with patients', and 'communication with relatives'. It was available in the national languages of the countries involved. Questions were rated by respondents for importance using a four-point Likert scale. Responses to open questions were also invited. RESULTS: Most characteristics were highly rated, with priority given to medical knowledge and skills. Women were more likely to emphasise communication skills. There were no consistent regional differences. Free-text responses welcomed the opportunity to participate.

The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (<c2><b1> 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock.

METHODS: Single center study consisting of semi-structured interviews with experienced physicians and nurses. Seventeen intensivists from medical (n = 7), surgical (n = 5), and anesthesia (n = 5) critical care backgrounds, and ten nurses from medical (n = 5) and surgical (n = 5) ICU backgrounds were interviewed. Principles of grounded theory were used to analyze the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Eleven factors within four categories were identified that influenced physician variability in decisions to limit life support: (1) physician work environment-workload and competing priorities, shift changes and handoffs, and incorporation of nursing input; (2) physician experiences-of unexpected patient survival, and of limiting life support in physician's family; (3) physician attitudes-investment in a good surgical outcome, specialty perspective, values and beliefs; and (4) physician relationship with patient and family-hearing the patient's wishes firsthand, engagement in family communication, and family negotiation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several factors which physicians and nurses perceived were important sources of physician variability in decisions to limit life support. Ways to raise awareness and ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of factors such as workload, competing priorities, shift changes, and handoffs should be explored.

DESIGN: Systematic review of PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, and CINAHL for relevant literature from 1966 to February 2017. PATIENTS: Focus on critically ill patients and included evaluations in other patient care settings, as well. INTERVENTIONS: Identified interventions designed to reduce or prevent alert fatigue within clinical decision support systems. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study selection was based on one primary key question to identify effective interventions that attempted to reduce alert fatigue and three secondary key questions that covered the negative effects of alert fatigue, potential unintended consequences of efforts to reduce alert fatigue, and ideal alert quantity. Data were abstracted by two reviewers independently using a standardized abstraction tool.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 40 septic patients (17 female and 23 male; age range, 20-89 years) who were treated in our ICU. The ICG-PDR measurement and APACHE II score measurement were made within 24 hours after admission to the ICU. Indocyanine green elimination tests were conducted concurrently using the noninvasive liver function monitoring system (LiMON, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). A dose of 0.3 mg/kg ICG was given through a cubital fossa vein as a bolus. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that ICG-PDR was significantly lower in nonsurvivors (n = 18) than in survivors (n = 22) (mean, 12.1% +/- 7.6%/min; median, 9%/min, vs mean, 21.2% +/- 10.1%/min; median, 20%/min, respectively [P = .004]). The area under the curve as a measure of accuracy was 0.765 for ICG-PDR and 0.692 for APACHE II. Mortality was 80% in patients with ICG-PDR below 8% per minute, and survival was approximately 89% in patients with ICG-PDR above 24% per minute. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that ICG-PDR, assessed with a user-friendly noninvasive bedside LiMON device, is a good predictor of survival in septic patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the noninvasive measurement of ICG-PDR on ICU admission was comparable to that obtained by APACHE II scores.",2009,10.1016/j.jcrc.2008.11.012,24,3,329-334,eng,1557-8615 0883-9441,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Sex Factors and Prognosis and Aged, 80 and over and Age Factors and Length of Stay and Intensive Care Units and APACHE and Liver Function Tests and *Critical Care and Coloring Agents/*pharmacokinetics and Indocyanine Green/*pharmacokinetics and Sepsis/*blood/diagnosis/*mortality",NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,J Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decision aids can improve decision making quality, though their role in an intensive care units setting is unclear. We aimed to develop and pilot test a decision aid for shared decision makers of patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation. SETTING: Intensive care units at three medical centers. SUBJECTS: Fifty-three surrogate decision makers and 58 physicians. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: We developed the decision aid using defined methodological guidelines. After an iterative revision process, formative cognitive testing was performed among surrogate-physician dyads. Next, we compared the decision aid to usual care control in a prospective, before/after design study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were physician-surrogate discordance for expected patient survival, comprehension of relevant medical information, and the quality of communication. Compared to control, the intervention group had lower surrogate-physician discordance (7 [10] vs. 43 [21]), greater comprehension (11.4 [0.7] vs. 6.1 [3.7]), and improved quality of communication (8.7 [1.3] vs. 8.4 [1.3]) (all p<.05) post-intervention. Hospital costs were lower in the intervention group ($110,609 vs. $178,618; p=.044); mortality did not differ by group (38% vs. 50%, p=.95). Ninety-four percent of the surrogates and 100% of the physicians reported that the decision aid was useful in decision making. CONCLUSION: We developed a prolonged mechanical ventilation decision aid that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with both improved decision-making quality and less resource utilization.

Concurrently, emergency care has become patient-centered. This review aims to describe challenges associated with the application of key principles of bioethics in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care; propose actions to address these challenges; and highlight the need for evidence-based ethics and consensus on ethical principles interpretation. METHODS: Following agreement on the article's outline, subgroups of 2-3 authors provided narrative reviews of ethical issues concerning autonomy and honesty, beneficence/nonmaleficence and dignity, justice, specific practices/circumstances such as family presence during resuscitation, and emergency research. Proposals for addressing ethical challenges were also offered. RESULTS: Respect for patient autonomy can be realized through honest provision of information, shared decision-making, and advance directives/care planning. Essential prerequisites comprise public and specific healthcare professionals' education, appropriate regulatory provisions, and allocation of adequate resources. Regarding beneficence/nonmaleficence, resuscitation should benefit patients, while avoiding harm from futile interventions; pertinent practice should be based on neurological prognostication and patient/family-reported outcomes. Regarding dignity, aggressive life-sustaining treatments against patients preferences should be avoided. Contrary to the principle of justice, resuscitation quality may be affected by race/income status, age, ethnicity, comorbidity, and location (urban versus rural or country-specific/region-specific). Current evidence supports family presence during resuscitation. Regarding emergency research, autonomy should be respected without hindering scientific progress; furthermore, transparency of research conduct should be promoted and funding increased. CONCLUSIONS: Major ethical challenges in resuscitation science need to be addressed through complex/resource-demanding interventions. Such actions require support by ongoing/future research.",2018,10.1007/s00134-018-5202-0,44,6,703-716,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,Humans and Personal Autonomy and *Decision Making and Resuscitation and *Medical Futility and Beneficence and *Resuscitation and Personal autonomy and Social justice,NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: A novel algorithm was devised to detect sepsis 6 hours prior to its onset based on electronic medical records. SETTING: Retrospective cohorts from three separate hospitals are used in this study. Sepsis onset was defined based on Sepsis-3. Algorithms are evaluated based on the score function used in the Physionet Challenge 2019. PATIENTS: Over 60,000 ICU patients with 40 clinical variables (vital signs, laboratory results) for each hour of a patient's ICU stay were used. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The proposed algorithm predicted the onset of sepsis in the preceding n hours (where n = 4, 6, 8, or 12). Furthermore, the proposed method compared how many sepsis patients can be predicted in a short time with other methods. To interpret a given result in a clinical perspective, the relationship between input variables and the probability of the proposed method were presented. The proposed method achieved superior results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve, and score) and predicted more sepsis patients in advance. In official phase, the proposed method showed the utility score of -0.101, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.782, area under the precision-recall curve 0.041, accuracy 0.786, and F-measure 0.046.

Healthcare providers often rely on surrogates to make decisions for medical care and participation in clinical research. However, the accuracy of surrogate decisions for a variety of critical care research studies is poorly understood. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Medical intensive care unit patients and their designated surrogates. INTERVENTION: Patients were asked whether they would consent to participate in hypothetical research studies of increasing complexity, and surrogates independently indicated whether they would consent to enroll the patient in the same scenarios. RESULTS: Overall, 69 medical intensive care unit patients were enrolled into the study. The majority of surrogates were either the spouse (58%) or parent (22%) of the patient. The percentage of patients that would agree to participate in a research study and the percentage of surrogates that would agree to have the patient enrolled into a research study both declined as the risk of the study increased (p < .001 for both analyses). In addition, the overall discrepancy, the false-negative rates, and the false-positive rates between patient and surrogates were greater as the risk of the study increased (p < .001, p < .001, and p = .049, respectively). <ce><ba> values for all seven scenarios demonstrated less-than-moderate agreement (range 0.03-0.41).

We tried to evaluate what Koreans thought about controversial issues regarding EOL treatments. METHODS: We surveyed Koreans with the following questions: 1) are ventilator-dependent PVS patients candidates for end-of life treatment decisions? 2) Is withholding and withdrawing EOL treatment the same thing? 3) In an unconscious, terminally ill patient, whose wishes are unknown, how should EOL decisions be made? 4) How should we settle disagreement amongst medical staff and the patient's family on EOL decisions? RESULTS: One thousand Koreans not working in healthcare and five hundred healthcare professionals responded to the survey. Fifty-seven percent of Koreans not working in healthcare and sixty seven percent of Korean healthcare professionals agreed that ventilator-dependent PVS patients are candidates for EOL treatment decisions. One quarter of all respondents regarded withholding and withdrawing EOL treatment as equal. Over 50% thought that EOL treatment decisions should be made through discussions between the physician and the patient's family. For conflict resolution, 75% of Koreans not working in healthcare preferred direct settlement between the medical staff and the patient's family while 55% of healthcare professionals preferred the hospital ethics committee.

Out of 88 deaths among 830 admissions, 49% were preceded by EOLD. Of these 58% had withholding of treatment, 35% had do-not-resuscitate orders (DNR) and 7% had a withdrawal decision. Mean age and APACHE IV scores were similar between EOLD and FS groups. Functional dependence before hospitalization favored EOLD. Patients receiving EOLD as opposed to FS had longer stays. Fifty-three percent of limitations were decided during the first week of ICU stay well before the time of death. Escalation of therapy within 3 days of death was less frequent in the EOLD group.

We aimed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality among critically ill ESLD patients and to develop and validate a simple, parsimonious model for bedside use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 653 intensive care unit admissions for ESLD patients; modeled in-hospital mortality using multivariable logistic regression; and compared the predictive ability of several different models using the area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curves. RESULTS: Multivariable predictors of in-hospital mortality included Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, mechanical ventilation, and gender; there was also an interaction between MELD score and gender (P < .02). MELD alone had better discrimination (AU-ROC 0.83) than APACHE II alone (AU-ROC 0.76), and adding mechanical ventilation to MELD achieved the single largest increase in model discrimination (AU-ROC 0.85; P < .01). In a parsimonious, 2-predictor model, higher MELD scores (OR 1.14 per 1-point increase; 95% CI 1.11-1.16), and mechanical ventilation (OR 6.20; 95% CI 3.05-12.58) were associated with increased odds of death. Model discrimination was also excellent in the validation cohort (AU-ROC 0.90).

DESIGN: Prospective, exploratory, descriptive observational study of noninterpreted English family meetings and interpreted Spanish family meetings in the pediatric intensive care setting. SETTING: A single, university-based, tertiary children's hospital. SUBJECTS: Participants in PICU family meetings, including medical staff, family members, ancillary staff, and interpreters. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty family meetings (21 English and nine Spanish) were audio-recorded, transcribed, de-identified, and analyzed using the qualitative method of directed content analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quality of communication was analyzed in three ways: 1) presence of elements of shared decision-making, 2) balance between physician and family speech, and 3) complexity of physician speech. Of the 11 elements of shared decision-making, only four occurred in more than half of English meetings, and only three occurred in more than half of Spanish meetings. Physicians spoke for a mean of 20.7 minutes, while families spoke for 9.3 minutes during English meetings. During Spanish meetings, physicians spoke for a mean of 14.9 minutes versus just 3.7 minutes of family speech. Physician speech complexity received a mean grade level score of 8.2 in English meetings compared to 7.2 in Spanish meetings. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of physician-family communication during PICU family meetings is poor overall. Interpreted meetings had poorer communication quality as evidenced by fewer elements of shared decision-making and greater imbalance between physician and family speech. However, physician speech may be less complex during interpreted meetings. Our data suggest that physicians can improve communication in both interpreted and noninterpreted family meetings by increasing the use of elements of shared decision-making, improving the balance between physician and family speech, and decreasing the complexity of physician speech.",2014,10.1097/CCM.0000000000000177,42,6,1507-1517,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Prospective Studies and Qualitative Research and Tertiary Care Centers and *Communication and *Decision Making and *Professional-Family Relations and *Family and *Translating and *Intensive Care Units, Pediatric",NA,NA,2014/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Celi_2008_Critcare.LonEngl,JOUR,An artificial intelligence tool to predict fluid requirement in the intensive care unit: a proof-of-concept study,"Celi, Leo Anthony and Hinske, L. Christian and Alterovitz, Gil and Szolovits, Peter","Critical care (London, England)","INTRODUCTION: The goal of personalised medicine in the intensive care unit (ICU) is to predict which diagnostic tests, monitoring interventions and treatments translate to improved outcomes given the variation between patients. Unfortunately, processes such as gene transcription and drug metabolism are dynamic in the critically ill; that is, information obtained during static non-diseased conditions may have limited applicability. We propose an alternative way of personalising medicine in the ICU on a real-time basis using information derived from the application of artificial intelligence on a high-resolution database. Calculation of maintenance fluid requirement at the height of systemic inflammatory response was selected to investigate the feasibility of this approach. METHODS: The Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) is a database of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ICU in Boston. Patients who were on vasopressors for more than six hours during the first 24 hours of admission were identified from the database. Demographic and physiological variables that might affect fluid requirement or reflect the intravascular volume during the first 24 hours in the ICU were extracted from the database. The outcome to be predicted is the total amount of fluid given during the second 24 hours in the ICU, including all the fluid boluses administered. RESULTS: We represented the variables by learning a Bayesian network from the underlying data. Using 10-fold cross-validation repeated 100 times, the accuracy of the model in predicting the outcome is 77.8%. The network generated has a threshold Bayes factor of seven representing the posterior probability of the model given the observed data. This Bayes factor translates into p < 0.05 assuming a Gaussian distribution of the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the model, the probability that a patient would require a certain range of fluid on day two can be predicted. In the presence of a larger database, analysis may be limited to patients with identical clinical presentation, demographic factors, co-morbidities, current physiological data and those who did not develop complications as a result of fluid administration. By better predicting maintenance fluid requirements based on the previous day's physiological variables, one might be able to prevent hypotensive episodes requiring fluid boluses during the course of the following day.",2008,10.1186/cc7140,12,6,R151,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,"Humans and Female and Male and Boston and Information Storage and Retrieval and Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and *Artificial Intelligence and *Intensive Care Units and *Fluid Therapy and Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2008///,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a large, multicenter inpatient data. SETTING: Two academic tertiary medical centers between the years 2007 and 2018. SUBJECTS: All hospitalized patients who received a blood culture during hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: The dataset was partitioned temporally into development and validation cohorts: the logistic regression and gradient boosting machine models were trained on the earliest 80% of hospital admissions and validated on the most recent 20%. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 252,569 blood culture days-defined as nonoverlapping 24-hour periods in which one or more blood cultures were ordered. In the validation cohort, there were 50,514 blood culture days, with 3,762 cases of bacteremia (7.5%) and 370 cases of fungemia (0.7%). The gradient boosting machine model for bacteremia had significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.78 [95% CI 0.77-0.78]) than the logistic regression model (0.73 [0.72-0.74]) (p < 0.001). The model identified a high-risk group with over 30 times the occurrence rate of bacteremia in the low-risk group (27.4% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001). Using the low-risk cut-off, the model identifies bacteremia with 98.7% sensitivity. The gradient boosting machine model for fungemia had high discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.88 [95% CI 0.86-0.90]).

HROs commit to safety at the highest level and adopt a special approach to its pursuit. High reliability organizing has been studied and discussed for some time in other industries and is receiving increasing attention in health care, particularly in high-risk settings like the intensive care unit (ICU). The essence of high reliability organizing is a set of principles that enable organizations to focus attention on emergent problems and to deploy the right set of resources to address those problems. HROs behave in ways that sometimes seem counterintuitive--they do not try to hide failures but rather celebrate them as windows into the health of the system, they seek out problems, they avoid focusing on just one aspect of work and are able to see how all the parts of work fit together, they expect unexpected events and develop the capability to manage them, and they defer decision making to local frontline experts who are empowered to solve problems.

We sought to examine the relationship between personal preferences for life-sustaining treatment and medical decision making among pediatric intensivists. DESIGN: Cross-sectional national anonymous mail survey. SUBJECTS: All board-certified/eligible pediatric intensivists identified by the American Medical Association Masterfile. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 471 (30%) surveys were returned. A Personal Preference Score was calculated from responses to personal-preference questions for life-sustaining treatments adapted from ""Your Life, Your Choices,"" by Pearlman et al. Physicians were asked to consider the ""acceptability"" of offering and recommending treatment options involving life-sustaining treatments in a hypothetical scenario of a 2-yr old with a high cervical spinal-cord transection. Logistic regression controlling for sociodemographic characteristics found significant relationships (p<.01) between physicians' own preferences modeled as a one standard deviation change in their own Personal Preference Score (preference for life-sustaining treatment) and whether they offered more or less aggressive care (OR [95%CI]). Physicians who had a higher Personal Preference Score (higher preference for their own life-sustaining treatment) were more likely to recommend a tracheostomy (1.38 [1.35-1.41]) and reintubation if the patient failed extubation (1.87 [1.81-1.94]). Pediatric intensivists who had a lower Personal Preference Score (lower preference for life-sustaining treatment) were more likely to recommend that the patient not be reintubated if extubation failed (1.42 [1.39-1.46]) and to recommend Do Not Resuscitate status (1.34 [1.31-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric intensivists, personal preferences for life-sustaining treatment were significantly associated with scenario-based responses to acceptability of withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Physicians should be aware of the potential for personal preferences to influence practice recommendations, and endeavor to elicit and respect family preferences in collaborative decision making.",2012,10.1097/CCM.0b013e318255d85b,40,8,2464-2469,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"United States and Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Cross-Sectional Studies and Sex Factors and Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/psychology and *Pediatrics and *Life Support Care and *Withholding Treatment",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Part 1, with a focus on strategies for provision of family-centered care in critical illness during Pubic Health Emergency of International Concern. DESIGN: Development of a Society of Critical Care Medicine position statement using literature review, expert consensus from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Ethics Committee. A family member of a patient who was critically ill during a natural disaster served on the writing panel and provided validation from a family perspective to the recommendations. SETTING: Provision of family-centered care and support for patients who are critically ill or who have the potential of becoming critically ill, and their families, during a Pubic Health Emergency of International Concern. INTERVENTIONS: Communication; family support. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Family-centered interventions during a Pubic Health Emergency of International Concern include understanding how crisis standards may affect regional and local traditions.

Mehta_2012_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Why substitute decision makers provide or decline consent for ICU research studies: a questionnaire study,"Mehta, Sangeeta and Quittnat Pelletier, Friederike and Brown, Maedean and Ethier, Cheryl and Wells, David and Burry, Lisa and MacDonald, Rod",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: Consent for research participation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often obtained from a substitute decision maker (SDM). In this study we explored SDMs' reasons for declining or providing consent for research studies for critically ill adult family members. METHODS: Two questionnaires were developed, one directed at SDMs who agreed to have their relative participate in a research study (AGREE group), and another for SDMs who declined participation (DECLINE group). The questionnaires explored SDMs' opinions about research in general, timing of research approach, the informed consent process, and reasons for agreeing or declining participation. RESULTS: Ninety-six SDMs completed the questionnaire (68 AGREE, 27 DECLINE). There were no differences between AGREE and DECLINE groups with respect to SDM demographics, perceived severity of illness of the patient, or the research study approach. The most common reasons for providing consent were potential for research to help others (91%), research is important for medical progress (88%), and trust in the medical team (87%). The most common reasons for declining consent were SDM was too anxious to consider research (67%), fear that patient would receive experimental treatment (37%), and concern about risks of the study (33%). CONCLUSIONS: SDMs who agree to have a relative participate in an ICU research study are motivated by the potential benefit to the patient and altruism. SDMs who decline research participation, while not generally opposed to research, are fearful of study-related harm or discomfort for the patient, and are too anxious to consider a research study at that time.",2012,10.1007/s00134-011-2411-1,38,1,47-54,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Patient Participation and Surveys and Questionnaires and Clinical Trials as Topic and Ontario and *Decision Making and *Informed Consent and *Intensive Care Units and *Proxy,NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lieberman_2010_Critcare.LonEngl,JOUR,"Elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in and out of intensive care units: a comparative, prospective study of 579 ventilations","Lieberman, David and Nachshon, Liat and Miloslavsky, Oleg and Dvorkin, Valery and Shimoni, Avi and Zelinger, Julian and Friger, Michael and Lieberman, Devora","Critical care (London, England)","INTRODUCTION: Many mechanically ventilated elderly patients in Israel are treated outside of intensive care units (ICUs). The decision as to whether these patients should be treated in ICUs is reached without clear guidelines. We therefore conducted a study with the aim of identifying triage criteria and factors associated with in-hospital mortality in this population. METHODS: All mechanically invasive ventilated elderly (65+) medical patients in the hospital were included in a prospective, non-interventional, observational study. RESULTS: Of the 579 ventilations, 283 (48.9%) were done in ICUs compared with 296 (51.1%) in non-ICU wards. The percentage of ICU ventilations in the 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ age groups was 62%, 45%, and 23%, respectively. The decision to ventilate in ICUs was significantly and independently influenced by age (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.945, P < 0.001), and pre-hospitalization functional status by functional independence measure (FIM) scale (OR = 1.054, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 53.0% in ICUs compared with 68.2% in non-ICU wards (P < 0.001), but the rate was not independently and significantly affected by hospitalization in ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: In Israel, most elderly patients are ventilated outside ICUs and the percentage of ICU ventilations decreases as age increases. In our study groups, the lower mortality among elderly patients ventilated in ICUs is related to patient characteristics and not to their treatment in ICUs per se. Although the milieu in which this study was conducted is uncommon today in the western world, its findings point to possible means of managing future situations in which the demand for mechanical ventilation of elderly patients exceeds the supply of intensive care beds. Moreover, the findings of this study can contribute to the search for ways to reduce costs without having a negative effect on outcome in ventilated elderly patients.",2010,10.1186/cc8935,14,2,R48,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and Prospective Studies and Aged, 80 and over and *Intensive Care Units and *Emergency Medical Services and Respiration, Artificial/*statistics & numerical data and Israel",NA,NA,2010///,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Neal_2020_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Policies for Mandatory Ethics Consultations at U.S. Academic Teaching Hospitals: A Multisite Survey Study,"Neal, Jonathan B. and Pearlman, Robert A. and White, Douglas B. and Tolchin, Benjamin and Sheth, Kevin N. and Bernat, James L. and Hwang, David Y.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of top-ranked U.S. academic institutions that require ethics consultation for specific adult clinical circumstances (e.g., family requests for potentially inappropriate treatment) and to detail those circumstances and the specific clinical scenarios for which consultations are mandated. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study, conducted online or over the phone between July 2016 and October 2017. SETTING: We identified the top 50 research medical schools through the 2016 U.S. News and World Report rankings. The primary teaching hospital for each medical school was included. SUBJECTS: The chair/director of each hospital's adult clinical ethics committee, or a suitable alternate representative familiar with ethics consultation services, was identified for study recruitment. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A representative from the adult ethics consultation service at each of the 50 target hospitals was identified. Thirty-six of 50 sites (72%) consented to participate in the study, and 18 (50%) reported having at least one current mandatory consultation policy. Of the 17 sites that completed the survey and listed their triggers for mandatory ethics consultations, 20 trigger scenarios were provided, with three sites listing two distinct clinical situations. The majority of these triggers addressed family requests for potentially inappropriate treatment (9/20, 45%) or medical decision-making for unrepresented patients lacking decision-making capacity (7/20, 35%). Other triggers included organ donation after circulatory death, initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, denial of valve replacement in patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis, and posthumous donation of sperm. Twelve (67%) of the 18 sites with mandatory policies reported that their protocol(s) was formally documented in writing. CONCLUSIONS: Among top-ranked academic medical centers, the existence and content of official policies regarding situations that mandate ethics consultations are variable. This finding suggests that, despite recent critical care consensus guidelines recommending institutional review as standard practice in particular scenarios, formal adoption of such policies has yet to become widespread and uniform.",2020,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004343,48,6,847-853,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"United States and Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Health Services Misuse and Ethics Consultation/*organization & administration/standards and Hospitals, Teaching/*ethics",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Randomized, unblinded trial. SETTING: Single medical ICU. PATIENTS: Patients and surrogate decision makers in the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: The usual care group received a standard pamphlet about cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation preference options plus routine code status discussions with clinicians. The video group received usual care plus an 8-minute video that depicted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, showed a simulated hospital code, and explained resuscitation preference options. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred three patients and surrogates were randomized to usual care. One hundred five patients and surrogates were randomized to video plus usual care. Median total knowledge scores (0-15 points possible for correct answers) in the video group were 13 compared with 10 in the usual care group, p value of less than 0.0001. Video group participants had higher rates of understanding the purpose of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation options and terminology and could correctly name components of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. No statistically significant differences in documented resuscitation preferences following the interventions were found between the two groups, although the trial was underpowered to detect such differences. A majority of participants felt that the video was helpful in cardiopulmonary resuscitation decision making (98%) and would recommend the video to others (99%). CONCLUSIONS: A video depicting cardiopulmonary resuscitation and explaining resuscitation preference options was associated with improved knowledge of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation options and cardiopulmonary resuscitation terminology among patients and surrogate decision makers in the ICU, compared with receiving a pamphlet on cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Implications for Communication and Decision-Making in Critical Illness","Batten, Jason N. and Kruse, Katherine E. and Kraft, Stephanie A. and Fishbeyn, Bela and Magnus, David C.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To explore how nonphysicians and physicians interpret the word ""treatable"" in the context of critical illness. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews. SETTING: One academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four nonphysicians (patients and community members) purposively sampled for variation in demographic characteristics and 24 physicians (attending physicians and trainees) purposively sampled from four specialties (critical care, palliative care, oncology, and surgery). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified two distinct concepts that participants used to interpret the word ""treatable"": 1) a ""good news"" concept, in which the word ""treatable"" conveys a positive message about a patient's future, thereby inspiring hope and encouraging further treatment and 2) an ""action-oriented"" concept, in which the word ""treatable"" conveys that physicians have an action or intervention available, but does not necessarily imply an improved prognosis or quality of life. The overwhelming majority of nonphysicians adopted the ""good news"" concept, whereas physicians almost exclusively adopted the ""action-oriented"" concept. For some nonphysicians, the word ""treatable"" conveyed a positive message about prognosis and/or further treatment, even when this contradicted previously stated negative information. CONCLUSIONS: Physician use of the word ""treatable"" may lead patients or surrogates to derive unwarranted good news and false encouragement to pursue treatment, even when physicians have explicitly stated information to the contrary. Further work is needed to determine the extent to which the word ""treatable"" and its cognates contribute to widespread decision-making and communication challenges in critical care, including discordance about prognosis, misconceptions that palliative treatments are curative, and disputes about potentially inappropriate or futile treatment.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003614,47,3,369-376,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Interviews as Topic and *Terminology as Topic and *Communication and Physicians/psychology and *Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Critical Illness/*therapy,NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and other web-based databases were referenced since inception until November 26, 2018. We included randomized-controlled trials wherein protocolized family support interventions were conducted for enhanced communication and shared medical decision-making. LOS (in days) and mortality were evaluated using a random-effects model, and adjusted LOS was estimated using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: We included seven randomized-controlled trials with 3477 patients. Protocolized family support interventions were found to significantly reduce the ICU LOS {mean difference = - 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) = - 1.50 to - 0.27]} and hospital LOS [mean difference = - 3.78 (95% CI = - 5.26 to - 2.29)]; the results of the mixed-effect model showed that they significantly reduced ICU LOS after adjusting for the therapeutic goal [mean difference = - 1.30 (95% CI = - 2.35 to - 0.26)], methods of measurement [mean difference = - 0.89 (95% CI = - 1.55 to - 0.22)], and timing of intervention [mean difference = - 1.05 (95% CI = - 2.05 to - 0.05)]. Similar results were found after adjusting for patients' disease severity [mean difference = - 1.21 (95% CI = - 2.03 to - 0.39)] and the trim-and-fill method [mean difference = - 0.86 (95% CI = - 1.44 to - 0.28)].

Randall",Critical care medicine,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about what role physicians take in the decision-making process about life support in intensive care units. OBJECTIVE: To determine how responsibility is balanced between physicians and surrogates for life support decisions and to empirically develop a framework to describe different models of physician involvement. DESIGN: Multi-centered study of audio-taped clinician-family conferences with a derivation and validation cohort. SETTING: Intensive care units of four hospitals in Seattle, Washington, in 2000 to 2002 and two hospitals in San Francisco, California, in 2006 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fourteen clinicians and 495 surrogates who were involved in 162 life support decisions. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort (n = 63 decisions), no clinician inquired about surrogates' preferred role in decision-making. Physicians took one of four distinct roles: 1) informative role (7 of 63) in which the physician provided information about the patient's medical condition, prognosis, and treatment options but did not elicit information about the patient's values, engage in deliberations, or provide a recommendation about whether to continue life support; 2) facilitative role (23 of 63), in which the physician refrained from providing a recommendation but actively guided the surrogate through a process of clarifying the patients' values and applying those values to the decision; 3) collaborative role (32 of 63), in which the physician shared in deliberations with the family and provided a recommendation; and 4) directive role (1 of 63), in which the physician assumed all responsibility for, and informed the family of, the decision. In 10 out of 20 conferences in which surrogates requested a recommendation, the physician refused to provide one. The validation cohort revealed a similar frequency of use of the four roles, and frequent refusal by physicians to provide treatment recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variability in the roles physicians take in decision-making about life support with surrogates but little negotiation of desired roles.

Previous studies identified substantial subjective biases during end-of-life decision-making. We evaluated whether in-ICU patient's birthday influenced management decisions. DESIGN: We used a case-control design in which patients spending their birthday in the ICU (cases) were matched to controls on center, gender, age, severity, type of admission, and length of ICU stay before birthday. SETTING: 12 ICUs in French hospitals. PATIENTS: The cases and controls were patients with ICU admissions >48 h over a 10-year period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with the 1,042 controls, the 223 cases were more often trauma patients and received a larger number and longer durations of life-sustaining interventions. This increased intensity of life support occurred after, but not before, the birthday. The cases had longer ICU stay lengths. ICU and hospital mortality were not different between the two groups. End-of-life decisions were made in 22% and 24% of cases and controls, respectively. However, these decisions were made later in the cases than in the controls (18 [5-33] versus 9 [3-19] days). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that patients who spent their birthday in the ICU received a higher intensity of life-sustaining care and had longer ICU stays but did not have significantly different mortality rates compared with the controls suggests the use of nonbeneficial interventions. Staff members caring for patients whose birthdays fall during the ICU stay should be aware that this feature can bias end-of-life decisions, leading to an inappropriate level of care.",2012,10.1007/s00134-012-2510-7,38,7,1169-1176,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Decision Making and Case-Control Studies and Prospective Studies and France and Medical Futility and Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data and Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data and Intensive Care Units/standards/*statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/standards/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Braxton_2017_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Escalation of Commitment in the Surgical ICU,"Braxton, Carla C. and Robinson, Celia N. and Awad, Samir S.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Escalation of commitment is a business term that describes the continued investment of resources into a project even after there is objective evidence of the project's impending failure. Escalation of commitment may be a contributor to high healthcare costs associated with critically ill patients as it has been shown that, despite almost certain futility, most ICU costs are incurred in the last week of life. Our objective was to determine if escalation of commitment occurs in healthcare settings, specifically in the surgical ICU. We hypothesize that factors previously identified in business and organizational psychology literature including self-justification, accountability, sunk costs, and cognitive dissonance result in escalation of commitment behavior in the surgical ICU setting resulting in increased utilization of resources and cost. DESIGN: A descriptive case study that illustrates common ICU narratives in which escalation of commitment can occur. In addition, we describe factors that are thought to contribute to escalation of commitment behaviors. MAIN RESULTS: Escalation of commitment behavior was observed with self-justification, accountability, and cognitive dissonance accounting for the majority of the behavior. Unlike in business decisions, sunk costs was not as evident. In addition, modulating factors such as personality, individual experience, culture, and gender were identified as contributors to escalation of commitment. CONCLUSIONS: Escalation of commitment occurs in the surgical ICU, resulting in significant expenditure of resources despite a predicted and often known poor outcome. Recognition of this phenomenon may lead to actions aimed at more rational decision making and may contribute to lowering healthcare costs. Investigation of objective measures that can help aid decision making in the surgical ICU is warranted.",2017,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002261,45,4,e433-e436,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Social Responsibility and Aged and Sex Factors and Clinical Competence and Personality and Cultural Characteristics and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Health Care Costs and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Health Resources/economics/*statistics & numerical data and *Medical Futility and *Intensive Care Units/economics and Cognitive Dissonance",NA,NA,2017/04//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: A 2010 mailed survey of practicing U.S. physicians (1,156/1,878 or 62% of eligible physicians responded). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measures included an end of life vignette with five experimentally varied patient characteristics: setting, alimentation, pain, cognition, and communication. Physicians rated vignette patient quality of life on a scale from 0 to 100 and indicated whether they would recommend continuing full medical treatment or palliative treatment only. Cognitive deficits and alimentation had the greatest impacts on recommendations for further care, but pain and communication were also significant (all p < 0.001). Physicians who recommended continuing full medical treatment rated quality of life three times higher than those recommending palliative treatment only (40.41 vs 12.19; p < 0.01).

Ytzhak_2012_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Pediatric ventilation in a disaster: clinical and ethical decision making,"Ytzhak, Amir and Sagi, Ram and Bader, Tarif and Assa, Amit and Farfel, Alon and Merin, Ofer and Kreiss, Yitshak",Critical care medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Medical resources may be overwhelmed in a mass disaster situation. Intensive care resources may be limited even further. When the demand for a certain resource, like ventilators, exceeds its availability, caregivers are faced with the task of deciding how to distribute this resource.Ethical dilemmas arise when a practical decision necessitates ranking the importance of several ethical principles. In a disaster area, the greatest good for the greatest number principle and the goal of equal distribution of resources may take priority over the needs of the individual. Nonetheless, regardless of the interventions available, it is a prime goal to keep the patients' comfort and dignity as much as possible. BACKGROUND: In the mass disaster of the Haiti earthquake of January 2010, The Israeli Defense Forces Medical Corps field hospital was one of the first to respond to the call for help of the Haitian people with surgical and intensive care capabilities. It was the only facility able to ventilate children and neonates in the first week after the earthquake, although this ability was relatively limited. SPECIAL ARTICLE: Five case scenarios that we confronted at the pediatric ward of the field hospital are presented: two children with respiratory compromise due to pulmonary infection, one premature baby with respiratory distress syndrome, an asphyxiated neonate, and a baby with severe sepsis of a probable abdominal origin. In normal circumstances all of them would have been ventilated but with limited resources we raised in each case the question of ventilating or not.To help in the evaluation of each case we used a decision-support tool that was previously developed for ventilator allocation during an influenza pandemic. This tool takes into account several factors, including the illness severity, prognosis, and the expected duration of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Applying ethical priorities to analyze the decision-making problems leads to the understanding that an individualized approach with an ongoing assessment of the patient condition and the availability of resources, rather than a strict predefined decision rule, will give patients a better chance of survival, and will assist in allocating scarce resources.",2012,10.1097/CCM.0b013e318232e222,40,2,603-607,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Female and Male and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Prognosis and Infant, Newborn and Sampling Studies and Emergencies and Infant, Premature and Decision Making/*ethics and Israel and *Mass Casualty Incidents and *Earthquakes and Haiti and Triage/ethics/methods and Critical Illness/mortality/therapy and Abdomen, Acute and Asphyxia Neonatorum/diagnosis/therapy and Hospitals, Packaged and Myocarditis/diagnosis/therapy and Pneumonia/diagnosis/therapy and Respiration, Artificial/*ethics/methods and Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/diagnosis/therapy",NA,NA,2012/02//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Luce_2010_Critcaremedi,JOUR,A history of resolving conflicts over end-of-life care in intensive care units in the United States,"Luce, John M.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To present a case of conflict over end-of-life care in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to describe how such conflicts have been resolved in the United States since the inception of ICUs. DATA SOURCES: A nonsystematically derived sample of published studies and professional and lay commentaries on end-of-life care, ethical principles, medical decision-making, medical futility, and especially conflict resolution in the ICU. STUDY SELECTION: Some of those studies and commentaries dealing specifically with conflicts over end-of-life care in the ICU and their resolution. DATA SYNTHESIS: An historical review of conflict resolution over end-of-life issues in U.S. ICUs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Conflict at the end of life in ICUs in the United States is relatively rare because most families and physicians agree about how patients should be treated. Nevertheless, conflict still exists over some patients whose families insist on care that physicians consider inappropriate and hence inadvisable, and over other patients whose families object to care that physicians prefer to provide. When such conflict occurs, mediation between families and physicians is usually successful in resolving it. Consultation from ethics committees also may be helpful in achieving resolution, and one state actually allows such committees to adjudicate disputes.

Devictor_2011_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Forgoing life support: how the decision is made in European pediatric intensive care units,"Devictor, Denis J. and Latour, Jos M.",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: To determine how decisions to forgo life support are made in European pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). METHODS: A multicenter, prospective study, the Eurydice II study, among 45 PICUs: 20 in France, 21 in Northern/Western (N/W) European countries, and 4 in Eastern/Central (E/C) Europe. Data were collected between November 2009 and April 2010 through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment was made in 166 (40.6%) out of 409 deceased children (median 42.9%, France 38.2%, N/W European countries 60.0%, E/C European countries 0%; P < 0.001). In the E/C group, more patients died after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) failure than after forgoing life support (P < 0.001). In all PICUs, caregivers discussed the decision during a formal meeting, after which the medical staff made the final decision. The decision was often documented in the medical record (median 100%). The majority of the parents were informed of the final decision and were at the bedside during their child's death (median 100%). Decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment occurred in 40.6% of children, compared with 33% in Eurydice I. A high percentage of parents from France were now informed about the meeting and its conclusion as compared with Eurydice I (median 100%).

In children, the use of written protocols has not had such an impact. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a single-center trial to assess the feasibility of conducting a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation in those managed by a computer-driven explicit protocol versus usual care. Mechanically ventilated children aged between 2 and 17 years on pressure support and not receiving inotropes were included. After randomization, children were weaned either by usual care (n = 15) that was characterized by no protocolized decisions by attending physicians, or by a computer-driven protocol (Smartcare/PS<e2><84><a2>, Drager Medical) (n = 15). Weaning duration until first extubation was the primary outcome. For comparison, a Mann-Whitney U test was employed (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Patients characteristics at inclusion were similar. The median duration of weaning was 21 h (range 3-142 h) in the SmartCare/PS<e2><84><a2> group and 90 h (range 4-552 h) in the usual care group, p = 0.007. The rate of reintubation within 48 h after extubation and the rate of noninvasive ventilation after extubation in the SmartCare/PS<e2><84><a2> and usual care groups were 2/15 versus 1/15 and 2/15 versus 2/15, respectively.

We report EOL decision patterns in two Tunisian intensive care units [ICUs, medical (MICU) and surgical (SICU)] belonging to the same teaching hospital. METHODS: Consecutive deaths that occurred in participating ICUs over 2 years were analysed. End-of-life decisions were prospectively recorded by the senior attending physicians, while subject's characteristics were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: Deaths occurred in 326 of 1,733 ICU-admitted patients (median age: 64 years; median SAPS II at admission = 36). Overall, a decision for full support was taken in 69%, while decisions to withhold or withdraw life support were held in 22.1 and 8.9% of deaths, respectively. The rate of end-of-life decisions was similar in the MICU and the SICU. In no instance was there MV withdrawal during ICU stay. Discharging patients to die at home was observed only in the MICU (10 out of the 20 patients with a withdrawal decision). Two factors were independently associated with WH or WD decisions: a severe and ultimately fatal underlying disease was positively associated with such decisions (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.36; p = 0.003), while having an independent functional status before the ICU was associated with a decreased rate of physician decisions of WH or WD (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.67; p = 0.002).

Solarino_2011_Intecaremedi,JOUR,A national survey of Italian physicians' attitudes towards end-of-life decisions following the death of Eluana Englaro,"Solarino, Biagio and Bruno, Francesco and Frati, Giacomo and Dell'erba, Alessandro and Frati, Paola",Intensive care medicine,"BACKGROUND: Ethical issues regarding patient care have recently been raised in Italy by the case of Eluana Englaro, a 36-year-old woman who remained in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) for 17 years. There are no specific laws on the books in Italy regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In November 2008, a controversial decision by the Italian Supreme Court granted the woman's father his wish to discontinue nutrition and hydration provided to her. Because of this historic decision, the authors carried out a survey of Italian physicians' beliefs regarding end-of-life practices. METHODS: A questionnaire was e-mailed to 70,000 physicians working for the Italian Public Health System and University Medical Hospitals. RESULTS: A total of 22,219 doctors responded to the questionnaire (32.3%), of whom 17,252 (77.6%) had some experience in treating PVS patients. Nearly 70% of responding doctors were aware of PVS diagnostic criteria; most of them (61%) considered tube feeding to be a medical therapy, and 66% of respondents believed that withdrawal of assisted nutrition and hydration (ANH) might be appropriate depending on the patient's wishes. Moreover, even though 50% of doctors surveyed were not in favor of euthanasia, a significant percentage (42%) did approve of it, while 8% of this sample was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Italian doctors probably have the least experience in end-of-life decisions in Europe, therefore this national survey is a great chance to understand their authentic opinions regarding such remarkable issues. There is broad consensus that a clear legislative position regarding euthanasia and ANH is needed.",2011,10.1007/s00134-011-2132-5,37,3,542-549,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician's Role and Health Care Surveys and Advance Directives and Italy and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/*psychology and Decision Making/*ethics and Terminal Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Persistent Vegetative State and *Euthanasia, Passive/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2011/03//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tools to consistently identify those in the field with or at higher risk of developing critical illness do not exist. We sought to validate a prehospital critical illness risk score that uses objective clinical variables in a contemporary cohort of geographically and temporally distinct prehospital encounters. METHODS: We linked prehospital encounters at 21 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies to inpatient electronic health records at nine hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania from 2010 to 2012. The primary outcome was critical illness during hospitalization, defined as an intensive care unit stay with delivery of organ support (mechanical ventilation or vasopressor use). We calculated the prehospital risk score using demographics and first vital signs from eligible EMS encounters, and we tested the association between score variables and critical illness using multivariable logistic regression. Discrimination was assessed using the AUROC curve, and calibration was determined by plotting observed versus expected events across score values. Operating characteristics were calculated at score thresholds. RESULTS: Among 42,550 nontrauma, non-cardiac arrest adult EMS patients, 1926 (4.5 %) developed critical illness during hospitalization. We observed moderate discrimination of the prehospital critical illness risk score (AUROC 0.73, 95 % CI 0.72-0.74) and adequate calibration based on observed versus expected plots. At a score threshold of 2, sensitivity was 0.63 (95 % CI 0.61-0.75), specificity was 0.73 (95 % CI 0.72-0.73), negative predictive value was 0.98 (95 % CI 0.98-0.98), and positive predictive value was 0.10 (95 % CI 0.09-0.10). The risk score performance was greater with alternative definitions of critical illness, including in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.77, 95 % CI 0.7 -0.78).

We aim to identify metabolic variables at the start of advanced CPR at the scene that may be associated with two main outcomes of CPR (recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological outcome). METHODS: Prospective observational study of all non-traumatic OHCA in patients older than 17 years assisted by emergency medical services (EMS), with doctor and nurse on board, between January 2012 and December 2017. Venous blood gases were sampled upon initially obtaining venous access to determine the initial values of pH, pCO(2), HCO(3)(-), base excess (BE), Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and lactate. ROSC upon arrival at the hospital and neurological status 30 days later (Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale) were recorded. RESULTS: We included 1552 patients with OHCA with blood test data in a 6-year period. ROSC was achieved in 906 cases (58.4%), and good neurological recovery at 30 days (CPC I-II) occurred in 383 cases (24.68%). In multivariate analysis, we found a significant relationship between non-recovery of spontaneous circulation (no-ROSC) and low pH levels (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.03 (0.002-0.59), p = 0.020), high pCO(2) levels (adjusted OR 1.03 [1.01-1.05], p = 0.008) and high potassium levels (adjusted OR 2.28 [1.43-3.61], p = 0.008).

Artis_2019_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Data Omission by Physician Trainees on ICU Rounds,"Artis, Kathryn A. and Bordley, James and Mohan, Vishnu and Gold, Jeffrey A.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Incomplete patient data, either due to difficulty gathering and synthesizing or inappropriate data filtering, can lead clinicians to misdiagnosis and medical error. How completely ICU interprofessional rounding teams appraise the patient data set that informs clinical decision-making is unknown. This study measures how frequently physician trainees omit data from prerounding notes (""artifacts"") and verbal presentations during daily rounds. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical ICU with an established electronic health record and where physician trainees are the primary presenters during daily rounds. SUBJECTS: Presenters (medical student or resident physician), interprofessional rounding team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We quantified the amount and types of patient data omitted from photocopies of physician trainees' artifacts and audio recordings of oral ICU rounds presentations when compared with source electronic health record data. An audit of 157 patient presentations including 6,055 data elements across nine domains revealed 100% of presentations contained omissions. Overall, 22.9% of data were missing from artifacts and 42.4% from presentations. The interprofessional team supplemented only 4.1% of additional available data. Frequency of trainee data omission varied by data type and sociotechnical factors. The strongest predictor of trainee verbal omissions was a preceding failure to include the data on the artifact. Passive data gathering via electronic health record macros resulted in extremely complete artifacts but paradoxically predicted greater likelihood of verbal omission when compared with manual notation. Interns verbally omitted the most data, whereas medical students omitted the least. CONCLUSIONS: In an academic rounding model reliant on trainees to preview and select data for presentation during ICU rounds, verbal appraisal of patient data was highly incomplete. Additional trainee oversight and education, improved electronic health record tools, and novel academic rounding paradigms are needed to address this potential source of medical error.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003557,47,3,403-409,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Medical Audit and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and Internship and Residency/*statistics & numerical data and Students, Medical/*statistics & numerical data and Electronic Health Records/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Teaching Rounds/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Prospective, before-and-after interventional study enrolling patients with high risk of mortality, morbidity, or unmet palliative care needs in a 24-bed academic intensive care unit (ICU). The intervention involved a palliative care clinician interacting with the ICU physicians on daily rounds for high-risk patients. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled in the usual care phase, and 103 patients were enrolled during the intervention phase. The adjusted likelihood of a family meeting in ICU was 63% higher (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.14-2.07, p = 0.01), and time to family meeting was 41% shorter (95% CI 52-28% shorter, p < 0.001).

This study aimed to define when patients with sepsis would be stabilized and transitioned to persistent critical illness, and whether such transition time varies between latent classes of patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving sepsis patients in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Persistent critical illness was defined at the time when acute physiological characteristics were no longer more predictive of in-hospital mortality (i.e., vital status at hospital discharge) than antecedent characteristics. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectory classes by using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score measured during intensive care unit stay as the outcome, and persistent critical illness transition time was explored in each latent class. RESULTS: The mortality was 16.7% (3828/22,868) in the study cohort. Acute physiological model was no longer more predictive of in-hospital mortality than antecedent characteristics at 15 days after intensive care unit admission in the overall population. Only a minority of the study subjects (n = 643, 2.8%) developed persistent critical illness, but they accounted for 19% (15,834/83,125) and 10% (19,975/198,833) of the total intensive care unit and hospital bed-days, respectively. Five latent classes were identified. Classes 1 and 2 showed increasing Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score over time and transition to persistent critical illness occurred at 16 and 27 days, respectively. The remaining classes showed a steady decline in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the transition to persistent critical illness occurred between 6 and 8 days. Elevated urea-to-creatinine ratio was a good biochemical signature of persistent critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: While persistent critical illness occurred in a minority of patients with sepsis, it consumed vast medical resources.

The objectives of this review were to systematically identify RCTs in pediatric critical care and describe their methods and reporting. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and CENTRAL (from inception to April 16, 2013) and reference lists of included RCTs and relevant systematic reviews. We included published RCTs administering any intervention to children in a pediatric ICU. We excluded trials conducted in neonatal ICUs, those enrolling exclusively preterm infants, and individual patient crossover trials. Pairs of reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: We included 248 RCTs: 45 (18%) were multicentered and 14 (6%) were multinational. Trials most frequently enrolled both medical and surgical patients (43%) but postoperative cardiac surgery was the single largest population studied (19%). The most frequently evaluated types of intervention were medications (63%), devices (11%) and nutrition (8%). Laboratory or physiological measurements were the most frequent type of primary outcomes (18%). Half of these trials (50%) reported blinding. Of the 107 (43%) trials that reported an a priori sample size, 34 (32%) were stopped early. The median number of children randomized per trial was 49 and ranged from 6 to 4,947. The frequency of RCT publications increased at a mean rate of 0.7 RCTs per year (P<0.001) from 1 to 20 trials per year. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified the available RCTs in pediatric critical care and made them accessible to clinicians and researchers (http://epicc.mcmaster.ca). Most focused on medications and intermediate or surrogate outcomes, were single-centered and were conducted in North America and Western Europe.

Risk stratification tools may help identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions, but it is unclear if proper tools have been developed. METHODS: We searched Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PUBMED and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through March 2013, plus reference lists and citations of all studies included in the systematic review. Cohort studies were selected that described the derivation, validation or clinical impact of tools for predicting medical emergency team activation, ICU readmission or mortality following patient discharge from the ICU. Data were extracted on the study design, setting, population, sample size, tool (components, measurement properties) and outcomes. RESULTS: The literature search identified 9,926 citations, of which eight studies describing eight tools met the inclusion criteria. Reported outcomes included ICU readmission (n=4 studies), hospital mortality (n=3 studies) and both ICU readmission and hospital mortality (n=1 studies). Seven of the tools were comprised of distinct measurable component variables, while one tool used subjective scoring of patient risk by intensive care physicians. The areas under receiver operator curves were reported for all studies and ranged from 0.66 to 0.92. A single study provided a direct comparative analysis between two tools. We did not find any studies evaluating the impact of risk prediction on processes and outcomes of care.

Mayampurath_2020_Critcaremedi,JOUR,External Validation of an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Prediction Model Using Radiology Reports,"Mayampurath, Anoop and Churpek, Matthew M. and Su, Xin and Shah, Sameep and Munroe, Elizabeth and Patel, Bhakti and Dligach, Dmitriy and Afshar, Majid",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is frequently under recognized and associated with increased mortality. Previously, we developed a model that used machine learning and natural language processing of text from radiology reports to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome. The model showed improved performance in diagnosing acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared to a rule-based method. In this study, our objective was to externally validate the natural language processing model in patients from an independent hospital setting. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data across five prospective clinical studies. SETTING: An urban, tertiary care, academic hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to the medical ICU and at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The natural language processing model was previously derived and internally validated in burn, trauma, and medical patients at Loyola University Medical Center. Two machine learning models were examined with the following text features from qualifying radiology reports: 1) word representations (n-grams) and 2) standardized clinical named entity mentions mapped from the National Library of Medicine Unified Medical Language System. The models were externally validated in a cohort of 235 patients at the University of Chicago Medicine, among which 110 (47%) were diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome by expert annotation. During external validation, the n-gram model demonstrated good discrimination between acute respiratory distress syndrome and nonacute respiratory distress syndrome patients (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84). The n-gram model had a higher discrimination for acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared with the standardized named entity model, although not statistically significant (C-statistic 0.78 vs 0.72; p = 0.09). The most important features in the model had good face validity for acute respiratory distress syndrome characteristics but differences in frequencies did occur between hospital settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our computable phenotype for acute respiratory distress syndrome had good discrimination in external validation and may be used by other health systems for case-identification. Discrepancies in feature representation are likely due to differences in characteristics of the patient cohorts.",2020,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004468,48,9,e791-e798,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Sex Factors and Machine Learning and Prospective Studies and Socioeconomic Factors and Natural Language Processing and Reproducibility of Results and Hospitals, Urban and Age Factors and Academic Medical Centers and *Intensive Care Units and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Radiography, Thoracic/*methods and Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*diagnostic imaging/*mortality",NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pickering_2009_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Identification of patient information corruption in the intensive care unit: using a scoring tool to direct quality improvements in handover,"Pickering, Brian W. and Hurley, Killian and Marsh, Brian",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To use a handover assessment tool for identifying patient information corruption and objectively evaluating interventions designed to reduce handover errors and improve medical decision making. The continuous monitoring, intervention, and evaluation of the patient in modern intensive care unit practice generates large quantities of information, the platform on which medical decisions are made. Information corruption, defined as errors of distortion/omission compared with the medical record, may result in medical judgment errors. Identifying these errors may lead to quality improvements in intensive care unit care delivery and safety. DESIGN: Handover assessment instrument development study divided into two phases by the introduction of a handover intervention. SETTING: Closed, 17-bed, university-affiliated mixed surgical/medical intensive care unit. SUBJECTS: Senior and junior medical members of the intensive care unit team. INTERVENTIONS: Electronic handover page. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study subjects were asked to recall clinical information commonly discussed at handover on individual patients. The handover score measured the percentage of information correctly retained for each individual doctor-patient interaction. The clinical intention score, a subjective measure of medical judgment, was graded (1-5) by three blinded intensive care unit experts. A total of 137 interactions were scored. Median (interquartile range) handover scores for phases 1 and 2 were 79.07% (67.44-84.50) and 83.72% (76.16-88.37), respectively. Score variance was reduced by the handover intervention (p < .05). Increasing median handover scores, 68.60 to 83.72, were associated with increases in clinical intention scores from 1 to 5 (chi-square = 23.59, df = 4, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: When asked to recall clinical information discussed at handover, medical members of the intensive care unit team provide data that are significantly corrupted compared with the medical record. Low subjective clinical judgment scores are significant associated with low handover scores. The handover/clinical intention scores may, therefore, be useful screening tools for intensive care unit system vulnerability to medical error. Additionally, handover instruments can identify interventions that reduce system vulnerability to error and may be used to guide quality improvements in handover practice.",2009,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181a96267,37,11,2905-2912,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Quality Assurance, Health Care and Surveys and Questionnaires and Mental Recall and *Medical Records and *Continuity of Patient Care and *Quality Indicators, Health Care and Intensive Care Units/*organization & administration and Medical Errors/prevention & control",NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Walter_2008_Critcaremedi,JOUR,How decisions are made to admit patients to medical intensive care units (MICUs): a survey of MICU directors at academic medical centers across the United States,"Walter, Kristin L. and Siegler, Mark and Hall, Jesse B.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To determine how medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission decisions are made at U.S. academic MICUs and to learn how these practices compare with the recommendations of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the American Thoracic Society. DESIGN: A 22-question Web-based survey. SETTING: University health sciences centers. SUBJECTS: MICU directors at academic U.S. medical centers offering fellowship programs in pulmonary/critical care or critical care medicine. INTERVENTIONS: The survey was sent by E-mail to 146 academic MICU directors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survey response rate was 83% (121/146). MICU attendings were the primary decision-maker for patient admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in 40% of the MICUs during daytime hours, in 36% on weekends, and in 27% overnight. Critical care fellows and resident house staff were often responsible for making MICU admission decisions, particularly overnight and on weekends. Of the MICUs surveyed, 88% had written admission guidelines, although only 25% used them on a regular basis. Written restriction guidelines were present in only 21% of these ICUs, although 53% of MICU directors believed that MICUs should have standardized criteria for restricting admission to the ICU. Finally, 29% of MICUs surveyed did not authorize MICU attendings to deny ICU admission on a case-by-case basis for futile or inadvisable care, thereby maintaining an open door policy for ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Significant practice variability exists across U.S. academic MICUs regarding how decisions are made to admit patients to the ICU.

Here we start a discourse (with a continuation of the dialogue in Ethics of Outbreaks Position Statement. Part 2: Family-Centered Care) concerning the ethics of the provision of medical care, research challenges and behaviors during a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a focus on the proper conduct of clinical or epidemiologic research, clinical trial designs, unregistered medical interventions (including vaccine introduction, devices, pharmaceuticals, who gets treated, vulnerable populations, and methods of data collection), economic losses, and whether there is a duty of health care providers to provide care in such emergencies, and highlighting the need to understand cultural diversity and local communities in these efforts. DESIGN: Development of a Society of Critical Care Medicine position statement using literature review and expert consensus from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Ethics committee. The committee had representation from ethics, medical philosophy, critical care, nursing, internal medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology, surgery, and members with international health and military experience. SETTING: Provision of therapies for patients who are critically ill or who have the potential of becoming critically ill, and their families, regarding medical therapies and the extent of treatments. POPULATION: Critically ill patients and their families affected by a Public Health Emergency of International Concern that need provision of medical therapies. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN RESULTS: Interventions by high income countries in a Public Health Emergency of International Concern must always be cognizant of avoiding a paternalistic stance and must understand how families and communities are structured and the regional/local traditions that affect public discourse. Additionally, the obligations, or the lack of obligations, of healthcare providers regarding the treatment of affected individuals and communities must also be acknowledged.

Neri_2007_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Toward an ultrasound curriculum for critical care medicine,"Neri, Luca and Storti, Enrico and Lichtenstein, Daniel",Critical care medicine,"Accurate assessment and rapid decision-making are essential to save lives and improve performance in critical care medicine. Real-time point-of-care ultrasound has become an invaluable adjunct to the clinical evaluation of critically ill and injured patients both for pre- and in-hospital situations. However, a high level of quality is necessary, guaranteed by appropriate education, experience, credentialing, quality control, continuing education, and professional development. Although educational recommendations have been proposed by a variety of nonimaging specialties, to date they are still scattered and limited examples of standards for critical and intensive care professionals. The challenge of providing adequate specialty-specific training, as encouraged by major medical societies, is made even more difficult by the diversity of critical care ultrasound utilization by various subspecialties in a variety of settings and numerous countries. In order to meet this educational challenge, a standard core curriculum is presented in this manuscript. The proposed curriculum is built on a competence, performance, and outcomes-based approach that is tailored to setting-specific training needs and prioritized according to critical problem-based pathways, rather than traditional organ-based systems. A multiple goal-oriented style fully addresses the specialty-specific approach of critical and intensive care professionals, who typically deal with disease states in complex scenarios rather than individual organ complaints. Because of the variation in the concept of what constitutes critical care worldwide, and the rate of change of information and technology, this manuscript attempts to present a learning system addressing a variety of needs for a rapidly changing world.",2007,10.1097/01.CCM.0000260680.16213.26,35,5 Suppl,304-S290,eng,0090-3493,"Curriculum and Humans and International Cooperation and Problem-Based Learning and Models, Educational and Clinical Competence and *Critical Care and *Ultrasonography and *Education, Medical, Continuing",NA,NA,2007/05//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Downar_2016_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Guidelines for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures,"Downar, James and Delaney, Jesse W. and Hawryluck, Laura and Kenny, Lisa",Intensive care medicine,"BACKGROUND: Withdrawal of life-sustaining measures is a common event in the intensive care unit yet it involves a complex balance of medical, legal and ethical considerations. Very few healthcare providers have been specifically trained to withdraw life-sustaining measures, and no comprehensive guidelines exist to help ensure clinicians deliver the highest quality of care to patients and families. Hence, we sought to develop guidelines for the process of withdrawing life-sustaining measures in the clinical setting. METHODS: We convened an interdisciplinary group of ICU care providers from the Canadian Critical Care Society and the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses, and used a modified Delphi process to answer key clinical and ethical questions identified in the literature. RESULTS: A total of 39 experienced clinicians completed the initial workshop, and 36 were involved in the subsequent Delphi rounds. The group developed a series of guidelines to address (1) preparing for withdrawal of life-sustaining measures; (2) assessment of distress; (3) pharmaceutical management of distress; and (4) discontinuation of life-sustaining measures and monitoring. The group achieved consensus on all aspects of the guidelines after the third Delphi round. CONCLUSION: We present these guidelines to help physicians provide high-quality end of life (EOL) care in the ICU.

Smith_2019_Intecaremedi,JOUR,Acute ischaemic stroke: challenges for the intensivist,"Smith, M. and Reddy, U. and Robba, C. and Sharma, D. and Citerio, G.",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: To provide an update about the rapidly developing changes in the critical care management of acute ischaemic stroke patients. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted in five general areas of acute ischaemic stroke management: reperfusion strategies, anesthesia for endovascular thrombectomy, intensive care unit management, intracranial complications, and ethical considerations. RESULTS: The introduction of effective reperfusion strategies, including IV thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, has revolutionized the management of acute ischaemic stroke and transformed outcomes for patients. Acute therapeutic efforts are targeted to restoring blood flow to the ischaemic penumbra before irreversible tissue injury has occurred. To optimize patient outcomes, secondary insults, such as hypotension, hyperthermia, or hyperglycaemia, that can extend the penumbral area must also be prevented or corrected. The ICU management of acute ischaemic stroke patients, therefore, focuses on the optimization of systemic physiological homeostasis, management of intracranial complications, and neurological and haemodynamic monitoring after reperfusion therapies. Meticulous blood pressure management is of central importance in improving outcomes, particularly in patients that have undergone reperfusion therapies. CONCLUSIONS: While consensus guidelines are available to guide clinical decision making after acute ischaemic stroke, there is limited high-quality evidence for many of the recommended interventions. However, a bundle of medical, endovascular, and surgical strategies, when applied in a timely and consistent manner, can improve long-term stroke outcomes.",2019,10.1007/s00134-019-05705-y,45,9,1177-1189,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,Humans and Treatment Outcome and Anesthesia and Intensive care and Acute ischaemic stroke and Brain Ischemia/physiopathology/*therapy and Decompressive craniectomy and Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/methods/trends and Endovascular thrombectomy and Internal Medicine/methods/trends and Penumbra and Reperfusion/adverse effects/methods/trends and Stroke/physiopathology/*therapy and Thrombolysis and Thrombolytic Therapy/adverse effects/methods/trends,NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The design is a single-blinded block randomised controlled trial. A single large academic medical centre is the setting. METHODS: Sixteen neurologically stable but severely brain injured patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 8 or less were randomised to early or delayed extubation until their neurological examination improved. Eligible patients met standard respiratory criteria for extubation and passed a modified Airway Care Score (ACS) to ensure adequate control of respiratory secretions. The primary outcome measured between groups was the functional status of the patient at hospital discharge as measured by a Modified Rankin Score (MRS) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Secondary measurements included the number of nosocomial pneumonias and re-intubations, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay. Standard statistical assessments were employed for analysis. RESULTS: Five female and eleven male patients ranging in age from 30 to 93 years were enrolled. Aetiologies responsible for the neurological injury included six head traumas, three brain tumours, two intracerebral haemorrhages, two subarachnoid haemorrhages and three ischaemic strokes. There were no demographic differences between the groups. There were no unexpected deaths and no significant differences in secondary measures. The difference in means between the MRS and FIM were small (0.25 and 5.62, respectively). These results suggest that between 64 and 110 patients are needed in each treatment arm to detect a treatment effect with 80% power.

METHODS: A multicentre cohort study in 11 university hospitals from seven countries, evaluating triage decisions and outcomes of patients referred for admission to ICU who were either accepted, or refused and treated on the ward. Confounding in the estimation of the effect of ICU admission on mortality was controlled by use of a propensity score approach, which adjusted for the probability of being admitted. Variability across centres was accounted for in both analyses of factors influencing ICU admission and effect of ICU admission on mortality. RESULTS: Eligible were 8,616 triages in 7,877 patients referred for ICU admission. Variables positively associated with probability of being admitted to ICU included: ventilators in ward; bed availability; Karnofsky score; absence of comorbidity; presence of haematological malignancy; emergency surgery and elective surgery (versus medical treatment); trauma, vascular involvement, liver involvement; acute physiologic score II; ICU treatment (versus ICU observation). Multiple triages during patient's hospital stay and age were negatively associated with ICU admission. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the model was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-0.84], with Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.300. ICU admission was associated with a statistically significant reduction of both 28-day mortality [odds ratio (OR): 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.87] and 90-day mortality (0.79; 0.66-0.93). The benefit of ICU admission increased substantially in patients with greater severity of illness. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that intensivists take great care to avoid ICU admission of patients judged not severe enough for ICU or with low performance status, and they tend to admit surgical patients more readily than medical patients. Interestingly, they do not judge age per se as a reason for refusal of ICU admission.

We sought to determine whether this survival gain extends to the high-risk subgroup of patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Cirrhotic patients with septic shock admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) during two consecutive periods (1997-2004 and 2005-2010) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Forty-seven and 42 cirrhotic patients presented with septic shock in 1997-2004 and 2005-2010, respectively. The recent period differed from the previous one by implementation of adjuvant treatments of septic shock including albumin infusion as fluid volume therapy, low-dose glucocorticoids, and intensive insulin therapy. ICU and hospital survival markedly improved over time (40% in 2005-2010 vs. 17% in 1997-2004, P = 0.02 and 29% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.009, respectively). Furthermore, this survival gain in the latter period was sustained for 6 months (survival rate 24% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.06). After adjustment with age, the liver disease stage (Child-Pugh score), and the critical illness severity score (SOFA score), ICU admission between 2005 and 2010 remained an independent favorable prognostic factor (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.4, P = 0.004). The stage of the underlying liver disease was also independently associated with hospital mortality (Child-Pugh score: OR 1.42 per point, 95% CI 1.06-1.9, P = 0.018).

Kalil_2014_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Bayesian methodology for the design and interpretation of clinical trials in critical care medicine: a primer for clinicians,"Kalil, Andre C. and Sun, Junfeng",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To review Bayesian methodology and its utility to clinical decision making and research in the critical care field. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: Clinical, epidemiological, and biostatistical studies on Bayesian methods in PubMed and Embase from their inception to December 2013. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bayesian methods have been extensively used by a wide range of scientific fields, including astronomy, engineering, chemistry, genetics, physics, geology, paleontology, climatology, cryptography, linguistics, ecology, and computational sciences. The application of medical knowledge in clinical research is analogous to the application of medical knowledge in clinical practice. Bedside physicians have to make most diagnostic and treatment decisions on critically ill patients every day without clear-cut evidence-based medicine (more subjective than objective evidence). Similarly, clinical researchers have to make most decisions about trial design with limited available data. Bayesian methodology allows both subjective and objective aspects of knowledge to be formally measured and transparently incorporated into the design, execution, and interpretation of clinical trials. In addition, various degrees of knowledge and several hypotheses can be tested at the same time in a single clinical trial without the risk of multiplicity. Notably, the Bayesian technology is naturally suited for the interpretation of clinical trial findings for the individualized care of critically ill patients and for the optimization of public health policies. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the application of the versatile Bayesian methodology in conjunction with the conventional statistical methods is not only ripe for actual use in critical care clinical research but it is also a necessary step to maximize the performance of clinical trials and its translation to the practice of critical care medicine.",2014,10.1097/CCM.0000000000000576,42,10,2267-2277,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Reproducibility of Results and Meta-Analysis as Topic and *Bayes Theorem and Critical Care/*methods/standards and Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards and Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods/standards and Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/methods/standards and Comparative Effectiveness Research/methods/standards and Statistics as Topic/methods/standards",NA,NA,2014/10//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to explore the perceptions of acute care practitioners to determine whether they perceived nonbeneficial treatment to be a problem, to generate an acceptable definition of nonbeneficial treatment, to learn about their perceptions of the impact and causes of nonbeneficial treatment, and the ways that they feel could reduce or resolve nonbeneficial treatment. DESIGN: National, bilingual, cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of nursing and medical staff who provide direct patient care in acute medical wards or ICUs in Canada. MAIN RESULTS: We received 688 responses (response rate 61%) from 11 sites. Seventy-four percent of respondents were nurses. Eighty-two percent of respondents believe that our current means of resolving nonbeneficial treatment are inadequate. The most acceptable definitions of nonbeneficial treatment were ""advanced curative/life-prolonging treatments that would almost certainly result in a quality of life that the patient has previously stated that he/she would not want"" (88% agreement) and ""advanced curative/life-prolonging treatments that are not consistent with the goals of care (as indicated by the patient)"" (83% agreement). Respondents most commonly believed that nonbeneficial treatment was caused by substitute decision makers who do not understand the limitations of treatment, or who cannot accept a poor prognosis (90% agreement for each cause), and 52% believed that nonbeneficial treatment was ""often"" or ""always"" continued until the patient died or was discharged from hospital. Respondents believed that nonbeneficial treatment was a common problem with a negative impact on all stakeholders (> 80%) and perceived that improved advance care planning and communication training would be the most effective (92% and 88%, respectively) and morally acceptable (95% and 92%, respectively) means to resolve the problem of nonbeneficial treatment.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics, vital signs, diagnostics, and interventions were used in a Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm to predict serum creatinine-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 2 acute kidney injury, with 60% of the data used for derivation and 40% for validation. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in the validation cohort, and subgroup analyses were conducted across admission serum creatinine, acute kidney injury severity, and hospital location. Among the 121,158 included patients, 17,482 (14.4%) developed any Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury, with 4,251 (3.5%) developing stage 2. The AUC (95% CI) was 0.90 (0.90-0.90) for predicting stage 2 acute kidney injury within 24 hours and 0.87 (0.87-0.87) within 48 hours. The AUC was 0.96 (0.96-0.96) for receipt of renal replacement therapy (n = 821) in the next 48 hours. Accuracy was similar across hospital settings (ICU, wards, and emergency department) and admitting serum creatinine groupings. At a probability threshold of greater than or equal to 0.022, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 85% for stage 2 acute kidney injury and predicted the development of stage 2 a median of 41 hours (interquartile range, 12-141 hr) prior to the development of stage 2 acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available electronic health record data can be used to predict impending acute kidney injury prior to changes in serum creatinine with excellent accuracy across different patient locations and admission serum creatinine. Real-time use of this model would allow early interventions for those at high risk of acute kidney injury.",2018,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003123,46,7,1070-1077,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Electronic Health Records and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Algorithms and Reproducibility of Results and Area Under Curve and ROC Curve and Models, Statistical and *Machine Learning and Creatinine/blood and Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/*etiology and Renal Replacement Therapy/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kubler_2011_Intecaremedi,JOUR,End-of-life attitudes of intensive care physicians in Poland: results of a national survey,"Kubler, Andrzej and Adamik, Barbara and Lipinska-Gediga, Malgorzata and Kedziora, Jaroslaw and Strozecki, Lukasz",Intensive care medicine,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the ethical attitudes and practices of intensive care physicians regarding life-sustaining treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) in Poland. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to intensive care physicians taking part in a national medical congress. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed, of which 217 (54%) were returned completed. Almost all respondents (93%) reported having withheld therapy, and 75% of respondents reported withdrawing therapy. Physicians aged 40 years and over who had no religious affiliation more frequently reported withholding treatment. Only 5% of physicians reported deliberately administering drugs until death ensued. Respondents from large hospitals (more than 400 beds) more easily accepted foregoing life-sustaining therapy in ICU patients. In clinical scenario in which the family demanded the maximum available treatment, physicians reported that they were considerably influenced to modify decisions concerning life-sustaining therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ethical attitudes of intensive care physicians regarding end-of-life decisions are similar to the opinion presented in other European survey studies. The practice of withholding and withdrawing therapy in ICU patients is common in Poland. Actively shortening life is considered unacceptable. The request of the family even without legal consultation can influence physicians' decisions.",2011,10.1007/s00134-011-2269-2,37,8,1290-1296,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Sex Factors and Health Care Surveys and Quality of Life and Age Factors and Poland and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Decision Making/ethics and Intensive Care Units/*ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics/statistics & numerical data and Withholding Treatment/*ethics/statistics & numerical data and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and Physicians/*ethics/psychology and Catholicism and Euthanasia, Active/*ethics/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2011/08//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aulisio_2007_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Taking values seriously: Ethical challenges in organ donation and transplantation for critical care professionals,"Aulisio, Mark P. and Devita, Michael and Luebke, Donna",Critical care medicine,"Last year, >28,000 people received organ transplants from >14,000 donors in the United States. Unfortunately, the wait list now tops 91,000, with the gap between recipient needs and available donor organs at around 60,000. This has motivated a host of efforts to increase organ supply, including driver's license and donor registry initiatives, educational and advertising campaigns, and ""required request"" and mandatory Organ Procurement Organization notification when a patient's death is imminent. Other more controversial efforts to increase the donor pool include expanded criteria for cadaveric donors, such as older or sicker donors and so-called non-heart-beating donation, now referred to as donation after cardiac death. Perhaps the most controversial of all efforts to address the organ shortage have focused on increasing the number of living organ donors, which in 2001 for the first time exceeded the number of cadaveric donors. Critical care professionals know the sad reality behind the statistical scarcity of organ supply. They must manage anxious patients and family members who may be waiting for an organ that never comes, triage patients into and out of the intensive care unit, and work through the propriety of shifting goals from cure to comfort when those same patients deteriorate to the point that transplant may no longer be an appropriate medical option or when a transplant fails. Equally significant ethical challenges arise on the donor side, whether it is working through difficult end-of-life decisions, identifying when to call the organ procurement organization, caring for brain-dead patients, managing a candidate for donation after cardiac death, or caring for a living donor postoperatively. This article discusses some of the difficult ethical challenges raised by organ donation and transplantation for critical care professionals, focusing on end-of-life decision making, donation after cardiac death, and living organ donation.",2007,10.1097/01.CCM.0000252915.76019.19,35,2 Suppl,101-S95,eng,0090-3493,"Humans and Decision Making/ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and Critical Care/*ethics and Terminal Care/ethics and Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics and Organ Transplantation/*ethics",NA,NA,2007/02//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis of physician subjects participating in a simulation scenario using hospital set, actors, medical chart, and vital signs tracings. The simulation depicted a 78-yr-old man with metastatic gastric cancer, life-threatening hypoxia most likely attributable to cancer progression, and stable preferences to avoid intensive care unit admission and intubation. Two independent raters assessed the simulations and subjects completed a postsimulation web-based survey and debriefing interview. SETTING: Peter M. Winter Institute for Simulation Education and Research at the University of Pittsburgh. SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven hospital-based attending physicians, including 6 emergency physicians, 13 hospitalists, and 8 intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes included qualitative report of clinical verisimilitude during the debriefing interview, survey-reported diagnosis and prognosis, and observed treatment decisions. Independent variables included physician demographics, risk attitude, and reactions to uncertainty. All (100%) reported that the case and simulation were highly realistic, and their diagnostic and prognostic assessments were consistent with our intent. Eight physicians (29.6%) admitted the patient to the intensive care unit. Among the eight physicians who admitted the patient to the intensive care unit, three (37%) initiated palliation, two (25%) documented the patient's code status (do not intubate/do not resuscitate), and one intubated the patient. Among the 19 physicians who did not admit the patient to the intensive care unit, 13 (68%) initiated palliation and 5 (42%) documented code status. Intensivists and emergency physicians (p = 0.048) were more likely to admit the patient to the intensive care unit. Years since medical school graduation were inversely associated with the initiation of palliative care (p = 0.043).

Artis_2017_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Accuracy of Laboratory Data Communication on ICU Daily Rounds Using an Electronic Health Record,"Artis, Kathryn A. and Dyer, Edward and Mohan, Vishnu and Gold, Jeffrey A.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Accurately communicating patient data during daily ICU rounds is critically important since data provide the basis for clinical decision making. Despite its importance, high fidelity data communication during interprofessional ICU rounds is assumed, yet unproven. We created a robust but simple methodology to measure the prevalence of inaccurately communicated (misrepresented) data and to characterize data communication failures by type. We also assessed how commonly the rounding team detected data misrepresentation and whether data communication was impacted by environmental, human, and workflow factors. DESIGN: Direct observation of verbalized laboratory data during daily ICU rounds compared with data within the electronic health record and on presenters' paper prerounding notes. SETTING: Twenty-six-bed academic medical ICU with a well-established electronic health record. SUBJECTS: ICU rounds presenter (medical student or resident physician), interprofessional rounding team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During 301 observed patient presentations including 4,945 audited laboratory results, presenters used a paper prerounding tool for 94.3% of presentations but tools contained only 78% of available electronic health record laboratory data. Ninty-six percent of patient presentations included at least one laboratory misrepresentation (mean, 6.3 per patient) and 38.9% of all audited laboratory data were inaccurately communicated. Most misrepresentation events were omissions. Only 7.8% of all laboratory misrepresentations were detected. CONCLUSION: Despite a structured interprofessional rounding script and a well-established electronic health record, clinician laboratory data retrieval and communication during ICU rounds at our institution was poor, prone to omissions and inaccuracies, yet largely unrecognized by the rounding team. This highlights an important patient safety issue that is likely widely prevalent, yet underrecognized.",2017,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002060,45,2,179-186,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,Humans and Patient Care Team and Interprofessional Relations and *Communication and *Electronic Health Records and Intensive Care Units/standards/*statistics & numerical data and *Clinical Laboratory Techniques/standards/statistics & numerical data and *Teaching Rounds/methods/standards,NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chiarchiaro_2016_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Conflict Management Strategies in the ICU Differ Between Palliative Care Specialists and Intensivists,"Chiarchiaro, Jared and White, Douglas B. and Ernecoff, Natalie C. and Buddadhumaruk, Praewpannarai and Schuster, Rachel A. and Arnold, Robert M.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Conflict is common between physicians and surrogate decision makers around end-of-life care in ICU. Involving experts in conflict management improve outcomes, but little is known about what differences in conflict management styles may explain the benefit. We used simulation to examine potential differences in how palliative care specialists manage conflict with surrogates about end-of-life treatment decisions in ICUs compared with intensivists. DESIGN: Subjects participated in a high-fidelity simulation of conflict with a surrogate in an ICU. In this simulation, a medical actor portrayed a surrogate decision maker during an ICU family meeting who refuses to follow an advance directive that clearly declines advanced life-sustaining therapies. We audiorecorded the simulation encounters and applied a coding framework to quantify conflict management behaviors, which was organized into two categories: task-focused communication and relationship building. We used negative binomial modeling to determine whether there were differences between palliative care specialists' and intensivists' use of task-focused communication and relationship building. SETTING: Single academic medical center ICU. SUBJECTS: Palliative care specialists and intensivists. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled 11 palliative care specialists and 25 intensivists. The palliative care specialists were all attending physicians. The intensivist group consisted of 11 attending physicians, 9 pulmonary and critical care fellows, and 5 internal medicine residents rotating in the ICU. We excluded five residents from the primary analysis in order to reduce confounding due to training level. Physicians' mean age was 37 years with a mean of 8 years in practice. Palliative care specialists used 55% fewer task-focused communication statements (incidence rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.83; p = 0.005) and 48% more relationship-building statements (incidence rate ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.89-2.46; p = 0.13) compared with intensivists. CONCLUSIONS: We found that palliative care specialists engage in less task-focused communication when managing conflict with surrogates compared with intensivists. These differences may help explain the benefit of palliative care involvement in conflict and could be the focus of interventions to improve clinicians' conflict resolution skills.",2016,10.1097/CCM.0000000000001583,44,5,934-942,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Specialization and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Academic Medical Centers and *Communication and *Medical Staff, Hospital and *Palliative Care and Intensive Care Units/*organization & administration and Advance Directive Adherence and Terminal Care/*organization & administration and Negotiating/*methods",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chiarchiaro_2015_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Quality of communication in the ICU and surrogate's understanding of prognosis,"Chiarchiaro, Jared and Buddadhumaruk, Praewpannarai and Arnold, Robert M. and White, Douglas B.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Although misperceptions about prognosis by surrogates in ICUs are common and influence treatment decisions, there is no validated, practical way to measure the effectiveness of prognostic communication. Surrogates' subjective ratings of quality of communication have been used in other domains as markers of effectiveness of communication. We sought to determine whether surrogates' subjective ratings of the quality of prognostic communication predict accurate expectation about prognosis by surrogates. DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional cohort study. Surrogates rated the quality of prognostic communication by survey. Physicians and surrogates gave their percentage estimate of patient survival on ICU day 3 on a 0-100 probability scale. We defined discordance about prognosis as a difference in the physician's and surrogate's estimates of greater than or equal to <c2><b1>20%. We used multilevel logistic regression modeling to account for clustering under physicians and patients and adjust for confounders. SETTING: Medical-surgical, trauma, cardiac, and neurologic ICUs of five U.S. academic medical centers located in California, Pennsylvania, Washington, North Carolina, and Massachusetts. PATIENTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome at high risk of death or severe functional impairment, their 546 surrogate decision makers, and their 150 physicians. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no predictive utility of surrogates' ratings of the quality of communication about prognosis to identify inaccurate expectations about prognosis (odds ratio, 1.04 <c2><b1> 0.07; p = 0.54). Surrogates' subjective ratings of the quality of communication about prognosis were high, as assessed with a variety of questions. Discordant prognostic estimates were present in 63.5% (95% CI, 59.0-67.9) of physician-surrogate pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surrogates rate the quality of prognostic communication high, inaccurate expectations about prognosis are common among surrogates.

Sanders_2011_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Partial do-not-resuscitate orders: A hazard to patient safety and clinical outcomes?,"Sanders, Alan and Schepp, Melissa and Baird, Marianne",Critical care medicine,"BACKGROUND: Patients and families commonly discuss end-of-life decisions with clinicians to create a treatment plan based on patient wishes. In some instances, respect for patient autonomy in making choices may create the potential for patient harm. Medical treatments are often performed in groupings in order to work effectively. When such combinations are separated as a result of patient or surrogate choices, critical elements of life- saving care may be omitted, and the patient may receive nonbeneficial or harmful treatment. A partial do-not-resuscitate order may serve as an example. LITERATURE REVIEW AND DISCUSSION: The limited literature available regarding partial do-not-resuscitate order(s) suggests the practice is clinically and ethically problematic. Not much is known about the prevalence of these orders, but some clinicians believe they are a growing phenomenon. Medical and bioethics organizations have produced guidelines and recommendations on the use of full do-not-resuscitate order(s) with little mention of partial do-not-resuscitate order(s). Partial do-not-resuscitate order(s) are designed based on the patient's anticipated need for resuscitation and are intended to manage dying in a tolerable manner based on what the decision maker believes is ""best."" Through an analysis of the medical literature, we propose that a partial do-not-resuscitate order contradicts this ""best"" management intention because it is impossible for the decision maker, or care providers, to anticipate all possible prearrest and arrest situations. We propose that a partial do-not-resuscitate order highlights larger problems: 1) a misunderstanding of the meaning and scope of a do-not-resuscitate order and 2) a need for discussions around goals of care. CONCLUSION: Discouraging partial do-not-resuscitate(s) order may help promote more accurate and comprehensive advance care planning.",2011,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181feb8f6,39,1,14-18,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,United States and Humans and Safety Management and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Decision Making and Family Relations and Informed Consent and *Advance Care Planning and Resuscitation Orders/*ethics and Heart Arrest/mortality/*therapy and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/trends and Life Support Care/trends,NA,NA,2011/01//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clinical Protocols and Trainee Knowledge About Mechanical Ventilation. JAMA. 2011; 306(9):935-941. PubMed PMID: 21900133 This is available on http://www.pubmed.gov BACKGROUND: Clinical protocols are associated with improved patient outcomes; however, they may negatively affect medical education by removing trainees from clinical decision making. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between critical care training with mechanical ventilation protocols and subsequent knowledge about ventilator management. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort equivalence study linking a national survey of mechanical ventilation protocol availability with knowledge about mechanical ventilation. Exposure to protocols was defined as high intensity if an intensive care unit had 2 or more protocols for at least 3 years and as low intensity if 0 or 1 protocol. SETTING: Accredited US pulmonary and critical care fellowship programs. SUBJECTS: First-time examinees of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Critical Care Medicine Certification Examination in 2008 and 2009. INTERVENTION: N/AOutcomes: Knowledge, measured by performance on examination questions specific to mechanical ventilation management, calculated as a mechanical ventilation score using item response theory. The score is standardized to a mean (SD) of 500 (100), and a clinically important difference is defined as 25. Variables included in adjusted analyses were birth country, residency training country, and overall first-attempt score on the ABIM Internal Medicine Certification Examination. RESULTS: The 90 of 129 programs (70%) responded to the survey. Seventy seven programs (86%) had protocols for ventilation liberation, 66 (73%) for sedation management, and 54 (60%) for lung-protective ventilation at the time of the survey. Eighty eight (98%) of these programs had trainees who completed the ABIM Critical Care Medicine Certification Examination, totaling 553 examinees. Of these 88 programs, 27 (31%) had 0 protocols, 19 (22%) had 1 protocol, 24 (27%) had 2 protocols, and 18 (20%) had 3 protocols for at least 3 years. 42 programs (48%) were classified as high intensity and 46 (52%) as low intensity, with 304 trainees (55%) and 249 trainees (45%), respectively. In bi-variable analysis, no difference in mean scores was observed in high-intensity (497; 95% CI, 486-507) vs low-intensity programs (497; 95% CI, 485-509). Mean difference was 0 (95% CI, -16 to 16), with a positive value indicating a higher score in the high-intensity group. In multivariable analyses, no association of training was observed in a high-intensity program with mechanical ventilation score (adjusted mean difference, -5.36; 95% CI, -20.7 to 10.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among first-time ABIM Critical Care Medicine Certification Examination examinees, training in a high-intensity ventilator protocol environment compared with a low-intensity environment was not associated with worse performance on examination questions about mechanical ventilation management.",2012,10.1186/cc11257,16,2,307,eng,1466-609X 1364-8535,NA,NA,NA,2012/12/12/,Crit Care,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: The Society of Critical Care Medicine, American College of Clinical Pharmacy Critical Care Practice and Research Network, and the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists convened a joint task force of 15 pharmacists representing a broad cross-section of critical care pharmacy practice and pharmacy administration, inclusive of geography, critical care practice setting, and roles. The Task Force chairs reviewed and organized primary literature, outlined topic domains, and prepared the methodology for group review and consensus. A modified Delphi method was used until consensus (> 66% agreement) was reached for each practice recommendation. Previous position statement recommendations were reviewed and voted to either retain, revise, or retire. Recommendations were categorized by level of ICU service to be applicable by setting, and grouped into five domains: patient care, quality improvement, research and scholarship, training and education, and professional development. MAIN RESULTS: There are 82 recommendation statements: forty-four original recommendations and 38 new recommendation statements. Thirty-four recommendations were made for patient care, primarily relating to critical care pharmacist duties and pharmacy services. In the quality improvement domain, 21 recommendations address the role of the critical care pharmacist in patient and medication safety, clinical quality programs, and analytics. Nine recommendations were made in the domain of research and scholarship. Ten recommendations are in the domain of training and education and eight recommendations regarding professional development.

DESIGN: Experimental within-subjects comparison. SETTING: High-fidelity patient simulator. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve residents in an Internal Medicine Program at various stages of training (range, 1-35 mos). MEASUREMENTS: Performance was studied during 26 hrs of continuous wakefulness at four time points (8:00-10:00 am, 2:00-4:00 pm, 2:00-4:00 am, and 8:00-10:00 am the next day) using high-fidelity patient simulation. At each session, residents managed eight simulated dysrhythmias according to advanced cardiac life support protocols (advanced cardiac life support scenarios) and then managed a simulated critically ill patient (e.g., patient with meningitis) to test more complicated clinical decision-making (complex scenario). The frequency of previously defined major medical errors (i.e., action or inaction that likely would have resulted in significant harm in a real patient) was assessed by a scorer blinded to the time of the session. For each complex scenario, a global score between 0 and 100 was also given for overall performance. The impact of wakefulness on performance was assessed by using longitudinal mixed-effects models. RESULTS: For the complex scenarios, the mean number of errors increased from 0.92 +/- 0.90 in the first session to 1.58 +/- 0.79 in the fourth session (p = .09), and mean global score decreased from 56.8 +/- 14.6 to 49.6 +/- 12.6 (p = .02). For the advanced cardiac life support scenarios, the mean number of major errors committed in the advanced cardiac life support scenarios decreased during the study period (p = .01). However, essentially all of the improvement occurred between the first and second time points, suggesting that a substantial learning effect accounted for the findings.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTINGS: Fifteen acute critical care medical centers in Japan. PATIENTS: In total, 796 consecutive trauma patients who were admitted to emergency departments with an injury severity score of greater than or equal to 16 from January 2012 to December 2012. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All data were retrospectively collected, including laboratory data on arrival. Sensitivities to predict trauma death within 28 days of prothrombin time international normalized ratio greater than 1.50, pH less than 7.2, and body temperature less than 35<c2><b0>C were 15.7%, 17.5%, and 15.9%, respectively, and corresponding specificities of these were 96.4%, 96.6%, and 93.6%, respectively. The best predictors associated with hemostatic disorder and acidosis were fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product and base excess (the cutoff values were 88.8 <c2><b5>g/mL and -3.05 mmol/L). The optimal cutoff value of hypothermia was 36.0<c2><b0>C. The impact of the fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product and base excess abnormality on the outcome were approximately three- and two-folds compared with those of hypothermia. Using these variables, if the patient had a hemostatic disorder alone or a combined disorder with acidosis and hypothermia, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.7% and 66.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the low sensitivity and high specificity, conventional criteria were unsuitable as prognostic indicators.

Kayser_2020_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Conflict Management in the ICU,"Kayser, Joshua B. and Kaplan, Lewis J.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To provide a concise review of data and literature pertaining to the etiologies of conflict in the ICU, as well as current approaches to conflict management. DATA SOURCES: Detailed search strategy using PubMed and OVID Medline for English language articles describing conflict in the ICU as well as prevention and management strategies. STUDY SELECTION: Descriptive and interventional studies addressing conflict, bioethics, clinical ethics consultation, palliative care medicine, conflict management, and conflict mediation in critical care. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant descriptions or studies were reviewed, and the following aspects of each manuscript were identified, abstracted, and analyzed: setting, study population, aims, methods, results, and relevant implications for critical care practice and training. DATA SYNTHESIS: Conflict frequently erupts in the ICU between patients and families and care teams, as well as within and between care teams. Conflict engenders a host of untoward consequences for patients, families, clinicians, and facilities rendering abrogating conflict a key priority for all. Conflict etiologies are diverse but understood in terms of a framework of triggers. Identifying and de-escalating conflict before it become intractable is a preferred approach. Approaches to conflict management include utilizing clinical ethics consultation, and palliative care medicine clinicians. Conflict Management is a new technique that all ICU clinicians may use to identify and manage conflict. Entrenched conflict appears to benefit from Bioethics Mediation, an approach that uses a neutral, unaligned mediator to guide parties to a mutually acceptable resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Conflict commonly occurs in the ICU around difficult and complex decision-making. Patients, families, clinicians, and institutions suffer undesirable consequences resulting from conflict, establishing conflict prevention and resolution as key priorities. A variety of approaches may successfully identify, manage, and prevent conflict including techniques that are utilizable by all team members in support of clinical excellence.",2020,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004440,48,9,1349-1357,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Patient Care Team/organization & administration and Ethics, Medical and Critical Care/*organization & administration and Palliative Care/*organization & administration and Intensive Care Units/*organization & administration and Dissent and Disputes and Group Processes and Negotiating/*methods/psychology",NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Brush_2012_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Critical care physicians' approaches to negotiating with surrogate decision makers: a qualitative study,"Brush, David R. and Brown, Crystal E. and Alexander, G. Caleb",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To describe how critical care physicians manage conflicts with surrogates about withdrawing or withholding patients' life support. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of key informant interviews with critical care physicians during 2010. We transcribed interviews verbatim and used grounded theory to code and revise a taxonomy of themes and to identify illustrative quotes. SETTING: Three academic medical centers, one academic-affiliated medical center, and four private practice groups or private hospitals in a large Midwestern city SUBJECTS: Fourteen critical care physicians. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians reported tailoring their approach to address specific reasons for disagreement with surrogates. Five common approaches were identified: 1) building trust; 2) educating and informing; 3) providing surrogates more time; 4) adjusting surrogate and physician roles; and 5) highlighting specific values. When mistrust was an issue, physicians endeavored to build a more trusting relationship with the surrogate before readdressing decision making. Physicians also reported correcting misunderstandings by providing targeted education, and some reported highlighting specific patient, surrogate, or physician values that they hoped would guide surrogates to agree with them. When surrogates struggled with decisionmaking roles, physicians attempted to reinforce the concept of substituted judgment. Physicians noted that some surrogates needed time to ""come to terms"" with the patent's illness before agreeing with physicians. Many physicians had witnessed colleagues negotiate in ways they found objectionable such as providing misleading information, injecting their own values into the negotiation or behaving unprofessionally toward surrogates. Although some physicians viewed their efforts to encourage surrogates' agreement as persuasive, others strongly denied persuading surrogates and described their actions as ""guiding"" or ""negotiating.""

Although physicians acknowledged their efforts to change surrogates' decisions, many physicians did not perceive these efforts as persuasive.",2012,10.1097/CCM.0b013e31823c8d21,40,4,1080-1087,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,Humans and Female and Male and Time Factors and Physician's Role and Trust and Interviews as Topic and *Physicians and Patient Education as Topic/methods and Critical Care/*methods and *Withholding Treatment and *Third-Party Consent and Negotiating/*methods,NA,NA,2012/04//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Montravers_2011_Critcare.LonEngl,JOUR,Strategies of initiation and streamlining of antibiotic therapy in 41 French intensive care units,"Montravers, Philippe and Dupont, Herve and Gauzit, Remy and Veber, Benoit and Bedos, Jean-Pierre and Lepape, Alain","Critical care (London, England)","INTRODUCTION: Few studies have addressed the decision-making process of antibiotic therapy (AT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, all consecutive patients admitted over a one-month period (2004) to 41 French surgical (n = 22) or medical/medico-surgical ICUs (n = 19) in 29 teaching university and 12 non-teaching hospitals were screened daily for AT until ICU discharge. We assessed the modalities of initiating AT, reasons for changes and factors associated with in ICU mortality including a specific analysis of a new AT administered on suspicion of a new infection. RESULTS: A total of 1,043 patients (61% of the cohort) received antibiotics during their ICU stay. Thirty percent (509) of them received new AT mostly for suspected diagnosis of pneumonia (47%), bacteremia (24%), or intra-abdominal (21%) infections. New AT was prescribed on day shifts (45%) and out-of-hours (55%), mainly by a single senior physician (78%) or by a team decision (17%). This new AT was mainly started at the time of suspicion of infection (71%) and on the results of Gram-stained direct examination (21%). Susceptibility testing was performed in 261 (51%) patients with a new AT. This new AT was judged inappropriate in 58 of these 261 (22%) patients. In ICUs with written protocols for empiric AT (n = 25), new AT prescribed before the availability of culture results (P = 0.003) and out-of-hours (P = 0.04) was more frequently observed than in ICUs without protocols but the appropriateness of AT was not different. In multivariate analysis, the predictive factors of mortality for patients with new AT were absence of protocols for empiric AT (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.01 to 2.69), age <e2><89><a5>60 (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.26), SAPS II score >38 (OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.60 to 4.84), rapidly fatal underlying diseases (OR = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.52 to 5.56), SOFA score <e2><89><a5>6 (OR = 4.48, 95% CI: 2.46 to 8.18). CONCLUSIONS: More than 60% of patients received AT during their ICU stay. Half of them received new AT, frequently initiated out-of-hours. In ICUs with written protocols, empiric AT was initiated more rapidly at the time of suspicion of infection and out-of-hours.

Weissman_2018_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Inclusion of Unstructured Clinical Text Improves Early Prediction of Death or Prolonged ICU Stay,"Weissman, Gary E. and Hubbard, Rebecca A. and Ungar, Lyle H. and Harhay, Michael O. and Greene, Casey S. and Himes, Blanca E. and Halpern, Scott D.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Early prediction of undesired outcomes among newly hospitalized patients could improve patient triage and prompt conversations about patients' goals of care. We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, and elastic net regression models, with and without unstructured clinical text data, to predict a binary composite outcome of in-hospital death or ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days using data from the first 48 hours of hospitalization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with split sampling for model training and testing. SETTING: A single urban academic hospital. PATIENTS: All hospitalized patients who required ICU care at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, from 2001 to 2012. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among eligible 25,947 hospital admissions, we observed 5,504 (21.2%) in which patients died or had ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days. The gradient boosting machine model had the highest discrimination without (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.84) and with (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88-0.90) text-derived variables. Both gradient boosting machines and random forests outperformed logistic regression without text data (p < 0.001), whereas all models outperformed logistic regression with text data (p < 0.02). The inclusion of text data increased the discrimination of all four model types (p < 0.001). Among those models using text data, the increasing presence of terms ""intubated"" and ""poor prognosis"" were positively associated with mortality and ICU length of stay, whereas the term ""extubated"" was inversely associated with them. CONCLUSIONS: Variables extracted from unstructured clinical text from the first 48 hours of hospital admission using natural language processing techniques significantly improved the abilities of logistic regression and other machine learning models to predict which patients died or had long ICU stays.

Brandon",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the diagnostic accuracy, timeliness, and ease of use of Ceribell rapid response electroencephalography. We assessed physicians' diagnostic assessments and treatment plans before and after rapid response electroencephalography assessment. Primary outcomes were changes in physicians' diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and their confidence in these decisions based on the use of the rapid response electroencephalography system. Secondary outcomes were time to electroencephalography, setup time, ease of use, and quality of electroencephalography data. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter nonrandomized observational study. SETTING: ICUs in five academic hospitals in the United States. SUBJECTS: Patients with encephalopathy suspected of having nonconvulsive seizures and physicians evaluating these patients. INTERVENTIONS: Physician bedside assessment of sonified electroencephalography (30 s from each hemisphere) and visual electroencephalography (60 s) using rapid response electroencephalography. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians (29 fellows or residents, eight attending neurologists) evaluated 181 ICU patients; complete clinical and electroencephalography data were available in 164 patients (average 58.6 <c2><b1> 18.7 yr old, 45% females). Relying on rapid response electroencephalography information at the bedside improved the sensitivity (95% CI) of physicians' seizure diagnosis from 77.8% (40.0%, 97.2%) to 100% (66.4%, 100%) and the specificity (95% CI) of their diagnosis from 63.9% (55.8%, 71.4%) to 89% (83.0%, 93.5%). Physicians' confidence in their own diagnosis and treatment plan were also improved. Time to electroencephalography (median [interquartile range]) was 5 minutes (4-10 min) with rapid response electroencephalography while the conventional electroencephalography was delayed by several hours (median [interquartile range] delay = 239 minutes [134-471 min] [p < 0.0001 using Wilcoxon signed rank test]). The device was rated as easy to use (mean <c2><b1> SD: 4.7 <c2><b1> 0.6 [1 = difficult, 5 = easy]) and was without serious adverse effects.

Douglas_2012_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Neglect of quality-of-life considerations in intensive care unit family meetings for long-stay intensive care unit patients,"Douglas, Sara L. and Daly, Barbara J. and Lipson, Amy R.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency with which quality of life and treatment limitation were discussed in formal family meetings for long-stay intensive care unit patients with high risk for mortality and morbidity. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. SETTING: Five intensive care units. PATIENTS: One hundred sixteen family surrogate decisionmakers of long-stay intensive care unit patients who participated in an intensive communication system that aimed to provide weekly meetings with family decisionmakers. The structure of each meeting was to address medical update, patient preferences, treatment plan, and milestones for evaluating the treatment plan. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We audiotaped initial family meetings for 116 family decisionmakers for a total of 180 meetings. On average, meetings were 24 mins long with a majority of time being devoted to nonemotional speech and little (12%) spent discussing patient preferences. Quality of life was discussed in 45% and treatment limitation in 23% of all meetings. Quality-of-life discussions were more likely to occur when patients were admitted to a medical intensive care unit (odds ratio [OR] 5.9; p = .005), have a family decisionmaker who is a spouse (OR 9.4; p = .0001), were older (OR 1.04; p = 01), have a shorter length of stay (OR 0.93; p = .001), and have a family decisionmaker who was a spouse (OR 5.1; p = .002). For those with a treatment limitation discussion, 67% had a do-not-resuscitate order, 40% were admitted to a medical intensive care unit, 56% had a family decisionmaker who had been their caregiver, and 48% of their family decisionmakers were their children.

M. and Camargo, Carlos A. Jr and Hasegawa, Kohei","Critical care (London, England)","BACKGROUND: Development of emergency department (ED) triage systems that accurately differentiate and prioritize critically ill from stable patients remains challenging. We used machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes, and then compared their performance with that of a conventional approach-the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). METHODS: Using National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, from 2007 through 2015, we identified all adult patients (aged <e2><89><a5> 18 years). In the randomly sampled training set (70%), using routinely available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, chief complaints, comorbidities), we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. As the reference model, we constructed a logistic regression model using the five-level ESI data. The clinical outcomes were critical care (admission to intensive care unit or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the test set (the remaining 30%), we measured the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and net benefit (decision curves) for each model. RESULTS: Of 135,470 eligible ED visits, 2.1% had critical care outcome and 16.2% had hospitalization outcome. In the critical care outcome prediction, all four machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.86 [95%CI 0.85-0.87] in the deep neural network vs 0.74 [95%CI 0.72-0.75] in the reference model), with less under-triaged patients in ESI triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to non-urgent). Likewise, in the hospitalization outcome prediction, all machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.82-0.83] in the deep neural network vs 0.69 [95%CI 0.68-0.69] in the reference model) with less over-triages in ESI triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). In the decision curve analysis, all machine learning models consistently achieved a greater net benefit-a larger number of appropriate triages considering a trade-off with over-triages-across the range of clinical thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the conventional approach, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior performance to predict critical care and hospitalization outcomes.

Rie_2007_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Nontherapeutic quality improvement: The conflict of organizational ethics and societal rule of law,"Rie, Michael A. and Kofke, W. Andrew",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Critical care ethics focuses largely on patient autonomy. Cost containment is necessary but requires rationing and limitations on a patient's right to consume beneficial services. No laws address a process of autonomy rights limitation to consume resources in the intensive care unit. We analyzed the frictional interface between necessary cost containment as a quality improvement activity contrasted with individual autonomy in the context of the evolution of research ethics. DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS: Scholarly books, peer-reviewed articles, congressional record, legal sources, the World Wide Web, and the National Archives and Records Administration were evaluated in the context of current cost-containment-driven nontherapeutic quality improvement activities. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three generations in the evolution of human research ethics are identified: 1) Hippocrates to Nuremberg Code, 2) Nuremberg to Belmont, and 3) Belmont to present. Similar ethical lapses, which place the individual at risk without disclosure for the good of future patients, have arisen recurrently in the course of history and continue presently when nontherapeutic quality improvement activities are framed as a human research activity with essentially no ethical oversight. Consequently, fiduciary obligations of professionals and their employer-institutions to their mutual patients may be at odds, creating complex layers of conflicted decision making. Nonetheless, professional Hippocratic duty to ""the patient"" must be congruent with the organizational ethos of limited funding ""stewardship"" to produce meaningful patient care. Medicine's integrity is legally protected and mandated under the state interests (parens patria doctrine) of the common law.

C. and Cremer, Olaf L. and van Delden, Johannes J. and van Dijk, Diederik and de Lange, Dylan W.","Critical care (London, England)","BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors for the combination of long-term survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after intensive care unit (ICU) stay have not yet been studied. Our aim was to assess whether early acute kidney injury (eAKI), AKI occurring on the first day of ICU admission, is an independent predictor of this combined one-year outcome. METHODS: We included all patients admitted to the mixed ICU of the University Medical Centre Utrecht between July 2009 and April 2013, excluding patients with chronic dialysis, cardiac surgery, and length of stay shorter than 24 hours. eAKI was defined using the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) classification, using a newly developed algorithm to classify AKI based on routinely collected patient data. In one-year survivors, HRQoL was measured using the EuroQoL 5D-3L<e2><84><a2> (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The primary outcome measure was ""poor outcome"", defined as an EQ-5D index score <0.4 or death after one year follow up. A multivariable Poisson regression model was performed to adjust for age, comorbidities, admission type and severity of disease factors. RESULTS: We enrolled 2,420 patients, of whom 871 (36.0 %) died within one year. An additional 286 of 1549 one-year survivors (11.8 %) experienced low HRQoL. The respective incidence of the RIFLE classes, risk, injury and failure, were 456 (18.8 %), 253 (10.5 %) and 123 (5.1 %). After adjustment for other covariates, the RIFLE classes, injury and failure, were independently associated with poor outcome (adjusted relative risk 1.14, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.29; p = 0.03, and 1.25, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.55; p = 0.04), when compared to no eAKI patients . The constituents of this composite outcome were also analysed separately. In a Cox regression model the RIFLE classes, injury and failure, were significantly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35, 95 % CI 1.11, 1.65; p <0.01, and 1.78, 95 % CI 1.38, 2.30; p <0.01). In one-year survivors specifically, none of the RIFLE classes were significantly associated with low HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with moderate or severe AKI during the first 24 hours have a higher probability of mortality or low HRQoL (combined poor outcome), one year after ICU admission.

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a high-quality clinical database, namely the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme Database, which includes 276,731 admissions to 170 adult ICUs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2004. RESULTS: During the eight year study period, 1.3% (n = 3,420) of all patients admitted to ICU were receiving chronic renal dialysis before ICU admission. This represents an estimated ICU utilization of six admissions (32 bed-days) per 100 dialysis patient-years. The ESRF group was younger (mean age 57.3 years versus 59.5 years) and more likely to be male (60.2% versus 57.9%) than those without ESRF. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and Acute Physiology Score revealed greater severity of illness on admission in patients with ESRF (mean 24.7 versus 16.6 and 17.2 versus 12.6, respectively). Length of stay in ICU was comparable between groups (median 1.9 days versus 1.8 days) and ICU mortality was only slightly elevated in the ESRF group (26.3% versus 20.8%). However, the ESRF group had protracted overall hospital stay (median 25 days versus 17 days), and increased hospital mortality (45.3% versus 31.2%) and ICU readmission (9.0% vs. 4.7%). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for case mix identified the increased hospital mortality to be associated with increasing age, emergency surgery and nonsurgical cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ICU admission and extremes of physiological norms. The adjusted odds ratio for ultimate hospital mortality associated with chronic renal dialysis was 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.37). CONCLUSION: Patients with ESRF admitted to UK ICUs are more likely to be male and younger, with a medical cause of admission, and to have greater severity of illness than the non-ESRF population. Outcomes on the ICU were comparable between the two groups, but those patients with ESRF had greater readmission rates, prolonged post-ICU hospital stay and increased post-ICU hospital mortality. This study is by far the largest comparative outcome analysis to date in patients with ESRF admitted to the ICU.

DATA EXTRACTION: Fifty-four studies were analyzed. Data extracted included article characteristics, methods, results, and performance in clinical prediction. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most common patient types investigated were trauma (19 studies) and sepsis (eight). In studies comparing patient mitochondrial DNA or N-formyl peptide levels to healthy controls, 38 (90.5%) reported significantly elevated mitochondrial DNA levels in patients at first reported time point, as did the one study making this comparison for N-formyl peptides. Nine studies (81.8%) reported significantly elevated plasma/serum mitochondrial DNA levels in at least one time point in patients who developed inflammatory complications of their primary pathology compared with patients without inflammatory complications. For the ability of mitochondrial DNA to predict complications or outcomes, the area under the curve was 0.7 or greater in 84.6% of receiver operating characteristic curves, and 92.9% of odds, adjusted odds, risk, and hazard ratios were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular mitochondrial DNA levels are elevated early in patients' hospital courses in many acute illnesses and are higher in patients who develop inflammatory complications. Elevated mitochondrial DNA levels may be clinically useful in risk prediction and clinical decision support systems. Further research is needed to determine the role of extracellular N-formyl peptides in systemic inflammation and their possible clinical utility.",2018,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003381,46,12,2018-2028,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and ROC Curve and Biomarkers and *Critical Illness and Alarmins/immunology and DNA, Mitochondrial/biosynthesis/*immunology and Inflammation/*immunology and Mitochondrial Proteins/immunology and Peptides/*immunology and Sepsis/*immunology and Wounds and Injuries/*immunology",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Contrael_2013_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Prescribing patterns of hydrocortisone in septic shock: a single-center experience of how surviving sepsis guidelines are interpreted and translated into bedside practice,"Contrael, Katlynd M. and Killian, Alley J. and Gregg, Sara R. and Buchman, Timothy G. and Coopersmith, Craig M.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests giving hydrocortisone to septic patients only if their ""blood pressure is poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy."" Because the definition of ""poorly responsive"" is not provided, the purpose of this study was to identify prescribing triggers for hydrocortisone in septic shock. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients with septic shock over 17 months, who received hydrocortisone, followed by a survey of all intensivists who attended in the study ICUs to determine whether provider attitudes matched clinical practice. SETTING: Eight ICUs in an academic hospital and a hybrid academic/community hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 155 patients with septic shock in whom vasopressors were initiated and hydrocortisone was prescribed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients (64%) were already receiving two vasopressors before hydrocortisone was prescribed. An additional 22 patients were on a single high-dose vasopressor prior to corticosteroid initiation. Of patients who survived to have their hydrocortisone dose changed, 57% had their corticosteroids tapered, whereas 43% were abruptly discontinued. Seventy-six percent of patients were no longer on vasopressors when the first dosing change was made. Twenty-seven out of 36 intensivists (75%) completed the survey. The majority (72%) defined ""poorly responsive to vasopressors"" as the presence of two vasopressors, and 70% stated that they required patients to be off vasopressors prior to altering the corticosteroid dose. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variability exists when corticosteroids are prescribed for septic shock, with the most common interpretation in our institution of ""poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy"" being the presence of two vasopressors. The method and timing of corticosteroid discontinuation also differed among providers. Self-described prescribing patterns from intensivists closely matched their actual behavior, suggesting variability is due to differing interpretations of the guidelines themselves, rather than a deficit in knowledge translation.",2013,10.1097/CCM.0b013e31828cef29,41,10,2310-2317,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Retrospective Studies and Decision Making and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Attitude of Health Personnel and Medical Audit and Academic Medical Centers and Georgia and *Intensive Care Units and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*administration & dosage and Hydrocortisone/*administration & dosage and Shock, Septic/*drug therapy/mortality and Vasoconstrictor Agents/administration & dosage",NA,NA,2013/10//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A medical-surgical ICU. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients referred to the ICU during a one-yr period. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 898 triaged patients, 147 were deemed too well to benefit from ICU admission. Decisions to forego LST were made in 148 of 666 (22.2%) admitted patients and in all 85 patients deemed too sick for ICU admission. Independent predictors of decisions to forego LST at ICU refusal rather than after ICU admission were: age; underlying disease; living in an institution; preexisting cognitive impairment; admission for medical reasons; and acute cardiac failure, acute central neurologic illness, or sepsis. Hospital mortality after decisions to forego LST was not significantly different in refused and admitted patients (77.5% vs. 86.5%; p = .1). Decisions to forego LST were made via telephone in 58.8% of refused patients and none of the admitted patients. Nurses caring for the patient had no direct contact with the ICU physicians for 62.3% of the decisions in refused patients, whereas meetings between nurses and physicians occurred in 70.3% of decisions to forego LST in the ICU. Patients or relatives were involved in 28.2% of decisions to forego LST at ICU refusal compared with 78.4% of decisions to forego LST in ICU patients (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: All patients deemed too sick for ICU admission had decisions to forego LST. These decisions were made without direct patient examination in two-thirds of refused patients (vs. none of admitted patients) and were associated with less involvement of nurses and relatives compared with decisions in admitted patients.

Riviello_2011_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Critical care in resource-poor settings: lessons learned and future directions,"Riviello, Elisabeth D. and Letchford, Stephen and Achieng, Loice and Newton, Mark W.",Critical care medicine,"CONTEXT: Critical care faces the same challenges as other aspects of healthcare in the developing world. However, critical care faces an additional challenge in that it has often been deemed too costly or complicated for resource-poor settings. This lack of prioritization is not justified. Hospital care for the sickest patients affects overall mortality, and public health interventions depend on community confidence in healthcare to ensure participation and adherence. Some of the most effective critical care interventions, including rapid fluid resuscitation, early antibiotics, and patient monitoring, are relatively inexpensive. Although cost-effectiveness studies on critical care in resource-poor settings have not been done, evidence from the surgical literature suggests that even resource-intensive interventions can be cost effective in comparison to immunizations and human immunodeficiency virus care. In the developing world, where many critically ill patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, critical care presents a remarkable opportunity to provide significant incremental benefit, arguably much more so than in the developed world. ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS: Key areas of consideration in developing critical care in resource-poor settings include: Personnel and training, equipment and support services, ethics, and research. Strategies for training and retaining skilled labor include tying education to service commitment and developing protocols for even complex processes. Equipment and support services need to focus on technologies that are affordable and sustainable. Ethical decision making must be based on data when possible and on transparent articulated policies always. Research should be performed in resource-poor settings and focus on needs assessment, prognostication, and cost effectiveness. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The development of critical care in resource-poor settings will rely on the stepwise introduction of service improvements, leveraging human resources through training, a focus on sustainable technology, ongoing analysis of cost effectiveness, and the sharing of context-specific best practices. Although prevention, public health, and disease-specific agendas dominate many current conversations in global health, this is nonetheless a time ripe for the development of critical care. Leaders in global health funding hope to improve quality and length of life. Critical care is an integral part of the continuum of care necessary to make that possible.",2011,10.1097/CCM.0b013e318206d6d5,39,4,860-867,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Health Priorities and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Forecasting and Kenya and Workforce and Biomedical Technology and Education, Medical and Health Resources and Respiration, Artificial and *Developing Countries and Biomedical Research/ethics and *Critical Care/ethics/organization & administration/standards/trends",NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: An observational prospective study over a 6-month period. All adult patients triaged for admission to a medical ICU were included prospectively. Age, gender, reasons for requesting ICU admission, severity of underlying disease, severity of acute illness, mortality and ICU characteristics were recorded. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used for evaluating predicting factors of refused ICU admission. RESULTS: ICU admission was requested for 398 patients: 110 were immediately admitted (27.8%), 142 were never admitted (35.6%), and 146 were admitted at a later time (36.6%). The reasons for refusal were: too sick to benefit (31, 10.8%), too well to benefit (55, 19.1%), unit full (117, 40.6%), and more data about the patient were needed to make a decision (85, 29.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that late ICU admission was associated with the lack of available ICU beds (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.46-2.50; p = 0.003), cardiac disease (OR 7.77; 95% CI 2.41-25.04; p < 0.001), neurological disease (OR 3.78; 95% CI 1.40-10.26; p = 0.009), shock and sepsis (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.06-6.13; p = 0.03), and metabolic disease (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.11-7.30; p = 0.02). Factors for ICU refusal for never admitted patients were: severity of acute illness (OR 4.83; 95% CI 1.11-21.01; p = 0.03), cardiac disease (OR 14.26; 95% CI 3.95-51.44; p < 0.001), neurological disease (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.33-12.28; p = 0.01) and lack of available ICU beds (OR 6.26; 95% CI 4.14-9.46; p < 0.001). Hospital mortality was 33.3% (37/110) for immediately admitted patients, 43.8% (64/146) for patients admitted later and 49.3% (70/142) for never admitted patients. CONCLUSION: Refusal of ICU admission was correlated with the severity of acute illness, lack of ICU beds and reasons for admission request. Further efforts are needed to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICU admission and to improve the accuracy of data on ICU refusal rates.",2012,10.1007/s00134-012-2517-0,38,5,830-837,eng,1432-1238 0342-4642,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Time Factors and Hospital Mortality and Prospective Studies and Hospitals, University and *Decision Making and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods and Triage and *Intensive Care Units and *Patient Transfer and Morocco",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,Intensive Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bruce_2015_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Barriers and Facilitators to Initiating and Completing Time-Limited Trials in Critical Care,"Bruce, Courtenay R. and Liang, Cecilia and Blumenthal-Barby, Jennifer S. and Zimmerman, Janice and Downey, Andrea and Pham, Linda and Theriot, Lisette and Delgado, Estevan D. and White, Douglas",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: A time-limited trial is an agreement between clinicians and patients or surrogate decision makers to use medical therapies over a defined period of time to see if the patient improves or deteriorates according to agreed-upon clinical milestones. Although time-limited trials are broadly advocated, there is little empirical evidence of the benefits and risks of time-limited trials, when they are initiated, when and why they succeed or fail, and what facilitates completion of them. Our study objectives were to 1) identify the purposes for which clinicians use time-limited trials and 2) identify barriers and facilitators to initiating and completing time-limited trials. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews: We analyzed interviews using qualitative description with constant comparative techniques. SETTING: Nine hundred-bed, academic, tertiary hospital in Houston, Texas. Interviewees were from open medical, surgical, neurosurgical, and cardiovascular ICUs. SUBJECTS: Thirty healthcare professionals were interviewed (nine surgeons, 16 intensivists, three nurse practitioners, and two ""other"" clinicians). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Interviewees reported initiating time-limited trials for three different purposes: to prepare surrogates and clinicians for discussion and possible shifts toward comfort-care only therapies, build consensus, and refine prognostic information. The main barriers to initiating time-limited trials involve clinicians' or surrogate decision makers' disagreement on setting a time limit. Barriers to completing time-limited trials include 1) requesting more time; 2) communication breakdowns because of rotating call schedules; and 3) changes in clinical course. Finally, facilitators to completing time-limited trials include 1) having defined goals about what could be achieved during an ICU stay, either framed in narrow, numeric terms or broad goals focusing on achievable activities of daily living; 2) applying time-limited trials in certain types of cases; and 3) taking ownership to ensure completion of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of barriers and facilitators to initiating and completing time-limited trials is an essential first step toward appropriate utilization of time-limited trials in the ICUs, as well as developing educational or communication interventions with clinicians to facilitate time-limited trial use. We provide practical suggestions on patient populations in whom time-limited trials may be successful, the setting, and clinicians likely to benefit from educational interventions, allowing clinicians to have a fuller sense of when and how to use time-limited trials.",2015,10.1097/CCM.0000000000001307,43,12,2535-2543,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Time Factors and Judgment and Interviews as Topic and Hospital Bed Capacity, 500 and over and Consensus and Academic Medical Centers and Patient Care Team/organization & administration and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and *Personnel, Hospital and Intensive Care Units/*organization & administration/standards and Patient Care Planning/organization & administration and Terminal Care/organization & administration and Critical Care/*organization & administration/standards and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*organization & administration/standards",NA,NA,2015/12//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely campaign tasked professional societies to identify sources of overuse in specialty care practice. The purpose of this study was to assess how critical care clinicians were implementing the Critical Care Societies Collaborative Choosing Wisely recommendations in clinical practice. DESIGN: Descriptive survey methodology with use of Research Electronic Data Capture (https://projectredcap.org/) sent via email newsletter blast or to individual emails of the 150,000 total members of the organizations. SETTING: National survey. SUBJECTS: ICU physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and pharmacist members of four national critical care societies in the United States. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A six-question survey assessed what Choosing Wisely recommendations had been implemented in ICU settings and if the impact was assessed. A total of 2,520 responses were received from clinicians: nurses (61%; n = 1538), physicians (25.9%; n = 647), advanced practice providers (10.5%; n = 263), and pharmacists (2.1%; n = 52), reflecting a 1.6% response rate of the total membership of 150,000 clinicians. Overall, 1,273 respondents (50.6%) reported they were familiar with the Choosing Wisely campaign. Respondents reported that Choosing Wisely recommendations had been integrated in a number of ways including being implemented in clinical care (n = 817; 72.9%), through development of a specific clinical protocol or institutional guideline (n = 736; 65.7%), through development of electronic medical record orders (n = 626; 55.8%), or with integration of longitudinal tracking using an electronic dashboard (n = 213; 19.0%). Some respondents identified that a specific quality improvement initiative was developed related to the Choosing Wisely recommendations (n = 468; 41.7%), or that a research initiative had been conducted (n = 156; 13.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide information on the application of the Choosing Wisely recommendations to clinical practice from a small sample of critical care clinicians. However, as only half of the respondents report implementation, additional strategies are needed to promote the Choosing Wisely recommendations to make impactful change to improve care in ICU settings.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003496,47,3,331-336,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"United States and Humans and Surveys and Questionnaires and Societies, Medical and Clinical Decision-Making and Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data and Unnecessary Procedures/statistics & numerical data and Critical Care/*methods/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to understand what sources of knowledge surrogates rely on when estimating a patient's prognosis. DESIGN: Prospective, mixed-methods study using face-to-face, semistructured interviews with surrogate decision-makers. SETTING: Four intensive care units at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center in 2006 to 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 179 surrogate decision-makers for 142 incapacitated, critically ill patients at high risk for death. MAIN RESULTS: Less than 2% (3 of 179) of surrogates reported that their beliefs about the patients' prognoses hinged exclusively on prognostic information provided to them by physicians. The majority cited other factors in addition to physicians' predictions that also contributed to their beliefs about the patients' prognoses, including perceptions of the patient's individual strength of character and will to live; the patient's unique history of illness and survival; the surrogate's own observations of the patient's physical appearance; the surrogate's belief that their presence at the bedside may improve the prognosis; and the surrogate's optimism, intuition, and faith. For some surrogates, these other sources of knowledge superseded the importance of the physician's prognostication. However, most surrogates endeavored to balance their own knowledge of the patient with physicians' biomedical knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates use diverse types of knowledge when estimating their loved ones' prognoses, including individualized attributes of the patient, such as their strength of character and life history, of which physicians may be unaware.

T. Jr and Tirschwell, David L.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: Statistical models predicting outcome after intraparenchymal hemorrhage include patients irrespective of do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders. We built a model to explore how the inclusion of patients with do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders affects intraparenchymal hemorrhage prognostic models. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study from May 2001 until September 2003. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary referral hospital in Seattle, WA. PATIENTS: Four hundred twenty-four consecutive patients with spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We retrospectively abstracted information from medical records of intraparenchymal hemorrhage patients admitted to a single hospital. Using multivariate logistic regression of presenting clinical characteristics, but not do-not-attempt-resuscitation status, we generated a prognostic score for favorable outcome (defined as moderate disability or better at discharge). We compared observed probability of favorable outcome with that predicted, stratified by do-not-attempt-resuscitation status. We then generated a modified prognostic score using only non-do-not-attempt-resuscitation patients. Records of 424 patients were reviewed: 44% had favorable outcome, 43% had a do-not-attempt-resuscitation order, and 38% died in hospital. The observed and predicted probability of favorable outcome agreed well with all patients taken together. The observed probability of favorable outcome was significantly higher than predicted in non-do-not-attempt-resuscitation patients and significantly lower in do-not-attempt-resuscitation patients. Results were similar when applying a previously published and validated prognostic score. Our modified prognostic score was no longer pessimistic in non-do-not-attempt-resuscitation patients but remained overly optimistic in do-not-attempt-resuscitation patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although our prognostic model was well-calibrated when assessing all intraparenchymal hemorrhage patients, predictions were significantly pessimistic in patients without and optimistic in those with do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders. Such pessimism may drive decisions not to attempt resuscitation in patients in whom a favorable outcome may have been possible, thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. To be most useful in clinical decision making, intraparenchymal hemorrhage prognostic models should be calibrated to large intraparenchymal hemorrhage cohorts in whom do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders were not used.",2011,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181fb7b49,39,1,158-162,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Logistic Models and Multivariate Analysis and Cohort Studies and Prognosis and Decision Support Techniques and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and ROC Curve and Survival Analysis and Academic Medical Centers and *Models, Theoretical and Critical Care/methods and Resuscitation Orders/*ethics and Critical Illness/mortality/therapy and Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/*mortality/therapy",NA,NA,2011/01//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methodical evaluation of the impact of health information technology on outcomes is essential for institutions to make informed decisions regarding implementation. DATA SOURCES: EMBASE, Scopus, Medline, the Cochrane Review database, and Web of Science were searched from database inception through July 2013. Manual review of references of identified articles was also completed. STUDY SELECTION: Selection criteria included a health information technology intervention such as computerized physician order entry, clinical decision support systems, and surveillance systems, an inpatient setting, and endpoints of mortality, length of stay, or cost. Studies were screened by three reviewers. Of the 2,803 studies screened, 45 met selection criteria (1.6%). DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted on the year, design, intervention type, system used, comparator, sample sizes, and effect on outcomes. Studies were abstracted independently by three reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: There was a significant effect of surveillance systems on in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94; I=59%). All other quantitative analyses of health information technology interventions effect on mortality and length of stay were not statistically significant. Cost was unable to be quantitatively evaluated. Qualitative synthesis of studies of each outcome demonstrated significant study heterogeneity and small clinical effects. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic interventions were not shown to have a substantial effect on mortality, length of stay, or cost. This may be due to the small number of studies that were able to be aggregately analyzed due to the heterogeneity of study populations, interventions, and endpoints.

Hornby_2018_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Update of a Systematic Review of Autoresuscitation After Cardiac Arrest,"Hornby, Laura and Dhanani, Sonny and Shemie, Sam D.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: There has been a growth in publications focusing on the phenomena of autoresuscitation in recent years. In 2010, we systematically reviewed the medical literature with the primary objective of summarizing the evidence on the timing of autoresuscitation. Healthcare professionals have continued to voice concerns regarding the potential for autoresuscitation. With this in mind, the objective of this brief report is to update the results of our original review of autoresuscitation. DATA SOURCES: We applied the same search strategy described in our original article to update our findings to include articles published from January 2009 to September 2016. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We screened an additional 1,859 citations, after duplicates were removed, and then assessed 46 full-text articles for eligibility, from which 15 studies were included for data extraction. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the time period of this review, there have been 1) 10 additional adult and three pediatric case reports of autoresuscitation in patients after cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; in those cases with continuous monitoring and confirmation of circulation, the longest events are reported to be 10 and 2 minutes, respectively for adults and children; 2) six adults (4%, total n = 162) with autoresuscitation events reported from two observational studies and one chart review of patients undergoing withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; the longest time reported to be 89 seconds with electrocardiogram and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and 3 minutes with electrocardiogram monitoring only; 3) 12 pediatric patients studied with vital sign monitoring during withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy without any reports of autoresuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: Although case reports of autoresuscitation are hampered by variability in observation and monitoring techniques, autoresuscitation has now been reported in adults and children, and there appears to be a distinction in timing between failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Although additional prospective studies are required to clarify the frequency and predisposing factors associated with this phenomenon, clinical decision-making regarding patient management under uncertainty is required nonetheless. Both adult and pediatric healthcare professionals should be aware of the possibility of autoresuscitation and monitor their patients accordingly before diagnosing death.",2018,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002920,46,3,e268-e272,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Adult and Child and Remission, Spontaneous and *Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/physiopathology",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lewis_2017_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Organ Support After Death by Neurologic Criteria in Pediatric Patients,"Lewis, Ariane and Adams, Nellie and Chopra, Arun and Kirschen, Matthew P.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to 1) evaluate how pediatricians approach situations in which families request continuation of organ support after declaration of death by neurologic criteria and 2) explore potential interventions to make these situations less challenging. DESIGN: A survey on management and personal experience with death by neurologic criteria was distributed electronically to pediatric intensivists and neurologists. We compared responses from individuals who practice in states with accommodation exceptions (accommodation states where religious or moral beliefs must be taken into consideration when declaring death: California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York) to those from non-accommodation states. SETTING: United States. SUBJECTS: The survey was opened by 254 recipients, with 186 meeting inclusion criteria and providing data about the region in which they practice; of these, 26% were from accommodation states. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More than half of physicians (61% from both accommodation states and non-accommodation states) reported they cared for a pediatric patient whose family requested continuation of organ support after declaration of death by neurologic criteria (outside of organ donation; range, 1-17 times). Over half of physicians (53%) reported they would not feel comfortable handling a situation in which a pediatric patient's family requested care be continued after declaration of death by neurologic criteria. Nearly every physician (98%) endorsed that something needs to be done to make situations involving families who object to discontinuation of organ support after declaration of death by neurologic criteria easier to handle. Respondents felt that public education, physician education, and uniform state laws about these situations are warranted. CONCLUSIONS: It is relatively common for pediatricians who care for critically ill patients to encounter families who object to discontinuation of organ support after death by neurologic criteria. Management of these situations is challenging, and guidance for medical professionals and the public is needed.",2017,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002452,45,9,e916-e924,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Health Education and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Family/*psychology and Critical Illness/psychology and *Intensive Care Units, Pediatric and *Brain Death and Life Support Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nelson_2010_Critcaremedi,JOUR,In their own words: patients and families define high-quality palliative care in the intensive care unit,"Nelson, Judith E. and Puntillo, Kathleen A. and Pronovost, Peter J. and Walker, Amy S. and McAdam, Jennifer L. and Ilaoa, Debra and Penrod, Joan",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Although the majority of hospital deaths occur in the intensive care unit and virtually all critically ill patients and their families have palliative needs, we know little about how patients and families, the most important ""stakeholders,"" define high-quality intensive care unit palliative care. We conducted this study to obtain their views on important domains of this care. DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups facilitated by a single physician. SETTING: A 20-bed general intensive care unit in a 382-bed community hospital in Oklahoma; 24-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit in a 377-bed tertiary, university hospital in urban California; and eight-bed medical intensive care unit in a 311-bed Veterans' Affairs hospital in a northeastern city. PATIENTS: Randomly-selected patients with intensive care unit length of stay >=5 days in 2007 to 2008 who survived the intensive care unit, families of survivors, and families of patients who died in the intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Focus group facilitator used open-ended questions and scripted probes from a written guide. Three investigators independently coded meeting transcripts, achieving consensus on themes. From 48 subjects (15 patients, 33 family members) in nine focus groups across three sites, a shared definition of high-quality intensive care unit palliative care emerged: timely, clear, and compassionate communication by clinicians; clinical decision-making focused on patients' preferences, goals, and values; patient care maintaining comfort, dignity, and personhood; and family care with open access and proximity to patients, interdisciplinary support in the intensive care unit, and bereavement care for families of patients who died. Participants also endorsed specific processes to operationalize the care they considered important. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve intensive care unit palliative care quality should focus on domains and processes that are most valued by critically ill patients and their families, among whom we found broad agreement in a diverse sample. Measures of quality and effective interventions exist to improve care in domains that are important to intensive care unit patients and families.",2010,10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181c5887c,38,3,808-818,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Patient Care Team and Physician-Patient Relations and Aged, 80 and over and Focus Groups and *Patient Satisfaction and *Intensive Care Units and Caregivers/*psychology and Professional-Family Relations and Quality of Health Care/*standards and Bereavement and Palliative Care/*psychology/*standards",NA,NA,2010/03//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Guiza_2013_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Novel methods to predict increased intracranial pressure during intensive care and long-term neurologic outcome after traumatic brain injury: development and validation in a multicenter dataset,"Guiza, Fabian and Depreitere, Bart and Piper, Ian and Van den Berghe, Greet and Meyfroidt, Geert",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Intracranial pressure monitoring is standard of care after severe traumatic brain injury. Episodes of increased intracranial pressure are secondary injuries associated with poor outcome. We developed a model to predict increased intracranial pressure episodes 30 mins in advance, by using the dynamic characteristics of continuous intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring. In addition, we hypothesized that performance of current models to predict long-term neurologic outcome could be substantially improved by adding dynamic characteristics of continuous intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring during the first 24 hrs in the ICU. DESIGN: Prognostic modeling. Noninterventional, observational, retrospective study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: The Brain Monitoring with Information Technology dataset consisted of 264 traumatic brain injury patients admitted to 22 neuro-ICUs from 11 European countries. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Predictive models were built with multivariate logistic regression and Gaussian processes, a machine learning technique. Predictive attributes were Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury-basic and International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trial design in TBI-core predictors, together with time-series summary statistics of minute-by-minute mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure. MAIN RESULTS: Increased intracranial pressure episodes could be predicted 30 mins ahead with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value 0.12, calibration slope 1.02, calibration-in-the-large -0.02) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87) on an external validation dataset. Models for prediction of poor neurologic outcome at six months (Glasgow Outcome Score 1-2) based only on static admission data had 0.72 area under the receiver operating curve; adding dynamic information of intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure during the first 24 hrs increased performance to 0.90. Similarly, prediction of Glasgow Outcome Score 1-3 was improved from 0.68 to 0.87 when including dynamic information. CONCLUSION: The dynamic information in continuous mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure monitoring allows to accurately predict increased intracranial pressure in the neuro-ICU. Adding information of the first 24 hrs of intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring to known baseline risk factors allows very accurate prediction of long-term neurologic outcome at 6 months.",2013,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182742d0a,41,2,554-564,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Multivariate Analysis and Databases, Factual and Sensitivity and Specificity and Prognosis and ROC Curve and Age Factors and Monitoring, Physiologic and Intensive Care Units and Critical Care and *Models, Biological and Glasgow Outcome Scale and *Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Blood Pressure/*physiology and Brain Injuries/*physiopathology and Intracranial Hypertension/*diagnosis/physiopathology and Intracranial Pressure/*physiology",NA,NA,2013/02//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

IAP is most commonly measured using the intravesicular or ""bladder"" technique. The impact of changes in body position on the accuracy of IAP measurements, such as head of bed elevation to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, remains unclear. DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study. SETTING: Twelve international intensive care units. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-two critically ill medical and surgical patients at risk for intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Triplicate intravesicular pressure measurements were performed at least 4 hours apart with the patient in the supine, 15 degrees , and 30 degrees head of bed elevated positions. The zero reference point was the mid-axillary line at the iliac crest. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean IAP values at each head of bed position were significantly different (p < 0.0001). The bias between IAPsupine and IAP15 degrees was 1.5 mm Hg (1.3-1.7). The bias between IAPsupine and IAP30 degrees was 3.7 mm Hg (3.4-4.0). CONCLUSIONS: Head of bed elevation results in clinically significant increases in measured IAP. Consistent body positioning from one IAP measurement to the next is necessary to allow consistent trending of IAP for accurate clinical decision making.

Therefore, we characterized the attitudes of physicians and nurses about palliative care delivery in an ICU environment. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs at three large academic hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred three nurses, intensivists, and advanced practice providers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinicians completed written surveys that assessed attitudes about specialist palliative care presence and integration into the ICU setting, as well as acceptability of 23 published palliative care prompts (triggers) for specialist consultation. Most (n = 225; 75%) reported that palliative care consultation was underutilized. Prompting consideration of eligibility for specialist consultation by electronic health record searches for triggers was most preferred (n = 123; 41%); only 17 of them (6%) felt current processes were adequate. The most acceptable specialist triggers were metastatic malignancy, unrealistic goals of care, end of life decision making, and persistent organ failure. Advanced age, length of stay, and duration of life support were the least acceptable. Screening led by either specialists or ICU teams was equally preferred. Central themes derived from qualitative analysis of 65 written responses to open-ended items included concerns about the roles of physicians and nurses, implementation, and impact on ICU team-family relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of palliative care specialists in the ICU is broadly acceptable and desired. However, the most commonly used current triggers for prompting specialist consultation were among the least well accepted, while more favorable triggers are difficult to abstract from electronic health record systems. There is also disagreement about the role of ICU nurses in palliative care delivery.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation provision is increasing markedly despite poor patient outcomes. Misunderstanding prognosis in the prolonged mechanical ventilation decision-making process could provide an explanation for this phenomenon. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 126 patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants were interviewed at the time of tracheostomy placement about their expectations for 1-yr patient survival, functional status, and quality of life. These expectations were then compared with observed 1-yr outcomes measured with validated questionnaires. The 1-yr follow-up was 100%, with the exception of patient death or cognitive inability to complete interviews. At 1 yr, only 11 patients (9%) were alive and independent of major functional status limitations. Most surrogates reported high baseline expectations for 1-yr patient survival (n = 117, 93%), functional status (n = 90, 71%), and quality of life (n = 105, 83%). In contrast, fewer physicians described high expectations for survival (n = 54, 43%), functional status (n = 7, 6%), and quality of life (n = 5, 4%). Surrogate-physician pair concordance in expectations was poor (all kappa = <0.08), as was their accuracy in outcome prediction (range = 23%-44%). Just 33 surrogates (26%) reported that physicians discussed what to expect for patients' likely future survival, general health, and caregiving needs. CONCLUSIONS: One-year patient outcomes for prolonged mechanical ventilation patients were significantly worse than expected by patients' surrogates and physicians.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Two urban, academic emergency departments, with <e2><89><88>80,000 combined annual visits, between June 2016 and December 2017. PATIENTS: Admitted patients, greater than 17 years old, with two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and organ dysfunction, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, or lactate greater than 4.0 mmol/L. Patients with trauma, intracranial hemorrhage known prior to arrival, or without available blood samples were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Emergency department physicians reported likelihood of in-hospital mortality (0-100%) by survey at hospital admission. Remnant EDTA blood samples, drawn during the emergency department stay, were used to measure angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We screened 421 patients and enrolled 314. The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality within 28 days occurred in 31 (9.9%). When predicting the primary outcome, the best biomarker model included angiopoietin-2 and interleukin-6 and performed moderately well (area under the curve, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.75), as did physician judgment (area under the curve, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.82).

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Medical intensive care units of a county hospital located in an urban area. SUBJECTS: Primary surrogate decision makers of all adults admitted >48 hrs from August 2005 to April 2006, enrolled sequentially. INTERVENTIONS: Using a structured instrument consisting of visual analog scales, Likert-type questions, and an objective assessment of knowledge of family member's current intensive care, we interviewed primary surrogate decision makers after they had at least one bedside patient visit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of eligible primary surrogate decision makers, 81 were enrolled; 96% had spoken to hospital staff. On a scale in which 0 indicated the worst possible communication and 10 indicated the best possible communication, primary surrogate decision makers' mean (SD) ratings were 8.6 (2.3) for nurses and 7.8 (2.8) for doctors. Forty-seven percent of primary surrogate decision makers met the predetermined criteria for good understanding with no significant difference between college-educated (44%) and non-college-educated (50%) primary surrogate decision makers; more non-English-speaking primary surrogate decision makers (63%), however, had poor understanding than English speakers (40%) (mean difference in proportions 23%, 95% confidence interval 1% to 46%). Seventy-three percent (95% confidence interval 61-82) of primary surrogate decision makers correctly identified their family members' resuscitation orders (do-not-resuscitate, limited resuscitation, or full code). The primary reasons cited for poor communication/understanding were as follows: not given enough time (21%), explanations too complicated (16%), and too emotionally upset (5%).

Frailty is common in critical illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of acute kidney injury. We examined the association of acute kidney injury and frailty within a year of hospital discharge in survivors of critical illness. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS: Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure and/or shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Acute kidney injury was determined using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status was determined using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months following discharge. Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity (i.e., Charlson Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale score. Of 317 patients, 243 (77%) had acute kidney injury and one in four patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted models, acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with higher frailty scores at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14-3.24; odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, a similar association of acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher Clinical Frailty Scale score was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.34-5.66, respectively). In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of association were observed.

We previously demonstrated that, individually, all professional groups involved in rounds have significant blind spots in recognition of patient safety issues in the electronic health record. However, it is unclear how team dynamics impacts identification and verbalization of viewed data. Therefore, we created an ICU rounding simulation to assess how the interprofessional team recognized and reported data and its impact on decision-making. DESIGN: Each member of the ICU team reviewed a simulated ICU chart in the electronic health record which contained embedded patient safety issues. The team conducted simulated rounds according to the ICU's existing rounding script and was assessed for recognition of safety issues. SETTING: Academic medical center. SUBJECTS: ICU residents, nurses, and pharmacists. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight teams recognized 68.6% of safety issues with only 50% teams having the primary diagnosis in their differential. Individually, interns, nurses, and pharmacists recognized 30.4%, 15.6%, and 19.6% of safety items, respectively. However, there was a negative correlation between the intern's performance and the nurse's or the pharmacist's performance within a given team. The wide variance in recognition of data resulted in wide variance in orders. Overall, there were 21.8 orders requested and 21.6 orders placed per case resulting in 3.6 order entry inconsistencies/case. Between the two cases, there were 145 distinct orders place with 43% being unique to a specific team and only 2% placed by all teams. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant blind spots exist in the interprofessional team's ability to recognize safety issues in the electronic health record, the inclusion of other professional groups does serve as a partial safety net to improve recognition.

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of postoperative patients admitted to the ICU. Blood samples for analysis were taken within 3 hours from admission to the ICU including pancreatic stone protein, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II clinical scores were also determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy and independent predictors of death in the ICU [Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01465711]. SETTING: An adult medical-surgical ICU in a teaching hospital in Germany. PATIENTS: Ninety-one consecutive postoperative patients with proven diagnosis of secondary peritonitis admitted to the ICU were included in the study from August 17, 2007, to February 8, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Peripheral vein blood sampling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that pancreatic stone protein has the highest diagnostic accuracy for complications and is the best predictor for death in the ICU. Pancreatic stone protein had the highest overall efficacy in predicting death with an odds ratio of 4.0 vs. procalcitonin (odds ratio 3.2), interleukin-6 (odds ratio 2.8), C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.3), and WBCs (odds ratio 1.4). By multivariate analysis, pancreatic stone protein was the only independent predictor of death.

SETTING: One hundred seventy-nine U.S. hospitals with training programs in critical care accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. SUBJECTS: Six hundred thirty intensivists recruited via e-mail invitation from a database of 1,850 eligible academic intensivists. INTERVENTIONS: Each intensivist was randomized to review 10, online, clinical scenarios with a range of illness severities involving a hypothetical patient (Mrs. X). In control-group scenarios, the patient did not want continued life support without a reasonable chance of independent living. In the first experimental arm, the patient wanted life support regardless of functional outcome. In the second experimental arm, patient values were identical to the control group, but intensivists were required to record the patient's estimated 3-month functional prognosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Response to the question: ""Would you bring up the possibility of withdrawing life support with Mrs. X's family?"" answered using a five-point Likert scale. There was no effect of patient values on whether intensivists intended to discuss withdrawal of life support (p = 0.81), but intensivists randomized to record functional prognosis were 49% more likely (95% CI, 20-85%) to discuss withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: In this national, scenario-based, randomized trial, patient values had no effect on intensivists' decisions to discuss withdrawal of life support with family. However, requiring intensivists to record patients' estimated 3-month functional outcome substantially increased their intention to discuss withdrawal.",2014,10.1097/CCM.0000000000000227,42,6,1455-1462,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Prognosis and *Decision Making and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and *Patient Preference and *Family and Intensive Care Units/standards and *Withholding Treatment and *Social Values and Life Support Care/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2014/06//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Expert panel consensus and a prospective longitudinal survey. SETTING: Urban, academic, tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS: One hundred fifteen awake, mechanically ventilated, ICU patients who either received a tracheostomy or remained endotracheally intubated. INTERVENTIONS: A new quality-of-life instrument was developed and validated by using pilot study data; informal interviews of patients, families, and nurses; expert panel consensus; and item analyses. The new instrument was used to measure quality of life at three time points (5 d, 10 d, and 15 d after intubation). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A new 12-item quality-of-life questionnaire for mechanically ventilated patients was developed. Patients' responses to the quality-of-life questionnaire revealed moderate-to-high correlations with EuroQol scores (r = -0.4 to -0.9) and the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (r = 0.6-0.9) across the three times and a moderate correlation with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment tool (r = 0.5) at 10 days after intubation. Cronbach <ce><b1> ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 across the three times. The quality-of-life questionnaire for mechanically ventilated patients was responsive to changes in treatment modalities (tracheostomy vs no tracheostomy and early vs late tracheostomy demarcated by 10 d of intubation). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that this instrument was unidimensional in nature. CONCLUSIONS: The new quality-of-life questionnaire for mechanically ventilated patients is valid and can reliably measure quality of life in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. It may provide clinicians with an accurate assessment of patients' quality of life and facilitate optimal decision making regarding patients' ICU plan of care.",2015,10.1097/CCM.0000000000000552,43,1,142-148,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Reproducibility of Results and Aged, 80 and over and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards and *Quality of Life/psychology and Respiration, Artificial/adverse effects/*psychology and Tracheostomy/adverse effects/psychology",NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Majesko_2012_Critcaremedi,JOUR,Identifying family members who may struggle in the role of surrogate decision maker,"Majesko, Alyssa and Hong, Seo Yeon and Weissfeld, Lisa and White, Douglas B.",Critical care medicine,"Although acting as a surrogate decision maker can be highly distressing for some family members of intensive care unit patients, little is known about whether there are modifiable risk factors for the occurrence of such difficulties. OBJECTIVES: To identify: 1) factors associated with lower levels of confidence among family members to function as surrogates and 2) whether the quality of clinician-family communication is associated with the timing of decisions to forego life support. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 230 surrogate decision makers for incapacitated, mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of death in four intensive care units at University of California San Francisco Medical Center from 2006 to 2007. Surrogates completed a questionnaire addressing their perceived ability to act as a surrogate and the quality of their communication with physicians. We used clustered multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of low levels of perceived ability to act as a surrogate and a Cox proportional hazard model to determine whether quality of communication was associated with the timing of decisions to withdraw life support. RESULTS: There was substantial variability in family members' confidence to act as surrogate decision makers, with 27% rating their perceived ability as 7 or lower on a 10-point scale. Independent predictors of lower role confidence were the lack of prior experience as a surrogate (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval [1.04-4.46], p=.04), no prior discussions with the patient about treatment preferences (odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval [1.79-7.76], p<.001), and poor quality of communication with the ICU physician (odds ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval [1.09-1.35] p<.001). Higher quality physician-family communication was associated with a significantly shorter duration of life-sustaining treatment among patients who died (<ce><b2>=0.11, p=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Family members without prior experience as a surrogate and those who had not engaged in advanced discussions with the patient about treatment preferences were at higher risk to report less confidence in carrying out the surrogate role. Better-quality clinician-family communication was associated with both more confidence among family members to act as surrogates and a shorter duration of use of life support among patients who died.",2012,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182533317,40,8,2281-2286,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires and Prospective Studies and Intensive Care Units and Third-Party Consent and Withholding Treatment and Family/*psychology and Advance Directives/psychology and Proxy/*psychology and Role,NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-two Canadian ICUs. PATIENTS: We recruited 527 patients 80 years or older who had a medical or urgent surgical diagnosis and were admitted to an ICU for at least 24 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At baseline, we completed a comprehensive geriatric assessment of enrolled patients; survival and functional status was determined 12 months later. We defined recovery from critical illness as Palliative Performance Scale score of greater than or equal to 60. We used logistic regression analysis to examine factors associated with this outcome. Of the 434 patients (82%) whose Palliative Performance Scale was known at 12 months, 50% had died and 29% (126/434) had a score of greater than or equal to 60. In the multivariable model, we found that being married, having a primary diagnosis of emergency coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement, and higher baseline Palliative Performance Scale were independently predictive of a 12-month Palliative Performance Scale score of greater than or equal to 60. Male sex, primary diagnosis of stroke, and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Charlson comorbidity index, or clinical frailty scale were independently predictive of Palliative Performance Scale score of less than 60. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-quarter of very old ICU patients achieve a reasonable level of function 1 year after admission.

DESIGN: A single-group descriptive longitudinal correlational study. SETTING: Medical, surgical, and neurological ICUs in a large tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive family decision makers of adult critical care patients from August 2012 to November 2013. Study inclusion occurred after the patient's fifth day in the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Family decision makers of incapacitated adult ICU patients completed the Brief COPE instrument assessing coping strategy use 5 days after ICU admission and 30 days after hospital discharge or death of the patient and completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised assessing posttraumatic stress symptoms 60 days after hospital discharge. Seventy-seven family decision makers of the eligible 176 completed all data collection time points of this study. The use of problem-focused (p=0.01) and emotion-focused (p<0.01) coping decreased over time while avoidant coping (p=0.20) use remained stable. Coping strategies 30 days after hospitalization (R2=0.50, p<0.001) were better predictors of later posttraumatic stress symptoms than coping strategies 5 days after ICU admission (R2=0.30, p=0.001) controlling for patient and decision-maker characteristics. The role of decision maker for a parent and patient death were the only noncoping predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTING: A 1,720-bed medical center affiliated with a university. PATIENTS: In all, 226 patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage who presented at our hospital from 2001-2005. INTERVENTIONS: Group A (n = 113) underwent endoscopic surgery; group B (n = 113) underwent conservative treatment. Score differences on the Glasgow Outcome Scale and 1-yr Barthel Index were analyzed by chi-square test and Student's t-tests. Cut-offs for MICH scoring were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves for calculating the Youden Index. The treatment odds ratio was analyzed by univariate, multivariate, and multiple logistic regressions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The optimal cut-off point for mortality was a MICH score > or = 3 in which the Youden Index is 0.66 (sensitivity, 76.3%; specificity, 89.8%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.897). The positive and negative predictive values were 81.8% and 86.3%, respectively. The treatment odds ratio for surgical treatment was 6.87 (95% confidence interval, 3.13-14.5) at MICH scores > or = 3. The best cut-off for good functional outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale > or = 4 or Barthel index > or = 55) was MICH > or = 2. Conservative treatment achieved a better mean Barthel Index at MICH = 0 or 1 than surgical treatment, p < .01. At MICH scores = 3 or 4, 6-month mortality for conservative treatment was higher than for surgical treatment, p < .01 and p = .04, respectively. At MICH scores of 5, all patients died. CONCLUSIONS: MICH scoring provides a simple, reliable system for treatment decisions regarding basal ganglia hemorrhage and may accurately predict functional outcomes. Conservative treatment is recommended for basal ganglia ICH patients with low MICH scores (0, 1) to preserve neurologic function. Surgery is recommended for patients with a midlevel MICH score to obtain better functional outcomes (MICH = 2) and to reduce mortality (MICH = 3 or 4).

This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis. SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1%); trauma (10.2%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7%); pulmonary diseases (9.0%); infectious diseases (7.0%); and neoplasms (6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records.

This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of peripheral blood monocyte distribution width alone and in combination with WBC count for early sepsis detection in the emergency department. DESIGN: An Institutional Review Board approved, blinded, observational, prospective cohort study conducted between April 2017 and January 2018. SETTING: Subjects were enrolled from emergency departments at three U.S. academic centers. PATIENTS: Adult patients, 18-89 years, with complete blood count performed upon presentation to the emergency department, and who remained hospitalized for at least 12 hours. A total of 2,212 patients were screened, of whom 2,158 subjects were enrolled and categorized per Sepsis-2 criteria, such as controls (n = 1,088), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (n = 441), infection (n = 244), and sepsis (n = 385), and Sepsis-3 criteria, such as control (n = 1,529), infection (n = 386), and sepsis (n = 243). INTERVENTIONS: The primary outcome determined whether an monocyte distribution width of greater than 20.0 U, alone or in combination with WBC, improves early sepsis detection by Sepsis-2 criteria. Secondary endpoints determined monocyte distribution width performance for Sepsis-3 detection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Monocyte distribution width greater than 20.0 U distinguished sepsis from all other conditions based on either Sepsis-2 criteria (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.82) or Sepsis-3 criteria (area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76). The negative predictive values for monocyte distribution width less than or equal to 20 U for Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 were 93% and 94%, respectively. Monocyte distribution width greater than 20.0 U combined with an abnormal WBC further improved Sepsis-2 detection (area under the curve, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88) and as reflected by likelihood ratio and added value analyses. Normal WBC and monocyte distribution width inferred a six-fold lower sepsis probability. CONCLUSIONS: An monocyte distribution width value of greater than 20.0 U is effective for sepsis detection, based on either Sepsis-2 criteria or Sepsis-3 criteria, during the initial emergency department encounter. In tandem with WBC, monocyte distribution width is further predicted to enhance medical decision making during early sepsis management in the emergency department.",2019,10.1097/CCM.0000000000003799,47,8,1018-1025,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Case-Control Studies and Prospective Studies and *Emergency Service, Hospital and Biomarkers/blood and Lymphocyte Count/methods and Monocytes/*metabolism and Sepsis/diagnosis/*metabolism and Shock, Septic/diagnosis/*metabolism",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Cohort study using the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (NSCOT) database. Risk ratio and Poisson regression analyses were performed using data weighted according to the population of eligible patients. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A total of 18 level 1 and 51 level 2 non-trauma centers located in 14 states in the United States and 1,776 adults aged 25-84 yrs with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. MEASUREMENTS: Injury severity was determined by the motor component of the Glasgow Coma Scale score, the Injury Severity Score, pupillary reactivity, and presence of midline shift. Factors evaluated as contributing to intensity of care included: admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, placement of an intracranial pressure monitor, placement of a jugular bulb catheter, placement of a pulmonary artery catheter, critical care consultation, the number of specialty care consultations, mannitol use, treatment with barbiturate coma, decompressive craniectomy, number of nonneurosurgical procedures performed, the presence of a do-not-resuscitate order, and withdrawal of therapy. MAIN RESULTS: Controlling for injury-related factors, sex, and comorbidity, as age increased, the overall likelihood of receiving various interventions decreased. After controlling for injury severity, sex, and comorbidity, factors associated with higher risk of in-hospital death were: being aged 75-84 yrs (relative risk [RR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 1.55), pulmonary artery catheter use (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30, 1.86), intubation (RR 4.17, 95% CI 2.28, 7.61), the presence of a do-not-resuscitate order (RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.21, 4.65), and withdrawal of therapy (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.69, 3.23). In contrast, a higher number of specialty care consultations (surgical consults: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54, 0.74; medical consults: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79, 0.95; and other consults: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26, 0.69) were associated with decreased risk of death. The results were similar for factors associated with death at 12 months, with the exception that the number of medical consultations was not significant, whereas the number of nonneurosurgical procedures performed was associated with lower risk of death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92, 0.99), as was obtaining critical care consultation services (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71, 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: There is a lower intensity of care provided to older adults with traumatic brain injury. Although the specific contributions of specialists to patient management are unknown, their consultation was associated with decreased risk of in-hospital death and death within 12 months. It is important that careproviders have an increased awareness of the potential contribution of multidisciplinary clinical decision making to patient outcomes in older traumatically brain-injured patients.",2008,10.1097/01.CCM.0000297884.86058.8A,36,1,282-290,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Risk and Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Hospital Mortality and Sex Distribution and Cohort Studies and Injury Severity Score and Aged, 80 and over and Age Distribution and United States/epidemiology and Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care and Brain Injuries/*mortality/*therapy and Critical Care/methods/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2008/01//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Fifty-two hospital Michigan quality collaborative. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven-thousand two-hundred eighty-nine patients with peripherally inserted central catheters placed during hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient, provider, and device characteristics. Bivariate tests were used to assess differences between peripherally inserted central catheters placed in the ICU versus peripherally inserted central catheters placed on the ward. Multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models adjusting for patient and device factors with a logit link clustered by hospital were used to examine the association between peripherally inserted central catheter complications and location of peripherally inserted central catheter placement. Variation in ICU peripherally inserted central catheter use, rates of complications, and appropriateness of use across hospitals was also examined. Eight-thousand two-hundred eighty patients (30.3%) received peripherally inserted central catheters in the ICU versus 19,009 (69.7%) on the general ward. The commonest indication for peripherally inserted central catheter use in the ICU was difficult IV access (35.1%) versus antibiotic therapy (53.3%) on wards. Compared with peripherally inserted central catheters placed in wards, peripherally inserted central catheters placed in the ICU were more often multilumen (59.5% vs 39.3; p < 0.001) and more often associated with a complication (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18-1.43; p < 0.001). Substantial variation in ICU peripherally inserted central catheter use and outcomes across hospitals was observed, with median peripherally inserted central catheter dwell time ranging from 3 to 38.5 days (p < 0.001) and complications from 0% to 40.2% (p < 0.001). Importantly, 87% (n = 45) of ICUs reported median peripherally inserted central catheter dwell times less than or equal to 14 days, a duration where traditional central venous catheters, not peripherally inserted central catheters, are considered appropriate by published criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Peripherally inserted central catheter use in the ICU is highly variable, associated with complications and often not appropriate.

Kent Jr and Kim, Grace and Goodwin, Haley and Geocadin, Romergryko G.",Critical care medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize associations between antiepileptic drugs with sedating or anesthetic effects (third-line antiepileptic drugs) vs. other antiepileptic agents, and short-term outcomes, in status epilepticus. Furthermore, to evaluate the role of adverse hemodynamic and respiratory effects of these agents in status epilepticus treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative analysis. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center with two emergency departments and two neurologic intensive care units. PATIENTS: Adults admitted with a diagnosis of status epilepticus defined as seizures lasting continuously >5 mins, or for discrete periods in succession. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 126 patients with 144 separate status epilepticus admissions, 57 were female (45%) with mean age 54.7 <c2><b1> 15.7 yrs. Status epilepticus was convulsive in 132 cases (92%). Status epilepticus etiologies included subtherapeutic antiepileptic drugs (43%), alcohol or other nonantiepileptic drug (13%), and acute central nervous system disease (12%). Third-line antiepileptic drugs were administered in 47 cases (33%). Seventy-eight status epilepticus episodes (54%) had good outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Score = 1, 2) at the time of hospital discharge. On univariate analysis, poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score > 2) was associated with older age (mean 59.8 <c2><b1> 15.5 vs. 50.5 <c2><b1> 13.8 yrs, p < .001), acute central nervous system disease (21% vs. 4%, p = .001), mechanical ventilation (76% vs. 53%, p = .004), longer duration of ventilation (median 10 days [range 1-56] vs. 2 days [range 1-10], p < .001), treatment with vasopressors (35% vs. 5%, p < .001), and treatment with third-line antiepileptic drugs (51% vs. 17%, p < .001). Death was associated with acute central nervous system disease, prolonged ventilation, treatment with vasopressors, and treatment with third-line antiepileptic drugs. Predictors of poor outcome among all status epilepticus episodes were older age (odds ratio 1.06; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.09; p < .001), treatment with third-line antiepileptic therapy (odds ratio 5.64; 95% confidence interval 2.31-13.75; p < .001), and first episode of status epilepticus (odds ratio 3.73; 95% confidence interval 1.38-10.10; p = .010). Among status epilepticus episodes treated by third-line antiepileptic drugs, predictors of poor outcome were older age (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.18; p = .038) and longer ventilation (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.00; p = .015). Predictors of mortality among all status epilepticus episodes were treatment with third-line antiepileptic drugs (odds ratio, 12.08; 95% confidence interval 2.30-63.39; p = .003) and older age (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.12; p = .045). CONCLUSIONS: Third-line antiepileptic drug therapies with sedating or anesthetic effects predicted poor outcome and death in status epilepticus. Hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy and duration of mechanical ventilation induced by these agents may be contributing factors, especially when pentobarbital is used. These findings may inform decision making on drug therapy in status epilepticus and help develop safer and more effective treatment strategies to improve outcome.",2012,10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182591ff1,40,9,2677-2684,eng,1530-0293 0090-3493,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Multivariate Analysis and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Analysis of Variance and Predictive Value of Tests and Emergency Service, Hospital and Age Factors and Survival Analysis and Critical Illness and Intensive Care Units and Confidence Intervals and APACHE and Hospital Mortality/*trends and Glasgow Coma Scale and Respiration, Artificial/*methods and Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage and Pentobarbital/*administration & dosage and Status Epilepticus/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy and Vasoconstrictor Agents/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
