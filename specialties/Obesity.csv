Loke_2020_Do.m,JOUR,Propensity score methods in real-world epidemiology: A practical guide for first-time users,"Loke, Yoon Kong and Mattishent, Katharina","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Real-world epidemiology gives us the unique opportunity to observe large numbers of people, and the actions and events that characterize their encounters with healthcare providers. However, the heterogeneity and sheer diversity of the population and healthcare systems makes it impossible for researchers to compare ""like with like"" when attempting to draw causal inferences about interventions and outcomes. The critical issue in epidemiological datasets relates to high risk of bias due to confounders that stem from baseline differences between groups. Propensity score (PS) techniques are statistical approaches that have been used to tackle potential imbalance in the comparison groups. The PS is the estimated probability (based on measured baseline covariates) that the patient receives a particular intervention. Patients that share similar PS will most likely have the same distributions of underlying covariates included in the PS. Implementation of PS methods may achieve better balance of covariates, but there is no consensus on the best way of capturing all relevant confounders for incorporation into the PS model. Should covariates be selected by clinical or epidemiological experts, or would data-driven algorithms (machine learning) offer more efficient and reliable methods of estimating PS and controlling for confounding? The PS can be incorporated into the analysis in different ways, each with its own strengths and limitations, and researchers must choose the best fit for their study objectives. PS methods are particularly advantageous in situations where there are large numbers of measured covariates but relatively few outcome events captured in healthcare administrative databases.",2020,10.1111/dom.13926,22 Suppl 3,NA,13-20,eng,1463-1326 1462-8902,"Humans and Causality and Bias and *Algorithms and Propensity Score and *Models, Statistical and pharmaco-epidemiology",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Diabetes Obes Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zaccardi_2020_Do.m,JOUR,The present and future scope of real-world evidence research in diabetes: What questions can and cannot be answered and what might be possible in the future?,"Zaccardi, Francesco and Davies, Melanie J. and Khunti, Kamlesh","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","The last decade has witnessed an exponential growth in the opportunities to collect and link health-related data from multiple resources, including primary care, administrative, and device data. The availability of these ""real-world,"" ""big data"" has fuelled also an intense methodological research into methods to handle them and extract actionable information. In medicine, the evidence generated from ""real-world data"" (RWD), which are not purposely collected to answer biomedical questions, is commonly termed ""real-world evidence"" (RWE). In this review, we focus on RWD and RWE in the area of diabetes research, highlighting their contributions in the last decade; and give some suggestions for future RWE diabetes research, by applying well-established and less-known tools to direct RWE diabetes research towards better personalized approaches to diabetes care. We underline the essential aspects to consider when using RWD and the key features limiting the translational potential of RWD in generating high-quality and applicable RWE. Only if viewed in the context of other study designs and statistical methods, with its pros and cons carefully considered, RWE will exploit its full potential as a complementary or even, in some cases, substitutive source of evidence compared to the expensive evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials.",2020,10.1111/dom.13929,22 Suppl 3,NA,21-34,eng,1463-1326 1462-8902,Humans and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and *Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/therapy and *Research Design,NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Diabetes Obes Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seitz_2011_Do.m,JOUR,Interventions in primary care to improve cardiovascular risk factors and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes: a systematic review,"Seitz, P. and Rosemann, T. and Gensichen, J. and Huber, C. A.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Most patients with diabetes are treated in primary care (PC). We performed a systematic review to assess the effect of single and combined interventions on cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes in PC settings. We searched the MEDLINE database from January 1990 to October 2008. According to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group (EPOC) criteria, (cluster-)randomized control studies and controlled before-and-after studies were selected and reviewed. Identified interventions were classified according to a modified EPOC intervention taxonomy. We included 68 studies. Forty-five studies evaluated the effect of any intervention on HbA1c. Seventeen studies presented a significant improvement in HbA1c. Nine out of 27 studies evaluating CVRFs [cholesterol, blood pressure (BP)] and HbA1c showed a significant improvement in at least two of these factors. Audit and feedback on performance, clinical decision support systems, multi-professional teams and patient education seemed to be successful strategies. The increasing evidence regarding the treatment of persons with chronic illnesses, summarized in the Chronic Care Model (CCM), is not reflected in most recent studies about diabetes treatment in PC. Most interventions still seem only partly adapted to the CCM. The methodological quality of many studies is still poor and often the pivotal outcomes, CVRFs and HbA1c, are not appropriately addressed. As a consequence, the potential of PC in the care of patients with diabetes may still be underestimated.",2011,10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01347.x,13,6,479-489,eng,1463-1326 1462-8902,Humans and Female and Male and Primary Health Care and Clinical Trials as Topic and Risk Factors and Cardiovascular Diseases/physiopathology/*prevention & control and Diabetes Mellitus/*metabolism/physiopathology and Glycated Hemoglobin A/*metabolism,NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,Diabetes Obes Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Data were accessed from 4050 general practices (50% of total) covering 1.6 million patients with T2DM in the UK National Diabetes Audit 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015. This audit reported characteristics, services and outcomes in the T2DM population, including percentage of patients who had total glycaemic control (TGC), defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <e2><89><a4>7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and the percentage who were at higher glycaemic risk (HGR), defined as HbA1c >10% (86 mmol/mol); the respective figures were 67.2% and 6.2%. The medication data were examined in terms of annual defined daily doses (DDDs). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify associations between DDD and patient and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Over the period 2012/2013 to 2015/2016, patient numbers grew 4% annually and annual medication expenditure by 8%, but glycaemic control outcomes did not improve. The main findings were that practices with better outcomes: had a higher percentage of patients aged >65 years; provided more effective diabetes services (including case identification, care checks, patient education, percentage of patients with blood pressure and cholesterol under control and more patients with type 1 diabetes achieving target HbA1c levels); spent less overall on prescribing per patient with T2DM; and on average, prescribed fewer sulphonylureas, less insulin (for patients with T2DM), fewer glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, more metformin, more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and more blood glucose monitoring strips. Ethnicity and social disadvantage and levels of thiazolidinedione (glitazone) prescribing had no significant impact on outcomes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor use was too low for an effect to be observed in the period examined. CONCLUSIONS: If all practices brought their service and medication to the level of the top decile practices, they could achieve 74.7% compared with the median of 67.3% of patients achieving TGC, showing an increase of 213 000 in patients achieving TGC, while reducing the number at HGR to 3.8% compared with 6.1%, benefiting 62 000 patients.

As the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, DKD is a thorny, clinical problem in terms of its diagnosis and management. Intensive glucose control in DKD could slow down but not significantly halt disease progression. Revisiting the tremendous advances that have occurred in the field would enhance recognition of DKD pathogenesis as well as improve our understanding of translational science in DKD in this new era. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize advances in the understanding of the local microenvironmental changes in diabetic kidneys and discuss the involvement of genetic and epigenetic factors in the pathogenesis of DKD. We also review DKD prevalence changes and analyze the challenges in optimizing the diagnostic approaches and management strategies for DKD in the clinic. As we enter the era of 'big data', we also explore the possibility of linking systems biology with translational medicine in DKD in the current healthcare system. MAJOR CONCLUSION: Newer understanding of the structural changes of diabetic kidneys and mechanisms of DKD pathogenesis, as well as emergent research technologies will shed light on new methods of dealing with the existing clinical challenges of DKD.",2019,10.1016/j.molmet.2019.10.005,30,NA,250-263,eng,2212-8778,Humans and Genetics and Epigenomics/methods and Systems biology and Diabetes Complications/metabolism and Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism and Diabetic kidney disease and Diabetic Nephropathies/*genetics/*metabolism/*physiopathology and Epigenetics and Kidney/metabolism/pathology and Metabolic memory and Systems Biology/methods,NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,Mol Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

This view is consistent with the life course perspective of obesity and the aim of patient-centered care, one of six domains of health care quality. However, thus far, the value and practicality of including a weight history in the clinical assessment and treatment of patients with obesity have not been systematically explored. For these reasons, the Clinical Committee of The Obesity Society established a task force to review and assess the available evidence to address five key questions. It is concluded that weight history is an essential component of the medical history for patients presenting with overweight or obesity, and there are strong and emerging data that demonstrate the importance of life stage, duration of exposure to obesity, maximum BMI, and group-based trajectory modeling in predicting risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Consideration of these and other patient-specific factors may improve risk stratification and clinical decision-making for screening, counseling, and management. Recommendations are provided for the key elements that should be included in a weight history, and several needs for future clinical research are outlined.",2020,10.1002/oby.22642,28,1,17-9,eng,1930-739X 1930-7381,"Mortality and Morbidity and Humans and Decision Making and Counseling and *Body-Weight Trajectory and *Medical History Taking/methods/standards and Body Weight/*physiology and Obesity/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy and Overweight/epidemiology/pathology/therapy and Patient-Centered Care/methods/standards/*trends and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/trends",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Obesity (Silver Spring),NA,NA,NA,NA

A persistent dilemma is that investigators have to read and manually classify thousands of individual news articles to identify how obesity and obesity-related policy proposals may be described to the public in the media. A machine learning method called ""automated content analysis"" that permits researchers to train computers to ""read"" and classify massive volumes of documents was demonstrated. METHODS: 14,302 newspaper articles that mentioned the word ""obesity"" during 2011-2012 were identified. Four states that vary in obesity prevalence and policy (Alabama, California, New Jersey, and North Carolina) were examined. The reliability of an automated program to categorize the media's framing of obesity as an individual-level problem (e.g., diet) and/or an environmental-level problem (e.g., obesogenic environment) was tested. RESULTS: The automated program performed similarly to human coders. The proportion of articles with individual-level framing (27.7-31.0%) was higher than the proportion with neutral (18.0-22.1%) or environmental-level framing (16.0-16.4%) across all states and over the entire study period (P<0.05).

This study characterized geographic and temporal variation in the US media's framing of obesity across states from 2006 to 2015. METHODS: Newspaper articles that mentioned the term obesity were drawn from Access World News (NewsBank, Inc., Naples, Florida), a comprehensive online database (N = 364,288). This study employed automated content analysis, a machine learning technique, to categorize articles as (1) attributing obesity to individual-level causes (e.g., lifestyle behaviors), (2) attributing obesity to environmental/systemic causes (e.g., neighborhood walkability), (3) attributing obesity to both individual-level causes and environmental/systemic causes, or (4) articles without any such attribution framework. RESULTS: Nationwide across all years, a higher proportion of articles focused on individual-level attribution of obesity than environmental-level attribution or both. Missouri and Idaho had the highest proportions of articles with an individual framework, and Nevada, Arkansas, and Wisconsin had the highest proportions of articles with an environmental framework.
