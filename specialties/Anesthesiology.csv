Grocott_2019_Anae,JOUR,Peri-operative care pathways: re-engineering care to achieve the 'triple aim',"Grocott, M. P. W. and Edwards, M. and Mythen, M. G. and Aronson, S.",Anaesthesia,"Elective surgical pathways offer a particular opportunity to plan radical change in the way care is delivered, based on patient need rather than provider convenience. Peri-operative pathway redesign enables improved patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction), population/public health, and healthcare value (outcome per unit of currency). Among physicians with the skills to work within peri-operative medicine, anaesthetists are well positioned to lead the re-engineering of such pathways. Re-engineered pre-operative pathways open up opportunities for intervention before surgery including shared decision-making, comorbidity management and collaborative behavioural change. Individualised, risk-adapted, intra-operative interventions will drive more reliable and consistent care. Risk-adapted postoperative care, particularly around transitions of care, has a significant role in improving value through peri-operative medicine. Improved integration with primary care providers offers the potential for minimising errors around transitions of care before and after surgery, as well as maximising opportunities for population health interventions, including lifestyle modification (e.g. activity/exercise, smoking and/or alcohol cessation), pain management and sleep medicine. Systematic data collection focused on quality improvement is essential to drive continuous clinical improvement and will be enabled by technological development in predictive analytics, systems modelling and artificial intelligence.",2019,10.1111/anae.14513,74 Suppl 1,NA,90-99,eng,1365-2044 0003-2409,Humans and Pain Management/*methods and Perioperative Care/*methods and *Life Style and *Sleep Hygiene and peri-operative medicine and pre-operative assessment and prehabilitation and process re-engineering and surgical care pathways,NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,Anaesthesia,NA,NA,NA,NA

Machine-learning methods allow large amounts of data for development of robust predictive analytics. The authors hypothesized that machine-learning methods can provide prediction for the risk of postinduction hypotension. METHODS: Data was extracted from the electronic health record of a single quaternary care center from November 2015 to May 2016 for patients over age 12 that underwent general anesthesia, without procedure exclusions. Multiple supervised machine-learning classification techniques were attempted, with postinduction hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg within 10 min of induction by any measurement) as primary outcome, and preoperative medications, medical comorbidities, induction medications, and intraoperative vital signs as features. Discrimination was assessed using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The best performing model was tuned and final performance assessed using split-set validation. RESULTS: Out of 13,323 cases, 1,185 (8.9%) experienced postinduction hypotension. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.72), support vector machines was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.60), naive Bayes was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.69), k-nearest neighbor was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.65), linear discriminant analysis was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.73), random forest was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.75), neural nets 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.71), and gradient boosting machine 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.77). Test set area for the gradient boosting machine was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.77).

Tracheostomy-related adverse events remain a pervasive global problem, accounting for half of all airway-related deaths and hypoxic brain damage in critical care units. The Global Tracheostomy Collaborative (GTC) was formed in 2012 to improve patient safety and quality of care, emphasising knowledge, skills, teamwork, and patient-centred approaches. Inspired by quality improvement leads in Australia, the UK, and the USA, the GTC implements and disseminates best practices across hospitals and healthcare trusts. Its database collects patient-level information on quality, safety, and organisational efficiencies. The GTC provides an organising structure for quality improvement efforts, promoting safety of paediatric and adult patients. Successful implementation requires instituting key drivers for change that include effective training for health professionals; multidisciplinary team collaboration; engagement and involvement of patients, their families, and carers; and data collection that allows tracking of outcomes. We report the history of the collaborative, its database infrastructure and analytics, and patient outcomes from more than 6500 patients globally. We characterise this patient population for the first time at such scale, reporting predictors of adverse events, mortality, and length of stay indexed to patient characteristics, co-morbidities, risk factors, and context.

Stiegler_2014_Anes,JOUR,Cognitive processes in anesthesiology decision making,"Stiegler, Marjorie Podraza and Tung, Avery",Anesthesiology,"The quality and safety of health care are under increasing scrutiny. Recent studies suggest that medical errors, practice variability, and guideline noncompliance are common, and that cognitive error contributes significantly to delayed or incorrect diagnoses. These observations have increased interest in understanding decision-making psychology.Many nonrational (i.e., not purely based in statistics) cognitive factors influence medical decisions and may lead to error. The most well-studied include heuristics, preferences for certainty, overconfidence, affective (emotional) influences, memory distortions, bias, and social forces such as fairness or blame.Although the extent to which such cognitive processes play a role in anesthesia practice is unknown, anesthesia care frequently requires rapid, complex decisions that are most susceptible to decision errors. This review will examine current theories of human decision behavior, identify effects of nonrational cognitive processes on decision making, describe characteristic anesthesia decisions in this context, and suggest strategies to improve decision making.",2014,10.1097/ALN.0000000000000073,120,1,204-217,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,"Emotions and Humans and Decision Support Techniques and Models, Psychological and Bayes Theorem and Mental Processes and *Cognition and *Decision Making and Self Concept and Professional Practice and Medical Errors/prevention & control and Anesthesiology/education/*methods and Memory/physiology",NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to develop an intelligent recognition system (i-RS) in order to guide epidural placement and reduce physician error. METHODS: We analysed real-time dual-wavelength fibreoptic data recorded from the end of an epidural needle in a live porcine model. Two categories of tissue layers were necessary for correct placement of catheter: epidural space and ligamentum flavum. The data were tested using linear, quadratic and logistic parametric analysis to identify which method could distinguish the two anatomical structures. RESULTS: LDA was the best fit for our model. There was <e2><88><bc>80% sensitivity and specificity for correct anatomical identification. Error rates based on cross-validation were 17.0% for the epidural space and 18.6% for ligamentum flavum. Error rates were greater with the 532 nm compared with 650 nm wavelength. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of LDA for identifying the correct anatomical structure was similar to a physician who is an expert in epidural placement. Overall performance of an i-RS could be improved by expanding the database for decision-making and adding a category of uncertainty.

Existing risk scores either lack specificity at the patient level or utilise the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, which requires a clinician to review the chart. METHODS: We report on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forests, to create a fully automated score that predicts postoperative in-hospital mortality based solely on structured data available at the time of surgery. Electronic health record data from 53 097 surgical patients (2.01% mortality rate) who underwent general anaesthesia between April 1, 2013 and December 10, 2018 in a large US academic medical centre were used to extract 58 preoperative features.

To better understand the decision process itself, our ethnographic approach combined observation of and interviews with critical care physicians in a large English hospital. We observed 30 critical care doctors managing 71 referrals and conducted ten interviews with senior decision-makers to explore the themes raised by our observations. We analysed data using the constant comparative method. We found that the decision to move a patient to critical care was just one way in which the trajectory of critical illness could be modified. When patients were admitted to critical care, it was not always for invasive monitoring or advanced organ support, with some admitted for more general medical and/or nursing care. When patients were declined admission, they were not simply forgotten or left behind; they nevertheless underwent careful assessment and follow-up. Thus, depicting admission or refusal as a binary event is misleading.

This mixed-methods study in two parts explores the concept of 'barriers to challenging seniors' for anaesthetic trainees, and proposes a conceptual framework. Using a fully immersive simulation scenario with unanticipated airway difficulty, we investigated how junior anaesthetists (one to two years of training) challenged a scripted error. We also conducted focus groups with senior trainees (three to seven years of training) and undertook a 'thematic network analysis' of responses. Junior anaesthetic trainees challenged erroneous decisions effectively, but trainees with an additional year of experience challenged more quickly and effectively, combining 'crisp-advocacy-inquiry challenge' with 'non-verbal cues'. Focus group analysis conceptualised a 'barrier network' with three main themes: concerns around relationships; decision-making; and risk/cost-benefit.

Advanced data science techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, offer opportunities to develop classification tools for Current Procedural Terminology codes across anesthesia procedures. METHODS: Models were created using a Train/Test dataset including 1,164,343 procedures from 16 academic and private hospitals. Five supervised machine learning models were created to classify anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology codes, with accuracy defined as first choice classification matching the institutional-assigned code existing in the perioperative database. The two best performing models were further refined and tested on a Holdout dataset from a single institution distinct from Train/Test. A tunable confidence parameter was created to identify cases for which models were highly accurate, with the goal of at least 95% accuracy, above the reported 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Baltimore, Maryland) fee-for-service accuracy. Actual submitted claim data from billing specialists were used as a reference standard. RESULTS: Support vector machine and neural network label-embedding attentive models were the best performing models, respectively, demonstrating overall accuracies of 87.9% and 84.2% (single best code), and 96.8% and 94.0% (within top three). Classification accuracy was 96.4% in 47.0% of cases using support vector machine and 94.4% in 62.2% of cases using label-embedding attentive model within the Train/Test dataset. In the Holdout dataset, respective classification accuracies were 93.1% in 58.0% of cases and 95.0% among 62.0%. The most important feature in model training was procedure text. CONCLUSIONS: Through application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, highly accurate real-time models were created for anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology code classification.

This psychology of decision-making has received little formal attention in anaesthesiology literature, although it is widely appreciated in other safety cultures, such as aviation, and other medical specialities. We sought to identify which types of cognitive errors are most important in anaesthesiology. METHODS: This study consisted of two parts. First, we created a cognitive error catalogue specific to anaesthesiology practice using a literature review, modified Delphi method with experts, and a survey of academic faculty. In the second part, we observed for those cognitive errors during resident physician management of simulated anaesthesiology emergencies. RESULTS: Of >30 described cognitive errors, the modified Delphi method yielded 14 key items experts felt were most important and prevalent in anaesthesiology practice (Table 1). Faculty survey responses narrowed this to a 'top 10' catalogue consisting of anchoring, availability bias, premature closure, feedback bias, framing effect, confirmation bias, omission bias, commission bias, overconfidence, and sunk costs (Table 2). Nine types of cognitive errors were selected for observation during simulated emergency management. Seven of those nine types of cognitive errors occurred in >50% of observed emergencies (Table 3).

METHODS: The aim of this pilot prospective parallel group cohort study was to investigate the neural correlates of clinical decision-making, and to determine if simulation as opposed to online training influences these neural correlates. Twelve third-year medical students were randomized into two groups and received simulation-based or online-based training on anaphylaxis. This was followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to detect brain activation patterns while answering multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to anaphylaxis, and unrelated non-clinical (control) questions. Performance in the MCQs, salivary cortisol levels, heart rate, and arterial pressure were also measured. RESULTS: Comparing neural responses to clinical and non-clinical questions (in all participants), significant areas of activation were seen in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. These areas were activated in the online group when answering action-based questions related to their training, but not in the simulation group. The simulation group tended to react more quickly and accurately to clinical MCQs than the online group, but statistical significance was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: The activation areas seen could indicate increased stress when answering clinical questions compared with general non-clinical questions, and in the online group when answering action-based clinical questions.

Misic_2020_Anes,JOUR,Machine Learning Prediction of Postoperative Emergency Department Hospital Readmission,"Misic, Velibor V. and Gabel, Eilon and Hofer, Ira and Rajaram, Kumar and Mahajan, Aman",Anesthesiology,"BACKGROUND: Although prediction of hospital readmissions has been studied in medical patients, it has received relatively little attention in surgical patient populations. Published predictors require information only available at the moment of discharge. The authors hypothesized that machine learning approaches can be leveraged to accurately predict readmissions in postoperative patients from the emergency department. Further, the authors hypothesize that these approaches can accurately predict the risk of readmission much sooner than hospital discharge. METHODS: Using a cohort of surgical patients at a tertiary care academic medical center, surgical, demographic, lab, medication, care team, and current procedural terminology data were extracted from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was whether there existed a future hospital readmission originating from the emergency department within 30 days of surgery. Secondarily, the time interval from surgery to the prediction was analyzed at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h. Different machine learning models for predicting the primary outcome were evaluated with respect to the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve metric using different permutations of the available features. RESULTS: Surgical hospital admissions (N = 34,532) from April 2013 to December 2016 were included in the analysis. Surgical and demographic features led to moderate discrimination for prediction after discharge (area under the curve: 0.74 to 0.76), whereas medication, consulting team, and current procedural terminology features did not improve the discrimination. Lab features improved discrimination, with gradient-boosted trees attaining the best performance (area under the curve: 0.866, SD 0.006). This performance was sustained during temporal validation with 2017 to 2018 data (area under the curve: 0.85 to 0.88). Lastly, the discrimination of the predictions calculated 36 h after surgery (area under the curve: 0.88 to 0.89) nearly matched those from time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach to predicting postoperative readmission can produce hospital-specific models for accurately predicting 30-day readmissions via the emergency department. Moreover, these predictions can be confidently calculated at 36 h after surgery without consideration of discharge-level data.",2020,10.1097/ALN.0000000000003140,132,5,968-980,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,"*Machine Learning and *Patient Readmission and Emergency Service, Hospital and Hospitalization and Humans and Patient Discharge",NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aim was to understand how decisions to admit or not are made. We observed 55 decision-making events in six NHS hospitals. We interviewed 30 referring and 43 intensive care doctors about these events. We describe the nature and context of the decision-making and analysed how doctors make intensive care admission decisions. Such decisions are complex with intrinsic uncertainty, often urgent and made with incomplete information. While doctors aspire to make patient-centred decisions, key challenges include: being overworked with lack of time; limited support from senior staff; and a lack of adequate staffing in other parts of the hospital that may be compromising patient safety. To reduce decision complexity, heuristic rules based on experience are often used to help think through the problem; for example, the patient's functional status or clinical gestalt. The intensive care doctors actively managed relationships with referring doctors; acted as the hospital generalist for acutely ill patients; and brought calm to crisis situations. However, they frequently failed to elicit values and preferences from patients or family members. They were rarely explicit in balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care for patients, so consistency and equity cannot be judged. The use of a framework for intensive care admission decisions that reminds doctors to seek patient or family views and encourages explicit balancing of burdens and benefits could improve decision-making. However, a supportive, adequately resourced context is also needed.",2021,10.1111/anae.15272,76,4,489-499,eng,1365-2044 0003-2409,"Humans and United Kingdom and patient safety and patient-centred care and Anthropology, Cultural and Intensive Care Units and *COVID-19 and Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and medical decision-making and clinical ethics and intensive care and Critical Care/*methods/*statistics & numerical data and clinician relationships and Health Care Surveys/methods/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,Anaesthesia,NA,NA,NA,NA

The outcome in patients with DBI is often death or severe disability, and as a consequence rapid withdrawal of life sustaining therapies is commonly contemplated or undertaken. However, accurate prognostication in life-threatening brain injury is difficult, particularly at an early stage. Evidence from controlled studies to guide decision-making is limited, and there is a risk of a 'self-fulfilling prophecy', with early prognostication leading to early withdrawal of life sustaining therapies and death. The Joint Professional Standards committee of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and the Intensive Care Society convened a consensus group with representation from stakeholder professional organizations to develop clear professional guidance in this area. It recognized that the weak evidence base makes GRADE guidelines difficult to justify. We have made 12 practical, pragmatic recommendations to help clinicians deliver safe, effective, equitable, and justifiable care within resource constrained healthcare systems. In the situation where patient-centred outcomes are recognized to be unacceptable, regardless of the extent of neurological improvement, then early transition to palliative care is appropriate.

With little known about older anesthesiologists' work effort and retirement decision making, the American Society of Anesthesiologists participated in a 2006 national survey of physicians aged 50-79 yr. METHODS: Samples of anesthesiologists and other specialists completed a survey of work activities, professional satisfaction, self-defined health and financial status, retirement plans and perspectives, and demographics. A complex survey design enabled adjustments for sampling and response-rate biases so that respondents' characteristics resembled those in the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. Retirement decision making was modeled with multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Life-table analysis provided a forecast of likely clinical workforce trends over an ensuing 30 yr. RESULTS: Anesthesiologists (N = 3,222; response rate = 37%) reported a mean work week of 49.4 h and a mean retirement age of 62.7 yr, both values similar to those of other older physicians. Work week decreased with age, and part-time work increased. Women worked a shorter work week (mean, 47.9 vs. 49.7 h, P = 0.024), partly due to greater part-time work (20.2 vs. 13.1%, P value less than 0.001). Relative importance of factors reported among those leaving patient care differed by age cohort, subspecialty, and work status. Poor health was cited by 64% of anesthesiologists retiring in their 50s as compared with 43% of those retiring later (P = 0.039).

These may have a long-term impact on patient safety, and so there is a need to understand what makes anaesthetists decide to follow or deviate from guidelines. METHODS: A questionnaire on the use of guidelines was completed by 629 College Fellows. This presented three anaesthetic scenarios, each of which involved a deviation from a guideline, and asked respondents to rate their beliefs about the likely outcome of the violation, the level of social approval they would have for violating, the amount of control they would have over violating, and the practice of their peers with regard to violating. RESULTS: In all three scenarios, beliefs about the outcome of violating and the amount of control over violating predicted respondents' self-reported likelihood that they would commit the violation. In two scenarios, beliefs about the practice of peers predicted violating. Level of social approval predicted violating in one scenario only.

Across different hospitals, healthcare providers have been reported to differ considerably in the ways in which they recognise and manage pain, with some prescribing analgesics far less frequently than others. However, factors that could explain this variability remain poorly understood. Here, we used neuroscience approaches for neural signal modelling to investigate whether individual decisions in the ED could be explained in terms of brain patterns related to empathy, risk-taking, and error monitoring. METHODS: For 15 months, we monitored the pain management behaviour of 70 ED nurses at triage, and subsequently invited 33 to a neuroimaging study involving three well-established tasks probing relevant cognitive and affective dimensions. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to predict pain management decisions from neural activity during these tasks. RESULTS: We found that the brain signal recorded when empathising with others predicted the frequency with which nurses documented pain in their patients. In addition, neural activity sensitive to errors and negative outcomes predicted the frequency with which nurses denied analgesia by registering potential side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the multiple processes underlying pain management, and suggest that the neural representations of others' states and one's errors play a key role in individual treatment decisions. Neuroscience models of social cognition and decision-making are a powerful tool to explain clinical behaviour and might be used to guide future educational programs to improve pain management in ED.",2019,10.1016/j.bja.2019.01.039,123,2,e284-e292,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"decision-making and Hospitals and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and empathy and Pain and Analgesics and Triage and *Emergency Service, Hospital and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Brain/*physiopathology and Pain Management/*methods and neuroimaging and *Empathy and Diagnostic Errors/prevention & control and pain management and analgesia and Emergency Nursing/methods and Pain Measurement/*methods",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA

By describing and quantifying performance, positive behaviour can be encouraged and unsafe behaviour remedied. Anaesthesia Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) is a behavioural marker system that can be used to assess non-technical skills in the workplace. METHODS: We determined whether specialist anaesthetists could be reliably trained to use ANTS at an assessor level in an 8 h programme. Unscripted videos of routine anaesthesia were produced for training and assessment purposes. Twenty-six participants attended rater training. Exercises in behaviour observation, rater error, frame of reference and performance dimension, and the use of ANTS were conducted throughout the day. Five videos were selected for formal assessment and data collected. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) were calculated for each element. RESULTS: The accepted value of r>0.7 was not reached. ICC calculated for each element was 0.11-0.62. Comparison of participants scores with those of expert raters showed poor agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthetists could not be trained to reliably use ANTS as a summative assessment tool using our 1 day programme. There was an inadequate correlation of scores between participants and experts. Two major problems contributed to the lack of agreement.

METHODS: Two sets of interviews were conducted with 19 specialist anaesthetists in Sweden. The first set of interviews aimed at finding how the anaesthetists experienced difficulties at work. It consisted of in-depth interviews based on one open-ended question. We analysed the interviews with a phenomenological method, looking for themes in anaesthetists' descriptions of difficulties at work. In the second set, the interviews were semi-structured with open-ended questions, based on themes found in the first interview set. These interviews aimed at exploring how the interviewees described their ways of handling difficulties and how they coped with potentially stressful situations. RESULTS: Analysis of the first set of interviews resulted in five themes, describing how the anaesthetists experienced difficulties at work. All interviewees talked about difficulties related to more than one of the themes. The second set of interviews revealed two main categories of ways of handling difficulties. First, problem solving consisted of descriptions of methods for handling difficult situations which aimed at solving problems, and second, coping strategies described ways of appraising potentially stressful situations that minimized stress, despite the problem not being solved.

Schulz_2020_Brjoofan,JOUR,Case-mix adjusted postanaesthesia care unit length of stay and business intelligence dashboards for feedback to anaesthetists,"Schulz, Erich B. and Phillips, Frank and Waterbright, Siall",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in business intelligence software and evidence that feedback to doctors can improve outcomes, objective feedback regarding patient outcomes for individual anaesthetists is hampered by lack of useful benchmarks. We aimed to address this issue by producing case-mix and risk-adjusted postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay (LOS) benchmarks for integration into modern reporting tools. METHODS: We extended existing hospital information systems to calculate predicted PACU LOS using a neural network trained on patient age, surgery duration, sex, operating specialty, urgency, weekday, and insurance status (n=100 511). We then calculated the difference between observed mean and predicted PACU LOS for individual doctors, and compared the results with and without case-mix adjustment. We report practical implications of using visual analytics dashboards displaying the difference between observed and predicted PACU LOS to provide feedback to anaesthetic doctors. RESULTS: The neural network accounted for over half of observed variation in individual doctors' mean PACU LOS (mean predicted and mean actual LOS Spearman's r(2)=0.57). Account for case-mix reduced apparent spread, with 80% of individual doctors falling in a band of 4.3 min after case-mix adjusting, compared with a range of 24 min without adjustment. Case-mix adjusting also identified different individual doctors as outliers (Weighted Cohen's kappa [<ce><ba>]=0.27). Finally, we demonstrated that we were able to integrate the adjusted metrics into routine reporting tools. CONCLUSION: With caution, case-mix adjustment of anaesthetic outcome measures such as PACU LOS potentially provides a useful continuous quality improvement tool.

Canty_2009_Brjoofan,JOUR,Audit of anaesthetist-performed echocardiography on perioperative management decisions for non-cardiac surgery,"Canty, D. J. and Royse, C. F.",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography is increasingly used for guiding intraoperative management decisions during non-cardiac surgery. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) equipment and training is becoming more available to anaesthetists, and its point-of-care application may facilitate real-time haemodynamic management and preoperative screening. METHODS: We conducted an audit of transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiograms, performed by an anaesthetist at a tertiary referral centre over a 9-month period, to identify the effect of echocardiography on clinical decision-making in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The indications for echocardiography followed published guidelines. RESULTS: Echocardiographic examinations of 97 patients included 87 transthoracic, and 14 transoesophageal studies. Of 36 studies conducted in the preoperative clinic, eight revealed significant cardiac pathology, necessitating cardiology referral or admission before surgery. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiograms performed on the day of surgery (n=39) led to two cancellations of surgery owing to end-stage cardiac disease, the institution of two unplanned surgical procedures (drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions), and to significant changes in anaesthetic and haemodynamic management, or both in 18 patients. Greater influence on management occurred with emergency surgery (75%) than elective surgery (43%). Intraoperative transthoracic (n=10) and transoesophageal (n=14) echocardiography also altered management (altered surgery in two patients, cancellation in one, and altered haemodynamic management in 18 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthetist-performed point-of-care TTE and thoracic ultrasound may have a high clinical impact on the perioperative management of patients scheduled for non-cardiac surgery.",2009,10.1093/bja/aep165,103,3,352-358,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"Humans and Decision Making and Feasibility Studies and Hemodynamics and Medical Audit and Perioperative Care/*methods and Echocardiography/*methods and Preoperative Care/methods and Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnostic imaging and Echocardiography, Transesophageal and Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Manser, T. and Kolbe, M. and Grote, G. and Grande, B. and Spahn, D. R. and Wacker, J.",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies in anaesthesia and intensive care indicate that a team's ability to adapt its coordination activities to changing situational demands is crucial for effective teamwork and thus, safe patient care. This study addresses the relationship between adaptation of team coordination and markers of clinical performance in response to a critical event, particularly regarding which types of coordination activities are used and which team member engages in those coordination activities. METHODS: Video recordings of 15 two-person anaesthesia teams (anaesthesia trainee plus anaesthesia nurse) performing a simulated induction of general anaesthesia were coded, using a structured observation system for coordination activities. The simulation involved a critical event-asystole during laryngoscopy. Clinical performance was assessed using two separate reaction times related to the critical event. RESULTS: Analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of the critical event on team coordination: after the occurrence of the asystole, team members adapted their coordination activities by spending more time on information management-a specific type of coordination activity (F(1,28)=15.17, P=0.001). No significant effect was found for task management. The increase in information management was related to faster decisions regarding how to respond to the critical event, but only for trainees and not for nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the claim that adaptation of coordination activities is related to improved team performance in healthcare. Moreover, adaptation and its relationship to team performance were found to vary with regard to type of coordination activities and team member.",2011,10.1093/bja/aer039,106,6,801-806,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Switzerland and Video Recording and *Clinical Competence and *Adaptation, Psychological and Reaction Time and Patient Simulation and Education, Medical, Graduate/organization & administration and *Task Performance and Analysis and Health Services Research/methods and Anesthesia, General/standards and Anesthesiology/education/*organization & administration/standards and Heart Arrest/etiology/therapy and Information Management/standards and Laryngoscopy/adverse effects and Patient Care Team/*organization & administration/standards",NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective before-and-after mixed-method trial in a 35 bed medical and surgical ICU. Daily ICU ward rounds were observed during two periods of 8 weeks. We compared paper checklists (control) with a dynamic (digital) clinical checklist (DCC, intervention). The primary outcome was compliance with best clinical practice, measured as the percentages of checked items and unchecked critical items. Secondary outcomes included ICU stay and the usability of digital checklists. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and severity of critical illness were similar during both control and intervention periods of study. A total of 36 clinicians visited 197 patients during 352 ward rounds using the paper checklist, compared with 211 patients during 366 ward rounds using the DCC. Per ICU round, a median of 100% of items (94.4-100.0) were completed by DCC, compared with 75.1% (66.7-86.4) by paper checklist (P=0.03). No critical items remained unchecked by the DCC, compared with 15.4% (8.3-27.3) by the paper checklist (P=0.01). The DCC was associated with reduced ICU stay (1 day [1-3]), compared with the paper checklist (2 days [1-4]; P=0.05). Usability of the DCC was judged by clinicians to require further improvement.

W. and Nsoedo, C. and Parker, D.",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Despite a growing recognition of the role of human error in anaesthesia, it remains unclear what should be done to mitigate its effects. We addressed this issue by using task analysis to create a systematic description of the behaviours that are involved during anaesthesia, which can be used as a framework for promoting good practice and highlight areas of concern. METHODS: The task steps involved in preparing and delivering anaesthesia were identified using hierarchical task analysis (HTA). The systematic human error reduction and prediction approach (SHERPA) was then used to identify potential human errors at each task step and suggest ways of preventing these errors. RESULTS: The number and type of behaviours involved vary according to the 'phase' of anaesthesia, with tasks in the induction room, including induction of anaesthesia itself, being the most demanding. Errors during preoperative planning and perioperative maintenance could be avoided by measures to support information handling and decision-making. Errors during machine checking, induction, and emergence could be reduced by streamlining or automating task steps, or by making changes to the physical design of the work environment. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the value of task analysis in improving anaesthetic practice. Task analysis facilitates the identification of relevant human factors issues and suggests ways in which these issues can be addressed.

R.",British journal of anaesthesia,"Healthcare litigation in the UK continues to grow at an alarming rate, with claims against anaesthetists and critical care physicians increasing each year. This has led to a huge financial burden for the taxpayer and a sharp increase in professional indemnity fees for individual doctors. Although such litigation should provide valuable information to educate practitioners and reduce future similar claims, there appear to be significant barriers preventing important lessons from being learned. Detailed learning opportunities are available only to the healthcare providers being sued or the expert witnesses employed to analyse the claims. Most practitioners have to rely on indemnifiers' case reports, closed-claim analyses, and ad hoc publications for information. In this review, we suggest ways in which important lessons from litigation could be brought to the attention of all clinicians. Currently, most clinicians are unable to determine whether key components of their practice such as consent, clinical decision-making, and documentation are of an acceptable standard for legal scrutiny. By reporting outcomes of Coroners' inquests, clinical and criminal negligence cases, and referrals to the General Medical Council, it would be hoped that more explicit standards of performance could be derived. Ultimately, this may not only improve patient safety, but protect practitioners from unjustifiable claims. Finally, given the critical importance of experts in the above process, we believe that a system for professional registration and regulation should be explored to ensure that they offer accurate, representative, and unbiased opinions and have the appropriate expertise in the subject matter to be analysed.",2012,10.1093/bja/aes188,109,1,110-122,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"Humans and United Kingdom and *Outcome Assessment, Health Care and Jurisprudence and Anesthesia/*standards",NA,NA,2012/07//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA

We are acutely aware that association <e2><89><a0> causation, yet untangling the two remains one of our greatest challenges. This realization has stimulated a Causal Revolution in epidemiology, and the lessons learned are highly relevant to anesthesia research. This article introduces readers to directed acyclic graphs; a cornerstone of modern causal inference techniques. These diagrams provide a robust framework to address sources of bias and discover causal effects. We use the topical question of whether anesthetic technique (total intravenous anesthesia vs. volatile) affects outcome after cancer surgery as a basis for a series of example directed acyclic graphs, which demonstrate how variables can be chosen to statistically control confounding and other sources of bias. We also illustrate how controlling for the wrong variables can introduce, rather than eliminate, bias; and how directed acyclic graphs can help us diagnose this problem.This is a rapidly evolving field, and we cover only the most basic elements. The true promise of these techniques is that it may become possible to make robust statements about causation from observational studies-without the expense and artificiality of randomized controlled trials.",2020,10.1097/ALN.0000000000003193,132,5,951-967,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,Humans and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Biomedical Research/*methods and Anesthesiology/*methods and *Causality and *Medical Illustration,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hand-held electronic cognitive aids have rarely been investigated. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a smartphone application, named MAX (for Medical Assistance eXpert), on the technical and non-technical performance of anaesthesia residents dealing with simulated crises. METHODS: This single-centre randomized, controlled, unblinded trial was conducted in the simulation centre at Lyon, France. Participants were anaesthesia residents with >1 yr of clinical experience. Each participant had to deal with two different simulated crises with and without the help of a digital cognitive aid. The primary outcome was technical performance, evaluated as adherence to guidelines. Two independent observers remotely assessed performance on video recordings. RESULTS: Fifty-two residents were included between July 2015 and February 2016. Six participants were excluded for technical issues; 46 participants were confronted with a total of 92 high-fidelity simulation scenarios (46 with MAX and 46 without). Mean (sd) age was 27 (1.8) yr and clinical experience 3.2 (1.0) yr. Inter-rater agreement was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.92).

Algorithm 1 gives a framework on how to optimise a safe general anaesthetic technique in the obstetric patient, and emphasises: planning and multidisciplinary communication; how to prevent the rapid oxygen desaturation seen in pregnant women by advocating nasal oxygenation and mask ventilation immediately after induction; limiting intubation attempts to two; and consideration of early release of cricoid pressure if difficulties are encountered. Algorithm 2 summarises the management after declaring failed tracheal intubation with clear decision points, and encourages early insertion of a (preferably second-generation) supraglottic airway device if appropriate. Algorithm 3 covers the management of the 'can't intubate, can't oxygenate' situation and emergency front-of-neck airway access, including the necessity for timely perimortem caesarean section if maternal oxygenation cannot be achieved. Table 1 gives a structure for assessing the individual factors relevant in the decision to awaken or proceed should intubation fail, which include: urgency related to maternal or fetal factors; seniority of the anaesthetist; obesity of the patient; surgical complexity; aspiration risk; potential difficulty with provision of alternative anaesthesia; and post-induction airway device and airway patency. This decision should be considered by the team in advance of performing a general anaesthetic to make a provisional plan should failed intubation occur. The table is also intended to be used as a teaching tool to facilitate discussion and learning regarding the complex nature of decision-making when faced with a failed intubation.

The incidence of infection was significantly higher in patients treated for chronic pain (7 of 216 = 3.2%) compared with postoperative pain (6 of 10,437 = 0.06%; P < 0.0001). Surgical drainage of subcutaneous pus was performed in three patients, and medical therapy was administered in the remainder of patients; all patients recovered without sequelae. Although rare, epidural catheter-associated infections remain a serious concern in high-risk children who may benefit the most from epidural analgesia. The findings of the authors support the low rate of epidural infection previously reported despite growing concerns of serious infections in children. These findings highlight the importance of vigilance to early diagnostic indicators of infection and provide practitioners and families with incidence data to guide informed medical decision-making.",2010,10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181de6cc5,113,1,224-232,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Incidence and Infant, Newborn and Boston/epidemiology and Analgesia, Epidural/*adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data and Catheter-Related Infections/*epidemiology/etiology and Cross Infection/*epidemiology/etiology",NA,NA,2010/07//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA
Waisel_2009_Anes,JOUR,"Anesthesiology trainees face ethical, practical, and relational challenges in obtaining informed consent","Waisel, David B. and Lamiani, Giulia and Sandrock, Norma J. and Pascucci, Robert and Truog, Robert D. and Meyer, Elaine C.",Anesthesiology,"BACKGROUND: Categorizing difficulties anesthesiologists have in obtaining informed consent may influence education, performance, and research. This study investigated the trainees' perspectives and educational needs through a qualitative analysis of narratives. METHODS: The Program to Enhance Relational and Communication Skills-Anesthesia used professional actors to teach communication skills and relational abilities associated with informed consent. Before attending the program, participants wrote about a challenging informed consent experience. Narratives were analyzed by two researchers following the principles of grounded theory. The researchers independently read the narratives and marked key words and phrases to identify reoccurring challenges described by anesthesiologists. Through rereading of the narratives and discussion, the two researchers reached consensus on the challenges that arose and calculated their frequency. RESULTS: Analysis of the 39 narratives led to the identification of three types of challenges facing anesthesiologists in obtaining informed consent. Ethical challenges included patient wishes not honored, conflict between patient and family wishes and medical judgment, patient decision-making capacity, and upholding professional standards. Practical challenges included the amount of information to provide, communication barriers, and time limitations. Relational challenges included questions about trainee competence, mistrust associated with previous negative experiences, and misunderstandings between physician and patient or family. CONCLUSIONS: The ethical, practical, and relational challenges in obtaining informed consent colored trainees' views of patient care and affected their interactions with patients. Using participant narratives personalizes education and motivates participants. The richness of narratives may help anesthesiologists to appreciate the qualitative aspects of informed consent.",2009,10.1097/ALN.0b013e318197ff46,110,3,480-486,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology and Judgment/ethics and Anesthesiology/*education/*ethics/methods and Internship and Residency/*ethics/methods,NA,NA,2009/03//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA
Walsh_2011_Brjoofan,JOUR,Responsiveness of the frontal EMG for monitoring the sedation state of critically ill patients,"Walsh, T. S. and Lapinlampi, T. P. and Ramsay, P. and Sarkela, M. O. K. and Uutela, K. and Viertio-Oja, H. E.",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Excessive sedation is associated with adverse patient outcomes during critical illness, and a validated monitoring technology could improve care. We developed a novel method, the responsiveness index (RI) of the frontal EMG. We compared RI data with Ramsay clinical sedation assessments in general and cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We developed the algorithm by iterative analysis of detailed observational data in 30 medical-surgical ICU patients and described its performance in this cohort and 15 patients recovering from scheduled cardiac surgery. Continuous EMG data were collected via frontal electrodes and RI data compared with modified Ramsay sedation state assessments recorded regularly by a blinded trained observer. RI performance was compared with Entropyâ„¢ across Ramsay categories to assess validity. RESULTS: RI correlated well with the Ramsay category, especially for the cardiac surgery cohort (general ICU patients Ï=0.55; cardiac surgery patients Ï=0.85, both P<0.0001). Discrimination across all Ramsay categories was reasonable in the general ICU patient cohort [P(K)=0.74 (sem 0.02)] and excellent in the cardiac surgery cohort [P(K)=0.92 (0.02)]. Discrimination between 'lighter' vs 'deeper' (Ramsay 1-3 vs 4-6) was good for general ICU patients [P(K)=0.80 (0.02)] and excellent for cardiac surgery patients [P(K)=0.96 (0.02)]. Performance was significantly better than Entropyâ„¢. Examination of individual cases suggested good face validity. CONCLUSIONS: RI of the frontal EMG has promise as a continuous sedation state monitor in critically ill patients. Further investigation to determine its utility in ICU decision-making is warranted.",2011,10.1093/bja/aer228,107,5,710-718,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Algorithms and Cohort Studies and Reproducibility of Results and Aged, 80 and over and Critical Illness and Respiration, Artificial and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods and Critical Care/methods and *Anesthesia and Cardiac Surgical Procedures and Anesthesia Recovery Period and Electromyography/methods and Frontal Lobe/*drug effects",NA,NA,2011/11//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a retrospective records review and SOFA scoring of critically ill patients with influenza A H1N1 in a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in an urban hospital. Eight critically ill patients with influenza A H1N1 were admitted to the intensive care unit. Their mean (range) age was 39 (26-52) years with a length of stay of 11 (3-17) days. All patients met SOFA score based triage admission criteria with a modal SOFA score of five. Five patients required invasive ventilation for a mean (range) of 5 (4-11) days. Five patients would have been considered for withdrawal of treatment using SOFA scoring guidelines at 48 h. All patients survived. We conclude that SOFA score based triage could lead to withdrawal of life support in critically ill patients who could survive with an acceptably low length of stay in the intensive care unit.,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06135.x,64,12,1283-1288,eng,1365-2044 0003-2409,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Prognosis and Disease Outbreaks and Triage/*methods and *Severity of Illness Index and Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data and *Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype and England/epidemiology and Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data and Critical Illness/therapy and Influenza, Human/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and Multiple Organ Failure/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy/virology",NA,NA,2009/12//undefined,Anaesthesia,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Landais, Paul",Anesthesiology,"BACKGROUND: An accurate risk score able to predict in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing surgery may improve both risk communication and clinical decision making. The aim of the study was to develop and validate a surgical risk score based solely on preoperative information, for predicting in-hospital mortality. METHODS: From January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010, data related to all surgeries requiring anesthesia were collected from all centers (single hospital or hospitals group) in France performing more than 500 operations in the year on patients aged 18 yr or older (n = 5,507,834). International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes were used to summarize the medical history of patients. From these data, the authors developed a risk score by examining 29 preoperative factors (age, comorbidities, and surgery type) in 2,717,902 patients, and then validated the risk score in a separate cohort of 2,789,932 patients. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, there were 12,786 in-hospital deaths (0.47%; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.48%), whereas in the validation cohort there were 14,933 in-hospital deaths (0.54%; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.55%). Seventeen predictors were identified and included in the PreOperative Score to predict PostOperative Mortality (POSPOM). POSPOM showed good calibration and excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with a c-statistic of 0.944 (95% CI, 0.943 to 0.945) in the development cohort and 0.929 (95% CI, 0.928 to 0.931) in the validation cohort.

Glance_2018_Anes,JOUR,Impact of the Choice of Risk Model for Identifying Low-risk Patients Using the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Perioperative Guidelines,"Glance, Laurent G. and Faden, Eric and Dutton, Richard P. and Lustik, Stewart J. and Li, Yue and Eaton, Michael P. and Dick, Andrew W.",Anesthesiology,"WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: The 2014 American College of Cardiology Perioperative Guideline recommends risk stratifying patients scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery using either: (1) the Revised Cardiac Index; (2) the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator; or (3) the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest calculator. The aim of this study is to determine how often these three risk-prediction tools agree on the classification of patients as low risk (less than 1%) of major adverse cardiac event. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using a sample of 10,000 patient records. The risk of cardiac complications was calculated for the Revised Cardiac Index and the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest models using published coefficients, and for the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator using the publicly available website. The authors used the intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa analysis to quantify the degree of agreement between these three risk-prediction tools. RESULTS: There is good agreement between the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest estimates of major adverse cardiac events (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.70), while only poor agreement between (1) American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and the Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.40), and (2) Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest and Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.30). The three prediction models disagreed 29% of the time on which patients were low risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variability in the predicted risk of cardiac complications using different risk-prediction tools. Including more than one prediction tool in clinical guidelines could lead to differences in decision-making for some patients depending on which risk calculator is used.",2018,10.1097/ALN.0000000000002341,129,5,889-900,eng,1528-1175 0003-3022,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and American Heart Association and Societies, Medical and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Risk Assessment/*methods and Perioperative Care/*methods",NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Counsell, D. and Wildsmith, J. A. W.",British journal of anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Serious complications of central neuraxial block (CNB) are rare. Limited information on their incidence and impact impedes clinical decision-making and patient consent. The Royal College of Anaesthetists Third National Audit Project was designed to inform this situation. METHODS: A 2 week national census estimated the number of CNB procedures performed annually in the UK National Health Service. All major complications of CNBs performed over 1 yr (vertebral canal abscess or haematoma, meningitis, nerve injury, spinal cord ischaemia, fatal cardiovascular collapse, and wrong route errors) were reported. Each case was reviewed by an expert panel to assess causation, severity, and outcome. 'Permanent' injury was defined as symptoms persisting for more than 6 months. Efforts were made to validate denominator (procedures performed) and numerator (complications) data through national databases. RESULTS: The census phase produced a denominator of 707,455 CNB. Eighty-four major complications were reported, of which 52 met the inclusion criteria at the time they were reported. Data were interpreted 'pessimistically' and 'optimistically'. 'Pessimistically' there were 30 permanent injuries and 'optimistically' 14. The incidence of permanent injury due to CNB (expressed per 100,000 cases) was 'pessimistically' 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.9-6.1) and 'optimistically' 2.0 (1.1-3.3). 'Pessimistically' there were 13 deaths or paraplegias, 'optimistically' five. The incidence of paraplegia or death was 'pessimistically' 1.8 per 100,000 (1.0-3.1) and 'optimistically' 0.7 (0-1.6). Two-thirds of initially disabling injuries resolved fully. CONCLUSIONS: The data are reassuring and suggest that CNB has a low incidence of major complications, many of which resolve within 6 months.",2009,10.1093/bja/aen360,102,2,179-190,eng,1471-6771 0007-0912,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Medical Audit and United Kingdom/epidemiology and Analgesia, Epidural/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data and Anesthesia, Epidural/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data and Anesthesia, Spinal/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data and Epidural Abscess/epidemiology/etiology and Hematoma, Epidural, Spinal/epidemiology/etiology and Paraplegia/epidemiology/etiology and Spinal Cord Injuries/epidemiology/etiology and State Medicine/standards/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2009/02//undefined,Br J Anaesth,NA,NA,NA,NA
