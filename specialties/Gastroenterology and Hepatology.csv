We investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) system can increase the accuracy of characterizations of polyps by endoscopists of different skill levels. METHODS: We developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for evaluation of diminutive colorectal polyps, based on efficient neural architecture searches via parameter sharing with augmentation using NBIs of diminutive (<e2><89><a4>5 mm) polyps, collected from October 2015 through October 2017 at the Seoul National University Hospital, Healthcare System Gangnam Center (training set). We trained the CNN using images from 1100 adenomatous polyps and 1050 hyperplastic polyps from 1379 patients. We then tested the system using 300 images of 180 adenomatous polyps and 120 hyperplastic polyps, obtained from January 2018 to May 2019. We compared the accuracy of 22 endoscopists of different skill levels (7 novices, 4 experts, and 11 NBI-trained experts) vs the CNN in evaluation of images (adenomatous vs hyperplastic) from 180 adenomatous and 120 hyperplastic polyps. The endoscopists then evaluated the polyp images with knowledge of the CNN-processed results. We conducted mixed-effect logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the effects of AI assistance on the accuracy of analysis of diminutive colorectal polyps by endoscopists (primary outcome). RESULTS: The CNN distinguished adenomatous vs hyperplastic diminutive polyps with 86.7% accuracy, based on histologic analysis as the reference standard. Endoscopists distinguished adenomatous vs hyperplastic diminutive polyps with 82.5% overall accuracy (novices, 73.8% accuracy; experts, 83.8% accuracy; and NBI-trained experts, 87.6% accuracy). With knowledge of the CNN-processed results, the overall accuracy of the endoscopists increased to 88.5% (P < .05). With knowledge of the CNN-processed results, the accuracy of novice endoscopists increased to 85.6% (P < .05). The CNN-processed results significantly reduced endoscopist time of diagnosis (from 3.92 to 3.37 seconds per polyp, P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a CNN that significantly increases the accuracy of evaluation of diminutive colorectal polyps (as adenomatous vs hyperplastic) and reduces the time of diagnosis by endoscopists. This AI assistance system significantly increased the accuracy of analysis by novice endoscopists, who achieved near-expert levels of accuracy without extra training.

Gastroenterology & hepatology,"The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has substantially changed in the past few decades. Improvements in patient stratification (for example, using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system) and the introduction of novel therapies (such as sorafenib) have improved patient survival. Nevertheless, HCC remains the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Decision-making largely relies on evidence-based criteria, as depicted in the US and European clinical practice guidelines, which endorse five therapeutic recommendations: resection; transplantation; radiofrequency ablation; chemoembolization; and sorafenib. However, areas still exist in which uncertainty precludes a strong recommendation, such as the role of adjuvant therapies after resection, radioembolization with yttrium-90 or second-line therapies for advanced HCC. Many clinical trials that are currently ongoing aim to answer these questions. The first reported studies, however, failed to identify novel therapeutic alternatives (that is, sunitinib, erlotinib or brivanib). Moreover, genomic profiling has enabled patient classification on the basis of molecular parameters, and has facilitated the development of new effective drugs. However, no oncogene addiction loops have been identified so far, as has been the case with other cancers such as melanoma, lung or breast cancer.

Siegel_2012_Gut,JOUR,Shared decision making in inflammatory bowel disease: helping patients understand the tradeoffs between treatment options,"Siegel, Corey A.",Gut,"The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is becoming more complicated with new medications and new treatment paradigms. Although data are accumulating that the earlier use of immunomodulators and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are more effective than the standard ""step-up"" pyramidal treatment algorithm, patients may not be comfortable with this more intensive therapeutic approach. The process of shared decision making engages patients in treatment decisions to optimize the chance that a chosen therapy matches their personal preferences for care. Decision aids are standard shared decision making tools, which are used to present evidence-based data in a patient-friendly manner to help patients with preference-sensitive decisions. Not all care decisions are preference-sensitive, and not all patients are interested in being part of a shared medical decision. The responsibility of the provider is to identify how much of a role patients want, and then determine which decisions need their input to provide the best patient-centered care. The overall goal is to involve patients in decisions so that they are educated about their options, confident in the plan, adherent to chosen therapy and ultimately have a better quality of life.",2012,10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300988,61,3,459-465,eng,1468-3288 0017-5749,Humans and Physician-Patient Relations and Decision Support Techniques and Patient Preference and *Decision Making and *Patient Participation and Patient Education as Topic/methods and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors and Biological Products/therapeutic use and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy,NA,NA,2012/03//undefined,Gut,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ensuring live donors' autonomy through informed consent is critical. We assessed live liver donors' (LD) comprehension, information needs, risk perceptions, and demographics. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were prospectively conducted with LDs after completing donor evaluation and informed consent at our transplant center. Likert scales measured informed consent domains. Open-ended responses underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty LDs participated (100% participation rate). Although 90% of LDs reported being informed about donation 'a great deal', only 66% reported understanding information about donation 'a great deal.' Many (40%) reported difficulty understanding medical terminology. Information LDs most desired to feel comfortable with their decision included: incidence and type of donor complications (67%), description of donation procedure (57%), and the process of donor preparation (43%). Most (83%) LDs rated risks to themselves as 'not at all' to 'somewhat' risky, and minimized these risks.

While altered signals from the viscera contribute to clinical symptoms, the brain integrates these interoceptive signals with emotional, cognitive and memory related inputs in a non-linear fashion to produce symptoms. Tremendous progress has occurred in the development of new imaging techniques that look at structural, functional and metabolic properties of brain regions and networks. Standardisation in image acquisition and advances in computational approaches has made it possible to study large data sets of imaging studies, identify network properties and integrate them with non-imaging data. These approaches are beginning to generate brain signatures in IBS that share some features with those obtained in other often overlapping chronic pain disorders such as urological pelvic pain syndromes and vulvodynia, suggesting shared mechanisms. Despite this progress, the identification of preclinical vulnerability factors and outcome predictors has been slow.

High postoperative portal vein pressure (P(PV)) and portocaval gradient (PCG), which cannot be predicted by current tools, are the most important determinants of PHLF. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate a digital twin to predict the risk of postoperative portal hypertension (PHT). METHODS: We prospectively included 47 patients undergoing major hepatectomy. A mathematical (0D) model of the entire blood circulation was assessed and automatically calibrated from patient characteristics. Hepatic flows were obtained from preoperative flow MRI (n = 9), intraoperative flowmetry (n = 16), or estimated from cardiac output (n = 47). Resection was then simulated in these 3 groups and the computed P(PV) and PCG were compared to intraoperative data. RESULTS: Simulated post-hepatectomy pressures did not differ between the 3 groups, comparing well with collected data (no significant differences). In the entire cohort, the correlation between measured and simulated P(PV) values was good (r = 0.66, no adjustment to intraoperative events) or excellent (r = 0.75) after adjustment, as well as for PCG (respectively r = 0.59 and r = 0.80). The difference between simulated and measured post-hepatectomy PCG was <e2><89><a4>3 mmHg in 96% of cases. Four patients suffered from lethal PHLF for whom the model satisfactorily predicted their postoperative pressures. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a 0D model could correctly anticipate postoperative PHT, even using estimated hepatic flow rates as input data. If this major conceptual step is confirmed, this algorithm could change our practice toward more tailor-made procedures, while ensuring satisfactory outcomes. LAY SUMMARY: Post-hepatectomy portal hypertension is a major cause of liver failure and death, but no tool is available to accurately anticipate this potentially lethal complication for a given patient. Herein, we propose using a mathematical model to predict the portocaval gradient at the end of liver resection. We tested this model on a cohort of 47 patients undergoing major hepatectomy and demonstrated that it could modify current surgical decision-making algorithms.",2021,10.1016/j.jhep.2020.10.036,74,3,661-669,eng,1600-0641 0168-8278,"Risk factors and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Mathematical model and Feasibility Studies and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Prognosis and Follow-Up Studies and *Models, Theoretical and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Liver Function Tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods and Hepatectomy/*adverse effects and Hypertension, Portal/diagnostic imaging/*etiology and Liver failure and Liver Failure/diagnostic imaging/*etiology and Liver resection and Portal pressure and Portal Pressure and Portal Vein/physiopathology and Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/*etiology",NA,NA,2021/03//undefined,J Hepatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sarcopenia is a main indicator of adverse outcomes in this population, including poor quality of life, hepatic decompensation, mortality in patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation (LT), longer hospital and intensive care unit stay, higher incidence of infection following LT, and higher overall health care cost. Although it is clear that muscle mass is an important predictor of LT outcomes, many questions remain, including the best modality for assessing muscle mass, the optimal cut-off values for sarcopenia, the ideal timing and frequency of muscle mass assessment, and how to best incorporate the concept of sarcopenia into clinical decision making. For these reasons, we assembled a group of experts to form the North American Working Group on Sarcopenia in Liver Transplantation to use evidence from the medical literature to address these outstanding questions regarding sarcopenia in LT. We believe sarcopenia assessment should be considered in all patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) assessed by computed tomography constitutes the best-studied technique for assessing sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Cut-off values for sarcopenia, defined as SMI < 50 cm(2) /m(2) in male and < 39 cm(2) /m(2) in female patients, constitute the validated definition for sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Conclusion: The management of sarcopenia requires a multipronged approach including nutrition, exercise, and additional pharmacological therapy as deemed necessary.

Although largely used in medical literature, there are no studies measuring the benefit of liver transplantation (LT) over hepatic resection (HR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of ""Number of patients needed to transplant (NTT)."" EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Classes B-C, very large (>10 cm) and multi-nodular (>2 nodules) tumours, macroscopic vascular invasion and extra-hepatic metastases. STUDY POPULATION: 1028 HCC cirrhotic patients from one Eastern (n=441) and two Western (n=587) surgical units. Patient survival observed after HR by proportional hazard regression model was compared to that predicted after LT by the Metroticket calculator. The benefit obtainable from LT compared to resection was analysed in relationship with number of nodules (modelled as ordinal variable: single vs. oligonodular), size of largest nodule (modelled as a continuous variable), presence of microscopic vascular invasion (MVI), and time horizon from surgery (5-year vs. 10-year). RESULTS: 330 patients were beyond the Milan criteria (32%) and 597 (58%) had MVI. The prevalence of MVI was 52% in patients within Milan criteria and 71% in those beyond (p<0.0001). In the 5-year transplant benefit analysis, nodule size and HCC number were positive predictors of transplant benefit, while MVI had a strong negative impact on NTT. Transplantation performed as an effective therapy (NTT <5) only in oligonodular HCC with largest diameter >3cm (beyond conventional LT criteria) when MVI was absent. The 10-year scenario increased drastically the transplant benefit in all subgroups of resectable patients, and LT became an effective therapy (NTT <5) for all patients without MVI whenever tumor extension and for oligonodular HCC with MVI within conventional LT criteria.

Anderson_2020_Gast,JOUR,Causes of Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers Based on World Endoscopy Organization System of Analysis,"Anderson, Rebecca and Burr, Nicholas E. and Valori, Roland",Gastroenterology,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC) is CRC diagnosed after a colonoscopy in which no cancer was found. A consensus article from the World Endoscopy Organization (WEO) proposed an approach for investigating and categorizing PCCRCs detected within 4 years of a colonoscopy. We aimed to identify cases of PCCRC and the factors that cause them, test the WEO system of categorization, quantify the proportion of avoidable PCCRCs, and propose a target rate for PCCRCs detected within 3 years of a colonoscopy that did not detect CRC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 107 PCCRCs identified at a single medical center in England from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2017 using coding and endoscopy data. For each case, we reviewed clinical, pathology, radiology, and endoscopy findings. Using the WEO recommendations, we performed a root-cause analysis of each case, categorizing lesions as follows: possible missed lesion, prior examination adequate; possible missed lesion, prior examination inadequate; detected lesion, not resected; or likely incomplete resection of previously identified lesion. We determined whether PCCRCs could be attributed to the colonoscopist for technical or decision-making reasons, and whether the PCCRC was avoidable or unavoidable, based on the WEO categorization and size of tumor. The endoscopy reporting system provided performance data for individual endoscopists. RESULTS: Of the PCCRCs identified, 43% were in high-risk patients (those with inflammatory bowel disease, previous CRC, previous multiple large polyps, or hereditary cancer syndromes) and 66% were located distal to the hepatic flexure. There was no correlation between postcolonoscopy colorectal tumor size and time to diagnosis after index colonoscopy. Bowel preparation was poor in 19% of index colonoscopies, and only 36% of complete colonoscopies had adequate photodocumentation of completion. Development of 73% of PCCRCs was determined to be affected by technical endoscopic factors, 17% of PCCRCs by administrative factors (follow-up procedures delayed/not booked by administrative staff), and 27% of PCCRCs by decision-making factors. Twenty-seven percent of PCCRCs were categorized as possible missed lesion, prior examination adequate; 58% as possible missed lesion, prior examination inadequate; 8% as detected lesion, not resected; and 7% as incomplete resection of previously observed lesion; 89% were deemed to be avoidable. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of PCCRCs, using the WEO system of categorization, we found 43% to occur in high-risk patients; this might be reduced with more vigilant surveillance. Measures are needed to reduce technical, decision-making, and administrative factors. We found that 89% of PCCRCs may be avoidable. If half of avoidable PCCRCs could be prevented, the target rate of 2% for the PCCRC-3y (cancer diagnosed between 6 and 36 months after index colonoscopy) benchmark would be achievable.",2020,10.1053/j.gastro.2019.12.031,158,5,1287-1299.e2,eng,1528-0012 0016-5085,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Incidence and Recurrence and Clinical Decision-Making and England/epidemiology and Tumor Burden and False Negative Reactions and Cohort and Aftercare/organization & administration/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Benchmarking/statistics & numerical data and Colon Cancer and Colon/diagnostic imaging/pathology and Colonoscopy/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology and Delayed Diagnosis/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data and Early Detection of Cancer/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Etiology and Mass Screening/organization & administration/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Rectum/diagnostic imaging/pathology",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Gastroenterology,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific guidance using current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines as a reference point. DESIGN: We convened a RAND appropriateness panel comprising 14 gastroenterologists and an IBD nurse consultant supplemented by surgical and COVID-19 experts. Panellists rated the appropriateness of interventions for ASUC in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Median scores and disagreement index (DI) were calculated. Results were discussed at a moderated meeting prior to a second survey. RESULTS: Panellists recommended that patients with ASUC should be isolated throughout their hospital stay and should have a SARS-CoV-2 swab performed on admission. Patients with a positive swab should be discussed with COVID-19 specialists. As per BSG guidance, intravenous hydrocortisone was considered appropriate as initial management; only in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was its use deemed uncertain. In patients requiring rescue therapy, infliximab with continuing steroids was recommended. Delaying colectomy because of COVID-19 was deemed inappropriate. Steroid tapering as per BSG guidance was deemed appropriate for all patients apart from those with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom a 4-6 week taper was preferred. Post-ASUC maintenance therapy was dependent on SARS-CoV-2 status but, in general, biologics were more likely to be deemed appropriate than azathioprine or tofacitinib. Panellists deemed prophylactic anticoagulation postdischarge to be appropriate in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab.

Strazzabosco_2017_Hepa.BalMd..,JOUR,Value-based care in hepatology,"Strazzabosco, Mario and Allen, John I. and Teisberg, Elizabeth O.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","The migration from legacy fee-for-service reimbursement to payments linked to high-value health care is accelerating in the United States because of new legislation and redesign of payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Because patients with chronic diseases account for substantial use of health care resources, payers and health systems are focusing on maximizing the value of care for these patients. Because chronic liver diseases impose a major health burden worldwide affecting the health and lives of many individuals and families as well as substantial costs for individuals and payers, hepatologists must understand how they can improve their practices. Hepatologists practice a high-intensity cognitive subspecialty, using complex and costly procedures and medications. High-value patient care requires multidisciplinary coordination, labor-intensive support for critically ill patients, and effective chronic disease management. Under current fee-for-service reimbursement, patient values, medical success, and financial success can all be misaligned. Many current attempts to link health outcomes to reimbursement are based on compliance with process measures, with less emphasis on outcomes that matter most to patients, thus slowing transformation to higher-value team-based care. Outcome measures that reflect the entire cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and administrators in improving the quality and value of care. A comprehensive set of outcome measures for liver diseases is not currently available. Numerous researchers now are attempting to fill this gap by devising and testing outcome indicators and patient-reported outcomes for the major liver conditions. These indicators will provide tools to implement a value-based approach for patients with chronic liver diseases to compare results and value of care between referral centers, to perform health technology assessment, and to guide decision-making processes for health authorities. This review sets the groundwork for implementing a value-based, patient-centered approach to chronic liver diseases within a health system.

Rich_2010_Gut,JOUR,Distinguishing Menetrier's disease from its mimics,"Rich, Amy and Toro, Tania Zuluaga and Tanksley, Jarred and Fiske, William H. and Lind, Christopher D. and Ayers, Gregory D. and Piessevaux, Hubert and Washington, Mary K. and Coffey, Robert J.",Gut,"OBJECTIVE: Menetrier's disease (MD) is a rare hypertrophic gastropathy characterised by giant rugal folds, hypochlorhydria, protein loss and a classic constellation of symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and peripheral oedema). It is considered a clinical diagnosis that may at times be difficult to establish. Firm diagnostic criteria for MD are proposed by delineating the clinicopathological features that best differentiate MD from its mimics. METHOD: 48 patients referred to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for consideration of enrolment in a clinical trial of treatment of patients with MD with cetuximab were evaluated for a definitive diagnosis by assessing the clinical presentation, pertinent laboratory values and histopathological features. RESULTS: MD was confirmed in 25 of the 48 patients (52%). The remaining 23 patients were considered to be mimics of MD, the most common diagnoses being gastric polyps or polyposis syndromes (13/23, 57%). Gastric slides were available from 40 of the 48 patients for detailed histological analysis (22/25 MD and 18/23 non-MD). Foveolar hyperplasia, glandular tortuosity and dilation, and a marked reduction in parietal cell number were present in all 22 cases of MD. Lamina propria smooth muscle hyperplasia and oedema characterised most cases (18/22 and 19/22, respectively). More than half had prominent eosinophils (11/22) and/or plasma cells (12/22) in the lamina propria. The clinical presentation of patients with MD was characterised by significantly younger age of onset, male predominance and increased vomiting compared with non-MD patients, and a lower prevalence of anaemia compared with MD patients with polyps. There was a trend towards increased frequency of peripheral oedema in patients with MD compared with non-MD patients. CONCLUSIONS: MD is most accurately diagnosed by clinicohistopathological analysis including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric pH, appropriate laboratory tests (complete blood count, serum albumin, serum gastrin, Helicobacter pylori and cytomegalovirus serology) and full-thickness mucosal biopsy of the involved gastric mucosa.",2010,10.1136/gut.2010.220061,59,12,1617-1624,eng,1468-3288 0017-5749,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Algorithms and Diagnosis, Differential and Biopsy and Gastric Mucosa/pathology and Gastritis, Hypertrophic/complications/*diagnosis/pathology and Gastroscopy and Polyps/diagnosis and Stomach Diseases/diagnosis",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,Gut,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of this cohort study is to compare outcomes following TAVR and SAVR in patients with cirrhosis to inform the preferred intervention. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Prospectively collected data on 105 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR (n = 55) or SAVR (n = 50) between 2008 and 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Two control groups were included: 2,680 patients without cirrhosis undergoing TAVR and SAVR and 17 patients with cirrhosis who received medical therapy alone. Among the 105 patients with cirrhosis, the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 3.8% (1.5, 6.9), and the median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 11.6 (9.4, 14.0). The TAVR group had similar in-hospital (1.8% vs. 2.0%) and 30-day mortality (3.6% vs. 4.2%) as the SAVR group. During the median follow-up of 3.8 years (95% confidence interval, 3.0-6.9), there were 63 (60%) deaths. MELD score (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.21; P = 0.002) was an independent predictor of long-term survival. In the subgroup of patients with MELD score <12, the TAVR group had reduced survival compared with the SAVR group (median survival of 2.8 vs. 4.4 years; P = 0.047). However, in those with MELD score <e2><89><a5>12, survival after TAVR, SAVR, and medical therapy was similar (1.3 vs. 2.1 vs. 1.6 years, respectively; P = 0.53). CONCLUSION: In select patients with cirrhosis, both TAVR and SAVR have acceptable and comparable short-term outcomes. MELD score, but not Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, independently predicts long-term survival after TAVR and SAVR.

In all, 222 patients diagnosed with HCC and treated with multiple TACE cycles between January 1999 and December 2009 at the Departments of Gastroenterology/Hepatology of the Medical Universities of Vienna (training cohort) and Innsbruck (validation cohort) were included. We investigated the effect of the first TACE on parameters of liver function and tumor response and their impact on overall survival (OS, log rank test) and developed a point score (ART score: Assessment for Retreatment with TACE) in the training cohort (n = 107, Vienna) by using a stepwise Cox regression model. The ART score was externally validated in an independent validation cohort (n = 115, Innsbruck). The increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by >25% (hazard ratio [HR] 8.4; P < 0.001), an increase of Child-Pugh score of 1 (HR 2.0) or <e2><89><a5>2 points (HR 4.4) (P < 0.001) from baseline, and the absence of radiologic tumor response (HR 1.7; P = 0.026) remained independent negative prognostic factors for OS and were used to create the ART score. The ART score differentiated two groups (0-1.5 points; <e2><89><a5>2.5 points) with distinct prognosis (median OS: 23.7 versus 6.6 months; P < 0.001) and a higher ART score was associated with major adverse events after the second TACE (P = 0.011). These results were confirmed in the external validation cohort and remained significant irrespective of Child-Pugh stage and the presence of ascites prior the second TACE. CONCLUSION: An ART score of <e2><89><a5>2.5 prior the second TACE identifies patients with a dismal prognosis who may not profit from further TACE sessions.

Aslanian_2020_Gast,JOUR,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Pancreas Cancer Screening in High-Risk Individuals: Expert Review,"Aslanian, Harry R. and Lee, Jeffrey H. and Canto, Marcia Irene",Gastroenterology,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association Institute Clinical Practice Update is to describe the indications for screening for pancreas cancer in high-risk individuals. METHODS: The evidence reviewed in this work is based on reports of pancreas cancer screening studies in high-risk individuals and expert opinion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Pancreas cancer screening should be considered in patients determined to be at high risk, including first-degree relatives of patients with pancreas cancer with at least 2 affected genetically related relatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Pancreas cancer screening should be considered in patients with genetic syndromes associated with an increased risk of pancreas cancer, including all patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, patients with CDKN2A gene mutation, and patients with 1 or more first-degree relatives with pancreas cancer with Lynch syndrome, and mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and ATM genes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Genetic testing and counseling should be considered for familial pancreas cancer relatives who are eligible for surveillance. A positive germline mutation is associated with an increased risk of neoplastic progression and may also lead to screening for other relevant associated cancers. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Participation in a registry or referral to a pancreas Center of Excellence should be pursued when possible for high-risk patients undergoing pancreas cancer screening. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Clinicians should not screen average-risk individuals for pancreas cancer. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals should begin at age 50 years, or 10 years younger than the initial age of familial onset. Screening should be initiated at age 40 years in CKDN2A and PRSS1 mutation carriers with hereditary pancreatitis and at age 35 years in the setting of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) should be used in combination as the preferred screening modalities in individuals undergoing pancreas cancer screening. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The target detectable pancreatic neoplasms are resectable stage I pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and high-risk precursor neoplasms, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia and some enlarged pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Screening intervals of 12 months should be considered when there are no concerning pancreas lesions, with shortened intervals and/or the performance of EUS in 6-12 months directed towards lesions determined to be low risk (by a multidisciplinary team). EUS evaluation should be performed within 3-6 months for indeterminate lesions and within 3 months for high-risk lesions, if surgical resection is not planned. New-onset diabetes in a high-risk individual should lead to additional diagnostic studies or change in surveillance interval. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Decisions regarding therapy directed towards abnormal findings detected during screening should be made by a dedicated multidisciplinary team together with the high-risk individual and their family. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Surgical resection should be performed at high-volume centers. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Clinicians should consider discontinuing pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals when they are more likely to die of non-pancreas cancer-related causes due to comorbidity and/or are not candidates for pancreas resection. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: The limitations and potential risks of pancreas cancer screening should be discussed with patients before initiating a screening program.",2020,10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.088,159,1,358-362,eng,1528-0012 0016-5085,"United States and Humans and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Comorbidity and Genetic Predisposition to Disease and Medical History Taking and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Decision Making, Shared and Cancer Screening and Societies, Medical/standards and Early Detection of Cancer/*standards and Mass Screening/*standards and Risk Assessment/standards and Gastroenterology/standards and Genetic Testing/standards and Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/complications/*genetics and Pancreas Cancer and Pancreas/diagnostic imaging and Pancreatectomy/standards and Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy and Registries/standards",NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Gastroenterology,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hagan_2014_Hepa.BalMd..,JOUR,Cost analysis of sofosbuvir/ribavirin versus sofosbuvir/simeprevir for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus in interferon-ineligible/intolerant individuals,"Hagan, Liesl M. and Sulkowski, Mark S. and Schinazi, Raymond F.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","Treatment guidance for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) released by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) offers two options for interferon (IFN)-ineligible/intolerant individuals with genotype 1 infection: sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir/simeprevir (SOF/SMV) for 12 weeks. A 24-week course of SOF/RBV costs approximately US$169,000, with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates ranging from 52% to 84%; 12 weeks of SOF/SMV costs approximately $150,000, with SVR between 89% and 100%. Because SOF/SMV is currently used off-label, debate exists among physicians and payers about whether it should be prescribed and covered. This article presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of these two treatment regimens accounting for costs of drugs, treatment-related medical care, retreatment for individuals who do not achieve SVR, and natural history of continued HCV infection after failed retreatment. Analysis uses a Markov model with a lifetime horizon and a societal perspective. In the base-case scenario, SOF/SMV dominated SOF/RBV in a modeled 50-year-old cohort of treatment-naive and -experienced subjects, excluding those who failed earlier therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir. SOF/SMV yielded lower costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the average subject, compared to SOF/RBV ($165,336 and 14.69 QALYs vs. $243,586 and 14.45 QALYs, respectively). In base-case cost analysis, the SOF/SMV treatment strategy saved $91,590 per SVR, compared to SOF/RBV. Under all one-way sensitivity scenarios, SOF/SMV remained dominant and resulted in cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a 12-week course of SOF/SMV is a more cost-effective treatment for genotype 1 CHC than 24 weeks of SOF/RBV among IFN-ineligible/intolerant individuals, supporting the AASLD/IDSA guidance and offering implications for both clinical and regulatory decision making as well as pharmaceutical pricing.",2014,10.1002/hep.27151,60,1,37-45,eng,1527-3350 0270-9139,"Humans and Middle Aged and Markov Chains and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and Drug Therapy, Combination and Genotype and Simeprevir and Sofosbuvir and *Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy/economics/mortality and Antiviral Agents/economics/therapeutic use and Drug Costs/*statistics & numerical data and Hepacivirus/*drug effects/genetics and Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*economics/therapeutic use and Interferons/therapeutic use and Liver Cirrhosis/drug therapy/economics/mortality and Retreatment/economics and Ribavirin/*economics/therapeutic use and Sulfonamides/*economics/therapeutic use and Uridine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,Hepatology,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyzed the incidence of and risk factors for recurrent diverticular hemorrhage and whether discontinuing anticoagulation after diverticular hemorrhage is associated with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled in the OptumInsight Clinformatics database from 2000 through 2016. Incidence rates for initial and recurrent diverticular hemorrhage were calculated by identifying patients who had hospitalizations with a primary discharge diagnosis consistent with diverticular hemorrhage. The hazard ratios of second diverticular hemorrhage associated with anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and medication use. The hazard ratio for ischemic stroke among patients who discontinued anticoagulation after diverticular hemorrhage was calculated similarly. RESULTS: In the cohort analyzed, 14,925 patients had an initial diverticular hemorrhage; 1368 of these patients had a second episode. The unstandardized incidence rates of initial and second diverticular hemorrhage were 10.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-11.0) and 3625.6 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 3436.0-3823.0). Platelet aggregation inhibitors were associated with second episodes of diverticular hemorrhage (hazard ratio 1.47; 95% CI 1.15-1.88), whereas all classes of anticoagulation agents were not associated. Among patients with a potential indication for stroke prophylaxis, those who discontinued anticoagulation after the diverticular hemorrhage had an increased hazard of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 1.93; 95% CI 1.17-3.19).
