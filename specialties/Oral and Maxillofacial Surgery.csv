Jensen_2014_TIjoo.mi,JOUR,Paranasal bone: the prime factor affecting the decision to use transsinus vs zygomatic implants for biomechanical support for immediate function in maxillary dental implant reconstruction,"Jensen, Ole T. and Adams, Mark W. and Smith, Edmund",The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,"Paranasal bone affects the decision-making process for placement of implants for immediate function in the highly resorbed maxilla. The most important bone for apical fixation of implants in this setting is the lateral nasal bone mass. Maximum available bone mass found at the pyriform above the nasal fossa, designated M point, can most often engage two implants placed at 30-degree angles. The second most important area of paranasal bone mass is the subnasal bone of the premaxilla, which is required to engage an angled implant at the alveolar crest. However, only 4 to 5 mm in height is needed when implants are angled posterior to engage M point. The third most important paranasal bone site for implant fixation is the midline nasal crest extending upward to the vomer. This site, which is usually type 1/2 bone, can engage implants apically and provide enough fixation for immediate function even if implants are short. These anatomical bone sites enable placement of implants to obtain a 12- to 15-mm anterior-posterior spread, which is favorable for immediate function.",2014,10.11607/jomi.te52,29,1,138-e130,eng,1942-4434 0882-2786,"Humans and Male and Adult and Medical Illustration and Alveolar Bone Loss/pathology and Dental Implantation, Endosseous/*methods and Dental Occlusion and Immediate Dental Implant Loading/methods and Maxilla and Maxillary Diseases/pathology and Nasal Bone/*anatomy & histology/pathology and Torque and Zygoma",NA,NA,2014/02//Jan undefined,Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants,NA,NA,NA,NA
Putters_2018_Injooforanmasu,JOUR,Morbidity of anterior iliac crest and calvarial bone donor graft sites: a 1-year randomized controlled trial,"Putters, T. F. and Wortmann, D. E. and Schortinghuis, J. and van Minnen, B. and Boven, G. C. and Vissink, A. and Raghoebar, G. M.",International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,"Autogenous bone graft harvesting is still commonly considered the gold standard for the reconstruction of a severely resorbed maxillary alveolar ridge; however, the preferred donor site remains a subject of debate. This study compared the morbidity of calvarial and iliac crest donor sites after harvesting. Twenty edentulous patients with an insufficient volume of maxillary bone for reliable implant placement were assigned randomly to either calvarial (n=10) or anterior iliac crest (n=10) bone harvesting groups. All patients underwent a maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure combined with widening of the alveolar process using buccal bone blocks. Donor site morbidity was assessed before, during, and at 1year after the surgery through patient questionnaires, physical examination, and medical records. No perioperative complications occurred. The anterior iliac crest group reported minor postoperative pain after harvesting. The scars after calvaria harvesting were significantly longer (P=0.003), but this was not bothersome for the group of patients. Long-term pain was negligible and satisfaction was high in both groups. Both the calvaria and anterior iliac crest are associated with low long-term donor site morbidity and high patient satisfaction. Thus, patient-centred decision-making is appropriate when selecting the preferred harvesting method for that patient.",2018,10.1016/j.ijom.2018.06.002,47,11,1474-1480,eng,1399-0020 0901-5027,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Treatment Outcome and patient satisfaction and Patient Satisfaction and morbidity and Pain, Postoperative and Surgical Flaps and Transplantation, Autologous and Alveolar Ridge Augmentation/*methods and bone augmentation and calvarial bone and iliac crest and Ilium/*transplantation and Sinus Floor Augmentation/*methods and Skull/*transplantation and Transplant Donor Site/*pathology",NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
