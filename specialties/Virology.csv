Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%), and 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (ranged, 3-12 days) and 4 days (ranged, 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were demic by World Health Organiza more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5%, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20%, 80%). A total of 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs 4%, P=.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on ""flattening the curve"". While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.",2020,10.3390/v12070769,12,7,NA,eng,1999-4915,"SARS-CoV-2 and deep learning and machine learning and COVID-19 and Humans and Pandemics and ROC Curve and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and CNN and *Machine Learning and *Deep Learning and *Betacoronavirus and Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis and Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis and Corona virus and image processing and LSTM networks",NA,NA,2020/07/16/,Viruses,NA,NA,NA,NA

Risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients, especially detailed self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators, have not been well described. In this paper, a total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included. Self-evaluation indicators including demographics, baseline characteristics, and symptoms and detailed lab-examination indicators were extracted. Data were first compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed to identify possible risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients. MVPA achieved a relatively high classification accuracy of 93% when using both self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators. Several self-evaluation factors related to COVID-19 were highly associated with mortality, including age, duration (time from illness onset to admission), and the Barthel index (BI) score. When the duration, age increased by 1 day, 1 year, BI decreased by 1 point, the mortality increased by 3.6%, 2.4%, and 0.9% respectively. Laboratory-examination indicators including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelet count, fibrin degradation products, oxygenation index, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer were also risk factors. Among them, duration was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Several self-evaluation indicators that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without clinical examination were the risk factors of all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Data were collected from the health examination center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to investigate the relationship between HBV and NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 14 452 patients were included, with an average age of 43.84 <c2><b1> 13.03 years.

The prevalence of NAFLD was significantly lower in the current infection group (29.9%) than in the past infection group (35.8%) and noninfection group (31.9%) (P < .001). After adjusting for age, the prevalence of NAFLD in the current infection group remained the lowest across all of the age groups. Multivariate analysis showed that current infection was at a lower risk of NAFLD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.717, 95% CI: 0.608-0.846), whereas past infection had no effect on NAFLD.

A vaccine is available, yet HBV prevalence remains a concern, particularly in developing countries. Pathology laboratories have a primary role in the diagnosis and monitoring of HBV infection, through hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) immunoassay and associated tests. Analysis of HBsAg immunoassay and associated pathology data from 821 Chinese patients applied 10-fold cross-validation to establish classification decision trees (CDTs), with CDT results used subsequently to develop a logistic regression model. The robustness of logistic regression model was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, Pseudo-R(2) and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) result that showed the logistic regression model was capable of accurately discriminating the HBsAg positive from HBsAg negative patients at 95% accuracy. Overall CDT sensitivity and specificity was 94.7% (<c2><b1> 5.0%) and 89.5% (<c2><b1> 5.7%), respectively, close to the sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay, providing an alternative to predict HBsAg status. Both the CDT and logistic regression modeling demonstrated the importance of the routine pathology variables alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum albumin (ALB), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to accurately predict HBsAg status in a Chinese patient cohort. The study demonstrates that CDTs and a linked logistic regression model applied to routine pathology data were an effective supplement to HBsAg immunoassay, and a possible replacement method where immunoassays are not requested or not easily available for the laboratory diagnosis of HBV infection.",2013,10.1002/jmv.23609,85,8,1334-1339,eng,1096-9071 0146-6615,China and Humans and Sensitivity and Specificity and Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and *Decision Support Techniques and Alanine Transaminase/*blood and Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood and Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*blood and Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification and Hepatitis B/*diagnosis/pathology/virology and Serum Albumin/*analysis,NA,NA,2013/08//undefined,J Med Virol,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if European healthcare databases can be used to estimate vaccine coverage, benefit and/or risk using pertussis-containing vaccines as an example. METHODS: Characterisation was conducted using open-source Java-based (Jerboa) software and R scripts. We obtained: (i) The general characteristics of the database and data source (meta-data) and (ii) a detailed description of the database population (size, representatively of age/sex of national population, rounding of birth dates, delay between birth and database entry), vaccinations (number of vaccine doses, recording of doses, pattern of doses by age and coverage) and events of interest (diagnosis codes, incidence rates). A total of nine databases (primary care, regional/national record linkage) provided data on events (pertussis, pneumonia, death, fever, convulsions, injection site reactions, hypotonic hypo-responsive episode, persistent crying) and vaccines (acellular pertussis and whole cell pertussis) related to the pertussis proof of concept studies. RESULTS: The databases contained data for a total population of 44 million individuals. Seven databases had recorded doses of vaccines. The pertussis coverage estimates were similar to those reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Incidence rates of events were comparable in magnitude and age-distribution between databases with the same characteristics. Several conditions (persistent crying and somnolence) were not captured by the databases for which outcomes were restricted to hospital discharge diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The database characterisation programs and workflows allowed for an efficient, transparent and standardised description and verification of electronic healthcare databases which may participate in pertussis vaccine coverage, benefit and risk studies.

We characterized molecular cluster detection in Washington State, evaluated the current cluster investigation criteria, and developed a criterion using machine learning. The population living with HIV (PLWH) in Washington State, those with an analyzable genotype sequences, and those in clusters were described across demographic characteristics from 2015 to2018. The relationship between 3- and 12-month cluster growth and demographic, clinical, and temporal predictors were described, and a random forest model was fit using data from 2016 to 2017. The ability of this model to identify clusters with future transmission was compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Washington state criteria in 2018. The population with a genotype was similar to all PLWH, but people in a cluster were disproportionately white, male, and men who have sex with men. The clusters selected for investigation by the random forest model grew on average 2.3 cases (95% CI 1.1-1.4) in 3 months, which was not significantly larger than the CDC criteria (2.0 cases, 95% CI 0.5-3.4).

Swift_2016_Viru,JOUR,Big Data Offers Novel Insights for Oncolytic Virus Immunotherapy,"Swift, Stephanie L. and Stojdl, David F.",Viruses,"Large-scale assays, such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing and various ""omics"" technologies, have explored multiple aspects of the immune response following virus infection, often from a public health perspective. Yet a lack of similar data exists for monitoring immune engagement during oncolytic virus immunotherapy (OVIT) in the cancer setting. Tracking immune signatures at the tumour site can create a snapshot or longitudinally analyse immune cell activation, infiltration and functionality within global populations or individual cells. Mapping immune changes over the course of oncolytic biotherapy-from initial infection to tumour stabilisation/regression through to long-term cure or escape/relapse-has the potential to generate important therapeutic insights around virus-host interactions. Further, correlating such immune signatures with specific tumour outcomes has significant value for guiding the development of novel oncolytic virus immunotherapy strategies. Here, we provide insights for OVIT from large-scale analyses of immune populations in the infection, vaccination and immunotherapy setting. We analyse several approaches to manipulating immune engagement during OVIT. We further explore immunocentric changes in the tumour tissue following immunotherapy, and compile several immune signatures of therapeutic success.

Most of the content on YouTube is not created by professionals, public institutions or the traditional media, and instead is authored by private individual content creators. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating health information, it is important for researchers and public health practitioners to understand the nature of health information as it is shared on YouTube. The primary objective of this research is to describe expressions of vaccine hesitancy content on YouTube, and specifically, compare the expression of pro- and anti-immunization sentiments. We do this by not only analyzing a systematic sample of influenza and measles immunization videos in terms of viewer analytics, but also by choice of language. We find that pro- and anti-immunization videos are common, but that videos with anti-immunization sentiment tend to be more 'liked'. We also find that a small number of words can be effectively used to identify anti-immunization content, an observation that could be useful for identifying trends in anti-immunization sentiment on social media.

METHODS: Geolocated tweets from U.S. counties (N = 115,330) were analyzed using MALLET LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic modeling techniques to correlate with prospective individual survey data (N = 3005) about vaccine attitudes, actual vaccination, and real-life discussions about vaccines with family and friends during the 2018-2019 influenza season. RESULTS: Ten topics were common across U.S. counties during the 2018-2019 influenza season. In the overall analyses, two of these topics (i.e., Vaccine Science Matters and Big Pharma) were associated with attitudes and behaviors. The topic concerning vaccine science in November-February was positively correlated with attitudes in February-March, r = 0.09, BF(10) = 3. Moreover, among respondents who did not discuss the influenza vaccine with family and friends, the topic about vaccine fraud and children in November-February was negatively correlated with attitudes in February-March and with vaccination in February-March, and April-May (rs = -0.18 to -0.25, BF(10) = 4-146). However, this was absent when participants had discussions about the influenza vaccine with family and friends.

However, many of the ethical considerations that support EBDM when used to evaluate therapeutic care do not readily translate to prevention. This mismatch can result in policy decisions that produce unanticipated negative consequences, including public resistance. In its emphasis on quantifiable outcomes, EBDM invokes the ethical principle of rule-utilitarianism, which values the optimal long-run balance of benefit over harm. Vaccines raise a number of competing ethical concerns in ways that individual medical treatments do not. They rely on widespread compliance for effectiveness, which can limit individual autonomy, emphasize population over individual effects, which can obscure the imperative of beneficence to help the vulnerable, require a just allocation process within populations, and sometimes challenge strong social norms.

As a novel therapeutic strategy, we have therefore investigated the potential of ES-62, an anti-inflammatory secreted product of the filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae, to improve healthspan (the period of life before diseases of ageing appear) by targeting the chronic inflammation that drives metabolic dysregulation underpinning ageing-induced ill-health. We administered ES-62 subcutaneously (at a dose of 1 <ce><bc>g/week) to C57BL/6J mice undergoing HCD-accelerated ageing throughout their lifespan, while subjecting the animals to analysis of 120 immunometabolic responses at various time-points. ES-62 improved a number of inflammatory parameters, but markedly, a range of pathophysiological, metabolic and microbiome parameters of ageing were also successfully targeted. Notably, ES-62-mediated promotion of healthspan in male and female HCD-mice was associated with different mechanisms and reflecting this, machine learning modelling identified sex-specific signatures predictive of ES-62 action against HCD-accelerated ageing. Remarkably, ES-62 substantially increased the median survival of male HCD-mice. This was not the case with female animals and unexpectedly, this difference between the two sexes could not be explained in terms of suppression of the chronic inflammation driving ageing, as ES-62 tended to be more effective in reducing this in female mice. Rather, the difference appeared to be associated with ES-62's additional ability to preferentially promote a healthier gut-metabolic tissue axis in male animals.",2020,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008391,16,3,e1008391,eng,1553-7374 1553-7366,"Female and Male and Animals and Mice and *Models, Immunological and Acanthocheilonema/*immunology and Acanthocheilonemiasis/*immunology and Diet, Western/*adverse effects and Helminth Proteins/*immunology and Longevity/*immunology",NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,PLoS Pathog,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of the present study was to categorize public concerns regarding influenza vaccinations in Japan by analyzing a massive web-based question dataset. METHODS: The Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Japanese Yahoo! Answers) Dataset, which includes more than 16 million questions collected between April 2004 and April 2009, was used in this study. We sequentially filtered data to obtain questions on influenza vaccinations. Any questions that met our exclusion criteria concerning veterinary vaccines or computer virus vaccines were removed from the analysis. Filtered questions and their answers were manually analyzed for their content by a team of board-certified pediatricians. RESULTS: After filtering data, we obtained 1950 questions regarding influenza vaccinations. The three most frequently asked questions were regarding the vaccination schedule, safety, and effectiveness. When we analyzed monthly trends in question contents, we noted the emergence of similar questions in the same period every year. Therefore, we classified the time periods of each year into three parts: (1) from April to the commencement of seasonal influenza vaccinations (September), (2) from October until the epidemic period, and (3) the epidemic period. Two interesting results were obtained: concerns regarding effectiveness abruptly increased during the epidemic period, and pregnant or breastfeeding women increasingly asked questions regarding feasibility between October and the epidemic period. CONCLUSIONS: The questions and concerns collected and analyzed in this study illustrate that the public have questions about the influenza vaccine and also that questions changed with periodical consistency.

Focus groups (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>5) were conducted through convenience sampling in a medical university in October 2016 in Anhui, China. Two years later, 6 participants among them were follow-up interviewed. All the interviews were audio-recorded, then transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using constant comparative method. Opinions of 22 participants (13 females, 9 males) were collected. Results revealed that hepatitis B vaccination was discussed the most frequently, and most of participants were vaccinated against (or had documented immunity to) hepatitis B before or during their clinical internship. None of the participants reported other vaccines uptake. Three dimensions of themes were identified: (i) at individual level, the factor ""feeling less infection risk"" might strengthen their perceived barriers. The factors ""laziness"" and ""fluke mind"" would be used to rationalize their inactive practices about vaccination; (ii) at social level, themes involved ""inactive organizational behaviors"", ""suggestions from people around"", and ""social norms"". Decision-making of medical students' vaccination was more relying on themselves and influenced more by their classmates before or during their internship, rather than being influenced more by their families/universities as before. (iii) at professional level, there are two contradictions about the participants' behaviors and attitudes. One is that they may have inappropriate behaviors because of their lack of knowledge, but sometimes they seem too satisfied about their medical knowledge to vaccination. The other is that there are both vigilance response and desensitization to occupational infection risk. It is suggested that efforts should be strengthened to spread scientific knowledge of infectious diseases and immunization as long as medical students enter the university.

An analysis of German HPV vaccination leaflets revealed, however, that none met the standards of balanced risk communication. METHODS: We surveyed a sample of 225 girl-parent pairs in a before-after design on the effects of balanced and unbalanced risk communication on participants' knowledge about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccination, their perceived risk, their intention to have the vaccine, and their actual vaccination decision. RESULTS: The balanced leaflet increased the number of participants who were correctly informed about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine by 33 to 66 absolute percentage points. In contrast, the unbalanced leaflet decreased the number of participants who were correctly informed about these facts by 0 to 18 absolute percentage points. Whereas the actual uptake of the HPV vaccination 14 months after the initial study did not differ between the two groups (22% balanced leaflet vs. 23% unbalanced leaflet; p=.93, r=.01), the originally stated intention to have the vaccine reliably predicted the actual vaccination decision for the balanced leaflet group only (concordance between intention and actual uptake: 97% in the balanced leaflet group, rs=.92, p=.00; 60% in the unbalanced leaflet group, rs=.37, p=.08). CONCLUSION: In contrast to a unbalanced leaflet, a balanced leaflet increased people's knowledge of the HPV vaccination, improved perceived risk judgments, and led to an actual vaccination uptake, which first was robustly predicted by people's intention and second did not differ from the uptake in the unbalanced leaflet group.

Black_2013_Vacc,JOUR,The role of health economic analyses in vaccine decision making,"Black, Steven",Vaccine,"Beginning in the 20th century with the consideration of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the US, the cost effectiveness became a topic of discussion when this vaccine was being considered for universal use by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization practices (ACIP). In 2008, the ACIP began using formal criteria for the presentation of such data and their inclusion in ACIP discussions. More recently, the US Institute of Medicine has recommended that health economic considerations play a primary role in the prioritization of future vaccine for development. However, such analyses can be biased towards vaccines that provide economic benefit rather than those that reduce severe morbidity and mortality. This is because the economic impact of minor common events that result in medical utilization or time lost from work for parents can outweigh the economic impact of severe morbidity and mortality. Thus diseases with a low mortality and morbidity but with a common clinical manifestation such as the common cold could be prioritized over vaccines against diseases such as meningococcal sepsis where the morbidity and mortality associated with each case is very high, but there is no associated common clinical syndrome. Thus the use of cost effectiveness analyses as a 'gating criteria' to decide which vaccines should be developed or routinely used runs the risk of transforming vaccines into primarily a tool for achieving cost savings within the health care system rather than a public health intervention targeting human suffering, death and disability. It is the purpose of this article to review the framework under which health economic evaluations can be undertaken, to review the experience with and reliability of such analyses, and to discuss the potential negative implications of the use of health economic analyses as a primary decision making tool.",2013,10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.008,31,51,6046-6049,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,United States and Humans and Decision Making and Health Policy and Cost-effectiveness and Costs and Cost Analysis and Communicable Diseases/*economics/epidemiology and Vaccination/*economics/*methods and Vaccine policy and Vaccines/administration & dosage/*economics/*immunology,NA,NA,2013/12/09/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed among 143 IM residents at Mayo Clinic to evaluate the PCSDM curriculum plus fact-based immunization curriculum (intervention) compared to fact-based immunization curriculum alone (control) on the outcomes of resident continuity clinic patient panel immunization rates for influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus, pertussis, and zoster vaccines. Pre-study and post-study immunization KAP surveys were administered to IM residents. RESULTS: Ninety-nine residents participated in the study. Eighty-two residents completed pre-study and post-study surveys. Influenza and pertussis immunization rates improved for both intervention and control groups.

Using a pre-post survey methodology, we compared the impact of two of the most popular YouTube videos discussing seasonal influenza vaccine, both vaccine-critical, on the attitudes towards immunizing of first year medical students attending a Canadian medical school. Forty-one medical students were randomized to view either a scientifically styled, seemingly ""evidence-based"", vaccine-critical video or a video using anecdotal stories of harms and highly sensationalized imagery. In the pre-intervention survey, medical students frequently used YouTube for all-purposes, while 42% used YouTube for health-related purposes and 12% used YouTube to search for health information. While medical students were generally supportive of immunizing, there was suboptimal uptake of annual influenza vaccine reported, and a subset of our study population expressed vaccine-critical attitudes and behaviors with respect to seasonal influenza. Overall there was no significant difference in pre to post attitudes towards influenza immunization nor were there any differences when comparing the two different vaccine-critical videos. The results of our study are reassuring in that they suggest that medical students are relatively resistant to the predominately inaccurate, vaccine-critical messaging on YouTube, even when the message is framed as scientific reasoning.

Absurd"" - Mapping maternal vaccination discourse and stance on social media over six months","Martin, Sam and Kilich, Eliz and Dada, Sara and Kummervold, Per Egil and Denny, Chermain and Paterson, Pauline and Larson, Heidi J.",Vaccine,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the predominant topics of discussion, stance and associated language used on social media platforms relating to maternal vaccines in 15 countries over a six-month period. BACKGROUND: In 2019, the World Health Organisation prioritised vaccine hesitancy as a top ten global health threat and recognized the role of viral misinformation on social media as propagating vaccine hesitancy. Maternal vaccination offers the potential to improve maternal and child health, and to reduce the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Understanding the topics of discussion, stance and language used around maternal vaccines on social media can inform public health bodies on how to combat vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Social media data was extracted (Twitter, forums, blogs and comments) for six months from 15 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Panama, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom and United States). We used stance, discourse and topic analysis to provide insight into the most frequent and weighted keywords, hashtags and themes of conversation within and across countries. RESULTS: We exported a total of 19,192 social media posts in 16 languages obtained between 1st November 2018 and 30th April 2019. After screening all posts, 16,000 were included in analyses, while excluding retweets, 2,722 were annotated for sentiment. Main topics of discussion were the safety of the maternal influenza and pertussis vaccines. Discouraging posts were most common in Italy (44.9%), and the USA (30.8%). CONCLUSION: The content and stance of maternal vaccination posts from November 2018 to April 2019 differed across countries, however specific topics of discussion were not limited to geographical location.

Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was used to inductively code these data. Resulting themes were mapped across the COM-B ('capability', 'opportunity', 'motivation' and 'behaviour') theoretical framework to understanding barriers and potential interventions. RESULTS: Twenty-six medical practitioners (21 GPs and 5 hospital specialists) completed semi-structured interviews. Barriers, and facilitators for influenza vaccine recommendation (the intended behaviour) were thematically grouped. Opportunity themes included structural barriers (e.g. limited use of systems and processes to support the identification of children with SRMCs); recommendation as standard practice; vaccination inconvenience; lack of communication and educational resources; social acceptance and normalisation; and media messaging. Capability themes included provider communication with parents; knowledge of influenza vaccine recommendations; and professional boundaries to implement the recommendation. Themes in the Motivation category included provider clinical prioritisation and responsibility towards providing a recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: The main barriers to influenza recommendation raised by our study participants were structural. These included lack of processes to identify children with SRMCs, limited use of reminder systems and unclear delineation of role responsibility between hospital specialists and GPs. An important driver that emerged was GPs' responsibility for providing a recommendation. To increase influenza vaccine coverage for children with SRMCs, consideration should be given to addressing practice level structural barriers and improving collaboration.",2020,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.020,38,49,7806-7814,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Children and Humans and Child and Vaccination and Influenza and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and *General Practitioners and *Influenza Vaccines and *Influenza, Human/prevention & control and Chronic medical conditions and Immunisation and Infectious diseases",NA,NA,2020/11/17/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA
Miles_2013_Vacc,JOUR,Validity of vaccination cards and parental recall to estimate vaccination coverage: a systematic review of the literature,"Miles, Melody and Ryman, Tove K. and Dietz, Vance and Zell, Elizabeth and Luman, Elizabeth T.",Vaccine,"Immunization programs frequently rely on household vaccination cards, parental recall, or both to calculate vaccination coverage. This information is used at both the global and national level for planning and allocating performance-based funds. However, the validity of household-derived coverage sources has not yet been widely assessed or discussed. To advance knowledge on the validity of different sources of immunization coverage, we undertook a global review of literature. We assessed concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and coverage percentage point difference when subtracting household vaccination source from a medical provider source. Median coverage difference per paper ranged from -61 to +1 percentage points between card versus provider sources and -58 to +45 percentage points between recall versus provider source. When card and recall sources were combined, median coverage difference ranged from -40 to +56 percentage points. Overall, concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value showed poor agreement, providing evidence that household vaccination information may not be reliable, and should be interpreted with care. While only 5 papers (11%) included in this review were from low-middle income countries, low-middle income countries often rely more heavily on household vaccination information for decision making. Recommended actions include strengthening quality of child-level data and increasing investments to improve vaccination card availability and card marking. There is also an urgent need for additional validation studies of vaccine coverage in low and middle income countries.",2013,10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.089,31,12,1560-1568,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,Humans and Predictive Value of Tests and *Medical Records and *Parents and Vaccination/*statistics & numerical data and *Mental Recall and Immunization Programs/methods/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2013/03/15/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although a licensed Ebolavirus vaccine (EV) is not yet available, the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has accelerated EV clinical trials and given public health authorities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone experience with implementation of emergency ring vaccination. As evidence supporting the use of EV during an outbreak response has become available, public health authorities in at-risk countries are considering how to integrate EV into future emergency Ebola responses and for prevention in high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and frontline workers (HCW/FLWs), even before an EV is licensed. This review provides an overview of Ebola epidemiology, immunology, and evidence to inform regional and country-level decisions regarding EV delivery during an emergency response and to at-risk populations before a licensed vaccine is available and beyond. Countries or regions planning to use EV will need to assess factors such as the likelihood of a future Ebolavirus outbreak, the most likely species to cause an outbreak, the availability of a safe and effective EV (unlicensed or licensed) for the affected population, capacity to implement Ebola vaccination in conjunction with standard Ebola outbreak control measures, and availability of minimum essential resources and regulatory requirements to implement emergency Ebola vaccination.

This manuscript summarizes the consensus points reached during a pan-European meeting on gaps and barriers in making vaccination of adults aged 50+ a reality and on further joint actions in Europe. The shift from childhood to life-long vaccination is essential to prevent disability, morbidity and mortality in the elderly and promote healthy ageing.

We explored views on three mandatory policies (declination forms, face masks or reduced patient contact, and mandatory vaccination) among both HCWs and flu vaccination programme managers in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. METHOD: A mixed method approach was employed. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted with staff responsible for implementing influenza campaigns in NHS trusts (healthcare organisations) in England (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>72 trusts). The survey measured perceived effectiveness of the three mandatory policies and perceived support for them among HCWs. Qualitative interviews were conducted in four trusts, with influenza campaign managers (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>24) and with HCWs who had the opportunity to receive the influenza vaccination (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>32). Interviews explored respondents' views of the three strategies and were analysed thematically using QSR NVivo 11 All data were collected shortly after the 2016/2017 influenza season. RESULTS: In the survey, views varied on the effectiveness of the three policies and none of the interventions were thought to be strongly supported by HCWs, with particularly low levels of support perceived for mandatory vaccination and for face masks or reduced patient contact. The qualitative interviews revealed substantial concerns around the practicability and enforceability of mandatory policies and the potential discriminatory effect on HCWs who made a principled decision or had medical reasons for exemption. Additional doubts were also expressed regarding the effectiveness of face masks and their potential to worry patients, and the ethics of compelling staff to accept medical intervention. DISCUSSION: Mandatory vaccination and face masks would not be strongly supported if introduced in the UK. If declination forms are adopted, they should be used in a constructive intelligence-gathering manner which avoids stigmatising HCWs.",2019,10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.11.033,37,1,69-75,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Attitudes and England and Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Vaccination and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Masks and Influenza and Policy and Patient Acceptance of Health Care and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Policy and Influenza, Human/*prevention & control and Health Personnel/*psychology and Administrative Personnel/psychology and Vaccination Refusal and Vaccination/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology and Flu and Mandatory Programs/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2019/01/03/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

Globally coordinated virological and epidemiological surveillance is the foundation of the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process. Although national influenza surveillance and reporting capabilities are being strengthened and expanded, sustaining and building upon recent gains has become a major challenge. Strengthening the vaccine virus selection process additionally requires the continuation of initiatives to improve the timeliness and representativeness of influenza viruses shared by countries for detailed analysis by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Efforts are also continuing at the national, regional, and global levels to better understand the dynamics of influenza transmission in both temperate and tropical regions. Improved understanding of the degree of influenza seasonality in tropical countries of the world should allow for the strengthening of national vaccination policies and use of the most appropriate available vaccines. There remain a number of limitations and difficulties associated with the use of HAI assays for the antigenic characterization and selection of influenza vaccine viruses by WHOCCs. Current approaches to improving the situation include the more-optimal use of HAI and other assays; improved understanding of the data produced by neutralization assays; and increased standardization of serological testing methods. A number of new technologies and associated tools have the potential to revolutionize influenza surveillance and response activities. These include the increasingly routine use of whole genome next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput approaches. Such approaches could not only become key elements in outbreak investigations but could drive a new surveillance paradigm. However, despite the advances made, significant challenges will need to be addressed before next-generation technologies become routine, particularly in low-resource settings. Emerging approaches and techniques such as synthetic genomics, systems genetics, systems biology and mathematical modelling are capable of generating potentially huge volumes of highly complex and diverse datasets. Harnessing the currently theoretical benefits of such bioinformatics (""big data"") concepts for the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process will depend upon further advances in data generation, integration, analysis and dissemination. Over the last decade, growing awareness of influenza as an important global public health issue has been coupled to ever-increasing demands from the global community for more-equitable access to effective and affordable influenza vaccines. The current influenza vaccine landscape continues to be dominated by egg-based inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, with a small number of cell-based and recombinant vaccines. Successfully completing each step in the annual influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle will continue to rely upon timely and regular communication between the WHO GISRS, manufacturers and regulatory authorities. While the pipeline of influenza vaccines appears to be moving towards a variety of niche products in the near term, it is apparent that the ultimate aim remains the development of effective ""universal"" influenza vaccines that offer longer-lasting immunity against a broad range of influenza A subtypes.",2015,10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.090,33,36,4368-4382,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Humans and International Cooperation and World Health Organization and *Epidemiological Monitoring and Influenza, Human/*epidemiology/*prevention & control and *Technology, Pharmaceutical and Influenza vaccine viruses and Influenza Vaccines/*immunology/*isolation & purification and Vaccine virus selection and WHO recommendations",NA,NA,2015/08/26/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, the vaccination rate among health care personnel in Poland is also very low. The aim of this study was to determine the current barriers to achieving effective influenza vaccination coverage among primary health care (PHC) patients and physicians in Poland and to reveal any associations between the patients' and physicians' characteristics and the influenza vaccination coverage rate among patients. METHOD: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was distributed among 18 PHC physicians and 533 their patients in Krakow, Poland and the surrounding region. The data from patients were associated with the doctors' characteristics. RESULTS: The reasons for not receiving the influenza vaccine differed between patients and their physicians. Among the patient population, the main reason behind vaccination non-compliance was the self-perception of good health, while forgetting about the vaccination was the main reason among the physicians. The factors that had the positive influence on the patients' decision to receive the vaccination involved: older age, being a widower, being retired, having a chronic disease, being vaccinated against influenza in the past and awareness of influenza complications. Moreover, those patients who had received sufficient influenza vaccination education from their healthcare provider and had been the patients of physicians who had been vaccinated against influenza, had significantly higher vaccination rates. CONCLUSION: Improved patients and doctors education strategies are needed to maximize influenza vaccination coverage rates. Information regarding the need and benefits of the influenza vaccine, along with details on where and when to receive vaccination will provide a positive influence on a patients' decision-making process regarding vaccination compliance.

For most travelers, JE risk is very low but varies based on several factors, including travel duration, location, and activities. To aid public health officials, health care providers, and travelers evaluate the worth of administering/ receiving pre-travel JE vaccinations, we estimated the numbers-needed-to-treat to prevent a case and the cost-effectiveness ratios of JE vaccination for U.S. travelers in different risk categories. METHODS: We used a decision tree model to estimate cost per case averted from a societal and traveler perspective for hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers. Risk Category I included travelers planning to spend <e2><89><a5>1 month in JE-endemic areas, Risk Category II were shorter-term (<1 month) travelers spending <e2><89><a5>20% of their time doing outdoor activities in rural areas, and Risk Category III were all remaining travelers. We performed sensitivity analyses including examining changes in cost-effectiveness with 10- and 100-fold increases in incidence and medical treatment costs. RESULTS: The numbers-needed-to-treat to prevent a case and cost per case averted were approximately 0.7 million and $0.6 billion for Risk Category I, 1.6 million and $1.2 billion for Risk Category II, and 9.8 million and $7.6 billion for Risk Category III. Increases of 10-fold and 100-fold in disease incidence proportionately decreased cost-effectiveness ratios. Similar levels of increases in medical treatment costs resulted in negligible changes in cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSION: Numbers-needed-to-treat and cost-effectiveness ratios associated with preventing JE cases in U.S. travelers by vaccination varied greatly by risk category and disease incidence. While cost effectiveness ratios are not the sole rationale for decision-making regarding JE vaccination, the results presented here can aid in making such decisions under very different risk and cost scenarios.",2020,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.032,38,17,3351-3357,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Humans and Cost-effectiveness and Asia and Travel and *Travel and Vaccination/*economics and *Encephalitis, Japanese/epidemiology/prevention & control and Japanese encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis vaccine and Japanese Encephalitis Vaccines/*economics and Numbers needed to treat",NA,NA,2020/04/09/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grabenstein_2013_Vacc,JOUR,"What the world's religions teach, applied to vaccines and immune globulins","Grabenstein, John D.",Vaccine,"For millennia, humans have sought and found purpose, solace, values, understanding, and fellowship in religious practices. Buddhist nuns performed variolation against smallpox over 1000 years ago. Since Jenner developed vaccination against smallpox in 1796, some people have objected to and declined vaccination, citing various religious reasons. This paper reviews the scriptural, canonical basis for such interpretations, as well as passages that support immunization. Populous faith traditions are considered, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Subjects of concern such as blood components, pharmaceutical excipients of porcine or bovine origin, rubella strain RA 27/3, and cell-culture media with remote fetal origins are evaluated against the religious concerns identified. The review identified more than 60 reports or evaluations of vaccine-preventable infectious-disease outbreaks that occurred within religious communities or that spread from them to broader communities. In multiple cases, ostensibly religious reasons to decline immunization actually reflected concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs among a social network of people organized around a faith community, rather than theologically based objections per se. Themes favoring vaccine acceptance included transformation of vaccine excipients from their starting material, extensive dilution of components of concern, the medicinal purpose of immunization (in contrast to diet), and lack of alternatives. Other important features included imperatives to preserve health and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, among neighbors). Concern that 'the body is a temple not to be defiled' is contrasted with other teaching and quality-control requirements in manufacturing vaccines and immune globulins. Health professionals who counsel hesitant patients or parents can ask about the basis for concern and how the individual applies religious understanding to decision-making about medical products, explain facts about content and processes, and suggest further dialog with informed religious leaders.

Mary and Montesinos, Diana P. and Middleman, Amy B.",Vaccine,"OBJECTIVES: Data are limited on whether providers understand parental attitudes to recommended childhood immunizations. We determined parental attitudes and assessed how accurately providers estimated parental opinions. METHODS: Survey of parents and providers (pediatricians, nurses, medical assistants) in randomly selected practices in Houston, Texas. Surveys assessed demographics, perceptions of immunization importance, safety and efficacy, and acceptability of vaccine delivery. Providers estimated parental responses. RESULTS: 401 parents (82% mothers, 12% fathers, 6% other) and 105 providers participated. Parents thought vaccines were important for health (median score 9.5; 0=not important, 10=extremely important) but also were concerned regarding vaccine safety and side effects (8.9 on 0-10 scale). 309 (77%) agreed that vaccines effectively prevent disease. Route of administration mattered to 147 (37%), who preferred injection (9.0) over oral (7.3) or intranasal (4.8) routes. Although parents would prefer three or fewer injections per visit, preventing more diseases (189 [47.6%]) was more important than number of injections (167 [42.3%]) when deciding the number of vaccines allowed per visit. White parents rated vaccines less important in preventing some illnesses than did non-white (P<e2><89><a4>0.006 for meningitis, hepatitis, HPV, influenza and rotavirus) and rated number of injections per visit more important than number of diseases prevented (51.6% white versus 34.2% non-white; P 0.002). Providers underestimated parental attitudes toward vaccine importance (particularly influenza and HPV), and overestimated the proportion of parents who thought route of administration mattered (63%) and that number of injections per visit was the most important factor (76%) around parental vaccine decisions (P<0.001 for parent-provider mismatch).

This qualitative study explored the experiences and representations of HPV vaccination by adolescent girls seeing doctors at least occasionally. STUDY DESIGN: We used a written essay question to explore this issue among 101 adolescent girls at six urban medical centers and a semi-structured interview to discuss it in further depth with five of them. The analysis was lexicometric (ALCESTE(R)) and phenomenological (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis). RESULTS: These results are organized around four superordinate themes: the teenage girls' factual knowledge about this vaccine, their motives for and obstacles to vaccination, their involvement in this decision, and finally the need for information about and solutions to this issue. CONCLUSIONS: Teenage girls know little about this vaccine and are more sensitive to the emotional discourse that surrounds it than to rational knowledge about it. The requirement for parental authorization for this vaccine reinforces the girls' lack of investment.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review pneumococcal disease cost of illness and productivity loss studies in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. METHODS: A search of relevant databases was performed till November 2011. A broad and sensitive search strategy was used consisting of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms for pneumococcal disease, healthcare costs and productivity loss studies. No language restriction was applied. Only papers from LAC region and child population were analyzed. Additional exclusion criteria included duplicate studies, and insufficient information about methods. RESULTS: A total of 1241 citations were retrieved. After applying the exclusion criteria, only 16 studies remained for analysis. There were 4 papers from Brazil, 3 from Argentina, 2 from Colombia, 2 from Mexico, 1 from Uruguay, 1 from Chile, and 3 analyzing a group of LAC countries. Only 4 were cost-of-illness studies, 11 were cost-effectiveness studies of pneumococcal vaccine and 1 study of the pneumococcal burden of disease. Methods used for quantifying health resource utilization and costing methods varied significantly among studies, as well as data sources considered. Productivity losses were considered in 8 studies, all of which used the human capital approach method. Pneumococcal disease cost estimates varied significantly depending on the pneumococcal syndromes considered, methods used, study perspective and type of costs included. CONCLUSION: This systematic review reinforced the importance of standardization of methods for cost studies that can allow comparison and reproducibility in other settings.

The objective of this study was to obtain professional agreement on vaccine practices in these patients. METHODS: A Delphi survey was carried out with physicians recognised for their expertise in vaccinology and/or the caring for adult patients with AID and/or DRID. For each proposed vaccination practice, the experts' opinion and level of agreement were evaluated. RESULTS: The proposals relating to patients with AID specified: the absence of risk of AID relapse following vaccination; the possibility of administering live virus vaccines (LVV) to patients not receiving immunosuppressants; the pertinence of determining protective antibody titre before vaccination; the absence of need for specific monitoring following the vaccination. The proposals relating to patients with DRID specified that a 3-6 month delay is needed between the end of these treatments and the vaccination with LVV. There is no contraindication to administering LVV in patients receiving systemic corticosteroids prescribed for less than two weeks, regardless of their dose, or at a daily dose not exceeding 10mg of prednisone, if this involves prolonged treatment. Out of 14 proposals, the level of agreement between the experts was ""very good"" for eleven, and ""good"" for the remaining three.

Prior to the introduction of new vaccines, it is imperative to assess the perceptions of the public and medical community about the disease and the vaccine. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of mothers and health care providers (HCPs) toward PCV in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-five respondents (26 mothers and 29 HCPs) were interviewed at public and private health care facilities in Bandung using semi-structured interviews in May-June 2011. Data were analyzed manually according to pre-defined themes. RESULTS: Although most mothers had low knowledge about PCV, did not perceive themselves as susceptible to the disease, perceived that cost was the main barrier to PCV access, and obtained little information on PCV, they considered pneumonia as a severe disease and a priority health problem, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and were likely to adopt it. Similarly, knowledge about PCV among most HCPs was limited. Despite perceiving cost as the main barrier, most HCPs perceived benefits of the vaccine, susceptibility and severity of the disease, regarded pneumonia as a priority health problem, and were likely to suggest the new vaccination. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Despite the poor knowledge of mothers and HCPs about PCV, they are aware of the high burden of pneumonia and the need for a vaccine in the NIP. Perceived severity and benefits among mothers, and, additionally, perceived susceptibility among HCPs were manifested in the willingness to accept PCV. The findings would contribute to better understanding the factors, which could support decision-making about vaccine introduction, and be utilized for developing suitable messages for mothers and HCPs.",2013,10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.01.007,31,11,1516-1522,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Child, Preschool and Infant and Interviews as Topic and Patient Acceptance of Health Care and Infant, Newborn and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Health Personnel and Indonesia/epidemiology and *Mothers and Pneumococcal Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology and Pneumonia, Pneumococcal/*epidemiology/*prevention & control and Vaccines, Conjugate/administration & dosage/immunology",NA,NA,2013/03/01/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

An estimated 2.7<e2><80><af>million neonatal deaths and 2.6<e2><80><af>million stillbirths still occur annually. Over the past several years there has been renewed global interest in innovative approaches to maternal immunization to potentially decrease mortality and severe morbidity in neonates, and in the pregnant woman and her fetus. Several new vaccines are in clinical development for indications in pregnant women, e.g., vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, and group B streptococcus. Achieving near-concurrent introduction of new maternal vaccines in high-, middle-, and low-income countries requires that mechanisms are in place for appropriate safety monitoring worldwide. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation convened a global expert meeting in Amsterdam on May 1-2, 2018, to discuss a framework for appropriate pharmacovigilance for vaccines used during pregnancy based on integrated maternal interventions vigilance (MIV) systems and collection of appropriate data to inform timely decision-making by and for pregnant women. Planning for MIV requires a multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach that fully leverages and builds upon existing resources, and builds new capabilities and capacity where needed. Meeting participants identified priority actions including (1) establishing background rates to better evaluate emerging safety signals and vaccine effectiveness, (2) identifying potential sentinel vaccine surveillance sites, (3) developing data sharing capabilities, (4) creating guidance documents and protocols, and (5) the advanced preparation of culturally-appropriate communication plans and risk management plans. Integrating MIV across the routine obstetric and neonatal health care delivery continuum and all relevant programs and data systems could result in fundamental improvements in maternal, neonatal and child health.

They can potentially act as unofficial health educators to help dispel misunderstandings about medical risks in a culturally appropriate manner. Somali parents in Minnesota are less likely to immunize their children for MMR than other parents because they believe the MMR vaccine causes autism. The low MMR vaccination rate contributed to measles outbreaks in the state in 2011 and 2017. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an educational session on interpreter beliefs and knowledge about childhood vaccines. METHODS: A large interpreter service in Minneapolis holds quarterly educational sessions for their interpreters. The investigators presented a one-hour interactive session on childhood vaccinations at one of the meetings. The interpreters were surveyed pre- and post-training to assess their (1) beliefs regarding childhood vaccines, (2) knowledge of childhood vaccination indications and safety, and surveyed pre-training about their perceived impact on patient decision-making. RESULTS: Fifty-five of the 78 interpreters attending the training session completed both the pre- and post-training surveys. Participants made significant improvements in their knowledge of vaccines after the training. Interpreters were less likely to believe that vaccines causes autism after the presentation (p<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.02), and were more likely to indicate that the current evidence does not support a vaccine - autism connection (p<e2><80><af><<e2><80><af>0.001).

Personal values are a measurable psychological construct that could be used to deliver personalized messages to influence vaccine hesitancy and behavior. Our objectives were to develop a valid, reliable self-report survey instrument to measure vaccine values based on the Schwartz theory of basic human values, and to test the hypothesis that vaccine values are distinct from vaccine attitudes and are related to vaccine hesitancy and behavior. METHODS: Parental Vaccine Values (PVV) scale items were generated using formative qualitative research and expert input, yielding 24 items for testing. 295 parents of children aged 14-30<e2><80><af>months completed a self-report survey with measures of Schwartz's global values, the PVV, vaccine attitudes, and vaccine hesitancy. Factor analysis was used to determine vaccine values factor structure. Associations between vaccine values, vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination behavior were assessed using linear and logistic regression models. Late vaccination was assessed from electronic medical records. RESULTS: A six-factor structure for vaccine values was determined with good fit (RMSEA<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.07, Bentler's CFI<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.91) with subscales for Conformity, Universalism, Tradition, Self-Direction, Security- Disease Prevention, and Security- Vaccine Risk.

T. and Sturkenboom, Miriam C. J. M. and de Melker, Hester E.",Vaccine,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, a relatively low varicella disease burden compared to other European countries is observed within routine surveillance. To validate this, we estimated the varicella-related consultation rate using The Integrated Primary Care Information database. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, varicella patients in 2006-2008 were identified by the International Classification of Primary Care (A72) and free text in the electronic medical records, and manually reviewed to be categorised as 'varicella' or 'probable varicella'. The incidence of GP-consultation, specialist referral, emergency department contact and hospitalisation due to varicella was calculated, standardised to the Dutch population. RESULTS: We identified 1881 varicella cases (2348 including probable cases), 14 patients were hospitalised. The overall incidence of GP-consultation due to varicella per 100,000 person-years was at least 281 (95%CI 268-294) and when probable cases were also included at maximum 354 (95%CI 340-369). The overall incidence of specialist referral, emergency department contact and hospitalisation per 100,000 person-years was 3.9 (95%CI 2.7-5.6), 2.5 (95%CI 1.5-4.0) and 2.0 (95%CI 1.2-3.4) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the relatively low disease burden due to varicella in the Netherlands. In this study, using primary care data, similar incidences of GP consultation and referral to secondary care due to varicella were found as in routine surveillance. The lower varicella-related consultation rate might be linked to more conservative GP consultation behaviour in the Netherlands, and the relatively young age of infection.

H. and Greenberg, David P. and Chit, Ayman",Vaccine,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies of the relative effectiveness of influenza vaccines are essential for public health decision making. Their estimates, however, are subject to bias due to unmeasured confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) methods can control for observed and unobserved confounders. METHODS: We used linked electronic medical record databases in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as well as Medicare administrative files to examine the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose influenza vaccine (HD) versus standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD) in preventing hospitalizations among VHA-enrolled Veterans <e2><89><a5>65<e2><80><af>years of age during 5 influenza seasons (2010-2011 through 2014-2015). Using multivariable IV Poisson regression modeling to address unmeasured confounding and bias, we analyzed the data by each season and through longitudinal analysis of all five seasons. FINDINGS: We included 3,638,924 person-influenza seasons of observation where 158,636 (4%) were among HD vaccine recipients and 3,480,288 (96%) were among SD vaccine recipients. Of the 1,728,562 Veterans, 1,702,824 (98.5%) were male and 1,299,412 (75%) were non-Hispanic white. Based on the longitudinal analysis of all five seasons, the IV-adjusted rVE estimate of HD vs. SD was 10% (95% CI, 8-12%) against all-cause hospitalization; 18% (95% CI, 15-21%) against cardiorespiratory-associated hospitalization; and 14% (95% CI, 6-22%) against influenza/pneumonia-associated hospitalization. The findings by season were similar. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis of VHA clinical data collected from approximately 1.7 million Veterans 65<e2><80><af>years and older during five seasons demonstrates that high-dose influenza vaccine is more effective than standard-dose influenza vaccines in preventing influenza- or pneumonia-associated hospitalizations, cardiorespiratory hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations.",2019,10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.063,37,11,1484-1490,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Humans and Electronic Health Records and Female and Male and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Instrumental variable and Influenza and Aged, 80 and over and Research Design and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Veterans/*statistics & numerical data and Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data and Influenza, Human/*prevention & control and *Vaccine Potency and High-dose vaccine and Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology and Pneumonia/prevention & control and Vaccination/methods/*statistics & numerical data and Veterans Health Services/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/03/07/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA

Miles",Vaccine,"Generally, live-virus vaccines are contraindicated for pregnant women because of the theoretical risk of transmission of the vaccine virus to the fetus. Advisory groups recommend avoiding pregnancy in the immediate period after administration of such contraindicated vaccines (CVs) and stress benefit-to-risk evaluation for live or inactivated vaccines regarding pregnancy. Given the limited available data and theoretical risks associated particularly with live-virus vaccines, inadvertent immunization with CVs may lead to elective termination of pregnancy (ETP), despite advisory group statements that ""vaccination is not ordinarily an indication to terminate the pregnancy."" The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national passive surveillance system managed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination. The objectives of this review were to describe reports of ETP in VAERS and characterize the circumstances of inadvertent administration of vaccines to pregnant women among ETP reports. We reviewed VAERS reports of ETP submitted from 1990 to 2006. Reports of ETP for reasons other than vaccination during or shortly before pregnancy, such as fetal abnormalities or deaths, were excluded. Of 80 ETP reports, 62 (78%) originated from the US; 79 (99%) were reported by manufacturers. Median age of vaccinees was 26 years (range: 13-43 years; 67 reports). Seventy-three vaccinees (91%) received a single vaccine; 65 (81%) received at least one live-virus vaccine. In 48 (60%) ETP reports, vaccinees were unaware of pregnancy at time of immunization. In 15 (19%) reports, vaccinees became pregnant within 3 months of vaccination; in 13 (16%) reports, vaccinees might have been pregnant before vaccination; in 4 (5%) reports, information was missing. All 80 reports of ETP involved vaccines for which possible effects on fetal development are unknown. However, no cases of vaccine-associated congenital rubella or varicella syndromes have been reported in the medical literature. Also, these syndromes have not been reported to varicella or rubella vaccine pregnancy registries. VAERS has the limitations of passive surveillance systems. Under-reporting of ETP in VAERS could be substantial. More attention may be needed to assess the likelihood of pregnancy when administering vaccines to women with child-bearing potential, and to inform women who learn they are pregnant shortly after being immunized of current information on risks. Quantifying the frequency of ETP related to CVs and the risk (if any) to the fetus of such vaccines can help to inform policy, practice, and individual decision making.

Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. METHODS: We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. RESULTS: Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced <e2><89><a5>1 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 1<c2><b7>71, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). CONCLUSION: Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation.

When used optimally, vaccines prevent disease manifestations, reduce transmission of disease, decrease the need for pharmaceutical intervention, and improve the health and welfare of animals, as well as indirectly protecting against zoonotic diseases of people. Advances in the last decade or so using comprehensive systems biology approaches linking genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and biotechnology with immunology, pathogenesis and vaccine formulation and delivery are expected to enable enhanced approaches to vaccine development. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the role of computational systems biology analysis of host:pathogen interactions (the interactome) as a tool for enhanced rational design of vaccines. Systems biology is bringing a new, more robust approach to veterinary vaccine design based upon a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions and its impact on the host's molecular network of the immune system. A computational systems biology method was utilized to create interactome models of the host responses to Brucella melitensis (BMEL), Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP), Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STM), and a Salmonella mutant (isogenic <ce><94>sipA, sopABDE2) and linked to the basis for rational development of vaccines for brucellosis and salmonellosis as reviewed by Adams et al. and Ficht et al. [1,2]. A bovine ligated ileal loop biological model was established to capture the host gene expression response at multiple time points post infection. New methods based on Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) machine learning were employed to conduct a comparative pathogenicity analysis of 219 signaling and metabolic pathways and 1620 gene ontology (GO) categories that defined the host's biosignatures to each infectious condition. Through this DBN computational approach, the method identified significantly perturbed pathways and GO category groups of genes that define the pathogenicity signatures of the infectious agent. Our preliminary results provide deeper understanding of the overall complexity of host innate immune response as well as the identification of host gene perturbations that defines a unique host temporal biosignature response to each pathogen. The application of advanced computational methods for developing interactome models based on DBNs has proven to be instrumental in elucidating novel host responses and improved functional biological insight into the host defensive mechanisms. Evaluating the unique differences in pathway and GO perturbations across pathogen conditions allowed the identification of plausible host-pathogen interaction mechanisms. Accordingly, a systems biology approach to study molecular pathway gene expression profiles of host cellular responses to microbial pathogens holds great promise as a methodology to identify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the host-pathogen interactome. Thus, we propose that such an approach has immediate application to the rational design of brucellosis and salmonellosis vaccines.",2011,10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.080,29,41,7197-7206,eng,1873-2518 0264-410X,"Humans and Animals and Host-Pathogen Interactions and Systems Biology/*methods and Bacterial Vaccines/*immunology and Brucella melitensis/immunology/pathogenicity and Brucellosis/immunology/prevention & control/transmission/*veterinary and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis/immunology/pathogenicity and Paratuberculosis/immunology/*prevention & control/transmission and Salmonella Infections, Animal/immunology/*prevention & control/transmission and Salmonella typhimurium/immunology/pathogenicity and Veterinary Medicine/methods and Zoonoses/microbiology/*transmission",NA,NA,2011/09/22/,Vaccine,NA,NA,NA,NA
