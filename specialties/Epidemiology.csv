Time-relevant population data are critical as denominators for health statistics, analytics and epidemiology, to calculate rates or risks of disease. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics are key determinants of health and important confounders in the relationship between environmental contaminants and health. In many countries, census data have long been the source of small-area population denominators and confounder information. A strength of the traditional census model has been its careful design and high level of population coverage, allowing high-quality detailed data to be released for small areas periodically, e.g. every 10 years. The timeliness of data, however, becomes a challenge when temporally and spatially highly accurate annual (or even more frequent) data at high spatial resolution are needed, for example, for health surveillance and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the approach to collecting demographic population information is changing in the era of open and big data and may eventually evolve to using combinations of administrative and other data, supplemented by surveys. We discuss different approaches to address these challenges including (i) the US American Community Survey, a rolling sample of the US population census, (ii) the use of spatial analysis techniques to compile temporally and spatially high-resolution demographic data and (iii) the use of administrative and big data sources as proxies for demographic characteristics.",2020,10.1093/ije/dyz179,49 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,i15-i25,eng,1464-3685 0300-5771,United States and Population and Humans and Female and Male and Demography and big data and Social Class and Censuses and census and Spatial Analysis and administrative data and *Observational Studies as Topic and *Small-Area Analysis and spatio-temporal analysis,NA,NA,2020/04/01/,Int J Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aim to explore the potential to use an automatic, data-driven, machine-learning algorithm in clinical decision making. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using a database containing comprehensive health assessment information (the interRAI-HC) on home care clients (N=24,724) from eight community-care regions in Ontario, Canada, we compare the performance of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and a Clinical Assessment Protocol (the ""ADLCAP"") currently used to predict rehabilitation potential. For our purposes, we define a patient as having rehabilitation potential if the patient had functional improvement or remained at home over a follow-up period of approximately 1 year. RESULTS: The KNN algorithm has a lower false positive rate in all but one of the eight regions in the sample, and lower false negative rates in all regions.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a modeling study using national hospital and mortality records for patients with myocardial infarction (n = 200,119), hip fracture (n = 169,646), or colorectal cancer surgery (n = 56,515) in England in 2015-2017. One-year mortality was predicted from ICD-10 codes recorded for at least 0.5% of patients using logistic regression ('full' models). An approximation method was used to select fewer codes that explained at least 95% of variation in full model predictions ('reduced' models). RESULTS: One-year mortality was 17.2% (34,520) after myocardial infarction, 27.2% (46,115) after hip fracture, and 9.3% (5,273) after colorectal surgery. Full models included 202, 257, and 209 ICD-10 codes in these populations.

Our objective in this review was to assess machine learning alternatives to logistic regression, which may accomplish the same goals but with fewer assumptions or greater accuracy. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We identified alternative methods for propensity score estimation and/or classification from the public health, biostatistics, discrete mathematics, and computer science literature, and evaluated these algorithms for applicability to the problem of propensity score estimation, potential advantages over logistic regression, and ease of use. RESULTS: We identified four techniques as alternatives to logistic regression: neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees (classification and regression trees [CART]), and meta-classifiers (in particular, boosting). CONCLUSION: Although the assumptions of logistic regression are well understood, those assumptions are frequently ignored. All four alternatives have advantages and disadvantages compared with logistic regression. Boosting (meta-classifiers) and, to a lesser extent, decision trees (particularly CART), appear to be most promising for use in the context of propensity score analysis, but extensive simulation studies are needed to establish their utility in practice.",2010,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.11.020,63,8,826-833,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,"Humans and Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks, Computer and *Data Interpretation, Statistical and *Decision Trees and *Propensity Score and *Logistic Models",NA,NA,2010/08//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Schmidt_2018_Joofclep,JOUR,Linear regression and the normality assumption,"Schmidt, Amand F. and Finan, Chris",Journal of clinical epidemiology,"OBJECTIVES: Researchers often perform arbitrary outcome transformations to fulfill the normality assumption of a linear regression model. This commentary explains and illustrates that in large data settings, such transformations are often unnecessary, and worse may bias model estimates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Linear regression assumptions are illustrated using simulated data and an empirical example on the relation between time since type 2 diabetes diagnosis and glycated hemoglobin levels. Simulation results were evaluated on coverage; i.e., the number of times the 95% confidence interval included the true slope coefficient. RESULTS: Although outcome transformations bias point estimates, violations of the normality assumption in linear regression analyses do not. The normality assumption is necessary to unbiasedly estimate standard errors, and hence confidence intervals and P-values. However, in large sample sizes (e.g., where the number of observations per variable is >10) violations of this normality assumption often do not noticeably impact results. Contrary to this, assumptions on, the parametric model, absence of extreme observations, homoscedasticity, and independency of the errors, remain influential even in large sample size settings. CONCLUSION: Given that modern healthcare research typically includes thousands of subjects focusing on the normality assumption is often unnecessary, does not guarantee valid results, and worse may bias estimates due to the practice of outcome transformations.",2018,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.12.006,98,NA,146-151,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,Big data and Bias and *Linear Models and *Bias and *Sample Size and Epidemiological methods and Linear regression and Modeling assumptions and Statistical inference,NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of such approaches, developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group, offers systematic and transparent guidance in moving from evidence to recommendations. The GRADE strategy concentrates on four factors: the balance between benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, values and preferences, and resource considerations. However, it also considers issues around feasibility, equity, and acceptability of recommendations. GRADE distinguishes two types of recommendations: strong and weak. Strong recommendations reflect a clear preference for one alternative and should apply to all or almost all patients, obviating the need for a careful review of the evidence with each patient. Weak recommendations are appropriate when there is a close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, uncertainty regarding the effects of the alternatives, uncertainty or variability in patients' values and preferences, or questionable cost-effectiveness. Weak recommendations usually require accessing the underlying evidence and a shared decision-making approach.

STUDY DESIGN: After retrieving 163,433 news records mentioning the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemics, a maximum entropy model for inductive machine learning was used to identify relationships among 500 randomly sampled news records that correlated with systematic human assessments of their scientific quality and sensationalism. These relationships were then computationally applied to automatically classify 10,000 additional randomly sampled news records. The model was validated by randomly sampling 200 records and comparing human assessments of them to the computer assessments. RESULTS: The computer model correctly assessed the relevance of 86% of news records, the quality of 65% of records, and the sensationalism of 73% of records, as compared to human assessments. Overall, the scientific quality of SARS and H1N1 news media coverage had potentially important shortcomings, but coverage was not too sensationalizing.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Diabetes is a complex chronic disease that requires active involvement of patients in its management. Diabetes self-management education and training (DSMT), ""the ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for prediabetes and diabetes self-care,"" is an important component of integrated diabetes care. It is an intervention in which patients learn about diabetes and how to implement the self-management that is imperative to control the disease. The curriculum of DSMT often includes the diabetes disease process and treatment options; healthy lifestyle; blood glucose monitoring; preventing, detecting and treating diabetes complications; and developing personalized strategies for decision making. The American Diabetes Association recommends providing DSMT to those with newly diagnosed diabetes, because data suggest that when diabetes is first diagnosed is the time when patients are most receptive to such engagement. However, little is known about the proportion of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes participating in DSMT. CDC analyzed data from the Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Truven Health Analytics) for the period 2009-2012 to estimate the claim-based proportion of privately insured adults (aged 18-64 years) with newly diagnosed diabetes who participated in DSMT during the first year after diagnosis.

An increasingly common review is a ""methodology scoping review,"" which provides a summary of existing analytical methods, techniques and software that have been proposed or applied in research articles to address an analytical problem or further an analytical approach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation, and reporting are limited. METHODS: Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated through a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarize the challenges inherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of best practice to promote future guideline development. RESULTS: We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping review. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the search terms a priori, and the language used for a particular method can vary across the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful consideration because new methodology is often not described (in full) within abstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical question, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary materials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing review guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to defining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes. CONCLUSION: Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of research, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardize their design, implementation, and reporting. We recommend a wider discussion on this topic.",2020,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.014,127,NA,191-197,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,Humans and Systematic reviews and *Review Literature as Topic and Research Design/*standards and Reporting and Methodology scoping reviews and Scoping reviews and Study design and Systematic Reviews as Topic/*methods,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article charts the landscape of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and patient decision aids. Decision support tools for medical practice can be mapped on two dimensions. (1) The target user and his or her level of decision making; either for groups of patients or for an individual patient and (2) the level of uncertainty: either supporting more directive decision making (behavior support) in the case of strong recommendations with a single best option or supporting dialog (deliberation support) on the pros and cons of different options in the case of conditional (or weak) recommendations. We conclude that it is important to establish closer links between CPGs and patient decision aids, through collaborative development of both. Such collaboration will encourage the design of decision support tools for professionals and patients who share the same evidence and the aim to increase the quality of decision making between doctor and patient.

Bentley_2018_Injoofep,JOUR,The impact of social housing on mental health: longitudinal analyses using marginal structural models and machine learning-generated weights,"Bentley, Rebecca and Baker, Emma and Simons, Koen and Simpson, Julie A. and Blakely, Tony",International journal of epidemiology,"BACKGROUND: Social housing may provide an affordable and secure residential environment, but has also been associated with stigma, poor housing conditions and locational disadvantage. We examined the cumulative effect of additional years, and tenure security (number of transitions in/out), of social housing on mental health in a large cohort of lower-income Australians. METHODS: We analysed a longitudinal panel survey that annually collected information on tenure and health from 2001 to 2013. To address the time-varying effect of previous health on social housing occupancy, we used marginal structural models. Stabilized inverse probabilities of treatment weights were generated using ensemble learning to improve prediction. To address remaining residual imbalance across covariates, double adjustment was made by additionally including baseline covariates in models. Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Short-Form summary measure of the SF-36 (MH), and psychological distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). RESULTS: People who had continuous exposure to social housing had worse mental health on average than people continuously occupying other tenures. The worst mental health outcomes, however, were observed for people who made multiple transitions. Mental health deteriorated and psychological distress increased with number of transitions: MH -1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.16; 0.09) and K10 0.56 (95% CI 0.12; 1.00). Estimates are in the order of 6% (MH) and 9% (K10) of one standard deviation for each measure. CONCLUSIONS: The more transitions people made in/out of social housing, the greater the impact on mental health and psychological distress, supporting the case for provision of more stable forms of social housing.",2018,10.1093/ije/dyy116,47,5,1414-1422,eng,1464-3685 0300-5771,"Poverty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and *Mental Health and *Social Stigma and Australia/epidemiology and *Models, Statistical and *Machine Learning and Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology and Public Housing/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/10/01/,Int J Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A postal four double-page questionnaire on end-of-life decision making was sent to a random sample of 1,100 general practitioners, 400 elderly care physicians, and 500 medical specialists. Another random sample of 500 medical specialists received a shorter questionnaire of two double pages. After 3 months and one reminder, all nonresponding physicians received an even shorter questionnaire of one double page. RESULTS: Total response was 64% (1,456 of 2,269 eligible respondents). Response rate of medical specialists for the four double-page questionnaire was equal to that of the two double-page questionnaire (190 and 191 questionnaires were returned, respectively). The total response rate increased from 53% to 64% after sending a short one double-page questionnaire (1,203-1,456 respondents).

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures provide unique information from the patient perspective on overall health, symptoms, burden, and treatment response. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe applications of PROs in clinical settings and considerations for implementation from the perspectives of PRO researchers, clinicians, administrators, policy makers, and patients attending a multidisciplinary meeting. DISCUSSION: Clinical applications of PROs include individual level use for medical decision making and aggregate use for comparative effectiveness research, program evaluation, quality improvement, and performance assessments. Considerations of feasibility on workflow impact and patient burden, display of results, and administration frequency are important. PROs with strong psychometric properties, actionable thresholds, and interpretable results should be selected. We provide current exemplars of PRO use in various clinical applications, initial lessons learned, and highlight conceptual, logistical, and consequential considerations of PRO data collection. A research agenda is proposed to address critical knowledge gaps. In conclusion, PROs can be used in clinical settings to support patient-centered care.

The past decade has seen considerable development in methods for analysing such complex longitudinal data. However, the extent to which those methods have been implemented is unclear. This study describes and characterizes the state of the field in methods adjusting for exposure-affected time-varying confounding, and examines their use in the literature. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature from 2000 to 2016 for studies adjusting for time-dependent confounding, including use of specific methods like inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Articles were coded based on the methods used and, for applied articles, the topic areas covered. RESULTS: We screened 4239 abstracts, and subsequently reviewed 1100 articles, leaving 542 relevant articles in the analyses. The number of published articles increased from two in 2000, to 112 in 2016. This increase was primarily in applied articles using IPTW, which increased from one study in 2000, to 90 in 2016. Of the 432 studies with applications to observed data, 60.9% were on at least one of: HIV (30.6%), cardiopulmonary health (13.2%), kidney disease (11.8%) or mental health (10.0%). CONCLUSIONS: There has been marked growth in reports addressing exposure-affected time-varying confounding. This was driven by work in a small number of topic areas, with other areas showing relatively little uptake.

To compare the prognostic or predictive value of two or more tests, the test result combinations can be used as baseline information. To evaluate the effect on patient outcome, randomized controlled trials of test strategies are an option. Randomization can apply to all tested or be restricted to specific subgroups, such as those with discordant test results, to increase the efficiency of trials.

Reporting discrepancies were defined as pairs of statements that could not both be true. Authors of SRs and overviews of SRs can encounter reporting discrepancies among multiple sources when extracting data-a manuscript and a conference abstract, and a manuscript and a clinical trial registry. However, these discrepancies can also be found within a single manuscript published in a scientific journal. OBJECTIVES: Hereby, we describe examples of internal reporting discrepancies that can be found in a single source, with the aim of raising awareness among authors of SRs and overviews of SRs about such potential methodological issues. CONCLUSIONS: Authors of SRs and overviews of SRs should check whether the same information is reported in multiple places within a study and compare that information.

Chatelan_2019_Injoofep,JOUR,Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce obesity?,"Chatelan, Angeline and Bochud, Murielle and Frohlich, Katherine L.",International journal of epidemiology,"High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.",2019,10.1093/ije/dyy274,48,2,332-342,eng,1464-3685 0300-5771,Humans and Socioeconomic Factors and obesity and Health Promotion/*methods and *Precision Medicine and *Diet and *Public Health Practice and Precision nutrition and Obesity/*prevention & control and personalized nutrition and obesogenic environments and population interventions and social inequalities in health,NA,NA,2019/04/01/,Int J Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Introduction Evidence synthesis ecosystem needs dramatic change,"Boutron, Isabelle and Crequit, Perrine and Williams, Hywel and Meerpohl, Joerg and Craig, Jonathan C. and Ravaud, Philippe",Journal of clinical epidemiology,"OBJECTIVES: This article presents why the planning, conduct, and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions are suboptimal. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We present an overview of the limitations of the current system of evidence synthesis for therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are a cornerstone of health care decisions. However, despite the increasing a number of published systematic reviews of therapeutic interventions, the current evidence synthesis ecosystem is not properly addressing stakeholders' needs. The current production process leads to a series of disparate systematic reviews because of erratic and inefficient planning with a process that is not always comprehensive and is prone to bias. Evidence synthesis depends on the quality of primary research, so primary research that is not available is biased or selectively reported raises important concerns. Moreover, the lack of interactions between the community of primary research producers and systematic reviewers impedes the optimal use of data. The context has considerably evolved, with ongoing research innovations, a new medical approach with the end of the one-size-fits-all approach, more available data, and new patient expectations.

The purpose of this experiment was to appraise the reliability of funding by duplicating applications that were considered by separate grant review panels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty duplicate applications were considered by two independent grant review panels that were awarding funding for Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council. Panel members were blinded to which applications were included in the experiment and to whether it was the original or duplicate application. Scores were compared across panels using Bland-Altman plots to determine measures of agreement, including whether agreement would have impacted on actual funding. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the applicants were funded by both panels and 60 percent were not funded by both, giving an overall agreement of 83 percent [95% confidence interval (CI): 73%, 92%]. The chance-adjusted agreement was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.92). CONCLUSION: There was a comparatively high level of agreement when compared with other types of funding schemes.

RESULTS: A diagnostic test analogy is an effective teaching tool. Learners' understanding of Bayes' theorem in diagnostic testing can be used as a bridge to the realization that the prestudy probability of a true difference is crucial for study interpretation. The analogy has several caveats and shortcomings. The limitations of this analogy and the conceptual difficulties with the Bayesian study analyses are addressed. CONCLUSION: P values do not provide the information many assume they do-they are not equivalent to a probability of a chance finding. This tutorial helps move learners from these incorrect notions to new insights.,2020,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.03.003,122,NA,49-55,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,"Evidence-based medicine and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Bayes Theorem and *Data Interpretation, Statistical and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Guidelines as Topic and Medical education and Biomedical Research/*standards and Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*standards and *Probability and Research Personnel/*education and Problem-based learning and Bayes' theorem and Hypothesis testing and P-values",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bossuyt_2020_Joofclep,JOUR,An analysis reveals differences between pragmatic and explanatory diagnostic accuracy studies,"Bossuyt, Patrick M. and Olsen, Maria and Hyde, Chris and Cohen, Jeremie F.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to clarify a difference between two approaches while evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of medical tests, labeled here as ""pragmatic"" vs. ""explanatory"" studies. METHODS: Using the definitions and characteristics described by Schwartz and Lellouch for randomized trials of interventions, and Schwartz' more general distinction between a pragmatic and an explanatory approach in medical research, we define a similar continuum for diagnostic accuracy studies. Explanatory studies aim to better understand the behavior of a test; pragmatic ones are done to support recommendations or decisions about using the test in clinical practice. RESULTS: Pragmatic test accuracy studies differ from explanatory test accuracy studies in several ways. The difference in aims has implications for key elements of study design, such as the study eligibility criteria, the recruitment of patients, the reference standard, and the choice of the statistical analysis. Explanatory accuracy studies are often designed to test a hypothesis. They are typically selective in recruitment, may include ""healthy controls,"" with a small sample size, often recruited at a single center. They ignore testing failures in the analysis and more often present their results as ROC curves. By contrast, pragmatic studies are designed to guide decision making. They ideally will recruit a single, large, and representative group of patients at multiple sites and will more often present their results as estimates of sensitivity and specificity or predictive values at a prespecified threshold. CONCLUSION: Distinguishing between a pragmatic and an explanatory approach can help in the design, analysis, and interpretation of diagnostic accuracy studies. It can clarify debates about the appropriateness of design features to the study purpose and about the validity and applicability of study findings.",2020,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.09.017,117,NA,29-35,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,"Humans and Sensitivity and Specificity and Sample Size and ROC Curve and Data Accuracy and Sensitivity and Specificity and Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*standards and Research Design/*standards and Reference standard and Diagnostic accuracy and Explanatory studies and Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic and Pragmatic studies and Test evaluation",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Collins_2015_Joofclep,JOUR,Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD): the TRIPOD statement,"Collins, Gary S. and Reitsma, Johannes B. and Altman, Douglas G. and Moons, Karel G. M.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,"Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).",2015,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.11.010,68,2,134-143,eng,1878-5921 0895-4356,"Humans and Multivariate Analysis and Prognosis and Decision Support Techniques and Consensus and Medical Records/*standards and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Delivery of Health Care/*standards and *Models, Statistical and Publishing/*standards",NA,NA,2015/02//undefined,J Clin Epidemiol,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The presentation of ethical problems and possible solutions is structured using the tools of conceptual normative analysis. RESULTS: Selective publication runs contrary to (1) principles of ethical research, such as social value and respect for participants, (2) sound medical decision making and clinical guideline development, (3) appropriate patient information, (4) public trust in clinical research, and (5) just allocation of public resources for clinical research. Reasons against the obligation of complete registration and publication of trials can be divided into (1) protection of private data and (2) commercial interests. Empirical findings indicate that selective publication and incomplete trial registration (1) are frequent, (2) extensively distort patient-relevant outcomes, and (3) affect a large number of patients. CONCLUSION: Empirical data and normative arguments outweigh their counterarguments and present a clear case in favor of an even more restrictive obligation to register trials.

Inferences from hypothetical randomized trials may however be emulated with marginal structural modeling (MSM) using observational data, but success in adjusting for time-dependent confounding and selection bias typically relies on parametric modeling assumptions. If these assumptions are violated, inferences from MSM may be inaccurate. In this article, we motivate the application of a data-adaptive estimation approach called super learning (SL) to avoid reliance on arbitrary parametric assumptions in CER. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using the electronic health records data from adults with new-onset type 2 diabetes, we implemented MSM with inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to evaluate the effect of three oral antidiabetic therapies on the worsening of glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Inferences from IPW estimation were noticeably sensitive to the parametric assumptions about the associations between both the exposure and censoring processes and the main suspected source of confounding, that is, time-dependent measurements of hemoglobin A1c. SL was successfully implemented to harness flexible confounding and selection bias adjustment from existing machine learning algorithms.

This study aimed to propose an operational definition of self-management interventions and determine its discriminative performance compared with other operational definitions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of definitions of self-management interventions and consensus meetings with self-management research experts and practitioners. RESULTS: Self-management interventions were defined as interventions that aim to equip patients with skills to actively participate and take responsibility in the management of their chronic condition in order to function optimally through at least knowledge acquisition and a combination of at least two of the following: stimulation of independent sign/symptom monitoring, medication management, enhancing problem-solving and decision-making skills for medical treatment management, and changing their physical activity, dietary, and/or smoking behavior. This definition substantially reduced the number of selected studies (255 of 750). In two preliminary expert meetings (n = 6), the proposed definition was identifiable for self-management research experts and practitioners (80% and 60% agreement, respectively).

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated illness (illness requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in death) increases with increasing age as well as presence of underlying medical conditions that have shown strong and consistent evidence, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity (1-4). Identifying and describing the prevalence of these conditions at the local level can help guide decision-making and efforts to prevent or control severe COVID-19-associated illness. Below state-level estimates, there is a lack of standardized publicly available data on underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness.

RESULTS: Because applicability depends on the specific questions and needs of the users, it is difficult to devise a valid uniform scale for rating the overall applicability of individual studies or body of evidence. We recommend consulting stakeholders to identify the factors most relevant to applicability for their decisions. Applicability should be considered separately for benefits and harms. Observational studies can help determine whether trial populations and interventions are representative of ""real world"" practice.

Robin",MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"In the United States in 2019, an estimated 16.9 million persons are living after receiving a cancer diagnosis (1). These cancer survivors face many challenges, including functional limitations, serious psychological distress (2), and other lasting and late effects of cancer treatments. Because of the high cost of cancer therapy, many cancer survivors are more likely to face substantial out-of-pocket health care expenditures and financial hardship, compared with persons without a history of cancer (3,4). Out-of-pocket expenditures and financial hardship associated with cancer have been higher among survivors aged 18-64 years than they have been among older survivors (5). To estimate annual out-of-pocket expenditures and financial hardship among cancer survivors aged 18-64 years, compared with persons without a cancer history, CDC, the American Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 2011-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).* The average annual out-of-pocket spending per person was significantly higher among cancer survivors ($1,000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = $886-$1,113) than among persons without a cancer history ($622; CI = $606-$639). Financial hardship was common; 25.3% of cancer survivors reported material hardship (e.g., problems paying medical bills), and 34.3% reported psychological hardship (e.g., worry about medical bills). These findings add to accumulating evidence documenting the financial difficulties of many cancer survivors. Mitigating the negative impact of cancer in the United States will require implementation of strategies aimed at alleviating the disproportionate financial hardship experienced by many survivors.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Two pneumococcal vaccines are currently licensed for use in adults in the United States: a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Pfizer, Inc.]) and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax 23, Merck and Co., Inc.]). In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* recommended routine use of PCV13 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years based on demonstrated PCV13 safety and efficacy against PCV13-type pneumonia among adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years (1). At that time, ACIP recognized that there would be a need to reevaluate this recommendation because it was anticipated that PCV13 use in children would continue to reduce disease burden among adults through reduced carriage and transmission of vaccine serotypes from vaccinated children (i.e., PCV13 indirect effects). On June 26, 2019, after having reviewed the evidence accrued during the preceding 3 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/PCV13.html), ACIP voted to remove the recommendation for routine PCV13 use among adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years and to recommend administration of PCV13 based on shared clinical decision-making for adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years who do not have an immunocompromising condition,(<e2><80><a0>) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, or cochlear implant, and who have not previously received PCV13. ACIP recognized that some adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years are potentially at increased risk for exposure to PCV13 serotypes, such as persons residing in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities and persons residing in settings with low pediatric PCV13 uptake or traveling to settings with no pediatric PCV13 program, and might attain higher than average benefit from PCV13 vaccination. When patients and vaccine providers(<c2><a7>) engage in shared clinical decision-making for PCV13 use to determine whether PCV13 is right for a particular person, considerations might include both the person's risk for exposure to PCV13 serotypes and their risk for developing pneumococcal disease as a result of underlying medical conditions. All adults aged <e2><89><a5>65 years should continue to receive 1 dose of PPSV23. If the decision is made to administer PCV13, it should be given at least 1 year before PPSV23. ACIP continues to recommend PCV13 in series with PPSV23 for adults aged <e2><89><a5>19 years with an immunocompromising condition, CSF leak, or cochlear implant (2).",2019,10.15585/mmwr.mm6846a5,68,46,1069-1075,eng,1545-861X 0149-2195,"United States and Humans and Aged and Advisory Committees and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. and Pneumococcal Vaccines/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,2019/11/22/,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,NA,NA,NA,NA
