Childhood evaluation of liability to substance use disorder,"Jing, Yankang and Hu, Ziheng and Fan, Peihao and Xue, Ying and Wang, Lirong and Tarter, Ralph E. and Kirisci, Levent and Wang, Junmei and Vanyukov, Michael and Xie, Xiang-Qun",Drug and alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) exacts enormous societal costs in the United States, and it is important to detect high-risk youths for prevention. Machine learning (ML) is the method to find patterns and make prediction from data. We hypothesized that ML identifies the health, psychological, psychiatric, and contextual features to predict SUD, and the identified features predict high-risk individuals to develop SUD. METHOD: Male (N<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>494) and female (N<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>206) participants and their informant parents were administered a battery of questionnaires across five waves of assessment conducted at 10-12, 12-14, 16, 19, and 22 years of age. Characteristics most strongly associated with SUD were identified using the random forest (RF)algorithm from approximately 1000 variables measured at each assessment. Next, the complement of features was validated, and the best models were selected for predicting SUD using seven ML algorithms. Lastly, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) evaluated accuracy of detecting individuals who develop SUD+/- up to thirty years of age. RESULTS: Approximately thirty variables strongly predict SUD. The predictors shift from psychological dysregulation and poor health behavior in late childhood to non-normative socialization in mid to late adolescence. In 10-12-year-old youths, the features predict SUD+/- with 74% accuracy, increasing to 86% at 22 years of age. The RF algorithm optimally detects individuals between 10-22 years of age who develop SUD compared to other ML algorithms. CONCLUSION: These findings inform the items required for inclusion in instruments to accurately identify high risk youths and young adults requiring SUD prevention.",2020,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107605,206,NA,107605,eng,1879-0046 0376-8716,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Child and Longitudinal Studies and Big data and Reproducibility of Results and Predictive Value of Tests and ROC Curve and Substance use disorder and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods and *Machine Learning and *Severity of Illness Index and Substance-Related Disorders/*diagnosis and *Psychological Techniques and Screening addiction risk and Substance abuse prevention",NA,NA,2020/01/01/,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA
Seo_2020_Joofbead,JOUR,Machine learning-based analysis of adolescent gambling factors,"Seo, Wonju and Kim, Namho and Lee, Sang-Kyu and Park, Sung-Min",Journal of behavioral addictions,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Problem gambling among adolescents has recently attracted attention because of easy access to gambling in online environments and its serious effects on adolescent lives. We proposed a machine learning-based analysis method for predicting the degree of problem gambling. METHODS: Of the 17,520 respondents in the 2018 National Survey on Youth Gambling Problems dataset (collected by the Korea Center on Gambling Problems), 5,045 students who had gambled in the past 3 months were included in this study. The Gambling Problem Severity Scale was used to provide the binary label information. After the random forest-based feature selection method, we trained four models: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extra trees (ETs), and ridge regression. RESULTS: The online gambling behavior in the past 3 months, experience of winning money or goods, and gambling of personal relationship were three factors exhibiting the high feature importance. All four models demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.7; ET showed the highest AUC (0.755), RF demonstrated the highest accuracy (71.8%), and SVM showed the highest F1 score (0.507) on a testing set. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that machine learning models can convey meaningful information to support predictions regarding the degree of problem gambling. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models trained using important features showed moderate accuracy in a large-scale Korean adolescent dataset. These findings suggest that the method will help screen adolescents at risk of problem gambling. We believe that expandable machine learning-based approaches will become more powerful as more datasets are collected.",2020,10.1556/2006.2020.00063,9,3,734-743,eng,2063-5303 2062-5871,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Health Surveys and adolescents and Severity of Illness Index and Support Vector Machine and *Machine Learning and Adolescent Behavior/*physiology and feature engineering and Gambling/*physiopathology and machine learning-based analysis method and problem gambling,NA,NA,2020/10/12/,J Behav Addict,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kalyanam_2017_Addibeha,JOUR,Exploring trends of nonmedical use of prescription drugs and polydrug abuse in the Twittersphere using unsupervised machine learning,"Kalyanam, Janani and Katsuki, Takeo and R G Lanckriet, Gert and Mackey, Tim K.",Addictive behaviors,"INTRODUCTION: Nonmedical use of prescription medications/drugs (NMUPD) is a serious public health threat, particularly in relation to the prescription opioid analgesics abuse epidemic. While attention to this problem has been growing, there remains an urgent need to develop novel strategies in the field of ""digital epidemiology"" to better identify, analyze and understand trends in NMUPD behavior. METHODS: We conducted surveillance of the popular microblogging site Twitter by collecting 11 million tweets filtered for three commonly abused prescription opioid analgesic drugs Percocet(R) (acetaminophen/oxycodone), OxyContin(R) (oxycodone), and Oxycodone. Unsupervised machine learning was applied on the subset of tweets for each analgesic drug to discover underlying latent themes regarding risk behavior. A two-step process of obtaining themes, and filtering out unwanted tweets was carried out in three subsequent rounds of machine learning. RESULTS: Using this methodology, 2.3M tweets were identified that contained content relevant to analgesic NMUPD. The underlying themes were identified for each drug and the most representative tweets of each theme were annotated for NMUPD behavioral risk factors. The primary themes identified evidence high levels of social media discussion about polydrug abuse on Twitter. This included specific mention of various polydrug combinations including use of other classes of prescription drugs, and illicit drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a methodology to filter Twitter content for NMUPD behavior, while also identifying underlying themes with minimal human intervention. Results from the study track accurately with the inclusion/exclusion criteria used to isolate NMUPD-related risk behaviors of interest and also provides insight on NMUPD behavior that has a high level of social media engagement. Results suggest that this could be a viable methodology for use in big data substance abuse surveillance, data collection, and analysis in comparison to other studies that rely upon content analysis and human coding schemes.",2017,10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.08.019,65,NA,289-295,eng,1873-6327 0306-4603,Humans and Substance abuse and Social media and Twitter and Risk Factors and Opioid-Related Disorders/*epidemiology and Social Media/*statistics & numerical data and Digital surveillance and Nonmedical use of prescription drugs and Prescription Drug Misuse/*statistics & numerical data and Prescription opioid abuse and Unsupervised Machine Learning/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Addict Behav,NA,NA,NA,NA

The newly formed institute, called the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), operates under the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The scope of the research and preventive work conducted in the Department covers alcohol, drugs, tobacco and gambling issues. The two main tasks of the Department are (i) to research, produce and disseminate information on alcohol and drugs, substance use, addictions and their social and health-related effects and (ii) to develop prevention and good practices with a view to counteracting the onset and development of alcohol and drug problems and the damaging effects of smoking and other addictions. The number of staff hovers at approximately 60 people. The Department is organized into three units, one specialized in social sciences (the Alcohol and Drug Research Unit), another in laboratory analytics (the Alcohol and Drug Analytics Unit) and the third primarily in preventive work (the Addiction Prevention Unit). These units incorporate a rich variety and long traditions of both research and preventive work. The mixture of different disciplines creates good opportunities for interdisciplinary research projects and collaboration within the Department. Also, the fact that in the same administrative context there are both researchers and people specialized in preventive work opens up interesting possibilities for combining efforts from these two branches. Nationally, the Department is a key player in all its fields of interest. It engages in a great deal of cooperation both nationally and internationally, and among its strengths are the high-quality, regularly collected long-term data sets.",2012,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03594.x,107,10,1741-1746,eng,1360-0443 0965-2140,Humans and Forecasting and Creativity and Interprofessional Relations and Finland and Biomedical Research/*organization & administration/trends and Academies and Institutes/*organization & administration/trends and Substance-Related Disorders/*prevention & control,NA,NA,2012/10//undefined,Addiction,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hu_2020_Druandalcdep,JOUR,Analysis of substance use and its outcomes by machine learning: II.

DESIGN: Boys (N<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>494) and girls (N<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>206) were recruited using a high-risk paradigm at 10-12 years of age and followed up at 12-14, 16, 19, 22, 25 and 30 years of age. MEASUREMENTS: At each visit, the subjects were administered a comprehensive battery to measure psychological makeup, health status, substance use and psychiatric disorder, and their overall harmfulness of substance consumption was quantified according to the multidimensional criteria (physical, dependence, and social) developed by Nutt et al. (2007). Next, high- and low- substance use severity trajectories were derived differentially associated with probability of segueing to substance use disorder (SUD). ML methodology was employed to predict trajectory membership. FINDINGS: The high-severity trajectory group had a higher probability of leading to SUD than the low-severity trajectory (89.0% vs 32.4%; odds ratio<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>16.88, p<e2><80><af><<e2><80><af>0.0001).

Wadekar_2020_Druandalcdep,JOUR,Understanding Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) using tree-based classifiers,"Wadekar, Adway S.",Drug and alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), defined as a physical or psychological reliance on opioids, is a public health epidemic. Identifying adults likely to develop OUD can help public health officials in planning effective intervention strategies. The aim of this paper is to develop a machine learning approach to predict adults at risk for OUD and to identify interactions between various characteristics that increase this risk. METHODS: In this approach, a data set was curated using the responses from the 2016 edition of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Using this data set, tree-based classifiers (decision tree and random forest) were trained, while employing downsampling to handle class imbalance. Predictions from the tree-based classifiers were also compared to the results from a logistic regression model. The results from the three classifiers were then interpreted synergistically to highlight individual characteristics and their interplay that pose a risk for OUD. RESULTS: Random forest predicted adults at risk for OUD with remarkable accuracy, with the average area under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve (AUC) over 0.89, even though the prevalence of OUD was only about 1 %. It showed a slight improvement over logistic regression. Logistic regression identified statistically significant characteristics, while random forest ranked the predictors in order of their contribution to OUD prediction. Early initiation of marijuana (before 18 years) emerged as the dominant predictor. Decision trees revealed that early marijuana initiation especially increased the risk if individuals: (i) were between 18-34 years of age, or (ii) had incomes less than $49,000, or (iii) were of Hispanic and White heritage, or (iv) were on probation, or (v) lived in neighborhoods with easy access to drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning can accurately predict adults at risk for OUD, and identify interactions among the factors that pronounce this risk. Curbing early initiation of marijuana may be an effective prevention strategy against opioid addiction, especially in high risk groups.",2020,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.107839,208,NA,107839,eng,1879-0046 0376-8716,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Marijuana and Prevalence and Random forest and *Decision Trees and Databases, Factual/*classification and Machine Learning/*classification/trends and Opioid Use Disorder and Opioid-Related Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/*epidemiology",NA,NA,2020/03/01/,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA

SDM acknowledges patients' role preferences in decision making processes. There has been limited research on SDM and role preferences in substance use disorders; results are promising. Aim of this study was to investigate role preferences of patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD), and to identify predictors of these preferences. METHOD: Cross-sectional data collected from June 2013 to May 2014 in four detoxification wards in Germany during a randomised controlled trial (RCT, Registration Code 01GY1114) was analysed. Of the 250 patients with AUD who were included in the RCT, data from 242 patients [65% male; mean age<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>45.2<e2><80><af>years (sd<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>10.3)] were analysed. Participants' role preferences were assessed with the Control Preference Scale. Potential correlates were drawn from instruments used in the RCT; multinomial logistic regression was used. RESULTS: 90% (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>217) of the AUD patients preferred an active or shared role in decision-making, 10% (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>25) preferred a passive role. Patients' desire for help was associated with their role preference (OR<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>3.087, p<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Patients' preference for an active role in decision-making underscores the importance of involving patients in their treatment planning. Patients' desire for help seems to be an important determinant of paternalistic decision making.

Thomas_2016_Druandalcdep,JOUR,Growth in spending on substance use disorder treatment services for the privately insured population,"Thomas, Cindy Parks and Hodgkin, Dominic and Levit, Katharine and Mark, Tami L.",Drug and alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 8% of individuals with private health insurance in the United States have substance use disorders (SUDs), but in 2009 only 0.4% of all private insurance spending was on SUDs. The objective of this study was to determine if changes that occurred between 2009 and 2012 - such as more generous SUD benefits, an epidemic of opioid use disorders, and slow recovery from a recession - were associated with greater use of SUD treatment. METHODS: Data were from the 2004-2012 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan((R)) Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. This database is representative of individuals with private insurance in the United States. Per enrollee use of and spending on SUD treatment was determined and compared with spending on all health care services. Trends were examined for inpatient care, outpatient care, and prescription medications. RESULTS: During the 2009-2012 time period, use of and spending on SUD services increased compared with all diagnoses. Two-thirds of the increase was driven by higher growth rates in outpatient use and prices. Despite the high growth rates, SUD treatment penetration rates remained low. As of 2012, only 0.6% of individuals with private insurance used SUD outpatient services, 0.2% filled SUD medication prescriptions, and 0.1% used inpatient SUD services. In 2012, SUD services accounted for less than 0.7% of all private insurance spending. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent coverage improvements, individuals with private health insurance still may not receive adequate levels of treatment for SUDs, as evidenced by the small proportion of individuals who access treatment.",2016,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.12.024,160,NA,143-150,eng,1879-0046 0376-8716,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Substance-related disorders and Hospitalization/economics and Insurance, Health/*economics and Ambulatory Care/economics and Drug Prescriptions/economics and Addiction treatment and Health expenditures and Health Expenditures/*trends and Mental Health Services/economics and Private Sector/*economics and Substance Abuse Treatment Centers/economics and Substance-Related Disorders/*economics/therapy",NA,NA,2016/03/01/,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study tested how cocaine moderates HIV-related neural activation during an intertemporal decision-making task. METHODS: The sample included 73 participants who differed on cocaine and HIV status (18 COC+/HIV+, 19 COC+/HIV-, 19 COC-/HIV+, 17 COC-/HIV-). Participants made choices between smaller, sooner and larger, delayed rewards while undergoing functional MRI. Choices varied in difficulty based on subjective value: hard (equivalently valued), easy (disparately valued), and control choices. A mixed-effects model controlling for education and smoking identified main and interactive effects of HIV and COC during hard relative to easy choices (difficulty contrast). RESULTS: COC+ status was associated with lower activation in bilateral frontal gyri and right insular and posterior parietal cortices. HIV+ status was associated with higher activation in the visual cortex, but lower activation in bilateral prefrontal cortices and cerebellum and left posterior parietal cortex. COC moderated the effects of HIV in several clusters centered in the bilateral prefrontal cortices and cerebellum. In post-hoc analyses, there were significant effects of HIV status on activation for COC+, but not COC-, participants; interaction effects remained after controlling for polysubstance use. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use may diminish the compensatory neural activation often seen among HIV+ samples during decision making.

This review aims to describe the current landscape, effectiveness and usability of connected interventions for SUD. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify articles evaluating connected health interventions for SUD in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, IEEE, and Scopus) were searched over a five-year period. Included articles described a connected health intervention targeting SUD and provided outcomes data. Data were extracted using a standardized reporting tool. RESULTS: A total of 1676 unique articles were identified during the initial search, with 32 articles included in the final analysis. Seven articles of the 32 were derived from two large studies. The most commonly studied SUD was alcohol use disorder. Sixteen articles reported at least one statistically significant result with respect to reduced craving and/or substance use. The majority of articles used ecological momentary assessment to trigger interventions, while four used biologic/physiologic data. Two articles used a wearable device. Common intervention types included craving management, coping assistance, and tailored feedback. Twenty-three articles measured usability factors, and acceptability was generally reported as high.

Boslett_2020_Addi.AbiEngl,JOUR,Using contributing causes of death improves prediction of opioid involvement in unclassified drug overdoses in US death records,"Boslett, Andrew J. and Denham, Alina and Hill, Elaine L.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A substantial share of fatal drug overdoses is missing information on specific drug involvement, leading to under-reporting of opioid-related death rates and a misrepresentation of the extent of the opioid epidemic. We aimed to compare methodological approaches to predicting opioid involvement in unclassified drug overdoses in US death records and to estimate the number of fatal opioid overdoses from 1999 to 2016 using the best-performing method. DESIGN: This was a secondary data analysis of the universe of drug overdoses in 1999-2016 obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics Detailed Multiple Cause of Death records. SETTING: United States. CASES: A total of 632 331 drug overdose decedents. Drug overdoses with known drug classification comprised 78.2% of the cases (n = 494 316) and unclassified drug overdoses (ICD-10 T50.9) comprised 21.8% (n = 138 015). MEASUREMENTS: Known opioid involvement was defined using ICD-10 codes T40.0-40.4 and T40.6, recorded in the set of contributing causes. Opioid involvement in unclassified drug overdoses was predicted using multiple methodological approaches: logistic regression and machine learning techniques, inclusion/exclusion of contributing causes of death and inclusion/exclusion of county-level characteristics. Having selected the model with the highest predictive ability, we calculated corrected estimates of opioid-related mortality. FINDINGS: Logistic regression and random forest models performed similarly. Including contributing causes substantially improved predictive accuracy, while including county characteristics did not. Using a superior prediction model, we found that 71.8% of unclassified drug overdoses in 1999-2016 involved opioids, translating into 99 160 additional opioid-related deaths, or approximately 28% more than reported. Importantly, there was a striking geographic variation in undercounting of opioid overdoses.

Community-tailored dashboards are central to the CTH intervention's mandate to implement a community-engaged and data-driven process. These dashboards support a participating community's decision-making for selection and monitoring of evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. METHODS/DESIGN: A community-tailored dashboard is a web-based set of interactive data visualizations of community-specific metrics. Metrics include opioid overdose deaths and other OUD-related measures, as well as drivers of change of these outcomes in a community. Each community-tailored dashboard is a product of a co-creation process between HCS researchers and stakeholders from each community. The four research sites used a varied set of technical approaches and solutions to support the scientific design and CTH intervention implementation. Ongoing evaluation of the dashboards involves quantitative and qualitative data on key aspects posited to shape dashboard use combined with website analytics. DISCUSSION: The HCS presents an opportunity to advance how community-tailored dashboards can foster community-driven solutions to address the opioid epidemic. Lessons learned can be applied to inform interventions for public health concerns and issues that have disproportionate impact across communities and populations (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities and other marginalized individuals).

H. and Chander, Geetanjali",Drug and alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder is a highly prevalent disease with multiple medications available for treatment. The overall prevalence of patients receiving pharmacotherapy is believed to be low and the characteristics and comorbidities that affect receipt are not well-established. METHODS: We created a dataset from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database of patients with an outpatient encounter for alcohol abuse or dependence in 2014. We subsequently identified patient characteristics, comorbid medical, psychiatric, or substance use disorders, as well as encounter provider specialties and, using multivariable logistic regression, assessed which variables correlated with increased or decreased receipt of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder for this population. RESULTS: In our dataset of 123,355 patients, patient receipt of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder was 3.3 %, and 9.3 % when restricted to the former diagnosis of alcohol dependence only. Male sex, younger age, alcohol-related liver disease, and cannabis use disorders correlated with decreased receipt whereas comorbid major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders correlated with increased receipt. Compared to patients seen by psychiatrists, those seen by primary medical doctors had a lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder is an underutilized treatment modality with a low prevalence of prescription in insured individuals.

The main aim of our study was to provide empirical evidence on the psychometric performance of self-reports currently used. Our research questions were: compared with a gold standard clinical interview, how accurate are (1) self-reported AUD, (2) self-reported alcohol use over time and (3) biomarkers of alcohol use among Swiss men? Finally, we aimed to identify an alternative screening tool. DESIGN: A single-center study with a cross-sectional design and a stratified sample selection. SETTING: Lausanne University Hospital (Switzerland) from October 2017 to June 2018. PARTICIPANTS: We selected participants from the French-speaking participants of the ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use and Risk Factors (n = 233). The sample included young men aged on average 27.0 years. MEASUREMENTS: We used the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies as the gold standard for DSM-5 AUD. The self-reported measures included 11 criteria for AUD, nine alcohol-related consequences, and previous 12 months' alcohol use. We also assessed biomarkers of chronic excessive drinking (ethyl glucuronide and phosphatidylethanol). FINDINGS: None of the self-reported measures/biomarkers taken alone displayed both sensitivity and specificity close to 100% with respect to the gold standard (e.g. self-reported AUD: sensitivity = 92.3%, specificity = 45.8%). The best model combined eight self-reported criteria of AUD and four alcohol-related consequences. Using a cut-off of three, this screening tool yielded acceptable sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (78.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Neither self-reported alcohol use disorder nor heavy alcohol use appear to be adequate to screen for alcohol use disorder among young men from the Swiss population. The best screening alternative for alcohol use disorder among young Swiss men appears to be a combination of eight symptoms of alcohol use disorder and four alcohol-related consequences.",2020,10.1111/add.14864,115,3,426-436,eng,1360-0443 0965-2140,machine learning and epidemiology and Humans and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Machine Learning and psychometrics and Sensitivity and Specificity and Cohort Studies and public health and Alcohol and Psychometrics and ROC Curve and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and Mass Screening/*methods and Switzerland/epidemiology and Biomarkers/chemistry and Alcoholism/*diagnosis and community-based sample and Self Report/standards,NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Addiction,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mpofu_2021_Addibeha,JOUR,Trending the evidence on opioid use disorder (OUD) continuum of care among rural American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) tribes: A systematic scoping review,"Mpofu, Elias and Ingman, Stanley and Matthews-Juarez, Patricia and Rivera-Torres, Solymar and Juarez, Paul D.",Addictive behaviors,"BACKGROUND: American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) communities are second only to White Americans in mortality from opioid use disorder (OUD), while the smallest racial/ethnic minority population group in the USA. Those in rural communities experience significant health care disparities, including poorer treatment access for substance use disorder. This systematic scoping review aimed to trend the emerging evidence on opioid use disorder (OUD) management among rural AI/AN communities as well as workforce training needs. METHOD: We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, SSCI, and Digital theses databases for empirical study publications on OUD management among AI/AN rural communities across the continuum of prevention, treatment and care. Eight studies met the following criteria: (a) focused on OUD; (b) sampled rural AI/AN members; (c) investigated prevention, treatment and/or care perspectives and/or practices or health provider preparation; and (d) published during the period 2009-2020. Included studies met the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) quality control standards. FINDINGS: Six of eight of the studies (75%) were surveys with community members and other stakeholders on OUD management within rural AI/AN communities rather than active interventions within this population. Moreover, five of eight of the studies (63%) reported a preference for culturally grounded health and wellness interventions with rural AI/AN, involving families, and community interventionists, utilizing community reinforcement approaches. Three of eight studies (37.5%) reported need for the cultural adaption of medication-assisted treatments (MAT) and use of culturally informed recovery care approaches. One of eight studies (12.5%) proposed to use culturally adapted contingency management behavioral approaches for OUD treatment and recovery care. CONCLUSION: The evidence is trending to endorse culturally adapted OUD management with rural AI/AN communities, prioritizing prevention education, and use of MAT with cultural adaptation and whole person approaches to sustainable recovery care.

Trivedi_2007_Druandalcdep,JOUR,Measurement-based care for refractory depression: a clinical decision support model for clinical research and practice,"Trivedi, Madhukar H. and Daly, Ella J.",Drug and alcohol dependence,"Despite years of antidepressant drug development and patient and provider education, suboptimal medication dosing and duration of exposure resulting in incomplete remission of symptoms remains the norm in the treatment of depression. Additionally, since no one treatment is effective for all patients, optimal implementation focusing on the measurement of symptoms, side effects, and function is essential to determine effective sequential treatment approaches. There is a need for a paradigm shift in how clinical decision making is incorporated into clinical practice and for a move away from the trial-and-error approach that currently determines the ""next best"" treatment. This paper describes how our experience with the Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial has confirmed the need for easy-to-use clinical support systems to ensure fidelity to guidelines. To further enhance guideline fidelity, we have developed an electronic decision support system that provides critical feedback and guidance at the point of patient care. We believe that a measurement-based care (MBC) approach is essential to any decision support system, allowing physicians to individualize and adapt decisions about patient care based on symptom progress, tolerability of medication, and dose optimization. We also believe that successful integration of sequential algorithms with MBC into real-world clinics will facilitate change that will endure and improve patient outcomes. Although we use major depression to illustrate our approach, the issues addressed are applicable to other chronic psychiatric conditions including comorbid depression and substance use disorder as well as other medical illnesses.",2007,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2007.01.007,88 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,71-S61,eng,0376-8716 1879-0046,"Humans and Female and Male and Algorithms and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and *Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and Mental Health Services/*organization & administration and Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy and Drug Therapy/methods",NA,NA,2007/05//undefined,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA
Richter_2015_Addi.AbiEngl,JOUR,It's time to change the default for tobacco treatment,"Richter, Kimber P. and Ellerbeck, Edward F.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","The World Health Organization estimates that 1 billion people will die from tobacco-related illnesses this century. Most health-care providers, however, fail to treat tobacco dependence. This may be due in part to the treatment 'default'. Guidelines in many countries recommend that health-care providers: (i) ask patients if they are 'ready' to quit using tobacco; and (ii) provide treatment only to those who state they are ready to quit. For other health conditions--diabetes, hypertension, asthma and even substance abuse--treatment guidelines direct health-care providers to identify the health condition and initiate evidence-based treatment. As with any medical care, patients are free to decline--they can 'opt out' from care. If patients do nothing, they will receive care. For tobacco users, however, the treatment default is often that they have to 'opt in' to treatment. This drastically limits the reach of tobacco treatment because, at any given encounter, a minority of tobacco users will say they are ready to quit. As a result, few are offered treatment. It is time to change the treatment default for tobacco dependence. All tobacco users should be offered evidence-based care, without being screened for readiness as a precondition for receiving treatment. Opt-out care for tobacco dependence is warranted because changing defaults has been shown to change choices and outcomes for numerous health behaviors, and most tobacco users want to quit; there is little to no evidence supporting the utility of assessing readiness to quit, and an opt-out default is more ethical.",2015,10.1111/add.12734,110,3,381-386,eng,1360-0443 0965-2140,"Access and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Decision Making and Motivation and motivation and health services and Practice Guidelines as Topic and evaluation and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Ethics, Medical and Standard of Care and smoking cessation and practice guidelines and evidence-based practice and Smoking Cessation/*methods and Choice Behavior/*ethics and harm reduction and health care quality and Smoking/psychology/*therapy and tobacco use disorder and Tobacco Use Disorder/psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,Addiction,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHOD: This analysis compared two control groups of RCTs targeting unhealthy alcohol consumption: one outpatient sample (GP; n=99) with one inpatient sample (GH; n=173). Both groups were recruited via systematic screening of all patients aged between 18 and 64 years and were included in the studies if drank above the at-risk criteria of the British Medical Association (20/30 g alcohol/daily) and/or fulfilled criteria of alcohol abuse or - dependence according to DSM-IV. Both samples received a non-alcohol specific brochure on healthy living after study inclusion and were re-assessed 12 months later. RESULTS: GH patients were significantly older, included of more males, had received less schooling and had a higher readiness to change at baseline than GP patients. Groups did not differ concerning alcohol-related diagnoses or smoking status. At the 12-month follow-up, significantly more GH patients revealed abstinence or drinking below the inclusion criteria (50.0% vs. 26.1%, p<.001). In a multivariate analysis, medical setting (GH vs. GP) remained a significant predictor for non-problematic drinking or abstinence even after controlling for baseline differences between groups.

There is scarce knowledge of the demographic variables and specific internet activities associated with PIU and a limited understanding of how PIU should be conceptualized. Our aim was to identify specific internet activities associated with PIU and explore the moderating role of age and gender in those associations. METHODS: We recruited 1749 participants aged 18 and above via media advertisements in an Internet-based survey at two sites, one in the US, and one in South Africa; we utilized Lasso regression for the analysis. RESULTS: Specific internet activities were associated with higher problematic internet use scores, including general surfing (lasso <ce><b2>: 2.1), internet gaming (<ce><b2>: 0.6), online shopping (<ce><b2>: 1.4), use of online auction websites (<ce><b2>: 0.027), social networking (<ce><b2>: 0.46) and use of online pornography (<ce><b2>: 1.0). Age moderated the relationship between PIU and role-playing-games (<ce><b2>: 0.33), online gambling (<ce><b2>: 0.15), use of auction websites (<ce><b2>: 0.35) and streaming media (<ce><b2>: 0.35), with older age associated with higher levels of PIU. There was inconclusive evidence for gender and gender<e2><80><af>*<e2><80><af>internet activities being associated with problematic internet use scores.

To explore the additive interaction of patient-based characteristics that may help to inform treatment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment of neurocognitive function, substance use, and psychiatric characteristics of adults seeking buprenorphine treatment within substance use treatment centers in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight opioid-dependent adults seeking buprenorphine treatment. MEASUREMENTS: A comprehensive battery, which included measures of executive functioning, learning, memory, verbal fluency, attention, processing speed, and motor functioning were administered. The Wide Range Achievement Test-Third Edition, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, and an audio computer assisted structured interview were also completed. Correlations and independent sample t-tests were used to ascertain group differences. FINDINGS: Thirty-nine percent of participants were impaired in global neurocognitive function (n=15). Over one third were impaired in either: learning (n=28), memory (n=26), executive functioning (n=17), motor functioning (n=17), attention/working memory (n=14) or verbal fluency (n=12). Lifetime history of alcohol dependence was associated with impairment in global neurocognitive, executive functioning, and motor functioning. Lifetime history of cocaine dependence was associated with impairment in executive functioning and motor functioning (all p's<0.05). Major depressive disorder history was not associated with neurocognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Among this sample of opioid-dependent adults, there were high rates of global and domain-specific neurocognitive impairment, with severe impairment in learning and memory.

PDMPs enable registered prescribers to obtain real-time information on patients' prescription history to reduce non-medical use of controlled drugs. This study examined whether PDMP implementation and different levels of PDMP requirements were associated with physicians' patterns of prescribing opioid analgesics for patients with non-cancer chronic pain. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis study using cross-sectional national data. Patients with non-cancer chronic pain from the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were included (weighted N=81,018,131; unweighted N=3295). Heckman two-step selection procedure employing two logistic regressions was used to explore the associations between PDMP requirements and physicians' prescribing behaviors, controlling for physician characteristics, patient characteristics, physician-healthcare system interaction, and physician-patient relationship, guided by the Eisenberg's model of physician decision making. RESULTS: State PDMP implementation status and requirement levels were not associated with physician opioid prescribing for non-cancer chronic pain treatment (p's ranged 0.30-0.32). Patients with Medicare coverage were more likely to be prescribed opioid analgesics than those with private health insurance (OR=1.55, p<0.01). Hispanic patients were less likely to be prescribed opioid analgesics than non-Hispanic white patients (OR=0.61, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that the effectiveness of PDMPs on physicians' opioid prescribing tendency for non-cancer chronic pain treatment could not be supported.

The current study uses conjoint analysis to examine the importance of current dose, visit frequency, clinical indicators, and payment type on office visit and dose adjustments during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment. METHODS: A national random sample of 776 US buprenorphine-prescribing physicians participated in a mailed survey between October 2015 and July 2018. The survey contained 16 patient vignettes describing: (1) current dose, (2) urine drug test (UDT) results and opioid blockade, (3) recent intravenous use, (4) visit attendance, (5) counseling adherence, (6) payment, and (7) visit schedule. Physicians rated how they would adjust office visits (0=definitely decrease to 5=no change to 10=definitely increase) and the dose (0=definitely decrease to 5=no change to 10=definitely increase). Descriptive statistics were calculated for the vignette responses. Conjoint analysis was used to estimate relative importance scores and part-worth utilities. RESULTS: Across the vignettes, the mean response for adjusting office visits was 7.43 (SD<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>1.69), indicating a tendency to increase the frequency of visits. UDT results/opioid blockade, intravenous use, and current visit schedule had the greatest importance scores for office visit adjustments. The mean response for adjusting the dose was 5.48 (SD<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>1.69), corresponding with a tendency toward not changing dose. Current dose, UDT results/opioid blockade, and intravenous use had the largest importance scores for dose adjustment.

Adolescents receive opioid prescriptions with frequency, but are susceptible to a constellation of unique risks in the context of pain management. This empirical study presents the first cohort of adolescents recruited from ambulatory medical care within 72 h of their receipt of opioids to treat acute pain. The primary aim was to capture a time-sensitive report of the intersection of prescription opioid receipt and contextual risks for opioid misuse related to pain experience, mental health symptoms, and substance use at the adolescent and parental levels. Data were collected from 70 14-19-year-old adolescents and their accompanying parent. Results reflected that 90% of this sample of adolescents reported 2 or more risks and 35% reported 5 or more risks for future opioid misuse. Pain catastrophizing (46%) and alcohol use (40%) and were the most common adolescent-level risk factors; mother history of chronic pain (32%) and parent anxiety (21%) were the most common parent-level risk factors. Past-week parent pain intensity showed the strongest association with adolescent past-week pain intensity; neither was associated with adolescent OUD symptoms. Adolescent pain catastrophizing most reliably predicted OUD symptoms; parent pain interference was also associated. Seventy-one percent of parents reported keeping opioids at home, a relevant risk factor for future misuse.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions that train physicians and/or pharmacists to counsel their patients on smoking-cessation techniques. METHODS: Using decision-analytic modeling, we compared four strategies for smoking-cessation counseling education: training only physicians, training only pharmacists, training both physicians and pharmacists (synergy strategy), and training neither physicians nor pharmacists (i.e., no specialized training, which is the usual practice). Short-term outcomes were based on results from a clinical trial conducted in 16 communities across the Houston area; long-term outcomes were calculated from epidemiological data. Short-term outcomes were measured using the cost per quit, and long-term outcomes were measured using the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Cost data were taken from institutional sources; both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Training both physicians and pharmacists added 0.09 QALY for 45-year-old men. However, for 45-year-old women, the discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy only increased by 0.01 QALY when comparing the synergy strategy to no intervention. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the synergy strategy with respect to the non-intervention strategy was US$868/QALY for 45-year-old men and US$8953/QALY for 45-year-old women.

RESULTS: A school naloxone program likely costs less than CAD$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained if the overdose frequency is at least once each year and it reduces opioid poisoning mortality by at least 40% (from 10% to <6.0%) or if the overdose frequency is at least two per year and the program reduces mortality by at least 20% (from 10% to <8.0%). The results are sensitive to the intensity and cost of staff training, the lifetime costs and life-expectancy of overdose survivors, and the probability of an overdose being fatal in the absence of a school naloxone program. CONCLUSIONS: School naloxone programs are relatively inexpensive, but that does not ensure that they are a cost-effective use of resources. While potentially cost-effective, if the risk of an overdose in a Toronto high school is low, then other programs aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of students may be better use of limited resources.",2018,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.08.003,192,NA,352-361,eng,1879-0046 0376-8716,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Cost effectiveness analysis and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and Students/psychology and Naloxone and Opioid overdose and Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods and Decision Making/physiology and Drug Overdose/*drug therapy/*economics/psychology and Naloxone/*economics/therapeutic use and Narcotic Antagonists/*economics/therapeutic use and Opioid poisoning and Schools/*economics,NA,NA,2018/11/01/,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA
Thompson_2021_Druandalcdep,JOUR,Development and Validation of a Prediction Model of Prescription Tranquilizer Misuse Based on a Nationally Representative United States Sample,"Thompson, C. L. and Alcover, Karl and Yip, Sarah W.",Drug and alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Prescription tranquilizer misuse is a risky behavior associated with fatal drug poisonings. Although various predictors have been examined, there is no published prediction model for tranquilizer misuse. This study develops and internally validates a tranquilizer misuse prediction model based primarily on drug histories of participants in a national cross-sectional survey. Predictors also include psychiatric, behavioral and demographic variables. METHODS: We analyzed data from 471,097 individuals aged 14-to-29-years in the United States, as sampled by the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, 2004-2018, an annual cross-sectional survey. We encoded 21 predictors with known or likely onset prior to tranquilizer misuse initiation, (e.g., early onset of cannabis use). With this dataset, we trained a neural network and regularized logistic regression model. While the assessment for tranquilizer misuse changed slightly in 2015, by pooling all years of survey data, predictions are robust to this source of variation. RESULTS: 1.44% of the pooled sample, 2004-2018, recently initiated tranquilizer misuse (unweighted estimate). On held-out test data (n = 43,714), logistic regression and the neural network performed equally well, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of <e2><88><bc>0.83 on the primary model, containing 12 variables known to occur before tranquilizer misuse. CONCLUSION: Built for case prediction rather than case detection, this model restricted predictors to those with known timing prior to initiation of tranquilizer misuse. Yet its performance supersedes commonly accepted criteria for clinical prediction models (AUC > 0.80). Future work should incorporate survey analysis weights into the prediction model to minimize possible bias.",2021,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108344,218,NA,108344,eng,1879-0046 0376-8716,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Prescriptions and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Logistic Models and Surveys and Questionnaires and Machine Learning and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and Benzodiazepines and Hypnotics and Sedatives and Risk-Taking and United States/epidemiology and Prescription Drug Misuse/*statistics & numerical data and *Tranquilizing Agents and Drug Dependence and Extra-Medical and Muscle Relaxants and Nonmedical Use and Substance-Related Disorders/diagnosis and Xanax,NA,NA,2021/01/01/,Drug Alcohol Depend,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wu_2018_Addi.AbiEngl,JOUR,Cost-effectiveness of personal tailored risk information and taster sessions to increase the uptake of the NHS stop smoking services: the Start2quit randomized controlled trial,"Wu, Qi and Gilbert, Hazel and Nazareth, Irwin and Sutton, Stephen and Morris, Richard and Petersen, Irene and Galton, Simon and Parrott, Steve","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a two-component intervention designed to increase attendance at the NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) in England. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial (Start2quit). SETTING: NHS SSS and general practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 4384 smokers aged 16 years or more identified from medical records in 99 participating practices, who were motivated to quit and had not attended the SSS in the previous 12 months. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention was a personalized and tailored letter sent from the general practitioner (GP) and a personal invitation and appointment to attend a taster session providing information about SSS. Control was a standard generic letter from the GP advertising SSS and asking smokers to contact the service to make an appointment. MEASUREMENTS: Costs measured from an NHS/personal social services perspective, estimated health gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) measured with EQ-5D and incremental cost per QALY gained during both 6 months and a life-time horizon. FINDINGS: During the trial period, the adjusted mean difference in costs was <c2><a3>92 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -<c2><a3>32 to -<c2><a3>216) and the adjusted mean difference in QALY gains was 0.002 (95% CI = -0.001 to 0.004). This generates an incremental cost per QALY gained of <c2><a3>59 401. The probability that the tailored letter and taster session is more cost-effective than the generic letter at 6 months is never above 50%. In contrast, the discounted life-time health-care cost was lower in the intervention group, while the life-time QALY gains were significantly higher. The probability that the intervention is more cost-effective is more than 83% using a <c2><a3>20 000-30 000 per QALY-gained decision-making threshold. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention designed to increase attendance at the NHS Stop Smoking Services (tailored letter and taster session in the services) appears less likely to be cost-effective than a generic letter in the short term, but is likely to become more cost-effective than the generic letter during the long term.",2018,10.1111/add.14086,113,4,708-718,eng,1360-0443 0965-2140,Risk and England and Humans and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Cost-effectiveness and United Kingdom and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and General Practitioners and *Patient Selection and smoking cessation and State Medicine and *Smoking Cessation and randomized controlled trial and Patient Education as Topic/economics/*methods and personal tailored risk information and Smoking/*therapy and stop smoking services and uptake of service,NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,Addiction,NA,NA,NA,NA
