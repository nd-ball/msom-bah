Nwachukwu_2020_ThAmjoofspme,JOUR,Application of Machine Learning for Predicting Clinically Meaningful Outcome After Arthroscopic Femoroacetabular Impingement Surgery,"Nwachukwu, Benedict U. and Beck, Edward C. and Lee, Elaine K. and Cancienne, Jourdan M. and Waterman, Brian R. and Paul, Katlynn and Nho, Shane J.",The American journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroscopy has become an important tool for surgical treatment of intra-articular hip pathology. Predictive models for clinically meaningful outcomes in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) are unknown. PURPOSE: To apply a machine learning model to determine preoperative variables predictive for achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) at 2 years after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were analyzed for patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for FAIS by a high-volume fellowship-trained surgeon between January 2012 and July 2016. The MCID cutoffs for the Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), HOS-Sport Specific (HOS-SS), and modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) were 9.8, 14.4, and 9.14, respectively. Predictive models for achieving the MCID with respect to each were built with the LASSO algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for feature selection, followed by logistic regression on the selected features. Study data were analyzed with PatientIQ, a cloud-based research and analytics platform for health care. RESULTS: Of 1103 patients who met inclusion criteria, 898 (81.4%) had a minimum of 2-year reported outcomes and were entered into the modeling algorithm. A total of 74.0%, 73.5%, and 79.9% met the HOS-ADL, HOS-SS, and mHHS threshold scores for achieving the MCID. Predictors of not achieving the HOS-ADL MCID included anxiety/depression, symptom duration for >2 years before surgery, higher body mass index, high preoperative HOS-ADL score, and preoperative hip injection (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the HOS-SS MCID included anxiety/depression, preoperative symptom duration for >2 years, high preoperative HOS-SS score, and preoperative hip injection, while running at least at the recreational level was a predictor of achieving HOS-SS MCID (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the mHHS MCID included history of anxiety or depression, high preoperative mHHS score, and hip injections, while being female was predictive of achieving the MCID (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study identified predictive variables for achieving clinically meaningful outcome after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. Patient factors including anxiety/depression, symptom duration >2 years, preoperative intra-articular injection, and high preoperative outcome scores are most consistently predictive of inability to achieve clinically meaningful outcome. These findings have important implications for shared decision-making algorithms and management of preoperative expectations after hip arthroscopy for FAI.",2020,10.1177/0363546519892905,48,2,415-423,eng,1552-3365 0363-5465,predictive modeling and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Case-Control Studies and Treatment Outcome and Body Mass Index and Activities of Daily Living and *Machine Learning and Arthroscopy/*methods and Femoracetabular Impingement/*surgery and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and Hip Joint/*surgery and Hip Outcome Score and MCID and Minimal Clinically Important Difference and modified Hip Harris Score and PatientIQ,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Am J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

High-quality studies with long-term follow-up are lacking, and evidence to support decision making is limited. PURPOSE: To evaluate functional and patient-reported outcome, surgical history, and complications among young adults who sustained an ACL injury before the age of 13 years and were treated with active rehabilitation and the option of delayed ACL reconstruction if needed. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Forty-six children aged <13 years with a total intrasubstance ACL injury were included. None of these patients had additional injuries that warranted early surgery. At final follow-up at a mean 8 years after the time of injury, 44 patients remained in the study. The same test battery was conducted at baseline, 1 and 2 years, and final follow-up at approximately 18 years of age. The test battery included functional tests (hop tests and isokinetic muscle strength tests of quadriceps and hamstrings), patient-reported outcome measures (including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form), and clinical examination. Medical records were reviewed to assess surgical history and complications. RESULTS: At a mean 8 years of follow-up, 24 patients (55%) had undergone ACL reconstruction, and 16 (36%) had undergone meniscal surgery. Quadriceps muscle strength symmetry was >90% for 30 patients (68%). Mean leg symmetry indexes for hop and strength tests were consistently >90%, except for the single-hop test and hamstrings muscle strength for ACL-reconstructed knees. Mean <c2><b1> SD International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 86.3 <c2><b1> 13.7 for the ACL-reconstructed knees and 90.6 <c2><b1> 11.8 for the nonreconstructed knees. At final follow-up, forty patients (91%) remained active in sports, but 29 (66%) restricted their activity level to nonpivoting sports. CONCLUSION: Active rehabilitation may have a role in treatment of children with ACL injury. Approximately 50% of children may cope well, even to adulthood, without a surgical intervention. The other half may develop instability that warrants ACL reconstruction, and one-third may require meniscal surgery.",2019,10.1177/0363546518810750,47,1,22-30,eng,1552-3365 0363-5465,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and children and Exercise and Prospective Studies and Follow-Up Studies and Postoperative Complications and Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *Adaptation, Psychological and *Muscle Strength and ACL and ACL reconstruction and active rehabilitation and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries/*rehabilitation/*surgery and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction/adverse effects and Athletic Injuries/rehabilitation/surgery and Knee Injuries/rehabilitation/surgery and Knee Joint/surgery and Quadriceps Muscle/physiology",NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,Am J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Colosimo, Angelo and Hewett, Timothy E.",The American journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND: Release for full activity and return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often dictated by time from surgery and subjective opinion by the medical team. Temporal guidelines for return to sport may not accurately identify impaired strength and neuromuscular control, which are associated with increased risk for second injury (contralateral and/or ipsilateral limb) after ACLR in athletes. HYPOTHESES: Athletes undergoing ACLR and returning to sport would demonstrate functional deficits that would not be associated with time from surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Thirty-three male (n = 10) and female (n = 23) athletes with unilateral ACLR, who were cleared by a physician to return to their sport after surgery and rehabilitation, performed the single-legged vertical hop test for 10 seconds on a portable force plate. Matched teammates of each patient were recruited to serve as sex-, sport-, and age-matched controls (CTRL; n = 67). Maximum vertical ground-reaction force (VGRF) was measured during each single-limb landing. Single-limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated as the ratio of the involved divided by uninvolved limb, expressed as a percentage. RESULTS: The single-limb vertical jump height LSI was reduced in the ACLR group, 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83%-95%), compared with the matched CTRL group, 101% (95% CI, 96%-105%; P < .01). The LSI for VGRF normalized to potential energy achieved during flight of the hop was increased in ACLR at 112% (95% CI, 106%-117%) relative to the CTRL group at 102% (95% CI, 98%-106%; P < .01). Linear regression analysis indicated that time from surgery was not associated with limb symmetry deficits in the ACLR group (P > .05; R (2) = .002-.01). CONCLUSION: Deficits in unilateral force development (vertical jump height) and absorption (normalized VGRF) persist in an athlete's single-limb performance after ACLR and full return to sports. These symmetry deficits appear to be independent of time after reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of these results, clinicians should consider assessment of single-limb power performance in the decision-making process for return-to-sport release. Persistent side-to-side asymmetries may increase the risk of contralateral and/or ipsilateral injury.",2012,10.1177/0363546512454656,40,10,2256-2263,eng,1552-3365 0363-5465,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Time Factors and Recovery of Function and *Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and *Athletic Performance and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries and Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*surgery and Athletic Injuries/*rehabilitation/surgery and Knee Injuries/*rehabilitation/surgery,NA,NA,2012/10//undefined,Am J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The field of exercise genomics has also advanced by incorporating these innovative technologies. There is therefore an urgent need for guiding references for sport and exercise genomics to allow the necessary advancements in this field of sport and exercise medicine, while protecting athletes from any invasion of privacy and misuse of their genomic information. Here, we update a previous consensus and develop a guiding reference for sport and exercise genomics based on a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis.

However accurately identifying travel mode in large datasets is problematic. Here we provide an open source tool to quantify time spent stationary and in four travel modes(walking, cycling, train, motorised vehicle) from accelerometer measured physical activity data, combined with GPS and GIS data. METHODS: The Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London study evaluates the effect of the built environment on health behaviours, including physical activity. Participants wore accelerometers and GPS receivers on the hip for 7 days. We time-matched accelerometer and GPS, and then extracted data from the commutes of 326 adult participants, using stated commute times and modes, which were manually checked to confirm stated travel mode. This yielded examples of five travel modes: walking, cycling, motorised vehicle, train and stationary. We used this example data to train a gradient boosted tree, a form of supervised machine learning algorithm, on each data point (131,537 points), rather than on journeys. Accuracy during training was assessed using five-fold cross-validation. We also manually identified the travel behaviour of both 21 participants from ENABLE London (402,749 points), and 10 participants from a separate study (STAMP-2, 210,936 points), who were not included in the training data. We compared our predictions against this manual identification to further test accuracy and test generalisability. RESULTS: Applying the algorithm, we correctly identified travel mode 97.3% of the time in cross-validation (mean sensitivity 96.3%, mean active travel sensitivity 94.6%). We showed 96.0% agreement between manual identification and prediction of 21 individuals' travel modes (mean sensitivity 92.3%, mean active travel sensitivity 84.9%) and 96.5% agreement between the STAMP-2 study and predictions (mean sensitivity 85.5%, mean active travel sensitivity 78.9%). CONCLUSION: We present a generalizable tool that identifies time spent stationary and time spent walking with very high precision, time spent in trains or vehicles with good precision, and time spent cycling with moderate precisionIn studies where both accelerometer and GPS data are available this tool complements analyses of physical activity, showing whether differences in PA may be explained by differences in travel mode.

The experts reached consensus on the following criteria to support the RTP decision: medical staff clearance, absence of pain on palpation, absence of pain during strength and flexibility testing, absence of pain during/after functional testing, similar hamstring flexibility, performance on field testing, and psychological readiness. It was also agreed that RTP decisions should be based on shared decision-making, primarily via consultation with the athlete, sports physician, physiotherapist, fitness trainer and team coach.

METHODS: The retail analytics firm, Dunnhumby, provided secondary retail data containing grocery transactions, targeted coupon exposures, and coupon use for 2500 households over 2-years. The USDA Quarterly At-Home Food Purchasing Database was used to categorize individual foods into 52 categories and combined into 12 food groups. Mixed effects linear models estimated the difference-in-difference effects of coupon exposure on category-level purchase rate/wk. pre- and post-campaign; models also tested effect modification by food category. RESULTS: Category-level food purchases significantly increased post-campaign. Mean (SD) food purchases/wk. Among exposed households (17.34 (13.08) units/wk) vs. unexposed households (3.75 (4.59) units/wk) were higher (p < 0.001). Difference-in-difference effects of coupon exposure showed a higher increase in purchase rate among exposed vs. unexposed households (5.73 vs. 0.67, p < 0.001). Food category significantly modified the association between coupon exposure and coupon campaign. Category-level purchase rate among exposed vs. unexposed households was relatively higher in less healthful (e.g. convenience foods) vs. more healthful categories (e.g. nuts) with a 1.17 unit/wk. increase in convenience foods purchase (p < 0.001) vs. a 0.03 unit/wk. increase in nuts (p < 0.001). Exploratory analyses suggested that price elasticity of food categories for targeted coupons (1.02-2.81) was higher than previous estimates for untargeted coupons. CONCLUSION: Across food categories, coupon exposure increased category-level purchase rate, with a relatively larger effect size for less healthful than more healthful categories. Promising results from this preliminary study suggest that experimental research is warranted to determine whether targeting with the explicit purpose of improving dietary quality can more effectively influence diet, and whether it can do so more cost effectively.",2018,10.1186/s12966-018-0744-7,15,1,111,eng,1479-5868,"Intervention and Incentives and Humans and Commerce and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Longitudinal Studies and Health Behavior and Family Characteristics and Longitudinal and Food Quality and Consumer Behavior/*economics and Diet, Healthy/economics and Dietary pattern and Difference-in-difference and Fast Foods/economics and Food Supply/economics and Grocery purchases and Healthful food purchase and Marketing/*economics and Retail purchase quality and Targeted coupon",NA,NA,2018/11/15/,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study develops a simulation approach to evaluate the impact of the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan (2010-2020) on physical activity, under the hypothesis that the intended transport mode shifts are realized. METHODS: Based on the Global Transport Survey (2010, n = 21,332) and on the RECORD GPS Study (2012-2013, n = 229) from the French capital region of Paris (Ile-de-France), a simulation method was designed and tested. The simulation method used accelerometer data and random forest models to predict the impact of the transport mode shifts anticipated in the Mobility Plan on transport-related moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (T-MVPA). The transport mode shifts include less private motorized trips in favor of more public transport, walking, and biking trips. RESULTS: The simulation model indicated a mean predicted increase of 2 min per day of T-MVPA, in case the intended transport mode shifts in the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan were realized. The positive effect of the transport mode shifts on T-MVPA would, however, be larger for people with a higher level of education. This heterogeneity in the positive effect would further increase the existing inequality in transport-related physical activity by educational level. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented in this paper showed a significant increase in transport-related physical activity in case the intended mode shifts in the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan were realized. This simulation method could be applied on other important health outcomes, such as exposure to noise or air pollution, making it a useful tool to anticipate the health impact of transport interventions or policies.",2017,10.1186/s12966-017-0600-1,14,1,143,eng,1479-5868,Machine learning and Humans and Health Promotion and Surveys and Questionnaires and Educational Status and Health inequalities and Data integration and Policy and France and Paris and *Exercise and Transportation/*methods and Active transport and Air Pollution/statistics & numerical data and Bicycling/statistics & numerical data and RECORD cohort study and Simulation study and Transport and Walking/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2017/10/23/,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,NA,NA,NA,NA

Significant medical conditions in endurance sports include heat illness, hyponatraemia and cardiac incidents. These conditions can differ from those typically encountered by clinicians or in the setting of low-endurance sports, and best practices in their management are discussed. Hydration and nutrition are critical in preventing these and other race-related morbidities, as they can impact both performance and medical outcomes on race day. Finally, the command and communication structures of an organized endurance event are vital to its safety and success, and such strategies and concepts are reviewed for implementation. The nature of endurance events increasingly relies on medical leaders to balance safety and prevention of morbidity while trying to help optimize athlete performance.",2015,10.1007/s40279-015-0396-6,45 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,69-S61,eng,1179-2035 0112-1642,Humans and Algorithms and Clinical Decision-Making and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration and *Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena and Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control/therapy and Competitive Behavior/*physiology and Dehydration/prevention & control and Heart Arrest/prevention & control/therapy and Heat Stress Disorders/prevention & control/therapy and Hyponatremia/prevention & control/therapy and Physical Endurance/*physiology and Sports Medicine/*organization & administration,NA,NA,2015/11//undefined,Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although such episodes are rare, many guidelines for pre-participation exercise screening have historically had a low threshold for recommending medical clearance prior to the commencement of exercise, placing the responsibility for decision making about exercise participation on physicians. The 'clearance to exercise' model still occurs widely in practice, but creates cost burdens and barriers to the uptake of exercise. Moreover, many physicians are not provided the training, nor time in a standard consultation, to be able to effectively perform this role. We present a model for pre-participation exercise screening and the initial assessment of clients wishing to commence an exercise programme. It is designed to guide professional practice for the referral, assessment and prescription of exercise for people across the health spectrum, from individuals who are apparently healthy, through to clients with pre-existing or occult chronic conditions. The model removes the request that physicians provide a 'clearance' for patients to engage in exercise programmes. Instead the role of physicians is identified as providing relevant clinical guidance to suitably qualified exercise professionals to allow them to use their knowledge, skills and expertise in exercise prescription to assess and manage any risks related to the prescription and delivery of appropriate exercise programmes. It is anticipated that removing unjustified barriers to exercise participation, such as mandated medical review, will improve the uptake of exercise by the unacceptably high proportion of the population who do not undertake sufficient physical activity for health benefit.",2018,10.1007/s40279-018-0888-2,48,6,1293-1302,eng,1179-2035 0112-1642,Humans and Chronic Disease and Exercise Therapy and Australia and Consensus and New Zealand and *Physicians and *Interprofessional Relations and *Exercise and *Physical Fitness and Mass Screening/*methods/standards and Surveys and Questionnaires/standards,NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare premorbid and postmorbid factors between student-athletes that were and were not medically disqualified from sport following a concussion. METHODS: Among 1832 student-athletes diagnosed with concussion within the CARE Consortium, 53 (2.9%) were medically disqualified (MDQ +) and 1779 (97.1%) were not medically disqualified (MDQ-). We used contingency tables and descriptive statistics for an initial evaluation of a broad list of premorbid and postmorbid factors. For those factors showing association with MDQ status, we calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the odds of being MDQ + in the presence of the identified factor. RESULTS: History of 2 (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.5, 6.9) or 3 + (OR: 7.4, 95% CI 3.4, 15.9) previous concussions; 1 + headaches in past 3 months (OR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.0, 3.2); immediate removal from play (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.2, 4.9); alcohol (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.4), tobacco (OR: 3.3, 95% CI 1.1, 9.5), or marijuana use since injury (OR: 5.4, 95% CI 1.5, 19.0); as well as prolonged recovery due to mental health alterations (OR: 5.3, 95% CI 2.0, 14.1) or motivation/malingering (OR: 7.5, 95% CI 3.3, 17.0) increased odds of being MDQ + .

CONCLUSIONS: MDQ following concussion was relatively rare.

METHODS: Thirty breast cancer survivors concurrently wore a hip-worn accelerometer and a thigh-worn activPAL for 7 d. A random forest classifier, trained on the activPAL data, was used to detect sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions in 5-s windows in the hip-worn accelerometer. The classifier estimates were compared with the standard accelerometer cut point, and significant differences across different bout lengths were investigated using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Overall, the algorithm predicted the postures with moderate accuracy (stepping, 77%; standing, 63%; sitting, 67%; sit-to-stand, 52%; and stand-to-sit, 51%). Daily level analyses indicated that errors in transition estimates were only occurring during sitting bouts of 2 min or less. The standard cut point was significantly different from the activPAL across all bout lengths, overestimating short bouts and underestimating long bouts. CONCLUSIONS: This is among the first algorithms for sitting and standing for hip-worn accelerometer data to be trained from entirely free-living activPAL data. The new algorithm detected prolonged sitting, which has been shown to be the most detrimental to health.

Accelerometers are now replacing survey data, but it is not clear that intensity-based cut points reflect the behaviors previously reported. New computational techniques can help classify raw accelerometer data into behaviors meaningful for public health. METHODS: Five hundred twenty days of triaxial 30-Hz accelerometer data from three studies (n = 78) were employed as training data. Study 1 included prescribed activities completed in natural settings. The other two studies included multiple days of free-living data with SenseCam-annotated ground truth. The two populations in the free-living data sets were demographically and physical different. Random forest classifiers were trained on each data set, and the classification accuracy on the training data set and that applied to the other available data sets were assessed. Accelerometer cut points were also compared with the ground truth from the three data sets. RESULTS: The random forest classified all behaviors with over 80% accuracy. Classifiers developed on the prescribed data performed with higher accuracy than the free-living data classifier, but these did not perform as well on the free-living data sets. Many of the observed behaviors occurred at different intensities compared with those identified by existing cut points. CONCLUSIONS: New machine learning classifiers developed from prescribed activities (study 1) were considerably less accurate when applied to free-living populations or to a functionally different population (studies 2 and 3). These classifiers, developed on free-living data, may have value when applied to large cohort studies with existing hip accelerometer data.",2016,10.1249/MSS.0000000000000841,48,5,951-957,eng,1530-0315 0195-9131,"Public Health and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Obesity and *Algorithms and Overweight and *Machine Learning and Monitoring, Ambulatory/*methods and *Exercise and Activities of Daily Living/classification and Accelerometry/*methods and Bicycling",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Med Sci Sports Exerc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shrier_2014_Brjoofspme,JOUR,Return to play following injury: whose decision should it be?,"Shrier, Ian and Safai, Parissa and Charland, Lyn",British journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND: Return-to-play (RTP) decision-making is required for every injured athlete. However, these decisions often lead to conflict between sport medicine professionals, athletes, coaches and sport associations. This study explores differences in professionals' opinion about which criteria should be used for RTP decisions, and who is best able to evaluate them. METHODS: We surveyed Canadian sport medicine physicians, physiotherapists, athletic therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, athletes, coaches and representatives from three sport associations. The 10 min online survey asked respondents to rate criteria as mandatory to irrelevant on a five-point Likert scale, and to indicate which profession was best able to evaluate the criteria. RESULTS: In general, medical doctors, physiotherapists and athletic therapists were considered best able to assess factors related to risk of injury and complications from injury. Each clinician group (except sport massage therapists) generally believed their own profession has the best capacity to evaluate the criteria. Athletes, coaches and sport associations were considered to have the best capacity to assess factors related to competition (desire, psychological and financial impact and loss of competitive standing). There remained considerable heterogeneity both between and within stakeholder groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found that differences in approach to RTP decisions were generally greater within versus between-stakeholder groups. If shared decision-making is to become the norm in clinical sport medicine, we need to begin a discussion on which discrepancies are due to lack of training (resolved through education) or scientific knowledge (resolved through research) or simply reflect the divergence of personal/societal values.",2014,10.1136/bjsports-2013-092492,48,5,394-401,eng,1473-0480 0306-3674,Humans and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Evaluation and Attitude to Health and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Decision Making and Risk Assessment/methods and Professional Practice and *Sports Medicine and Athletic Injuries/physiopathology/*rehabilitation and Recovery of Function/physiology and Sporting injuries and Sports rehabilitation programs,NA,NA,2014/03//undefined,Br J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Heesch_2018_Thinjoofbenuanphac,JOUR,Validity of objective methods for measuring sedentary behaviour in older adults: a systematic review,"Heesch, Kristiann C. and Hill, Robert L. and Aguilar-Farias, Nicolas and van Uffelen, Jannique G. Z. and Pavey, Toby",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,"BACKGROUND: The evidence showing the ill health effects of prolonged sedentary behaviour (SB) is growing. Most studies of SB in older adults have relied on self-report measures of SB. However, SB is difficult for older adults to recall and objective measures that combine accelerometry with inclinometry are now available for more accurately assessing SB. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the validity and reliability of these accelerometers for the assessment of SB in older adults. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed and EBSCOhost databases were searched for articles published up to December 13, 2017. Articles were eligible if they: a) described reliability, calibration or validation studies of SB measurement in healthy, community-dwelling individuals, b) were published in English, Portuguese or Spanish, and c) were published or in press as journal articles in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: The review identified 15 studies in 17 papers. Of the included studies, 11 assessed the ActiGraph accelerometer. Of these, three examined reliability only, seven (in eight papers) examined validity only and one (in two papers) examined both. The strongest evidence from the studies reviewed is from studies that assessed the validity of the ActiGraph. These studies indicate that analysis of the data using 60-s epochs and a vertical magnitude cut-point < 200 cpm or using 30- or 60-s epochs with a machine learning algorithm provides the most valid estimates of SB. Non-wear algorithms of 90+ consecutive zeros is also suggested for the ActiGraph. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have examined the reliability and validity of accelerometers for measuring SB in older adults. Studies to date suggest that the criteria researchers use for classifying an epoch as sedentary instead of as non-wear time (e.g., the non-wear algorithm used) may need to be different for older adults than for younger adults. The required number of hours and days of wear for valid estimates of SB in older adults was not clear from studies to date. More older-adult-specific validation studies of accelerometers are needed, to inform future guidelines on the appropriate criteria to use for analysis of data from different accelerometer brands.

No studies in older populations have developed and tested algorithms for walking and sedentary time in free-living daily life. Our goal was to rectify this gap by leveraging access to data from two studies in older women. METHODS: In study 1, algorithms were developed and tested in a sample of older women (N = 39, age range = 55-96 yr) in the field. Women wore accelerometers and SenseCam (ground truth annotation) devices for 7 d, yielding 3191 h and 320 d of data. Images were annotated and time matched to accelerometer data, and random forest classifiers labeled behaviors (sitting, riding in a vehicle, standing still, standing moving, and walking/running). In study 2, we examined the concurrent validity of the algorithms using accelerometer data from an observed 400-m walk test (2983 min of data available) and 6 d of wearing both accelerometers and global positioning systems devices in a sample of 222 women (age range = 67-100; 313,290 min of data available). Analyses included sensitivity, specificity balanced accuracy, and precision, as appropriate, averaged over each test participant at the minute level for each behavior. RESULTS: In study 1, the algorithms had 82.2% balanced accuracy. In study 2, the classifier had 87.9% accuracy for predicting walking. Overall machine learning classifiers and global positioning systems had 88.6% agreement.

de.Zambotti_2019_Meanscinspanex,JOUR,Wearable Sleep Technology in Clinical and Research Settings,"de Zambotti, Massimiliano and Cellini, Nicola and Goldstone, Aimee and Colrain, Ian M. and Baker, Fiona C.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,": The accurate assessment of sleep is critical to better understand and evaluate its role in health and disease. The boom in wearable technology is part of the digital health revolution and is producing many novel, highly sophisticated and relatively inexpensive consumer devices collecting data from multiple sensors and claiming to extract information about users' behaviors, including sleep. These devices are now able to capture different biosignals for determining, for example, HR and its variability, skin conductance, and temperature, in addition to activity. They perform 24/7, generating overwhelmingly large data sets (big data), with the potential of offering an unprecedented window on users' health. Unfortunately, little guidance exists within and outside the scientific sleep community for their use, leading to confusion and controversy about their validity and application. The current state-of-the-art review aims to highlight use, validation and utility of consumer wearable sleep-trackers in clinical practice and research. Guidelines for a standardized assessment of device performance is deemed necessary, and several critical factors (proprietary algorithms, device malfunction, firmware updates) need to be considered before using these devices in clinical and sleep research protocols.

A dual-accelerometer system recently showed promising results for accurately classifying a broad range of behaviors in a controlled laboratory environment. As a progressive step, the aim of this study is to validate the same dual-accelerometer system in semi free-living conditions in children and adults. The efficacy of several placement sites (e.g., wrist, thigh, back) was evaluated for comparison. METHODS: Thirty participants (15 children) wore three Axivity AX3 accelerometers alongside an automated clip camera (clipped to the lapel) that recorded video of their free-living environment (ground truth criterion measure of physical activity). Participants were encouraged to complete a range of daily-living activities within a 2-h timeframe. A random forest machine-learning classifier was trained using features generated from the raw accelerometer data. Three different placement combinations were examined (thigh-back, thigh-wrist, back-wrist), and their performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation for the child and adult samples separately. RESULTS: Machine learning models developed using the thigh-back accelerometer combination performed the best in distinguishing seven distinct activity classes with an overall accuracy of 95.6% in the adult sample, and eight activity classes with an overall accuracy of 92.0% in the child sample. There was a drop in accuracy (at least 11.0%) when other placement combinations were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: This validation study demonstrated that a dual-accelerometer system previously validated in a laboratory setting also performs well in semi free-living conditions.

Vriend_2015_Brjoofspme,JOUR,Implementation of an app-based neuromuscular training programme to prevent ankle sprains: a process evaluation using the RE-AIM Framework,"Vriend, Ingrid and Coehoorn, Iris and Verhagen, Evert",British journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The contemporary electronic media is regarded as a practical tool in the dissemination of preventive measures and interventions. For this purpose an App (free of charge) was developed including an efficacious programme for the prevention of ankle sprain recurrences. This study evaluated the implementation effectiveness of this 'Versterk je Enkel' App. METHODS: The App was evaluated within its practical context using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. The launch of the App was accompanied by a press release, website banners, as well as online and offline advertisements. Data for the evaluation of the App were objectively registered through Google analytics. Data were obtained in February 2013 based on 25,781 users resulting in follow-ups of 18 months (iOS version) and 15 months (Android version), respectively. Users questionnaires provided a qualitative view of the objectively assessed measures (n=82) to gain insight into the demographics of users, reasons to download, user experience and how the information was used. RESULTS: The App reached only 2.6% of the projected target population. User ratings for the App's relevancy, clarity, usefulness, appeal, information and reliability were high. App usage indicates that compliance with the embedded programme was low. CONCLUSIONS: Although the App was well received by the users, targeted efforts are required to ensure proper uptake and usage of the App by the target population. This also holds true for eHealth and mHealth efforts aimed at athlete care and injury prevention in general.",2015,10.1136/bjsports-2013-092896,49,7,484-488,eng,1473-0480 0306-3674,"Humans and Diffusion of Innovation and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Aged and Implementation and Medical Informatics Applications and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Satisfaction and Mobile Applications/*statistics & numerical data and Exercise Therapy/*methods and Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control and Ankle injuries and Ankle Injuries/*prevention & control and Injury Prevention and Telemedicine/methods/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,Br J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

PURPOSE: The study evaluates the validity of an integrative, machine learning method for processing activity monitor data in relation to a portable metabolic analyzer (Oxycon mobile [OM]) and direct observation (DO). METHODS: Forty-nine adults (age 18-40 yr) each completed 5-min bouts of 15 activities ranging from sedentary to vigorous intensity in a laboratory setting while wearing ActiGraph (AG) on the hip, activPAL on the thigh, and OM. Estimates of energy expenditure (EE) and categorization of activity intensity were obtained from the AG processed with Lyden's sojourn (SOJ) method and from our new sojourns including posture (SIP) method, which integrates output from the AG and activPAL. Classification accuracy and estimates of EE were then compared with criterion measures (OM and DO) using confusion matrices and comparisons of the mean absolute error of log-transformed data (MAE ln Q). RESULTS: The SIP method had a higher overall classification agreement (79%, 95% CI = 75%-82%) than the SOJ (56%, 95% CI = 52%-59%) based on DO. Compared with OM, estimates of EE from SIP had lower mean absolute error of log-transformed data than SOJ for light-intensity (0.21 vs 0.27), moderate-intensity (0.33 vs 0.42), and vigorous-intensity (0.16 vs 0.35) activities. CONCLUSIONS: The SIP method was superior to SOJ for distinguishing between sedentary and light activities as well as estimating EE at higher intensities. Thus, SIP is recommended for research in which accuracy of measurement across the full range of activity intensities is of interest.",2016,10.1249/MSS.0000000000000915,48,8,1629-1638,eng,1530-0315 0195-9131,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and *Machine Learning and *Exercise and *Energy Metabolism and Actigraphy/*instrumentation,NA,NA,2016/08//undefined,Med Sci Sports Exerc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fuller_2017_Brjoofspme,JOUR,Evaluation of World Rugby's concussion management process: results from Rugby World Cup 2015,"Fuller, Colin W. and Fuller, Gordon W. and Kemp, Simon P. T. and Raftery, Martin",British journal of sports medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate World Rugby's concussion management process during Rugby World Cup (RWC) 2015. DESIGN: A prospective, whole population study. POPULATION: 639 international rugby players representing 20 countries. METHOD: The concussion management process consisted of 3 time-based, multifaceted stages: an initial on-pitch and/or pitch-side assessment of the injury, a follow-up assessment within 3 hours and an assessment at 36-48 hours. The initial on-pitch assessment targeted obvious signs of concussion, which, if identified, lead to a 'permanent removal from play' decision and a diagnosis of concussion. If the on-pitch diagnosis was unclear, a 10-min off-pitch assessment was undertaken for signs and symptoms of concussion leading to a 'suspected concussion with permanent removal from play' or a 'no indication of concussion with return to play' decision. Evaluations at 3 and 36-48 hours postmatch lead to diagnoses of 'confirmed concussion' or 'no concussion'. Medical staff's decision-making was supported during each stage by real-time video review of events. Players diagnosed with confirmed concussion followed a 5-stage graduated-return-to-play protocol before being allowed to return to training and/or competition. RESULTS: Players were evaluated for concussion on 49 occasions, of which 24 resulted in diagnoses of concussion. Fourteen players showing on-pitch signs of concussion were permanently removed from play: 4 of the 5 players removed from play following off-pitch medical room evaluation were later diagnosed with a confirmed concussion. Five players not exhibiting in-match signs or symptoms of concussion were later diagnosed with concussion. The overall incidence of concussion during RWC 2015 was 12.5 concussions/1000 player-match-hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the implementation of a multimodal, multitime-based concussion evaluation process to ensure that immediate and late developing concussions are captured.",2017,10.1136/bjsports-2016-096461,51,1,64-69,eng,1473-0480 0306-3674,Epidemiology and Humans and Prospective Studies and Risk factor and Football/*injuries and Athletic Injuries/*diagnosis and Brain Concussion/*diagnosis and Concussion and Contact sports and Return to Sport and Rugby and Sports Medicine/methods,NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,Br J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bassett_2015_Meanscinspanex,JOUR,Accelerometer-based physical activity: total volume per day and standardized measures,"Bassett, David R. and Troiano, Richard P. and McClain, James J. and Wolff, Dana L.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,"The use of accelerometers in physical activity (PA) research has increased exponentially over the past 20 yr. The first commercially available accelerometer for assessing PA, the Caltrac, was worn on the waist and estimated PA energy expenditure in kilocalories. Around 1995, the emphasis shifted to measuring minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), especially for bouts of 10 min or longer. Recent studies, however, show that light-intensity PA and intermittent (nonbout) MVPA also have important health benefits. The total volume of PA performed is an important variable because it takes the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity bouts and condenses them down into a single metric. The total volume of PA is appropriate for many research applications and can enhance comparisons between studies. In the future, machine learning algorithms will provide improved accuracy for activity type recognition and estimation of PA energy expenditure. However, in the current landscape of objectively measured PA, total activity counts per day (TAC/d) is a proxy for the total volume of PA. TAC/d percentiles for age- and gender-specific groups have been developed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ActiGraph data (2003-2006), providing a novel way to assess PA. The use of TAC/d or standardized units of acceleration could harmonize PA across studies. TAC/d should be viewed as an additional metric, not intended to replace other metrics (e.g., sedentary time, light-intensity PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA) that may also be related to health. As future refinements to wearable monitors occur, researchers should continue to consider metrics that reflect the total volume of PA in addition to existing PA metrics.",2015,10.1249/MSS.0000000000000468,47,4,833-838,eng,1530-0315 0195-9131,"Humans and History, 21st Century and History, 20th Century and Equipment Design and Energy Metabolism and Motor Activity/*physiology and Accelerometry/history/instrumentation/*standards",NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,Med Sci Sports Exerc,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bruce_2018_Brjoofspme,JOUR,Development of a risk prediction model among professional hockey players with visible signs of concussion,"Bruce, Jared M. and Echemendia, Ruben J. and Meeuwisse, Willem and Hutchison, Michael G. and Aubry, Mark and Comper, Paul",British journal of sports medicine,"BACKGROUND: Little research examines how to best identify concussed athletes. The purpose of the present study was to develop a preliminary risk decision model that uses visible signs (VS) and mechanisms of injury (MOI) to predict the likelihood of subsequent concussion diagnosis. METHODS: Coders viewed and documented VS and associated MOI for all NHL games over the course of the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 regular seasons. After coding was completed, player concussions were identified from the NHL injury surveillance system and it was determined whether players exhibiting VS were subsequently diagnosed with concussions by club medical staff as a result of the coded event. RESULTS: Among athletes exhibiting VS, suspected loss of consciousness, motor incoordination or balance problems, being in a fight, having an initial hit from another player's shoulder and having a secondary hit on the ice were all associated with increased risk of subsequent concussion diagnosis. In contrast, having an initial hit with a stick was associated with decreased risk of subsequent concussion diagnosis. A risk prediction model using a combination of the above VS and MOI was superior to approaches that relied on individual VS and associated MOI (sensitivity=81%, specificity=72%, positive predictive value=26%). CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of VS and MOI significantly improves a clinician's ability to identify players who need to be evaluated for possible concussion. A preliminary concussion prediction log has been developed from these data. Pending prospective validation, the use of these methods may improve early concussion detection and evaluation.",2018,10.1136/bjsports-2016-097091,52,17,1143-1148,eng,1473-0480 0306-3674,"Athletes and Humans and Risk Assessment and Models, Theoretical and Sports and Ice hockey and Clinical Decision-Making and Athletic Injuries/*diagnosis and Brain Concussion/*diagnosis and Concussion and Hockey/*injuries",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,Br J Sports Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Purcell_2009_Brjoofspme,JOUR,What are the most appropriate return-to-play guidelines for concussed child athletes?,"Purcell, L.",British journal of sports medicine,"OBJECTIVE: To examine concussion literature for specific guidelines regarding return to play (RTP) following sport-related concussion in child athletes. To make recommendations regarding the most appropriate RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion. DESIGN: A literature review of concussion literature. INTERVENTION: A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase databases from 1998 to 2008. More than 60 articles and two websites were reviewed. RESULTS: There is a paucity of research on sport-related concussion in child athletes, particularly younger children (age 5-12 years). In particular, there is no research on RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion. Child athletes take longer to recover from concussions than adults. Concussion symptoms may resolve before cognitive function has completely recovered. Concussion assessment and management in children can be confounded by their growth and development, as well as the lack of trained medical personnel involved with youth sports. There are no child-specific assessment tools for concussion. CONCLUSIONS: RTP decisions in children should be made cautiously and should be individualised. No concussed child athlete should be allowed to RTP the same day. Physical and cognitive rest is very important to allow for the resolution of concussion symptoms. Child athletes should remain symptom free for several days before starting a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol. Further research is needed to elucidate the effects of concussion in children and to determine the most appropriate RTP guidelines.
