A sample of 205 parents completed an online survey about the use of autism spectrum disorder services for their children. The results revealed that on average, children began services by 3.3 years. Most parents reported utilizing non-medical treatments followed by biomedical treatments and cultural and religious treatment. The age at the initiation of services and the type of treatments used differed by parent's income, educational attainment, the extent of knowledge about autism spectrum disorders, and geographic location. Some child characteristics also influenced the use of services. The disparities in service utilization in Saudi Arabia point to the need to develop policy and interventions that can mitigate the paucity of services for children with autism spectrum disorders. More research is needed to better understand service use and the decision-making processes that underlie treatment selection by parents of children with autism spectrum disorders in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",2017,10.1177/1362361316664868,21,5,592-602,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Decision Making and Socioeconomic Factors and Parents and services and disability and Saudi Arabia and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*therapy and autism and Health Care Surveys/*statistics & numerical data and Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data and parents and treatments,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA

This hinders the ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions relating to autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we utilised linked health and non-health data to develop a method for identifying cases of autism spectrum disorder among children and young people in New Zealand. In addition, we examined rates of co-occurring mental health, neurodevelopmental and related conditions among this cohort and compared these to the general population. The method identified almost 10,000 children and young people with autism spectrum disorder in New Zealand. Co-occurring mental health or related problems were found in over 68% of this group (nearly seven times higher than the general population), and around half were identified with multiple co-occurring conditions. The most frequently identified conditions were intellectual disability, disruptive behaviours and emotional problems. We have developed a useful method for monitoring service and treatment-related trends, number and types of co-occurring conditions and examining social outcomes among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. While the method may underestimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in New Zealand, it provides a significant step towards establishing a more comprehensive evidence base to inform autism spectrum disorder-related policy.",2020,10.1177/1362361320939329,24,8,2213-2227,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,mental health and Humans and Adolescent and Child and big data and Tanzania and Prevalence and Mental Health and autism spectrum disorder and *Autism Spectrum Disorder/epidemiology and case identification and Integrated Data Infrastructure and New Zealand/epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA
Molloy_2011_A.tijorap,JOUR,Use of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in a clinical setting,"Molloy, Cynthia A. and Murray, Donna S. and Akers, Rachel and Mitchell, Terry and Manning-Courtney, Patricia",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,"The aim of this study was to examine the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) as it is commonly used in clinical practice. ADOS classifications were compared to final diagnoses given by a multidisciplinary team to 584 children referred for evaluation for possible autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. A total of 177 children were evaluated with a Module 1 (87 No Words), 198 with a Module 2 (90 < 5 years) and 209 with a Module 3. Of these, 142 (26%) were diagnosed with autism, 185 (32%) with non-autism ASD, and 257 (44%) with non-spectrum disorders. Sensitivities were moderate to high on both original and revised algorithms, while specificities were substantially lower than those previously reported. This difference is likely attributable to the composition of the sample that included many children with a broad array of developmental and behavioral disorders. The clinical impression of the team member who administered the ADOS was critical to the accuracy of the overall diagnosis. Using numeric scores alone resulted in misclassification from false positive results. The study highlights the importance of the qualitative interactions of the ADOS activities as well as the score in diagnostic decision making.",2011,10.1177/1362361310379241,15,2,143-162,eng,1461-7005 1362-3613,"Humans and Female and Male and Child and Child, Preschool and Sex Factors and Algorithms and Sensitivity and Specificity and Age Factors and Psychiatric Status Rating Scales and Asperger Syndrome/diagnosis and Autistic Disorder/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2011/03//undefined,Autism,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shepherd_2018_Joofauandedi,JOUR,Documenting and Understanding Parent's Intervention Choices for Their Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Shepherd, Daniel and Csako, Rita and Landon, Jason and Goedeke, Sonja and Ty, Kelly",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Understanding why parents choose some interventions but not others for their child with autism is important for a number of reasons. Estimating the proportion of evidence-based interventions engaged, identifying the agencies influencing parental decisions, and elucidating the barriers or reasons leading to intervention rejection or discontinuation can result in better service provision. New Zealand parents (n = 570) of a child with autism reported what interventions were being engaged, and why some interventions were engaged but not others. Funding was a major determinant of intervention engagement, while medical professionals exerted the most influence. Sources of support were not related to intervention engagement, but parental perceptions of their child's symptom severity were. Finally, non-engagement does not necessarily reflect parental opposition to an intervention, but rather the existence of barriers.",2018,10.1007/s10803-017-3395-7,48,4,1001-988,eng,1573-3432 0162-3257,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Autism and New Zealand and *Decision Making and *Choice Behavior and Parents/*psychology and ASD and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*psychology/*therapy and Intervention choice and Parent decision making,NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Autism Dev Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA

Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0-23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1-3.2).

The current study examined diagnostic certainty, or how sure clinicians were that their diagnosis was accurate, among 478 toddler and preschool-aged children referred for possible ASD to academic medical specialty clinics. Overall, 60 percent of diagnoses were made with complete certainty. Clinicians were more certain when positively identifying ASD than ruling it out. Children presenting with a moderate (vs high or low) level of observable ASD symptoms were less likely to have a certain diagnosis. Further, clinicians rated less diagnostic certainty for older children, those with public insurance, and those with higher IQ and adaptive behavior abilities.",2019,10.1007/s10803-018-3831-3,49,4,1391-1401,eng,1573-3432 0162-3257,"Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Child and Child, Preschool and Diagnosis, Differential and *Clinical Decision-Making and Autism Spectrum Disorder/*diagnosis and Autism spectrum disorder and Diagnostic certainty and Differential diagnosis",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Autism Dev Disord,NA,NA,NA,NA
Walsh_2018_Joofchpsanpsanaldi,JOUR,Predicting suicide attempts in adolescents with longitudinal clinical data and machine learning,"Walsh, Colin G. and Ribeiro, Jessica D. and Franklin, Joseph C.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","BACKGROUND: Adolescents have high rates of nonfatal suicide attempts, but clinically practical risk prediction remains a challenge. Screening can be time consuming to implement at scale, if it is done at all. Computational algorithms may predict suicide risk using only routinely collected clinical data. We used a machine learning approach validated on longitudinal clinical data in adults to address this challenge in adolescents. METHODS: This is a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. Data were collected from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative from January 1998 to December 2015 and included 974 adolescents with nonfatal suicide attempts and multiple control comparisons: 496 adolescents with other self-injury (OSI), 7,059 adolescents with depressive symptoms, and 25,081 adolescent general hospital controls. Candidate predictors included diagnostic, demographic, medication, and socioeconomic factors. Outcome was determined by multiexpert review of electronic health records. Random forests were validated with optimism adjustment at multiple time points (from 1 week to 2 years). Recalibration was done via isotonic regression. Evaluation metrics included discrimination (AUC, sensitivity/specificity, precision/recall) and calibration (calibration plots, slope/intercept, Brier score). RESULTS: Computational models performed well and did not require face-to-face screening. Performance improved as suicide attempts became more imminent. Discrimination was good in comparison with OSI controls (AUC = 0.83 [0.82-0.84] at 720 days; AUC = 0.85 [0.84-0.87] at 7 days) and depressed controls (AUC = 0.87 [95% CI 0.85-0.90] at 720 days; 0.90 [0.85-0.94] at 7 days) and best in comparison with general hospital controls (AUC 0.94 [0.92-0.96] at 720 days; 0.97 [0.95-0.98] at 7 days). Random forests significantly outperformed logistic regression in every comparison. Recalibration improved performance as much as ninefold - clinical recommendations with poorly calibrated predictions can lead to decision errors. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning on longitudinal clinical data may provide a scalable approach to broaden screening for risk of nonfatal suicide attempts in adolescents.",2018,10.1111/jcpp.12916,59,12,1261-1270,eng,1469-7610 0021-9630,"machine learning and Suicide and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Longitudinal Studies and electronic health records and adolescent and *Machine Learning and decision support techniques and attempted and Depression/epidemiology/psychology and Self-Injurious Behavior/epidemiology/psychology and Suicide, Attempted/*prevention & control/psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhang.James_2020_Joofchpsanpsanaldi,JOUR,Machine-Learning prediction of comorbid substance use disorders in ADHD youth using Swedish registry data,"Zhang-James, Yanli and Chen, Qi and Kuja-Halkola, Ralf and Lichtenstein, Paul and Larsson, Henrik and Faraone, Stephen V.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","BACKGROUND: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Early identification of at-risk youth would help allocate scarce resources for prevention programs. METHODS: Psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, family history of these disorders, measures of socioeconomic distress, and information about birth complications were obtained from the national registers in Sweden for 19,787 children with ADHD born between 1989 and 1993. We trained (a) a cross-sectional random forest (RF) model using data available by age 17 to predict SUD diagnosis between ages 18 and 19; and (b) a longitudinal recurrent neural network (RNN) model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict new diagnoses at each age. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.73(95%CI 0.70-0.76) for the random forest model (RF). Removing prior diagnosis from the predictors, the RF model was still able to achieve significant AUCs when predicting all SUD diagnoses (0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.72) or new diagnoses (0.67, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.71) during age 18-19. For the model predicting new diagnoses, model calibration was good with a low Brier score of 0.086. Longitudinal LSTM model was able to predict later SUD risks at as early as 2 years age, 10 years before the earliest diagnosis. The average AUC from longitudinal models predicting new diagnoses 1, 2, 5 and 10 years in the future was 0.63. CONCLUSIONS: Population registry data can be used to predict at-risk comorbid SUDs in individuals with ADHD. Such predictions can be made many years prior to age of the onset, and their SUD risks can be monitored using longitudinal models over years during child development. Nevertheless, more work is needed to create prediction models based on electronic health records or linked population registers that are sufficiently accurate for use in the clinic.",2020,10.1111/jcpp.13226,61,12,1370-1379,eng,1469-7610 0021-9630,"Machine learning and Humans and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Cross-Sectional Studies and Risk Factors and Comorbidity and substance use disorder and *Machine Learning and Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology and Sweden/epidemiology and *Registries and risk factor and comorbidity and Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*epidemiology and attention-deficit hyperactive disorder",NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current knowledge suggests that mental health disorders may reflect deviant trajectories of brain maturation. METHOD: We studied 654 children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans under a resting-state protocol. A machine-learning method was used to obtain age predictions of children based on the average coefficient of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) of the DMN, a measure of spontaneous local activity. The chronological ages of the children and fALFF measures from regions of this network, the response and predictor variables were considered respectively in a Gaussian Process Regression. Subsequently, we computed a network maturation status index for each subject (actual age minus predicted). We then evaluated the association between this maturation index and psychopathology scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). RESULTS: Our hypothesis was that the maturation status of the DMN would be negatively associated with psychopathology. Consistent with previous studies, fALFF significantly predicted the age of participants (p < .001). Furthermore, as expected, we found an association between the DMN maturation status (precocious vs. delayed) and general psychopathology scores (p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that child psychopathology seems to be associated with delayed maturation of the DMN. This delay in the neurodevelopmental trajectory may offer interesting insights into the pathophysiology of mental health disorders.",2016,10.1111/jcpp.12444,57,1,55-64,eng,1469-7610 0021-9630,neuroimaging and default mode network and MVPA and Neurodevelopment and psychopathology,NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA
