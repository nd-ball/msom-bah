Hamilton_2009_ThJoofpa,JOUR,Do we see what we think we see? The complexities of morphological assessment,"Hamilton, Peter W. and van Diest, Paul J. and Williams, Richard and Gallagher, Anthony G.",The Journal of pathology,"Reliable pathological interpretation is vital to so many aspects of tissue-based research as well as being central to patient care. Understanding the complex processes involved in decision-making is the starting point to improve both diagnostic reproducibility and the definition of diagnostic groups that underpin our experiments. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research in this field and it is encouraging to see The Journal of Pathology publishing work in this area. This review attempts to highlight the opportunities that exist in this field and the technologies that are now available to support this type of research. Key amongst these are the use of decision analysis tools such as inference networks, and virtual microscopy that allows us to simulate diagnostic decision-making. These tools have roles, not only in studying the subtleties of diagnostic decision-making, but also in delivering new methods of training and proficiency testing. Research which helps us to better understand what we see, why we see it, and standardizing interpretative reasoning in pathological classification is essential for improving the wide range of activities that pathologists support, including clinical diagnosis, teaching, training, and experimental research.",2009,10.1002/path.2527,218,3,285-291,eng,1096-9896 0022-3417,"Humans and Clinical Competence and *Decision Making and Education, Medical, Graduate/methods and Pathology, Clinical/education/*standards and Pattern Recognition, Visual",NA,NA,2009/07//undefined,J Pathol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cadet_2014_Actaneur,JOUR,Neuropathology of substance use disorders,"Cadet, Jean Lud and Bisagno, Veronica and Milroy, Christopher Mark",Acta neuropathologica,"Addictions to licit and illicit drugs are chronic relapsing brain disorders that affect circuits that regulate reward, motivation, memory, and decision-making. Drug-induced pathological changes in these brain regions are associated with characteristic enduring behaviors that continue despite adverse biopsychosocial consequences. Repeated exposure to these substances leads to egocentric behaviors that focus on obtaining the drug by any means and on taking the drug under adverse psychosocial and medical conditions. Addiction also includes craving for the substances and, in some cases, involvement in risky behaviors that can cause death. These patterns of behaviors are associated with specific cognitive disturbances and neuroimaging evidence for brain dysfunctions in a diverse population of drug addicts. Postmortem studies have also revealed significant biochemical and/or structural abnormalities in some addicted individuals. The present review provides a summary of the evidence that has accumulated over the past few years to implicate brain dysfunctions in the varied manifestations of drug addiction. We thus review data on cerebrovascular alterations, brain structural abnormalities, and postmortem studies of patients who abuse cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, and ""bath salts"". We also discuss potential molecular, biochemical, and cellular bases for the varied clinical presentations of these patients. Elucidation of the biological bases of addiction will help to develop better therapeutic approaches to these patient populations.",2014,10.1007/s00401-013-1221-7,127,1,107-91,eng,1432-0533 0001-6322,Humans and Animals and Brain Diseases/complications/*pathology/physiopathology and Brain/drug effects/*pathology/physiopathology and Illicit Drugs/adverse effects and Substance-Related Disorders/complications/*pathology/physiopathology,NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,Acta Neuropathol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gagne_2018_ThAmjoofsupa,JOUR,Identification of Grossing Criteria for Intraoperative Evaluation by Frozen Section of Lung Cancer Resection Margins,"Gagne, Andreanne and Racine, Etienne and Orain, Michele and Meziou, Salma and Simard, Serge and Couture, Christian and Page, Sylvain and Trahan, Sylvain and Ugalde, Paula and Lacasse, Yves and Joubert, David and Joubert, Philippe",The American journal of surgical pathology,"Because of a lack of official guidelines, systematic use of intraoperative frozen section for the evaluation of surgical margins in lung oncology constitutes standard practice in many pathology departments. This costly and time-consuming procedure seems unjustified as reported rates of positive margins remain low. We aimed to evaluate clinicopathologic criteria associated with positive margins and establish evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of frozen sections. This retrospective cohort included 1903 consecutive patients with a lung resection for malignant neoplasm between 2006 and 2015. Clinicopathologic data were retrieved from medical files. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify variables associated with a positive margin. Receiver operating characteristic curves and a probability table of positive margins based on tumor-margin distance were created. Our results were confirmed in a validation cohort of 27 patients with positive margins. The rate of positive margins was 3.8%. A positive margin status changed the surgical management in 48.6% of patients. A short macroscopic tumor-margin distance was associated with a higher risk of positive bronchovascular and parenchymal margins in univariate and multivariate analyses. Selecting a 2.0 cm tumor-margin distance cut-off for performing a frozen section would result in a 55.3% reduction of intraoperative evaluations, with a risk of missing a positive margin of 0.61%. Overall, we showed that systematic use of frozen section for intraoperative evaluation of surgical margins is unnecessary. A better selection of patients with a higher risk of a positive margin can be achieved with tumor-margin distance as a simple gross evaluation parameter.",2018,10.1097/PAS.0000000000001138,42,11,1495-1502,eng,1532-0979 0147-5185,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Reproducibility of Results and Predictive Value of Tests and Chemotherapy, Adjuvant and Clinical Decision-Making and Radiotherapy, Adjuvant and *Frozen Sections and *Margins of Excision and *Pneumonectomy/adverse effects and Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant and Intraoperative Care/*methods and Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/*surgery",NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Am J Surg Pathol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Martinez.Terroba_2018_ThJoofpa,JOUR,A novel protein-based prognostic signature improves risk stratification to guide clinical management in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients,"Martinez-Terroba, Elena and Behrens, Carmen and de Miguel, Fernando J. and Agorreta, Jackeline and Monso, Eduard and Millares, Laura and Sainz, Cristina and Mesa-Guzman, Miguel and Perez-Gracia, Jose Luis and Lozano, Maria Dolores and Zulueta, Javier J. and Pio, Ruben and Wistuba, Ignacio I. and Montuenga, Luis M. and Pajares, Maria J.",The Journal of pathology,"Each of the pathological stages (I-IIIa) of surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer has hidden biological heterogeneity, manifested as heterogeneous outcomes within each stage. Thus, the finding of robust and precise molecular classifiers with which to assess individual patient risk is an unmet medical need. Here, we identified and validated the clinical utility of a new prognostic signature based on three proteins (BRCA1, QKI, and SLC2A1) to stratify early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients according to their risk of recurrence or death. Patients were staged according to the new International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) staging criteria (8th edition, 2018). A test cohort (n = 239) was used to assess the value of this new prognostic index (PI) based on the three proteins. The prognostic signature was developed by Cox regression with the use of stringent statistical criteria (TRIPOD: Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis). The model resulted in a highly significant predictor of 5-year outcome for disease-free survival (p < 0.001) and overall survival (p < 0.001). The prognostic ability of the model was externally validated in an independent multi-institutional cohort of patients (n = 114, p = 0.021). We also demonstrated that this molecular classifier adds relevant information to the gold standard TNM-based pathological staging, with a highly significant improvement of the likelihood ratio. We subsequently developed a combined PI including both the molecular and the pathological data that improved the risk stratification in both cohorts (p <e2><89><a4> 0.001). Moreover, the signature may help to select stage I-IIA patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. In summary, this protein-based signature accurately identifies those patients with a high risk of recurrence and death, and adds further prognostic information to the TNM-based clinical staging, even when the new IASLC 8th edition staging criteria are applied. More importantly, it may be a valuable tool for selecting patients for adjuvant therapy. Copyright (C) 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
