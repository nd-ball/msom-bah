Crowson_2020_TheLar,JOUR,A contemporary review of machine learning in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery,"Crowson, Matthew G. and Ranisau, Jonathan and Eskander, Antoine and Babier, Aaron and Xu, Bin and Kahmke, Russel R. and Chen, Joseph M. and Chan, Timothy C. Y.",The Laryngoscope,"One of the key challenges with big data is leveraging the complex network of information to yield useful clinical insights. The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine-learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5 years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine-learning techniques, and review recent machine-learning applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine-learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care. Spreading awareness and confidence in machine learning will follow with further validation and proof-of-value analyses that demonstrate model performance superiority over established methods. We are poised to see a greater influx of machine-learning applications to clinical problems in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and it is prudent for providers to understand the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies.

Watters_2016_TheLar,JOUR,"Two-year mortality, complications, and healthcare use in children with medicaid following tracheostomy","Watters, Karen and O'Neill, Margaret and Zhu, Hannah and Graham, Robert J. and Hall, Matthew and Berry, Jay",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess patient characteristics associated with adverse outcomes in the first 2 years following tracheostomy, and to report healthcare utilization and cost of caring for these children. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Children (0-16 years) in Medicaid from 10 states undergoing tracheostomy in 2009, identified with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes and followed through 2011, were selected using the Truven Health Medicaid Marketscan Database (Truven Health Analytics, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed with likelihood of death and tracheostomy complication using chi-square tests and logistic regression. Healthcare use and spending across the care continuum (hospital, outpatient, community, and home) were reported. RESULTS: A total of 502 children underwent tracheostomy in 2009, with 34.1% eligible for Medicaid because of disability. Median age at tracheostomy was 8 years (interquartile range 1-16 years), and 62.7% had a complex chronic condition. Two-year rates of in-hospital mortality and tracheostomy complication were 8.9% and 38.8%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, the highest likelihood of mortality occurred in children age < 1 year compared with 13+ years (odds ratio [OR] 7.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-17.1); the highest likelihood of tracheostomy complication was in children with a complex chronic condition versus those without a complex chronic condition (OR 3.3; 95% CI, 1.1-9.9). Total healthcare spending in the 2 years following tracheostomy was $53.3 million, with hospital, home, and primary care constituting 64.4%, 9.4%, and 0.5% of total spending, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mortality and morbidity are high, and spending on primary and home care is small following tracheostomy in children with Medicaid. Future studies should assess whether improved outpatient and community care might improve their health outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

Forner_2020_Joh.ns,JOUR,Shared Decision-making in Head and Neck Surgery: A Review,"Forner, David and Noel, Christopher W. and Shuman, Andrew G. and Hong, Paul and Corsten, Martin and Rac, Valeria E. and Pieterse, Arwen H. and Goldstein, David",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Shared decision-making is a partnership between physicians and patients whereby patient values and preferences are incorporated with the best medical evidence. Shared decision-making may reduce decisional conflict, improve value-choice congruence, and increase patient involvement. Despite potential benefit in many key areas of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, both clinical and research focuses on shared decision-making are scarce. Head and neck surgical oncology is of particular interest owing to the frequency by which preference-sensitive decisions must be made. Information used in this review was obtained between January 1 and February 1, 2020. OBSERVATIONS: Various conceptual models have been developed in an attempt to define the concept of shared decision-making. More than 40 instruments have endeavored to measure the construct of shared decision-making. However, in head and neck surgery, few studies to date have explicitly done so. Situations of clinical equipoise, such as in the management of indeterminate thyroid nodules and in the treatment of laryngeal cancer, are frequent. In contrast, value-option incongruence may occur when patient values do not align with the most oncologically sound treatment choice, such as when the resection and reconstruction of oral cancer may leave patients with significant sequelae. Several patient decision aids have been developed to improve shared decision-making in specific clinical scenarios, for example, in considering total laryngectomy or primary chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite its potential benefit, there is a dearth of research and clinical applications of shared decision-making in head and neck surgery. Shared decision-making represents an area of substantial need in this regard, and additional efforts should be put forth.",2020,10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1601,146,9,839-844,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and *Patient Participation and *Decision Making, Shared and *Otolaryngology",NA,NA,2020/09/01/,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Willson_2015_TheLar,JOUR,Effect of environmental factors on Internet searches related to sinusitis,"Willson, Thomas J. and Lospinoso, Joshua and Weitzel, Erik K. and McMains, Kevin C.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Sinusitis significantly affects the population of the United States, exacting direct cost and lost productivity. Patients are likely to search the Internet for information related to their health before seeking care by a healthcare professional. Utilizing data generated from these searches may serve as an epidemiologic surrogate. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective time series analysis was performed. METHODS: Google search trend data from the Dallas-Fort Worth metro region for the years 2012 and 2013 were collected from www.google.com/trends for terms related to sinusitis based on literature outlining the most important symptoms for diagnosis. Additional terms were selected based on common English language terms used to describe the disease. Twelve months of data from the same time period and location for common pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulates), pollen and mold counts, and influenza-like illness were also collected. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation coefficients, and potential search activity predictors were assessed using autoregressive integrated moving average. RESULTS: Pearson correlation was strongest between the terms congestion and influenza-like illness (r=0.615), and sinus and influenza-like illness (r=0.534) and nitrogen dioxide (r=0.487). Autoregressive integrated moving average analysis revealed ozone, influenza-like illness, and nitrogen dioxide levels to be potential predictors for sinus pressure searches, with estimates of 0.118, 0.349, and 0.438, respectively. Nitrogen dioxide was also a potential predictor for the terms congestion and sinus, with estimates of 0.191 and 0.272, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Google search activity for related terms follow the pattern of seasonal influenza-like illness and nitrogen dioxide. These data highlight the epidemiologic potential of this novel surveillance method.

Britt_2017_TheLar,JOUR,Quality indicators of laryngeal cancer care in commercially insured patients,"Britt, Christopher J. and Chang, Hsien-Yen and Quon, Harry and Kang, Hyunseok and Kiess, Ana P. and Eisele, David W. and Frick, Kevin D. and Gourin, Christine G.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between quality, complications, and costs in commercially insured patients treated for laryngeal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of MarketScan Commercial Claim and Encounters data (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A.). METHODS: We evaluated 10,969 patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer from 2010 to 2012 using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression. Using quality indicators derived from guidelines for recommended care, summary measures of quality were calculated for diagnosis, initial treatment, surveillance, treatment for recurrence, performance, and an overall summary measure of quality. RESULTS: Higher-quality care in the initial treatment period was associated with lower odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.04-0.98]), surgical complications (OR = 0.39 [0.17-0.88]), and medical complications (OR = 0.68 [0.49-0.96]). Mean incremental 1-year costs were higher for higher-quality diagnosis ($20,126 [$14,785-$25,466]), initial treatment ($17,918 [$10,481-$25,355]), and surveillance ($25,424 [$20,014-$30,834]) quality indicators, whereas costs were lower for higher-quality performance measures (-$45,723 [-$56,246--$35,199]) after controlling for all other variables. Higher-quality care was associated with significant differences in mean incremental costs for initial treatment in surgical patients ($-37,303 [-$68,832--$5,775]), and for the overall summary measure of quality in patients treated nonoperatively ($10,473 [$1,121-$19,825]). After controlling for the overall summary measure of quality, costs were significantly lower for patients receiving high-volume surgical care (mean -$18,953 [-$28,381--$9,426]). CONCLUSION: Higher-quality larynx cancer care in commercially insured patients was associated with lower 30-day mortality and morbidity. High-volume surgical care was associated with lower 1-year costs, even after controlling for quality. These data have implications for discussions of value and quality in an era of healthcare reform.

Adamian_2021_TheLar,JOUR,An Open-Source Computer Vision Tool for Automated Vocal Fold Tracking From Videoendoscopy,"Adamian, Nat and Naunheim, Matthew R. and Jowett, Nate",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES: Contemporary clinical assessment of vocal fold adduction and abduction is qualitative and subjective. Herein is described a novel computer vision tool for automated quantitative tracking of vocal fold motion from videolaryngoscopy. The potential of this software as a diagnostic aid in unilateral vocal fold paralysis is demonstrated. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control. METHODS: A deep-learning algorithm was trained for vocal fold localization from videoendoscopy for automated frame-wise estimation of glottic opening angles. Algorithm accuracy was compared against manual expert markings. Maximum glottic opening angles between adults with normal movements (N = 20) and those with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (N = 20) were characterized. RESULTS: Algorithm angle estimations demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.97 (P < .001) and mean absolute difference of 3.72<c2><b0> (standard deviation [SD], 3.49<c2><b0>) in comparison to manual expert markings. In comparison to those with normal movements, patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis demonstrated significantly lower maximal glottic opening angles (mean 68.75<c2><b0> <c2><b1> 11.82<c2><b0> vs. 49.44<c2><b0> <c2><b1> 10.42<c2><b0>; difference, 19.31<c2><b0>; 95% confidence interval [CI] [12.17<c2><b0>-26.44<c2><b0>]; P < .001). Maximum opening angle less than 58.65<c2><b0> predicted unilateral vocal fold paralysis with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.85, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.888 (95% CI [0.784-0.991]; P < .001). CONCLUSION: A user-friendly software tool for automated quantification of vocal fold movements from previously recorded videolaryngoscopy examinations is presented, termed automated glottic action tracking by artificial intelligence (AGATI).

Jr and Rasgon, Barry M.",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Currently there are few validated metrics for predicting surgical skill among otolaryngology residency applicants. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether manual dexterity aptitude testing in the form of soap carving during otolaryngology residency interviews at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Oakland predicts surgical skill at the time of graduation from otolaryngology residency programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted to determine how applicants with the best and worst soap carvings compared at the time of graduation with respect to various metrics including visuospatial ability and manual dexterity. Over the last 25 years, applicants to the residency program at Kaiser Permanente Oakland were required to carve soap during their residency interview. The 3 best and 3 worst soap carvings from 1990 through 2006 were determined. Of the individuals who carved those soaps, 62 qualified for the study and matriculated into otolaryngology residency programs. INTERVENTIONS: Surveys were sent to the 62 individuals' residency programs to evaluate those individuals on a 5-point Likert scale in various categories as well as to rank those individuals as being in the top 50% or bottom 50% of their graduating class. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All else being equal, we hypothesized that applicants who had the manual dexterity and visuospatial skills to accurately carve a bar of soap would more likely possess the skills necessary to become a good surgeon. RESULTS: There was no difference between individuals with the best soap carvings and those with the worst soap carvings in all categories: cognitive knowledge, visuospatial ability, manual dexterity, decision making, and overall score (P > .10 for all categories). There was a 95% response rate, with 35 of 37 residency programs responding and 59 of 62 surveys returned.

However, the qualities desired in programs and applicants have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors that fellowship program directors and applicants believe to be most important in choosing a fellow and the factors most important to fellowship applicants in choosing a program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study using an anonymous online survey of 2012 pediatric otolaryngology fellowship program directors and applicants. Respondents were asked to rank a list of 10 qualities from most to least important for judging the strength of a fellowship applicant. Applicants also assessed the importance of factors in choosing a fellowship. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rank of each factor by members of each group. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 47 applicants (68%) and 15 of 31 fellowship directors (48%) completed the survey. For applicants, the most important factors when choosing a fellowship program were gaining strong experience in airway management and otology, faculty reputation, and location, whereas Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation, fellowship longevity, and salary were less important. For choosing an applicant, applicants indicated that the interview, prior applicant knowledge (trusted recommendation), and letters of recommendation, sequentially, should be given the greatest weight. Directors reported that they used the same top 3 factors to rank applicants, but knowledge or trusted recommendation of the applicant ranked first. Applicants who successfully matched interviewed at (mean, 9.5 vs 3.0; P = .003), applied at (mean, 11.6 vs 4.3; P = .02), and ranked (mean, 8.3 vs 2.3; P < .001) more fellowship programs than those who did not.

Whitman and Kirse, Daniel J.",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: This study contributes novel data on the association between oral fluid intake before discharge and adverse outcomes following tonsillectomy in pediatric patients. These data contribute to evidence-based, safe, and cost-effective decision making regarding discharge. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the quantity of oral fluid intake before discharge is associated with adverse outcomes following tonsillectomy in pediatric patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the electronic medical records of 1183 pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy between September 24, 2012, and June 5, 2015, at a tertiary care academic medical center. Exclusion criteria included age 18 years or older, overnight admission, and missing data on fluid intake. The final cohort comprised 473 patients. Data analysis was conducted from July 8 to August 23, 2015. EXPOSURES: All patients underwent tonsillectomy by 1 of 7 attending surgeons at our institution. All patients were given intravenous fluids and analgesia in the postanesthesia care unit before being admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for monitoring before discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was presentation to the emergency department within 2 weeks after tonsillectomy with a related complication. We also recorded hospital readmissions and returns to the operating room for related complications. The primary diagnosis was noted for each complication. RESULTS: Among 473 patients (235 male; mean [SD] age, 7.2 [3.5] years), oral fluid intake after tonsillectomy ranged from 0.7 to 66.7 mL/kg, with a mean (SD) intake of 18.2 (10.8) mL/kg. Mean (SD) time to discharge was 6.96 (1.91) hours (range, 1.68-14.25 hours). Overall, 31 patients (6.6%) presented to the emergency department for a related complication after tonsillectomy. No correlation was found between oral fluid intake after tonsillectomy and presentation to the emergency department (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98-1.08; P = .29). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that oral fluid intake before discharge is not predictive of presentation to the emergency department after tonsillectomy within the ranges studied and at this institution. Therefore, discharge criteria based strictly on thresholds for oral fluid intake may be unnecessary. Further study at multiple institutions using a wider range of fluid intake volumes or a large-scale randomized clinical trial is needed before conclusions can be generalized.",2016,10.1001/jamaoto.2015.3711,142,4,357-363,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Electronic Health Records and Female and Male and Child and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Decision Making and Follow-Up Studies and Postoperative Period and *Emergency Service, Hospital and Patient Readmission/trends and Patient Discharge/trends and *Tonsillectomy and Drinking/*physiology",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

McMullen_2017_Joh.ns,JOUR,Complications of Bilateral Neck Dissection in Thyroid Cancer From a Single High-Volume Center,"McMullen, Caitlin and Rocke, Daniel and Freeman, Jeremy",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: The morbidity of bilateral lateral neck dissection (BLND) for thyroid cancers has not been described in detail. This study delineates the specific complications arising from BLND for thyroid cancers at a single high-volume center. OBJECTIVE: To determine the morbidity associated with BLNDs for differentiated thyroid cancers at our institution. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective review of medical records performed to identify patients having undergone BLNDs for thyroid cancers by a single surgeon at an academic, tertiary medical center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 1988 to 2015. Patients who underwent BLND for papillary, follicular, or medullary thyroid cancers were identified through operative procedure codes and review of operative and pathology reports. The indication for this procedure was suspicious bilateral lateral compartment on imaging and clinical examination. Sixty-two patients who underwent BLND for thyroid cancers, with or without total thyroidectomy and central compartment dissection, were identified. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome measures for this study were unanticipated medical or surgical complications during the operation or in the postoperative period. Secondary measures were oncologic outcomes, including regional structural or biochemical recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 24 were male (39%), and 38 (61%) were female. Their mean age was 46 years (range, 17-80 years). The overall risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism was 37%. There was 1 case of unanticipated permanent recurrent nerve paralysis and 1 case of temporary nerve paresis. Postoperative chyle fistula occurred in 6 cases (10%). There were 3 readmissions within 30 days of surgery, 1 pulmonary embolism, and 1 perioperative mortality. Fifty percent of patients had pN0 contralateral necks despite preoperative clinical suspicion. Four patients were found to have anaplastic thyroid cancers intraoperatively. Five patients (8%) developed nodal recurrence in the neck. Four patients died of their disease within available follow-up (mean, 3.2 years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bilateral lateral neck dissection for thyroid cancers confers a significant amount of morbidity, including a significant rate of hypoparathyroidism. Knowledge of the complications of this procedure, especially in the setting of questionable survival benefit, may assist in preoperative decision-making and patient counseling.",2017,10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3670,143,4,376-381,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology and Carcinoma/pathology/*surgery and Hospitals, High-Volume and Hypoparathyroidism/*epidemiology and Neck Dissection/*adverse effects and Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery",NA,NA,2017/04/01/,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The decision to operate is made clinically. Although pyriform aperture width is used for diagnosing CNPAS, it does not fully characterize stenosis of the nasal cavity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of additional metrics for evaluating CNPAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The medical records of 13 patients with CNPAS treated from 2007 through 2012 at a single tertiary pediatric facility were retrospectively examined. Data on patient demographic characteristics, known genetic abnormalities, and hospital courses were extracted. Computed tomographic images were evaluated for pyriform aperture width; maxillary-nasal angle (MNA), defined as the angle between the anterior maxilla and anterior-posterior nasal axis; and choanal width. INTERVENTIONS: Medical management and surgical management. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pyriform aperture width, MNA, and choanal width. RESULTS: Six of 13 patients underwent medical management, and 7 patients underwent surgical treatment. For patients who were managed medically as compared with those managed surgically, the evaluation revealed a larger pyriform aperture width (median [interquartile range {IQR}], 5.6 [5.4-6.1] vs 4.6 [4.5-4.7] mm; P = .03) and MNA (median [IQR], 70<c2><b0> [63<c2><b0>-73<c2><b0>] vs 59<c2><b0> [59<c2><b0>-64<c2><b0>]; P = .048) but no significant difference in choanal width (median [IQR], 11.0 [9.6-12.2] vs 11.9 [10.3-11.9] mm; P = .76). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The MNA, when used in conjunction with pyriform aperture width, provides additional pertinent information to supplement clinical decision making in the evaluation of patients with CNPAS. These measurements may be helpful in identifying patients who should undergo surgical intervention, although additional studies would be required to allow predictive use of the MNA.",2015,10.1001/jamaoto.2015.0639,141,6,539-542,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Retrospective Studies and Infant, Newborn and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Choanal Atresia/complications/*diagnostic imaging/surgery and Constriction, Pathologic/complications/congenital/diagnostic imaging/surgery and Maxilla/*diagnostic imaging and Nasal Obstruction/*congenital/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/surgery and Nose/*abnormalities/*diagnostic imaging and Pyriform Sinus/diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jacobson_2013_Joh.ns,JOUR,Internal mammary artery and vein as recipient vessels in head and neck reconstruction,"Jacobson, Adam S. and Smith, Mark and Urken, Mark L.",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Free-tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction has evolved since the mid-1950s. A variety of different recipient arteries and veins have been described for use in head and neck reconstruction. In our experience, the internal mammary artery (IMA) and internal mammary vein (IMV) have become increasingly important for achieving successful microvascular reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the efficacy of the IMA and IMV recipient vessels in head and neck reconstruction, highlighting the different techniques used to harvest these vessels and outline decision making when approaching a neck where commonly used vessels are unavailable. DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Outpatient clinic setting. PARTICIPANTS: All free-tissue transfers performed between 2005 and 2011. All patients in whom the IMA or IMV recipient vessels were used were included. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve cases were performed with IMA and IMV harvest. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Donor site, flap used, recipient artery and vein, success of transfer, flap survival, and presence of donor site complications. RESULTS: The IMA and IMV were harvested in 12 patients, with 11 successful free-tissue transfers. In 1 patient, the vessels were unusable, and a regional tissue transfer was performed.

Davies_2017_Joh.ns,JOUR,Experience of US Patients Who Self-identify as Having an Overdiagnosed Thyroid Cancer: A Qualitative Analysis,"Davies, Louise and Hendrickson, Chase D. and Hanson, Gregory S.",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Overdiagnosis of cancer-the identification of cancers that are unlikely to progress-is a source of discomfort and challenge for patients, physicians, and health care systems. A major cause of this discomfort is the inability to know prospectively with certainty which cancers are overdiagnosed. In thyroid cancer, as patients have begun to understand this concept, some individuals are independently deciding not to intervene, despite this practice not yet being widely accepted. OBJECTIVE: To describe the current experience of people who independently self-identify as having an overdiagnosed cancer and elect not to intervene. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, semistructured interviews were conducted between July 1 and December 31, 2015, with 22 community-dwelling adults aged 21 to 75 years who had an incidentally identified thyroid finding that was known or suspected to be malignant and who questioned the intervention recommended by their physicians. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The experience of individuals who self-identify as having an overdiagnosed cancer and elect not to intervene. RESULTS: Of the 22 people interviewed (16 females and 6 males; mean age, 48.5 years), 18 had elected not to intervene on their thyroid finding and had been living with the decision for a mean of 39 months (median, 40 months; range, 1-88 months). Twelve of the 18 participants reported that they experienced significant anxiety about cancer progression, but had considered reasons for choosing nonintervention: understanding issues of precision in diagnostic testing and the varied behavior of cancer, surgical risks, medication use, and low risk of death from the cancer. Twelve participants described their decisions as met with nonreassuring, unsupportive responses. Medical professionals, friends, and internet discussion groups told them they were ""being stupid,"" ""were wrong,"" or were ""crazy"" to not intervene. Although 14 individuals said they wished to connect with others about their experiences, only 3 reported success in doing so. Fifteen participants reported that they managed their overall experience through secret keeping. By the time of this study, 5 of the 18 individuals had discontinued surveillance, the recommended alternative to intervention. Despite this, only 7 participants ""wished they did not know"" about their thyroid finding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Isolation and anxiety characterize the current experience of patients with thyroid cancer who are living with the decision to not intervene. These patients are at risk of disengaging from health care. Successful de-escalation of intervention for patients who self-identify as having overdiagnosed cancers requires explicit social and health system support and education. We hypothesize that improved support would also promote quality of care by increasing the likelihood that patients could be kept engaged for recommended surveillance.",2017,10.1001/jamaoto.2016.4749,143,7,663-669,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Social Isolation and Disease Progression and Anxiety/psychology and Incidental Findings and Medical Overuse/*statistics & numerical data and Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*psychology,NA,NA,2017/07/01/,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, few studies have reported the long-term outcomes following VFSI. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence rates of symptom recurrence and secondary interventions following VFSI for benign vocal fold lesions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The cohort included 189 patients with vocal fold lesions who had received VFSI as the primary treatment between August 2011 and September 2013. EXPOSURES: All participants underwent VFSI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Long-term surveillance was conducted through structured telephonic interviews and by reviewing medical charts every 6 months over a 2-year period. We assessed the 10-item voice handicap index, dysphonic symptoms, and whether the patients had received any additional interventions after the initial VFSI. RESULTS: The 189 participants (32 men and 157 women; mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years [range, 20-74 years] included patients who had undergone VFSI for vocal fold nodules (n = 72), polyps (n = 72), or mucus-retention cysts (n = 45). Following VFSI, 141 patients (74.6%; 23 men and 118 women; mean age, 39 years [range, 20-70 years]) showed positive response (ie, clinically significant symptom resolution without the need for additional procedures) and received long-term surveillance. The median follow-up period was 19.4 months, and 2 patients were lost to follow-up postoperatively within 1 year. The cumulative failure rates (subjective symptom recurrence plus secondary treatments) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after VFSI were 12%, 17%, 24%, and 32%, respectively. When the initial response rate to VFSI (141 of 189, 74.6%) was considered altogether, VFSI remained effective after 2 years in 50% of the initially recruited 189 patients. The highest rate of long-term effectiveness of VFSI occurred in vocal polyps (54%), followed by nodules (49%) and cysts (43%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates that VFSI can be beneficial in managing benign vocal lesions, especially when first-line treatments are unsuitable. However, the long-term results of this study clarify that a substantial number of patients experience symptom recurrence or receive subsequent interventions within 2 years after VFSI; this should be considered in medical decision making.",2017,10.1001/jamaoto.2016.4418,143,6,589-594,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Population Surveillance and Recurrence and Vocal Cords/*pathology and Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*administration & dosage and Injections, Intralesional and Voice Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology and Voice Quality",NA,NA,2017/06/01/,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Symptom quantification is paramount for surgical and medical decision making. Acoustic rhinometry is a relatively new technique aimed at the objective assessment of nasal obstruction. There is no standardized method for the objective assessment of the pediatric nasal airway. OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlations between acoustic rhinometry (AR), subjective symptoms, and endoscopic findings in children presenting with nasal obstruction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, exploratory, diagnostic study of prospectively collected data from a multidisciplinary airway clinic (pulmonology, orthodontics, and otolaryngology) database at a tertiary academic referral center. Data were collected over a 2-year period (2010-2012) from 65 nonsyndromic children (38 boys) 7 years and older (mean [SD] age, 10.3 [2.5] years [range, 7-14 years]), presenting with persistent nasal obstructive symptoms for at least 1 year, without signs and symptoms of sinus disease. INTERVENTIONS: We collected patient demographics and medical history information including allergy, asthma, and sleep-disordered breathing. Subjective nasal obstruction was scored using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sleep-disordered breathing was assessed using overnight pulse oximetry. The adenoid size, septal position, and visual severity of chronic rhinitis (endoscopic rhinitis score [ERS]) were rated on nasal endoscopy by 2 independent reviewers and validated by agreement. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) was undertaken before and after use of a decongestant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed to explore interrelationships between subjective nasal obstruction VAS, AR, and nasal endoscopy. RESULTS: Among the 65 patients, 28 (43%) had symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, 14 (22%) had allergic rhinitis, 10 (15%) had asthma, 27 (41%) had grade 3 or 4 adenoidal obstruction, 28 (43%) had an ERS of 2, 6 (9%) had an ERS of 3, and 19 (29%) had septal deviation. Significant correlations were found between subjective nasal obstruction VAS score and ERS (r = -0.364, P = .003), ERS and minimal cross-sectional area before decongestion (r = -0.278, P = .03), and adenoid size and calculated nasal resistance after decongestion (r = 0.430, P < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the ERS was the only significant predictor of VAS score (<ce><b2> of -22.089; 95% CI, -35.56 to -8.61 [P = .002]). No predictors were identified for AR variables. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among the evaluated tools, endoscopy appears to be the most reliable tool to estimate the degree of subjective nasal symptoms.",2015,10.1001/jamaoto.2015.0468,141,6,550-555,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Cross-Sectional Studies and Sex Distribution and Cohort Studies and Causality and Comorbidity and Age Distribution and Medical History Taking and *Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery and *Rhinometry, Acoustic and Asthma/diagnosis/epidemiology and Nasal Obstruction/*diagnosis/epidemiology and Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology and Rhinitis, Allergic/diagnosis/epidemiology and Sleep Apnea Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To characterize our experience with infarction in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) after FNA and review existing cases of infarcted PTCs in the literature to better understand this phenomenon. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective case series and review of literature at a tertiary medical center (University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA], Medical Center). All patients who had a surgical pathologic diagnosis of infarcted PTC and who underwent FNA prior to surgery at UCLA from June 2006 to June 2012 were identified. There were 620 cases of PTC and 12 cases of infarcted PTC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Demographic data, FNA cytologic findings, and surgical pathologic data were gathered for each patient. A comprehensive literature search for infarcted PTC was performed. RESULTS: Twelve cases of infarcted PTC were found in a total of 620 cases of PTC (1.9%). The mean (SD) time interval between the last FNA and surgery was 52 (35) days (range, 13-133 days). All patients received a diagnosis of infarcted PTC after thyroidectomy was performed. Focal infarction was found in 4 patients (33%), and near-total infarction was found in 8 patients (67%). Five patients (47%) had the follicular variant of PTC, making it the most common subtype in our series. A thorough literature search yielded 11 articles reporting a total of 26 cases of infarcted PTC after FNA. To our knowledge, our case series on infarcted PTC is the largest reported series in the literature. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although infarction of PTC after FNA occurs infrequently, it may lead to difficulties in histologic diagnosis. Awareness of this phenomenon and its histologic associations, along with careful reevaluation of the FNA and surgical specimens, is important for appropriate diagnosis and subsequent treatment. At this point, infarction in PTC should not alarm a head and neck surgeon to change management, but future prospective studies with a large population of patients with infarcted PTCs are needed to establish the impact of infarction on differences in treatment outcomes for therapies that may be used in PTCs.",2014,10.1001/jamaoto.2013.5650,140,1,52-57,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Biopsy, Fine-Needle/*adverse effects and Carcinoma, Papillary and Carcinoma/*pathology/surgery and Infarction/*etiology and Thyroid Cancer, Papillary and Thyroid Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery and Thyroidectomy and Ultrasonography, Interventional",NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is unclear which interventions should be attempted and in which order. While cost-effectiveness analyses have suggested that TESPAL is the most responsible use of health care resources, physicians must also consider patient risk to maintain a patient-centered decision-making process. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk associated with the management of intractable epistaxis. DESIGN AND SETTING: A risk analysis was performed using literature-reported probabilities of treatment failure and adverse event likelihoods in an emergency department and otolaryngology hospital admissions setting. The literature search included articles from 1980 to May 2014. The analysis was modeled for a 50-year-old man with no other medical comorbidities. Severities of complications were modeled based on Environmental Protection Agency recommendations, and health state utilities were monetized based on a willingness to pay $22<e2><80><af>500 per quality-adjusted life-year. Six management strategies were developed using posterior packing, TESPAL, and embolization in various sequences (P, T, and E, respectively). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total risk associated with each algorithm quantified in US dollars. RESULTS: Algorithms involving posterior packing and TESPAL as first-line interventions were found to be similarly low risk. The lowest-risk approaches were P-T-E ($2437.99 [range, $1482.83-$6976.40]), T-P-E ($2840.65 [range, $1136.89-$8604.97]), and T-E-P ($2867.82 [range, $1141.05-$9833.96]). Embolization as a first-line treatment raised the total risk significantly owing to the risk of cerebrovascular events (E-T-P, $11<e2><80><af>945.42 [range, $3911.43-$31<e2><80><af>847.00]; and E-P-T, $11<e2><80><af>945.71 [range, $3919.91-$31<e2><80><af>767.66]).

Fortunately, emerging technologies offer promise to reduce these barriers for research. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively compare the outcomes of the 3 most common surgical approaches for idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS), a rare airway disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this international, prospective, 3-year multicenter cohort study, 810 patients with untreated, newly diagnosed, or previously treated iSGS were enrolled after undergoing a surgical procedure (endoscopic dilation [ED], endoscopic resection with adjuvant medical therapy [ERMT], or cricotracheal resection [CTR]). Patients were recruited from clinician practices in the North American Airway Collaborative and an online iSGS community on Facebook. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was days from initial surgical procedure to recurrent surgical procedure. Secondary end points included quality of life using the Clinical COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Questionnaire (CCQ), Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), Eating Assessment Test-10 (EAT-10), the 12-Item Short-Form Version 2 (SF-12v2), and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Of 810 patients in this cohort, 798 (98.5%) were female and 787 (97.2%) were white, with a median age of 50 years (interquartile range, 43-58 years). Index surgical procedures were ED (n = 603; 74.4%), ERMT (n = 121; 14.9%), and CTR (n = 86; 10.6%). Overall, 185 patients (22.8%) had a recurrent surgical procedure during the 3-year study, but recurrence differed by modality (CTR, 1 patient [1.2%]; ERMT, 15 [12.4%]; and ED, 169 [28.0%]). Weighted, propensity score-matched, Cox proportional hazards regression models showed ED was inferior to ERMT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.16; 95% CI, 1.8-5.5). Among successfully treated patients without recurrence, those treated with CTR had the best CCQ (0.75 points) and SF-12v2 (54 points) scores and worst VHI-10 score (13 points) 360 days after enrollment as well as the greatest perioperative risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 810 patients with iSGS, endoscopic dilation, the most popular surgical approach for iSGS, was associated with a higher recurrence rate compared with other procedures. Cricotracheal resection offered the most durable results but showed the greatest perioperative risk and the worst long-term voice outcomes. Endoscopic resection with medical therapy was associated with better disease control compared with ED and had minimal association with vocal function.

Using an objective structured clinical examination to evaluate surgical decision-making,"Franzese, Christine",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES: To create an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) tailored to surgical residents that uses surgical case scenarios appropriate for the experience level of the resident to evaluate whether residents understand the indications for a specific surgery, identify when indications are met, and make the appropriate decision to proceed with an operation. METHODS: The surgical OSCE consisted of two case scenarios: a junior case created for postgraduate year (PGY) 2 to 3 level residents and a senior case created for PGY 4 to 5 level residents. Four senior residents and four junior residents in the otolaryngology department participated. Residents were instructed to proceed as if they had all the capabilities of the otolaryngology clinic. Recordings were made of each encounter and were reviewed by two separate faculty member with expertise in each case. Faculty evaluated whether surgical indications were elicited by history, whether certain physical examination or radiographic findings were recognized, whether residents made the correct diagnosis, and whether residents not only made the decision to proceed with surgery but also indicated the correct surgery. RESULTS: Seniors (100%) were better at obtaining needed surgical information and indications than juniors (25%). Seniors were more willing to make the decision to proceed with surgery (100%), whereas no juniors actually scheduled surgery. The reasons for this ranged from failure to elicit surgical indications to lack of surety in proceeding with surgery. All seniors recommended the appropriate surgery, but only 75% correctly identified the need for emergent intervention. Results of evaluations were reviewed with each resident individually. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical OSCE was successful in evaluating resident surgical decision-making. Juniors were not as capable as seniors in eliciting surgical indications and in ""making the jump"" to proceed with surgery. These results were used by our faculty to work with juniors on surgical history-taking and decision-making. These results were also useful in identifying seniors who could recognize an emergency situation.",2007,10.1097/MLG.0b013e31812e9621,117,11,1938-1942,eng,0023-852X,"Humans and Clinical Competence and *Educational Measurement and *Decision Making and *Internship and Residency and Education, Medical, Graduate/*methods and Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures/*education",NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,Laryngoscope,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rudmik_2014_Joh.ns,JOUR,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation vs arterial embolization for intractable epistaxis,"Rudmik, Luke and Leung, Randy",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Intractable epistaxis is a common otolaryngology emergency. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) and endovascular arterial embolization both provide excellent success rates, and therefore the decision to choose one over the other can be challenging. OBJECTIVE: To aid in decision making by evaluating the cost-effectiveness of TESPAL vs endovascular arterial embolization for intractable epistaxis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Economic evaluation using a decision tree model with a 14-day time horizon for emergency department consultations for patients with intractable epistaxis defined as persistent bleeding despite bilateral anterior nasal packing. The economic perspective was the health care third-party payer. Effectiveness and probability data were obtained from the published medical literature. Costs were obtained from the published literature, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database, and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed, including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Comparative treatment groups were (1) TESPAL and (2) embolization. INTERVENTIONS: TESPAL and endovascular arterial embolization. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for successful control of epistaxis. RESULTS: The reference case demonstrated that the embolization strategy was more effective but more costly compared with the TESPAL strategy: $22,324.70 per 0.70 effectiveness compared with $12,484.14 per 0.68 of effectiveness, respectively. The embolization vs TESPAL ICER was $492,028, which is higher than any willingness to pay (WTP), suggesting that TESPAL is the cost-effective decision. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 77.6% and 73.7% certainty that the TESPAL strategy is cost-effective at WTP thresholds of $10,000 and $50,000, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results from this economic evaluation suggest that when both TESPAL and arterial embolization are viable options (based on patient and institutional factors), TESPAL is the more cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with intractable epistaxis.",2014,10.1001/jamaoto.2014.1450,140,9,802-808,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"United States and Humans and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Models, Economic and Multivariate Analysis and Emergency Service, Hospital and *Decision Trees and Epistaxis/*economics/*therapy and Ligation/economics and Embolization, Therapeutic/*economics and Endoscopy/*economics and Maxillary Artery/*surgery",NA,NA,2014/09//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a logical pathologic condition to evaluate for effectiveness of remote diagnosis given its prevalence and the paucity of on-site otolaryngologists at many institutions. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of otolaryngology telemedical consultation in triaging and diagnosing patients with suspected PTA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2018, at 3 tertiary care hospitals among 31 consecutive patients aged 18 to 85 years for whom the otolaryngology department was consulted to assess for PTA. Statistical analysis was conducted from July 1 to September 30, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Telemedical evaluation of suspected PTA by 5 attending otolaryngologists blinded to patients' history aside from the chief report of odynophagia. Otolaryngologists rated each patient video on whether they believed the patient had a PTA and whether the case warranted prompt evaluation by an otolaryngologist. Predictions were compared with the criterion standard of drainage or negative needle aspiration. Otolaryngologists additionally assessed video quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of accurate diagnosis and triage of PTA based on otolaryngologists' review of oropharyngeal examinations recorded using standard smartphone cameras, as well as percentage of videos of oropharyngeal examinations using standard smartphone cameras deemed of sufficiently high quality for clinical decision-making. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (16 women [51.6%]; mean age, 31.9 years [range, 18-62 years]) were recruited, and 16 patients (51.6%) had a PTA. Comparing otolaryngologists' predictions with PTA status by the criterion standard, the prediction was consistent with that of the criterion standard 81% of the time averaged across otolaryngologists (mean diagnostic accuracy, 0.81). Similarly, the mean diagnostic accuracy was 0.83 when comparing the otolaryngologist's suggestion for a prompt in-person evaluation with actual PTA status by the criterion standard. Comparing patients who were deemed to require prompt otolaryngology evaluation and those with PTA by the criterion standard, mean sensitivity was 90%. Videos were rated as of sufficiently high quality to make a diagnosis in 154 of 155 videos (99.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that telemedical consultation is a viable, cost-conscious, efficient, and safe approach to PTA management. Despite having some difficulty diagnosing PTAs based on ""history concerning for PTA"" and oropharyngeal video alone, otolaryngologists are able to determine, with high sensitivity, which patients require prompt otolaryngology evaluation. The recording of consistently high-quality video using a standard smartphone camera is achievable without formal training.",2020,10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1972,146,10,909-913,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Feasibility Studies and Sensitivity and Specificity and *Smartphone and *Triage and *Otolaryngology and *Remote Consultation and Peritonsillar Abscess/*diagnosis,NA,NA,2020/10/01/,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tufano_2015_Joh.ns,JOUR,Incidental thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer: considerations before determining management,"Tufano, Ralph P. and Noureldine, Salem I. and Angelos, Peter",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"The worldwide incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing substantially, almost exclusively attributable to small papillary thyroid cancers. Increased use of diagnostic imaging is considered the most likely explanation for this reported rise, but other factors may also be contributing. The increase in health care expenditures related to managing these presumably low-risk cancers, without a clear patient benefit, has resulted in a backlash against the early detection of thyroid cancer. Currently, there is no way to confidently predict which incidentally detected thyroid nodule may be the precursor to a more aggressive process. Predictions such as these would require more accurate characterization of the biology of individual thyroid cancers than is currently possible. With time, we might prove our ability to confidently differentiate low-risk from high-risk thyroid cancers, but until that happens, routine screening for thyroid cancer by imaging billed as a ""health checkup"" should not be performed. However, incidentally detected thyroid nodules should be reported, and a clear medical team management plan should be developed. Our ethical responsibility is to provide patients with objective, evidence-based information about their disease status, not to assume that we know what is best for them by selectively withholding information. In addition, providing patients with psychosocial assistance will help them process the information necessary to make informed decisions that will provide them with the most value when a small thyroid nodule or cancer is incidentally identified. Herein, we summarize the epidemiological data for disease incidence, discuss some controversies in disease management, and outline the key elements and ethical considerations of informed decision making as they apply to managing incidentally detected thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.",2015,10.1001/jamaoto.2015.0647,141,6,566-572,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Physician-Patient Relations and Risk Factors and Patient Education as Topic and Incidence and Survival Rate and Cause of Death and Diagnosis, Differential and Global Health and Biopsy, Fine-Needle and Republic of Korea/epidemiology and *Disease Management and *Incidental Findings and Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/therapy and Carcinoma, Papillary/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/therapy and Early Detection of Cancer/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data and Thyroid Gland/pathology and Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy and Thyroid Nodule/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/therapy and Thyroidectomy/economics and Unnecessary Procedures/economics and Watchful Waiting/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To explore the addition of functional performance to other clinical factors for association with 3 patient outcomes: 30-day unplanned readmission (UR), 90-day medical complications, and overall survival (OS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary care center with patients surgically treated for squamous cell cancer of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx from January 2012 to December 2016. All analysis took place between January 2018 and November 2018. Data from 2 registries were analyzed, supplemented with medical record review. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore association of preoperative functional performance with outcomes. Conjunctive consolidation was used to create a useful clinical severity staging system, which included functional performance (estimated from metabolic equivalent [MET] score: <4, light-intensity activities; <e2><89><a5>4 at least moderate-intensity activities); overall comorbidity severity; preoperative weight loss; and TNM tumor staging. Logistic regression was used to assess the prognostic accuracy of the clinical severity staging system for 30-day UR and 90-day complications, and Cox proportional hazard regression for OS. EXPOSURES: All patients underwent surgical treatment for head and neck cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were 30-day UR and 90-day complications; the secondary outcome was OS. RESULTS: For the 657 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 62.0 (11.3) years; 73% were men (n = 477), and 88% were white (n = 580). A total of 75 (11%) had a 30-day UR; 204 (31%) developed a 90-day complication; and 127 (19%) patients died during the observation period. Individually, poor functional performance (<4 METs), high comorbidity burden, preoperative weight loss, and advanced TNM stage were associated with all 3 outcomes; the increased risk for each outcome ranged from 1.5 to 3.0 times the reference range. Using these 4 variables in combination, the 4-category clinical severity staging system demonstrated a strong association between severity stage and all 3 adverse outcomes: 30-day UR (C statistic, 0.63), 90-day complications (C statistic, 0.63), and OS (C statistic, 0.68). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Poor preoperative functional performance, high comorbidity burden, preoperative weight loss, and advanced tumor stage were all associated with worse patient outcomes after head and neck cancer surgery.

STUDY DESIGN: Survey study. METHODS: A survey investigating OSC use was sent to the 1,056 members of the North American Airway Collaborative (NoAAC) iSGS(1000) cohort in January 2018. Responses were merged with the existing NoAAC data set containing extensive demographic data, disease-specific history, and responses to validated patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 755 individuals with iSGS and mean age of 51.8 <c2><b1> 11.6 years were included (99% female, 98% white, 63% college educated) and 58% were OSC users. Younger age, female gender, and college education were each associated with OSC use (P < .05). Users spent 2.5 <c2><b1> 3.3 hours per week on the platforms. Time spent on OSC was not associated with total number of prior treatments. Higher disease anxiety (FoP-Q, R = 0.26, P < .001), lower social support (MOS, R = -0.12, P = .037), and lower level of shared-decision-making with the treating physician (SDM-Q9, R = -0.16, P = .007) were weakly associated with more hours spent engaging an OSC. OSC use influenced treatment and physician choice in 35% and 26% of users, respectively. Increased time spent on OSC use was associated with increased influence on patient medical decisions regarding treatment, surgery, and physician choice (P < .05). CONCLUSION: OSC engagement is common in patients with iSGS. Disease anxiety, social support, and relationship with the physician may influence OSC utilization. More OSC engagement weakly associated with greater OSC influence on patient medical decision-making. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

There is no universally accepted gold standard for high-risk HPV (hrHPV) assessment in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, nor is there a clear understanding of the frequency or role of hrHPV in sites other than oropharynx. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal assessment of hrHPV in FFPE head and neck tumor tissue specimens. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: In the setting of a large Midwestern referral center, assessment of hrHPV by p16 immunohistochemical staining, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-MassArray (PCR-MA), with L1 PGMY-PCR and sequencing to resolve method discordance, was conducted for 338 FFPE oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and oral cavity tumor tissue specimens. Relative sensitivity and specificity were compared to develop a standard optimal test protocol. Tissue specimens were collected from 338 patients with head and neck cancer treated during the period 2001 through 2011 in the departments of Otolaryngology, Radiation Oncology, and Medical Oncology. INTERVENTION: Patients received standard therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Optimal hrHPV identification, detection, and activity in head and neck cancers. RESULTS: Using combined PCR-MA with L1 PGMY-PCR and sequencing for conclusive results, we found PCR-MA to have 99.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity, p16 to have 94.2% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity, and in situ hybridization to have 82.9% sensitivity and 81.0% specificity. Among HPV-positive tumors, HPV16 was most frequently detected, but 10 non-HPV16 types accounted for 6% to 50% of tumors, depending on the site. Overall, 86% of oropharynx, 50% of nasopharynx, and 26% of oral cavity tumors were positive for hrHPV. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PCR-MA has a low DNA (5 ng) requirement effective for testing small tissue samples; high throughput; and rapid identification of HPV types, with high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-MA together with p16INK4a provided accurate assessment of HPV presence, type, and activity and was determined to be the best approach for HPV testing in FFPE head and neck tumor tissue specimens.",2013,10.1001/jamaoto.2013.5460,139,12,1320-1327,eng,2168-619X 2168-6181,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Databases, Factual and Sensitivity and Specificity and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Biopsy, Needle and Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology/virology and In Situ Hybridization/methods and Mouth Neoplasms/pathology/*virology and Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pathology/*virology and Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/pathology/*virology and Papillomaviridae/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity and Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis and Paraffin Embedding and Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods and Tumor Virus Infections/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2013/12//undefined,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for postradiotherapy and/or post-cisplatin chemotherapy hearing loss for patients with head and neck cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center among 242 patients (482 ears) with head and neck cancer who were treated with radiotherapy and/or cisplatin from October 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, and had follow-up audiometric data available. EXPOSURES: Radiotherapy and cisplatin chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient hearing level, as measured by the mean of pure tone audiometry at 1, 2, and 4 kHz on completion of treatment. A multivariable mixed model for predicting the posttreatment pure tone average was developed using only information available to clinicians at the beginning of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients (482 ears; 56 women and 186 men; mean [SD] age, 60 [10] years) were included in the analysis. All patients in the study received radiotherapy, and 105 (43.4%) received cisplatin chemotherapy. The mean (SD) total cumulative cisplatin dose was 298 (109) mg/m2. Patients' ears received a mean (SD) cochlear radiotherapy dose of 15 (13) Gy. The fixed-effects predictions from the predictive model agreed with 77% (95% CI, 73%-81%) of the variability in the posttreatment pure tone average. This predictive model also had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 75% for predicting an observed posttreatment pure tone average greater than 35 dB (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.85). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this study develops the first accurate prediction model of posttreatment hearing in patients with head and neck cancer that is feasible for use in the clinical setting before the initiation of treatment.

RESULTS: No significant differences were found between treatment groups for any demographic characteristic, clinical cofactor, or measure of social support, personality, or the physician-patient relationship. Subjects electing to pursue sinus surgery did report significantly worse average quality-of-life (QOL) scores on the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; P < .001) compared to those electing continued medical therapy (54.6 <c2><b1> 18.9 vs. 39.4 <c2><b1> 17.7), regardless of surgical history or polyp status. SNOT-22 score significantly predicted treatment selection (odds ratio, 1.046; 95% confidence interval, 1.028-1.065; P < .001) and was found to accurately discriminate between subjects choosing endoscopic sinus surgery and those electing medical management 72% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Worse patient-reported disease severity, as measured by the SNOT-22, was significantly associated with the treatment choice for CRS. Strong consideration should be given for incorporating CRS-specific QOL measures into routine clinical practice.

Jr and McIver, Bryan and Randolph, Gregory W.",Head & neck,"BACKGROUND: The primary purposes of this interdisciplinary consensus statement were to review the relevant indications for central neck dissection (CND) in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and to outline the appropriate extent and relevant techniques required to accomplish a safe and effective CND. METHODS: A writing group convened by the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) Endocrine Committee was tasked with identifying the important clinical elements to consider when managing the central neck compartment in patients with PTC based on available evidence in the literature, and the group's collective experience. The position statement paper was then submitted to the full Endocrine Committee, Education Committee, and AHNS Council. RESULTS: This consensus statement was developed to inform the clinical decision-making process when managing the central neck compartment in patients with PTC from the AHNS. This document is intended to provide clarity through definitions as well as a basic guideline from which to manage the central neck. It is our hope that this improves the quality and reduces variation in management of the central neck, facilitates communication, and furthers research for patients with thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: This represents, in our opinion, contemporary optimal surgical care for this patient population and is endorsed by the American Head and Neck Society. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We explored whether patient demographics, surgical variables, use of adjuvant treatment, and time since surgery were associated with patient-reported swallowing outcome. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of laryngectomees in eight UK hospitals. Demographic, treatment, and surgical variables were drawn from medical notes. The swallowing outcomes after laryngectomy (SOAL) questionnaire captured perceived swallowing outcome. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty one participants had complete data on treatment-related variables. In regression analysis, having a free jejunum flap repair and requiring chemoradiation were the only two variables that added significantly to the model of worse self-reported swallowing outcome (R(2) adjusted = .23, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The SOAL is a sensitive measure of self-reported swallowing outcome after laryngectomy.

While this macroeconomic approach is useful for population-level decision making, patient-level decision making is variable and driven by personal and financial implications. This microeconomic study seeks to identify threshold levels of infection where surgery becomes worthwhile to patients based on costs, lost income, and quality of life. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-Benefit Breakeven Analysis. METHODS: A breakeven analysis was constructed from literature reported medical and surgical response rates, change in quality of life as a result of intervention, and costs to patients. RESULTS: A breakeven threshold occurs when patients suffer from 1.3-2.8 episodes per year under the conservative assumption that the effects of surgery do not extend beyond 19 months--the longest outcomes reported. DISCUSSION: Due to possible confusion with URTIs, we have adopted an approach similar to that advocated by the Rhinosinusitis Task Force. Given the average number of URTIs suffered by adults annually is 1.4-2.3. We suggest adding this to the threshold number of episodes calculated in the present model. Under the most conservative assumptions, this suggests that patients should consider surgery when suffering from five or more episodes per year.",2013,10.1002/lary.23504,123,1,11-16,eng,1531-4995 0023-852X,Humans and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Quality of Life and Severity of Illness Index and Recurrence and Acute Disease and *Decision Making and Rhinitis/economics/*surgery and Sinusitis/economics/*surgery,NA,NA,2013/01//undefined,Laryngoscope,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bergeron_2018_TheLar,JOUR,A shared decision-making tool for obstructive sleep apnea without tonsillar hypertrophy: A randomized controlled trial,"Bergeron, Mathieu and Duggins, Angela L. and Cohen, Aliza P. and Tiemeyer, Karin and Mullen, Lisa and Crisalli, Joseph and McArthur, Angela and Ishman, Stacey L.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Shared decision-making is a process whereby patients and clinicians jointly establish a treatment plan integrating clinical evidence and patient values and preferences. Although this approach has been successfully employed in numerous medical disciplines, often using shared decision-making tools, otolaryngologic research assessing its use is scant. Our primary objective was therefore to determine if the tools we developed reduced decisional conflict for children with obstructive sleep apnea without tonsillar hypertrophy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria who were referred to our multidisciplinary upper airway center. Study patients used a shared decision-making tool whereas controls did not. Measures of decisional conflict (SURE [Sure of myself, Understanding information, Risk benefit ratio, Encouragement], CollaboRATE, and the Decisional Conflict Scale [DCS]) were obtained pre- and postvisit. RESULTS: We assessed 50 families (study group = 24, controls = 26). The mean age was 8.8 <c2><b1> 6.6 years, 44% were female, 86% were white, and the mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was 12.7 <c2><b1> 15.6 events/hour. The previsit mean DCS score was similar for controls (42.7) and study patients (40.8) (P = .38). The postvisit mean DCS score for controls was 13.3 and for study patients 6.1 (P = .034). Improvement in this score was greater in the study group (P = .03). At previsit evaluation, 63% of controls and 58% of study patients were unsure about their options. Postvisit, this improved to 4.1% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Families counseled regarding treatment options using shared decision-making tools had significantly less decisional conflict than those who did not use these tools. These positive outcomes suggest that clinicians should consider integrating this approach into clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b.

There is limited literature to support clinical decision-making. To evaluate outcomes and efficacy, we performed a retrospective medical chart review of patients who received combined anterograde retrograde esophageal dilation (CARD) between 2002 and 2009 at our institution. METHODS: Fifteen patients were identified who developed a stricture requiring CARD after treatment for head and neck cancers. Outcomes were pretreatment and posttreatment diet, gastrostomy tube status, and operative complications. RESULTS: Six of 15 patients were gastrostomy tube-free at last follow-up and 11 of 15 patients were taking oral nutrition. There were 4 complications. One patient died. Two gastrostomy tube site complications occurred. One patient sustained a dental injury. CONCLUSION: CARD offers benefit to most patients.

Arambula_2019_TheLar,JOUR,"Patient opinions regarding surgeon presence, trainee participation, and overlapping surgery","Arambula, Alexandra and Bonnet, Kemberlee and Schlundt, David G. and Langerman, Alexander",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES: To explore patient opinions and underlying values regarding overlapping surgery (OS) scenarios, specifically evaluating the effect of attending surgeon presence and availability, as well as trainee participation on patient comfort level and willingness to consent. STUDY DESIGN: Mixed methods. METHODS: Forty adults participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews included vignettes involving three scenarios of OS (1: attending present; 2: attending absent for wound closure; 3: attending absent and unavailable for wound closure, with covering attending), visual analog scale ratings of participants' comfort with scenarios, and cognitive debriefing. Themes and subthemes were identified using hierarchical coding of transcripts, and quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed anticipated decreases in comfort with decreasing attending presence/availability (mean comfort level 94% vs. 78% vs. 63% for scenarios 1 vs. 2 vs. 3, P < 0.005), although many patients reported improved comfort with scenario 3 if meeting the covering attending. Participants demonstrated a preference for less trainee involvement (P < 0.005, scenario 1) and greater trainee experience (P < 0.05, all scenarios). However, not all individuals were uncomfortable with attending absence or trainee independence. Themes important for decision making included trust in the surgeon, surgeon experience, trainee involvement, disease severity, cost, and wait time. CONCLUSION: Patients varied highly in their willingness to consent to OS scenarios. In settings of trainee independence and covering surgeons, many patients desired meeting these members of the treatment team, which improved comfort for some. For some patients, tradeoffs and incentives of timeliness, cost, and convenience modified their willingness to have OS.

DESIGN: An anonymous, web-based survey of chief residents in otolaryngology. METHODS: Respondents described their experience in pediatric otolaryngology using a 5-point Likert scale and reported their comfort levels (yes/no) with various medical and surgical issues in pediatric otolaryngology. RESULTS: The survey was successfully completed by 70 respondents, representing a response rate of 26%. The majority of the respondents reported positive experiences with regard to the following aspects of pediatric otolaryngology training: didactics (81%), clinical research opportunities (78%), positive faculty role models (87%), career mentorship (74%), independent medical (84%) and surgical (81%) decision-making, and overall comprehensive residency experience (87%). Basic science research opportunities (50%) were reported as less available than clinical research opportunities (78%) (P = .002). Compared with other surveyed issues, a lower comfort level was reported for management of craniofacial anomalies (P < .001), excision of large lymphatic malformations (P < .001), cochlear implantation (P < .001), laryngotracheal reconstruction (P < .001), and surgical correction of velopharyngeal insufficiency (P < .001).

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, provider-based questionnaire. METHODS: Five short-term and five long-term treatment outcomes of cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma were chosen by a focus group of head and neck oncologists. A pilot survey was developed in an online platform, and feedback from extramural head and neck oncologists was used to refine it for institutional review board submission and formal deployment. Respondents were surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists with experience in treating oropharyngeal carcinoma. One hundred five responses were analyzed, of which 67% were from providers with >10 years in practice and 79% were from providers who treat >15 new oropharyngeal carcinoma patients per year. RESULTS: A particular overall chemoradiation toxicity class is accounted for by two adjoining distress levels (>90% occurrence) for both short-term and long-term outcomes. Providers deemed mucositis and nausea, and pain and xerostomia the most distressing short-term and long-term toxicities, respectively. Providers were split as to their impression of the relative importance that patients place on short-term versus long-term outcomes when considering treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical tool to represent overall chemoradiation toxicity considering short-term and long-term outcomes has been developed by analyzing provider-centric responses to a realistic clinical scenario.

Cooper_2020_TheLar,JOUR,An Evaluation of the Presence of Spin in the Abstracts of Tonsillectomy Systematic Reviews,"Cooper, Craig M. and Johnson, Austin and Gray, Harrison and Vassar, Matt",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Spin-the practice of adding or omitting information intentionally or unintentionally to make the results of a study more favorable-may influence clinical decision making, especially when present in study abstracts. Here, we quantify and characterize the presence of spin in the abstracts of systematic reviews regarding tonsillectomy. METHODS: This study is an analysis of systematic review abstracts. Searches were conducted on September 23, 2019 on PubMed and Embase using the advanced search feature to retrieve systematic reviews regarding tonsillectomies. The nine most severe forms of spin were then evaluated. Spin was classified by two investigators in parallel, with each blinded to the classifications of the other. Study characteristics were also recorded in duplicate. Consensus meetings between investigators were held to resolve disagreements. RESULTS: In the 85 included systematic reviews, at least one form of spin was present in 44.7% (38/85) of abstracts. Journals with higher impact factors were less likely to contain spin in the abstracts of systematic reviews (point biserial correlation coefficient of -0.30). No statistically significant associations were found between the presence of spin and intervention type (P = .56) or adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (P = .08); however, there was a significant association between spin and funding source (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Spin was common in the abstracts of our sample of tonsillectomy systematic reviews.

Information on perioperative medication errors is scarce. This study was aimed at identifying the nature, cause, and potential remedies for medication errors in otolaryngologic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective and descriptive. METHODS: Clinicians were incentivized for reporting possible medication errors that occurred from the preoperative through the first postoperative clinic visit over a 2-month period. Each report was investigated by an expert panel to determine validity, preventability, contributing factors, and potential preventative measures. A random sample of procedures and clinic visits were monitored for compliance with safe medication practices and information flow. RESULTS: From 589 surgeries, 20 medication errors were reported (two preoperative, four operative, five during hospital admission, two in transition between services, four during discharge, and three postoperative). Errors included wrong dose (seven), omitted dose (six), wrong drug (five), wrong site (two), and unnecessary drug (one). Causes included failure to consider weight-based dosing, use accurate drug references, calculate the total medication supply needed, verify the administration site, consider pertinent patient information (e.g., allergies), reconcile medications upon transfers, and document medication histories. Use of preprinted order forms was flawed, and discharge instructions were insufficient to guide patients postoperatively.

METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2013, 76 patients received TORS for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Clinical predictors of adjuvant therapy were analyzed and comparisons were made between recommended treatment guidelines for up-front surgery versus definitive nonsurgical approaches. RESULTS: Advanced N classification, human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumor, extracapsular spread (ECS; 26 of 76), perineural invasion (PNI; 14 of 76), and positive margins (7 of 76) were significant predictors of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (p < .05). Up-front TORS deintensified adjuvant therapy; 76% of stage I/II and 46% of stage III/IV patients avoided CRT. Conversely, pathologic staging resulted in 33% of patients who would have received radiotherapy (RT) alone based on clinical staging, to be intensified to receive adjuvant CRT. CONCLUSION: The TORS approach deintensifies adjuvant therapy and provides valuable pathologic information to intensify treatment in select patients. TORS may be less effective in deintensification of adjuvant therapy in patients with clinically advanced N classification disease. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Patients who had a preoperative FNA comprised the study cohort. RESULTS: A total of 1,074 consecutive patients underwent parotidectomy during the study period; of those, 477 had a preoperative FNA. FNA was nondiagnostic in 26 cases. There were 29 false positives (6.4%), 26 false negatives (5.8%), 122 true positives (27.1%), and 274 true negatives (60.8%). The sensitivity and specificity of FNA were 82.4% and 90.4%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 80.8% and a negative predictive value of 91.3%. The overall accuracy of preoperative FNA was 87.8%. The preoperative FNA resulted in a change in the surgical plan in 85 (18.9%) cases. In 66 of these cases (78%), surgery was extended to include neck dissection at time of resection. In 10 cases, FNA led to surgical management over surveillance. In 11 cases, FNA downgraded the extent of surgery planned to an excisional biopsy. CONCLUSION: Preoperative FNA is a valuable adjunct in the surgical management of parotid lesions, with high specificity for the detection of malignant disease. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

Datema_2010_H.n,JOUR,Impact of comorbidity on short-term mortality and overall survival of head and neck cancer patients,"Datema, Frank R. and Ferrier, Marciano B. and van der Schroeff, Marc P. and Baatenburg de Jong, Robert J.",Head & neck,"BACKGROUND: In 2001, we presented a Cox regression model that is able to predict survival of the newly diagnosed patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This model is based on the TNM classification and other important clinical variables such as age at diagnosis, sex, primary tumor site, and prior malignancies. We aim to improve this model by including comorbidity as an extra prognostic variable. Accurate prediction of the prognosis of the newly diagnosed patient with head and neck cancer can assist the physician in patient counseling, clinical decision-making, and quality maintenance. METHODS: All patients with HNSCC of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx diagnosed in the Leiden University Medical Centre between 1981 and 1998 were included. From these 1371 patients, data on primary tumor site, age at diagnosis, sex, TNM classification, and prior malignancies were already available. Comorbidity data were collected retrospectively according to the ACE27 manual. The prognostic value of each variable on overall survival was studied univariately by Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. The Cox regression model was used to investigate the impact of these variables on overall survival simultaneously. Furthermore, univariate analyses were performed to investigate the impact of comorbidity severity on short-term mortality and to investigate the impact of organ-specific-comorbidity on short-term mortality. RESULTS: Comorbidity was present in 36.4% of our patients. Mild decompensation was seen in 17.4%, moderate decompensation in 13.5%, and severe decompensation in 5.5%. Most frequently observed ailments were cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal. In univariate analyses, all prognostic variables, including comorbidity, contributed significantly to overall survival. Their contribution (except sex) remained significant in the multivariate Cox model. Internal validation of this model showed a concordance index of 0.73, indicating a good predictive value. Short-term mortality was seen in 5.7% of our patients. Cardiovascular comorbidity, respiratory comorbidity, gastrointestinal comorbidity, and diabetes showed a significant relationship with short-term mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity impacts overall survival of the newly diagnosed patient with HNSCC. There is a clear distinction between the impact of the 4 ACE27 severity grades. The impact of an ACE27 grade 3 is comparable to the impact of a T4 tumor or an N2 neck. Comorbidity impacts short-term mortality as well. Especially cardiovascular comorbidity, respiratory comorbidity, gastrointestinal comorbidity, and diabetes show a strong relationship.",2010,10.1002/hed.21245,32,6,728-736,eng,1097-0347 1043-3074,"Humans and Middle Aged and Aged and Logistic Models and Comorbidity and Observer Variation and Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology/mortality and Head and Neck Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality and Laryngeal Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality and Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality and Pharyngeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,Head Neck,NA,NA,NA,NA
Leclerc_2020_TheLar,JOUR,The prevalence of cognitive impairment in laryngology treatment-seeking patients,"Leclerc, Andree-Anne and Gillespie, Amanda I. and Tadic, Stasa D. and Smith, Libby J. and Rosen, Clark A.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of cognitive impairment (CI) in the elderly general population is 10% to 20%. The incidence of CI in the elderly laryngology treatment-seeking population is unknown, and CI may impact decision making for elective medical/surgical treatment and negatively impact the outcome of voice/swallowing therapy. We sought to determine the prevalence of CI in elderly patients who are seeking laryngology care and to evaluate the feasibility of administering a cognitive screening instrument. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, Cross-sectional. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients (<e2><89><a5>65 years old) without a previous diagnosis of CI, seeking laryngology evaluation, were administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test by a trained physician. Other members of the clinical team were blinded to the MoCA results. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of participants obtained a score diagnostic for at least mild CI. The results showed a correlation between the MoCA scores and 1) the time needed to complete the test, 2) participant age, and 3) participant education level. No differences were observed between gender, alcohol consumption, or use of medications that can affect cognition and MoCA score. CONCLUSION: One in four elderly laryngology treatment-seeking patients were found to have undiagnosed CI. This finding warrants consideration for CI screening for these patients being evaluated for voice therapy and elective surgery. Treatment decision making in this population may benefit from additional family involvement.

Leung_2021_TheLar,JOUR,Should Oral Corticosteroids be Used in Medical Therapy for Chronic Rhinosinusitis? A Risk Analysis,"Leung, Randy M. and Smith, Timothy L. and Kern, Robert C. and Chandra, Rakesh K. and Schlosser, Rodney J. and Harvey, Richard J. and Conley, David B. and Lee, John M.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES: Oral corticosteroid (OCS) as a part of appropriate medical therapy (AMT) (formerly maximal medical therapy) in chronic rhinosinusitis remains controversial. While the risks of OCS are well known, the benefit remains unclear due the absence of a standardized prescribing regimen. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize whether the risks of OCS and its ability to avert endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) are helpful in AMT. When OCS is highly effective at averting surgery, the lesser risks of OCS would be justified because it can avoid the greater risks of ESS. When OCS is poorly effective at averting ESS, the risks of OCS would not be justified because many patients will be exposed to both risks. This study seeks to identify the threshold effectiveness of OCS at averting ESS that would minimize risk exposure to patients. METHODS: A probabilistic risks-based decision analysis was constructed from literature reported incidences and impacts of adverse events of OCS and ESS. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to identify the minimum effectiveness required to avoid further intervention (MERAFI) for chronic sinusitis without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). RESULTS: The analysis showed MERAFI results of 20.8% (95% CI 20.7-20.9%) for CRSsNP and 16.8% (95% CI 16.7-16.9%) for CRSwNP. CONCLUSIONS: Given reported OCS effectiveness in the range of 34-71% in CRSsNP and 46-63% in CRSwNP, this analysis suggests that the inclusion of OCS in AMT may be the lower risk strategy.

Richards_2015_TheLar,JOUR,The utility of office-based biopsy for laryngopharyngeal lesions: comparison with surgical evaluation,"Richards, Amanda L. and Sugumaran, Manikandan and Aviv, Jonathan E. and Woo, Peak and Altman, Kenneth W.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Advances in flexible endoscopy with working-channel biopsy forceps have led to excellent visualization of laryngopharyngeal lesions with capability for in-office awake biopsy. Potential benefits include prompt diagnosis without risk of general anesthesia, preoperative counseling, and avoiding an anesthetic should the lesion return benign. We evaluate the accuracy of these biopsies in order to determine their role and diagnostic value. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed from January 1, 2010, through July 31, 2013, of patients who underwent office-based current procedural terminology code 31576 and were taken to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy with biopsy/excision. Clinical diagnoses and pathology reports were reviewed. For statistical analysis, we considered three groups: 1) malignant and premalignant, 2) lesions of uncertain significance, and 3) benign lesions. RESULTS: In the study period, 76 patients with an office biopsy had a clinical picture to warrant direct microlaryngoscopy and biopsy/excision. Kendall's coefficient for each group indicated moderate correlation only. When groups 1 and 2 were considered together, there was a substantial and statistically significant correlation. For malignant and premalignant lesions, the office biopsy analysis was as follows: sensitivity = 60%, specificity = 87%, positive predictive value = 78%, and negative predictive value = 74%. CONCLUSION: Office biopsy may offer early direction and avoid operative intervention in some cases; however, for suspected dysplastic or malignant lesions, direct microlaryngoscopy should be the standard of care to ensure adequate full-thickness sampling and staging. For benign pathology, office biopsy is a safe and viable alternative to direct microlaryngoscopy and biopsy/excision.",2015,10.1002/lary.25005,125,4,909-912,eng,1531-4995 0023-852X,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Sensitivity and Specificity and Medical Records and medical decision making and lesion and Ambulatory Surgical Procedures/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Biopsy, Needle/economics/*statistics & numerical data and dysplasia and Laryngeal Diseases/pathology/surgery and Laryngeal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery and Laryngoscopy/methods and leukoplakia and microlaryngoscopy and Office biopsy and Operating Rooms/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Pharyngeal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery",NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,Laryngoscope,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cao_2021_TheLar,JOUR,Current Practices in Endotracheal Tube Size Selection for Adults,"Cao, Austin C. and Rereddy, Shruthi and Mirza, Natasha",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Intubation with inappropriately sized endotracheal tubes (ETT) can cause long-term tracheal and laryngeal injuries often requiring surgical intervention. Although tracheal size has been demonstrated to vary based on height and sex, it is unclear whether these guidelines are regularly implemented in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation. The objective of this study is to determine the rate of appropriate ETT size selection in patients undergoing intubation and assess provider decision making in ETT size selection. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The study population was all patients who underwent endotracheal intubation over a two-week period at a tertiary academic medical center. Data were collected on patient age, gender, height, BMI, comorbidities, ETT size, duration of intubation, bronchoscopies, and type of practitioner who performed the intubation. A height-based nomogram for ETT size selection was used to determine the recommended ETT size for each patient. RESULTS: One hundred five patients met the inclusion criteria. 22% of patients were intubated with an inappropriately large tube, defined as 1.0 mm larger than the recommended size. Women were more likely to be intubated with an inappropriately large ETT (OR = 13.58, P = .001), as were patients with height less than 160 cm (OR = 141, P = .001). Other factors related to disease severity, anticipation for bronchoscopy, and BMI were not risk factors for the use of inappropriately large ETT. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is compelling evidence that height is a strong predictor of tracheal morphology and appropriate ETT size, height-based guidelines have yet to be universally adopted for ETT size selection.

Heaton_2020_TheLar,JOUR,Aerodynamically driven phonation of individual vocal folds under general anesthesia in canines,"Heaton, James T. and Kobler, James B. and Ottensmeyer, Mark P. and Petrillo, Robert H. and Tynan, Monica A. and Mehta, Daryush D. and Hillman, Robert E. and Zeitels, Steven M.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We previously developed an instrument called the Aerodynamic Vocal Fold Driver (AVFD) for intraoperative magnified assessment of vocal fold (VF) vibration during microlaryngoscopy under general anesthesia. Excised larynx testing showed that the AVFD could provide useful information about the vibratory characteristics of each VF independently. The present investigation expands those findings by testing new iterations of the AVFD during microlaryngoscopy in the canine model. STUDY DESIGN: Animal model. METHODS: The AVFD is a handheld instrument that is positioned to contact the phonatory mucosa of either VF during microlaryngoscopy. Airflow delivered through the AVFD shaft to the subglottis drives the VF into phonation-like vibration, which enables magnified observation of mucosal-wave function with stroboscopy or high-speed video. AVFD-driven phonation was tested intraoperatively (n = 26 VFs) using either the original instrument design or smaller and larger versions three-dimensionally printed from a medical grade polymer. A high-fidelity pressure sensor embedded within the AVFD measured VF contact pressure. Characteristics of individual VF phonation were compared with typical two-fold phonation and compared for VFs scarred by electrocautery (n = 4) versus controls (n = 22). RESULTS: Phonation was successful in all 26 VFs, even when scar prevented conventional bilateral phonation. The 15-mm-wide AVFD fits best within the anteroposterior dimension of the musculo-membranous VF, and VF contact pressure correlated with acoustic output, driving pressures, and visible modes of vibration. CONCLUSIONS: The AVFD can reveal magnified vibratory characteristics of individual VFs during microlaryngoscopy (e.g., without needing patient participation), potentially providing information that is not apparent or available during conventional awake phonation, which might facilitate phonosurgical decision making.

Schiff_2019_TheLar,JOUR,Pediatricians' proficiency in the care of the dysphonic child,"Schiff, Carly S. and Zur, Karen B. and Biggs, Lisa M. and Guo, Jia and Pitman, Michael J.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Pediatricians are the first physicians to see a dysphonic child (DC), yet there are limited data on their proficiency in caring for them. The objective of this study was to understand how pediatricians' experience and their comfort in recognizing/diagnosing voice disorders affects their referral patterns and use of basic treatment options. STUDY DESIGN: Survey study. METHODS: A 13-question survey was sent to pediatricians in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's primary care network; 45/216 were returned. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test, linear/logistic regression model, Fisher exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: Pediatricians practicing longer are more comfortable recognizing dysphonia (P = .0022). They are significantly more likely to refer a DC, even without subjective complaints of hoarseness by the family/patient or compounding medical issues. For each year in practice, the probability of referring increases by 1.55% (P = .0017). Pediatricians with a higher percentage of dysphonic children in their practice are more likely to trust their own perceptual recognition when deciding to refer (P = .0496). Nearly all pediatricians (40/45) would refer to a pediatric otolaryngologist. None would refer to a laryngologist or a voice therapist. No factors significantly affected treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: Veteran pediatricians feel more comfortable diagnosing a voice disorder and are more likely to refer a DC, regardless of patient/parent complaints or compounding factors. Pediatricians are most likely to refer to a pediatric otolaryngologist versus a voice specialist. These findings suggest that education of younger, less-experienced pediatricians about recognizing voice disorders and options for referral is needed. This may improve the overall care of the DC.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. METHODS: The study was carried out in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary academic medical center. Eighty-six premature newborns who underwent ligation of a PDA were examined postextubation with fiberoptic laryngoscopy to assess vocal fold mobility, regardless of laryngeal symptom status. RESULTS: Fourteen infants (16%) had LVFP. All were <28 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth and <1,250 g at PDA ligation, and were significantly less mature and smaller than infants without LVFP. Infants <28 weeks PMA at birth and <1,250 g at ligation had an incidence of LVFP of 23% and 24%, respectively. Fourteen percent of the infants with LVFP did not have laryngeal symptoms and would have been missed had these been the sole criteria for assessing vocal fold mobility. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of LVFP after PDA ligation in the NICU is high, and some cases may be missed if laryngoscopy is performed only when laryngeal symptoms are present. Infants <28 weeks PMA at birth and <1,250 g at ligation are at especially high risk. Vocal fold mobility should be documented by laryngoscopy on all high-risk infants undergoing a PDA ligation in the NICU regardless of laryngeal symptom status, and on all infants with relevant symptoms.

Gregory and Luu, Quang and Gandour-Edwards, Regina and Donald, Paul J. and Chen, Allen M.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Submandibular gland-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SMG-sparing IMRT) has been proposed to reduce xerostomia following head and neck irradiation. However, the safety of this practice has been questioned. Data from a large surgical series of oropharyngeal carcinoma patients were extracted to identify clinicopathological correlates for submandibular involvement and to create a risk stratification scheme to guide decision making to refine selection guidelines for SMG-sparing IMRT. STUDY DESIGN: Clinicopathologic analysis. METHODS: The medical records of 153 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated by primary surgery and neck dissection were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed with logistic regression to identify factors predictive of submandibular involvement. Recursive partitioning was used to develop risk stratification schemas based on preoperative data alone and in combination with pathologic data to guide treatment decisions in the definitive and postoperative settings, respectively. RESULTS: Submandibular (level IB) nodal dissection was performed in 119 heminecks (85 ipsilateral and 17 contralateral). The incidence of submandibular involvement was 18%. Young age, T3-4 disease, N2b-3 disease, and perineural invasion were identified as risk factors for submandibular nodal involvement on multivariate analysis (P < .01). Three distinct risk groups for submandibular involvement were identified: age >60 years and N0-2a disease (low risk, 2%), age <e2><89><a4>60 years and T1-2N2b-3 (intermediate risk, 16%), age <e2><89><a4>60 years and T3-4N2b-3 disease (high risk, 57%).

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS: Utilizing the National Cancer Data Base, 2004 to 2015, patients with a diagnosis of oral cavity/oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were studied. Multivariate analysis was completed with multivariate regression and Cox proportional hazard model, and survival outcomes were examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15,181 patients who had surgery for a head and neck cancer at an academic/research center were included in the study population. Of the study population, 4,890 (32.2%) patients completed PORT at a different treatment facility. Treatment at a different facility was more common among patients who were <e2><89><a5>65 years old, white, Medicare recipients, those with a greater distance between residence and surgical treatment facility, and with lower income within area of residence (each P < .05).

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: Medical records of 101 consecutive adult and 20 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent 137 cochlear implantation (CI) procedures at a single institution were reviewed. RESULTS: Computed tomography (CT) was obtained preoperatively in 110 (90.9%) patients, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained in 102 (84.3%) patients, and both were obtained in 94 (77.7%) patients. MRI revealed one acoustic neuroma and two meningiomas, which affected surgical planning for three (2.2%) procedures. MRI identified enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) in 2.0% of adult patients. CT demonstrated middle ear disease in four (3.3%) patients. CT was useful in indicating round window and cochlear patency in three (2.2%) patients with cochlear otosclerosis. Twenty pediatric patients underwent 27 CI procedures. Preoperative CT in the pediatric cohort demonstrated five (25%) dysplastic cochleae, three (15%) dysplastic vestibules and/or semicircular canals, and three (15%) EVAs. In one patient, CT demonstrated a duplicated right internal auditory canal (IAC) and hypoplastic left IAC; MRI confirmed hypoplastic cochlear nerves. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MRI can demonstrate retrocochlear pathology, cochlear patency, and EVA in adults being evaluated for cochlear implantation. CT may provide additional information in patients with chronic otitis media or otosclerosis. However, in postlingually deafened adults without conductive or asymmetrical hearing loss, imaging is unlikely to affect surgical decision making. Both CT and MRI can identify anomalies in pediatric patients. MRI does not offer substantial benefit over CT for routine evaluation of pediatric inner ear and temporal bone anatomy.

Zenga_2017_TheLar,JOUR,Postoperative hemorrhage and hospital revisit after transoral robotic surgery,"Zenga, Joseph and Suko, Jasmina and Kallogjeri, Dorina and Pipkorn, Patrik and Nussenbaum, Brian and Jackson, Ryan S.",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the incidence and complications related to postoperative hemorrhage (POH) after transoral robotic surgery (TORS). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the State Inpatient Database (SID), the State Ambulatory Surgery Database (SASD), and the State Emergency Department Database (SEDD) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. METHODS: Patients were identified from the SID, SASD, and SEDD for the states of Florida, New York, and California from 2005 to 2013 who had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition code for a surgical procedure on the upper aerodigestive tract associated with a code for robotic-assisted surgery. Univariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with POH. RESULTS: Five hundred nine patients underwent TORS. Indications for surgery included neoplastic disease in 376 (74%) and sleep apnea in 74 (15%). Forty-one (8%) had an episode of POH at a median of 9 days postoperatively (range = 0-21 days). Twenty-four (5%) required an intervention related to their POH. Sixteen (3%) required return to the operating room for control of hemorrhage; 11 (2%) had a severe complication that required embolization or tracheostomy. Charlson Comorbidity Score of <e2><89><a5>3 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45-6.30) and a tonsillar neoplasm (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.03-3.74) were significantly associated with POH. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POH after TORS was low, and few of these patients had a severe complication related to this event. Medical comorbidity and tonsillar subsite may be independent risk factors for POH. These data provide a benchmark for informed decision making in TORS and a basis for further study.

Cramer_2017_TheLar,JOUR,Liver disease in patients undergoing head and neck surgery: Incidence and risk for postoperative complications,"Cramer, John D. and Patel, Urjeet A. and Samant, Sandeep and Yang, Amy and Smith, Stephanie Shintani",The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Head and neck cancer patients have multiple risk factors for liver disease. However, little is known about the incidence of liver disease or the safety of surgery in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2013. METHODS: We identified patients undergoing head and neck surgery and excluded them if preoperative laboratory data were missing. Patients were classified as having liver disease if their preoperative aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index was <e2><89><a5> 0.7, and as having advanced liver disease if their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score was <e2><89><a5> 10. We compared the rate of postoperative complications using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 19,138 eligible patients, the incidence of any degree of liver disease was 6.8% for aerodigestive tract surgery and 3.3% for controls. The 30-day mortality rate after major head and neck surgery, which included composite resection; free tissue transfer; and total laryngectomy with advanced, mild, and no liver disease, was 14.6%, 3.0%, and 0.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). For nonmajor surgery, the mortality rate was 3.0%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively (P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, patients with advanced liver disease experienced a six-fold higher rate of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-12.8). CONCLUSION: There is a high risk to detect liver disease in patients undergoing head and neck surgery of the aerodigestive tract. Those with advanced liver disease are at high risk for perioperative mortality, and this risk should be judiciously considered in medical/surgical decision making and postoperative care.
