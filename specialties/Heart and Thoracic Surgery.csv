Kilic_2020_ThAnofthsu,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cardiovascular Health Care,"Kilic, Arman",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: This review article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as it relates to cardiovascular health care. METHODS: An overview of the terminology and algorithms used in ML as it relates to health care are provided by the author. Articles published up to August 1, 2019, in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical practice in the future. RESULTS: AI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, and clinical risk prediction, although these techniques require further refinement and evaluation.",2020,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.09.042,109,5,1323-1329,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,Humans and *Algorithms and *Artificial Intelligence and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and *Machine Learning and Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data and Cardiovascular Diseases/*therapy,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Substantial mortality gains in the acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) population were observed with the reported outcomes of the SHOCK trial in 1999 compared to previous populations with AMI-CS. Nonetheless even in the age of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct related artery, survival rates continue to be only approximately 50%. The conventional focus since the SHOCK trial has centered on revascularization strategies and the subsequent medical management of these patients post-PCI with ever diminishing returns. Perhaps we have hit the ""glass ceiling"" with current strategies and it is time to explore novel strategies to salvage not only the heart but more importantly the patient and potentially more of both. Going forward, researchers need to focus on developing a systematic approach to problem solving in utilizing MCS for patients with cardiogenic shock. Effective methodologies that are evidence based will help physicians in their decision-making when considering temporary MCS for patients.",2019,10.21037/acs.2018.11.05,8,1,32-43,eng,2225-319X 2304-1021,acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and Cardiogenic shock and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and percutaneous coronary intervention and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (PCI and ECMO),NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,Ann Cardiothorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A questionnaire regarding 16 medical and 6 ethical questions of WH/WD of life-sustaining treatment was distributed to the clinical director, senior ICU physician and head nurses of all German heart surgery centres (n = 237 questionnaires). Furthermore, we present a literature survey using the key words 'End-of-life care AND withholding/withdrawal of life support therapy AND intensive care unit'. RESULTS: We received replies from 86 of 237 (36.3%) contacted persons. Concerning medical reasons, cranial computed tomography (CCT) with poor prognosis (91.9%), multi-organ failure (70.9%) and failure of assist device therapy (69.8%) were the three most frequently cited medical reasons for WH/WD life-sustaining treatment. Overall, 32.6% of persons answered that ethical aspects influence their decision-making processes. Poor expected quality of life (48.8%), the patient's willingness to limit medical care (40.7%) and the families' choice (27.9%) were the top three reported ethical reasons. There was a significant difference regarding the perception of the three involved professional groups concerning the decision-making parameters: multi-organ failure (P = 0.018), failure of assist device therapy (P = 0.001), cardiac index (P = 0.009), poor expected quality of life (P = 0.009), the patient's willingness to limit medical care (P = 0.002), intraoperative course (P = 0.054), opinion of family members (P = 0.032) and whether decision-making process are done collaboratively (clinical director, 45.7%; ICU physician, 52%; and head of nursing staff, 26.9%). Palliation medication in patients after WH/WD of life-support consisted of morphine (92%) and benzodiazepines (88%).

Manyam_2022_ThJoofthancasu,JOUR,Unraveling the impact of time-dependent perioperative variables on 30-day readmission after coronary artery bypass surgery,"Manyam, Rameshbabu and Zhang, Yanqing and Carter, Seth and Binongo, Jose N. and Rosenblum, Joshua M. and Keeling, William B.",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,"OBJECTIVES: Readmission within 30 days of discharge after coronary artery bypass grafting is a measure of quality and a driver of cost in health care. Traditional predictive models use time-independent variables. We developed a new model to predict time to readmission after coronary artery bypass grafting using both time-independent and time-dependent preoperative and perioperative data. METHODS: Adults surviving to discharge after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting at a multi-hospital academic health system from January 2017 to September 2018 were included in this study. Two distinct data sources were used: the institutional cardiac surgical database and the clinical data warehouse, which provided more granular data points for each patient. Patients were divided into training and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio. We evaluated 82 potential risk factors using Cox survival regression and machine learning techniques. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to estimate model predictive accuracy. RESULTS: We trained the model with 21 variables that scored a P value of less than .05 in the univariable analysis. The multivariable model determined 16 significant risk factors, and 6 of them were time-dependent. These included preoperative hemoglobin a1c level, preoperative creatinine, preoperative hematocrit, intraoperative hemoglobin, postoperative creatinine, and postoperative hemoglobin. Area under the receiver operating characteristic values were 0.906 and 0.868 for training and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Time-dependent perioperative variables in an isolated coronary artery bypass grafting cohort provided better predictive ability to a readmission model. This study was unique in the inclusion of time-dependent covariates in the predictive model for readmission after discharge after coronary artery bypass grafting.",2022,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.09.076,164,3,943-955.e7,eng,1097-685X 0022-5223,Humans and Adult and regression and Risk Factors and Glycated Hemoglobin A and *Patient Readmission and hospital readmission and Creatinine and *Coronary Artery Bypass/adverse effects and CABG and coronary artery bypass grafting and cox survival and extreme gradient boosting and Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology and predictive analytics model and time-dependent covariates and XGBoost,NA,NA,2022/09//undefined,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Long_2012_Intcarandthosur,JOUR,Heart team discussion in managing patients with coronary artery disease: outcome and reproducibility,"Long, Jenny and Luckraz, Heyman and Thekkudan, Joyce and Maher, Abdul and Norell, Michael",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"Recent ESC/EACTS revascularization guidelines advocate a 'Heart Team' (HT) approach in the decision-making process when managing patients with coronary disease. We prospectively assessed HT decision-making in 150 patients analysing personnel attendance, data presented, the 'actioning' of the HT decision and, if not completed, then the reasons why. Additionally, 50 patients were specifically re-discussed after 1 year in order to assess consistency in decision-making. We have two HT meetings each week. At least one surgeon, interventional cardiologist and non-interventional cardiologist were present at all meetings. Data presented included patient demographics, symptoms, co-morbidities, coronary angiography, left ventricular function and other relevant investigations, e.g. echocardiograms. HT decisions included continued medical treatment (22%), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; 22%), coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG; 34%) or further investigations such as pressure wire studies, dobutamine stress echo or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (22%). These decisions were fully undertaken in 86% of patients. Reasons for aberration in the remaining 21 patients included patient refusal (CABG 29%, PCI 10%) and further co-morbidities (28%). On re-discussion of the same patient data (n = 50) a year later, 24% of decisions differed from the original HT recommendations reflecting the fact that, for certain coronary artery disease pattern, either CABG or PCI could be appropriate.",2012,10.1093/icvts/ivr157,14,5,594-598,eng,1569-9285 1569-9293,"England and Humans and Female and Male and Time Factors and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Reproducibility of Results and Guideline Adherence and Continuity of Patient Care and Patient Selection and *Cooperative Behavior and *Interdisciplinary Communication and *Patient Care Team and *Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care and Cardiovascular Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use and *Coronary Artery Bypass/adverse effects and Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosis/*therapy and *Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/adverse effects",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

F. M. and van Mieghem, Nicolas M. and Daemen, Joost and van Domburg, Ron T. and Kappetein, A. Pieter and Head, Stuart J.",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"OBJECTIVES: The Heart Team has been recommended as standard care for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, little is known about the real benefits, potential treatment delays and late outcomes of this approach. Our goal was to determine the safety and feasibility of multidisciplinary Heart Team decision making for patients with CAD. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 1000 consecutive cases discussed by the Heart Team between November 2010 and January 2012. We assessed (i) time intervals between different care steps involving the Heart Team; (ii) the distribution of patients according to the complexity of their CAD; and (iii) the 5-year survival as estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Of 1000 case discussions, 40 were repeat cases, resulting in 960 unique cases. The mean age was 65 years, 73% were men, and 29% had diabetes. Native vessel disease was present in 86.4%, of which 69% had simple 1-vessel disease (1VD) or 2-vessel disease (2VD), and 31% had complex left main (LM) or 3-vessel disease (3VD). The time interval between referral by a community hospital and final treatment was less than 6 weeks for 90% of cases. Treatment decisions were delayed in 35% of cases due to a need for additional diagnostic information. For simple 1- or 2VD with or without proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, treatment was medical therapy in 6% and 12%, respectively; percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 88% and 85%, respectively; and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 6% and 3%, respectively. For 3VD disease, treatment was equally split between CABG and PCI (46% for both). PCI was preferred for isolated LM or LM with 1VD (81% vs CABG 16%), whereas CABG was preferred in LM with 2- or 3VD (71% vs PCI 19%). The 5-year mortality rate was 16% for 1- or 2VD, 17% for 3VD, 3% for isolated LM or with 1VD and 27% for LM with 2- or 3VD. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-centre analysis, the Heart Team approach was feasible, with decision making and treatment by the Heart Team following within a short time after referral. However, the timing of treatment could be further optimized if adequate information and imaging were available at the time of the Heart Team meeting. The final treatment recommendation by the Heart Team was largely in accordance with clinical guidelines.",2019,10.1093/icvts/ivy237,28,2,206-213,eng,1569-9285,Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Treatment Outcome and Follow-Up Studies and *Decision Making and *Patient Care Team and *Surgeons and Coronary Artery Bypass/*methods and Coronary Artery Disease/*surgery and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*methods,NA,NA,2019/02/01/,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

We discuss the clinical decision-making in a population with MAIF pseudoaneurysms following valve replacement surgery. From 2003 to 2010, 16 patients (age 65 <c2><b1> 17 years) were referred to our institute with worsening valvular disease. All the patients had undergone previous aortic or mitral valve replacement surgery. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed in these patients. According to the echocardiographic findings, we described two groups of patients with MAIF pseudoaneurysms: group 1 (seven patients) without previously known infective disease, and group 2 (nine patients) with a medical history of endocarditis. For asymptomatic patients without an infective background or valve regurgitation (group 1), clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was selected. Reintervention was planned for postinfection pseudoaneurysms (group 2), on account of the residual paravalvular leak and the high-risk of MAIF rupture. The case series emphasizes the need for more awareness about MAIF pseudoaneurysms, rare complications of aortic and mitral valve surgery, which occur far more frequently than expected.

This study evaluates the clinical effectiveness of a specific algorithm based on size and symptoms for preemptive surgery to prevent complications. METHODS: A total of 781 patients with nondissecting ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms who presented electively for evaluation to our institution from 2011 to 2017 were triaged to surgery (n = 607, 77%) or medical observation (n = 181, 24%) based on a specific algorithm: surgery for large (>5 cm) or symptomatic aneurysms.

Nwaejike_2013_Intcarandthosur,JOUR,Should pregnant patients with a recurrent or persistent pneumothorax undergo surgery?,"Nwaejike, Nnamdi and Elbur, Ehab and Rammohan, Kandadai S. and Shah, Rajesh",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"A 29-year old woman at 26 weeks gestation (gravida 3 and para 0) presented with an acute left-sided pneumothorax. She had a 10 pack-year smoking history and no other relevant medical history. Over the next 3 weeks, she had three recurrences of her left-sided pneumothorax, each of which was managed by intercostal drain insertion. During the fourth episode of pneumothorax, after chest drain insertion there was a continued air-leak for 4 days. She was referred to the cardiothoracic service for further management of this problem. A best evidence topic was constructed according to a structured protocol to answer the question: in pregnant patients with a recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, is surgery safer compared with conservative treatment for the wellbeing of the patient and the foetus? The 2010 guidelines for the management of pneumothorax state that there is Level C evidence that simple observation and aspiration are usually effective during pregnancy, with elective assisted delivery and regional anaesthesia at or near term. The guidelines also state Level D evidence that a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure should be considered after birth. Three hundred and eighty-four papers were found, and from these, four papers were identified describing 79 cases of pneumothorax in pregnancy to provide the best evidence to answer the question. Conservative treatment by observation alone with or without tube thoracostomy compared with surgical treatment by VATS or thoracotomy are the options used in the observed literature reviews. All reports observe no difference in outcome to the mother or foetus if a conservative approach (observation or tube thoracostomy) is used compared with surgery prior to the delivery of the baby. However, an initial conservative approach could lead to surgery after delivery for a persistent pneumothorax in as much as 40% of patients. A persistent pneumothorax after delivery that might require surgery delays discharge home and compromises the normal interaction between the mother and new-born child, which might be distressing. For informed consent, the implications of the risk of persistent pneumothorax requiring surgery after delivery where a conservative approach is used initially should be discussed with the patient and family to aid decision making.",2013,10.1093/icvts/ivt396,17,6,988-990,eng,1569-9285 1569-9293,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and Adult and Risk Assessment and Surgery and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Pregnancy and Patient Selection and Recurrence and Benchmarking and *Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted/adverse effects and Drainage and Pneumothorax and Pneumothorax/diagnosis/*surgery and Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis/*surgery",NA,NA,2013/12//undefined,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

We performed a cost and waste comparison of MED versus EBUS-TBNA for MLNS to raise awareness of the financial and environmental implications of our practices. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of outpatients who underwent MLNS under general anesthesia in the OR with MED or EBUS-TBNA (September 2007 to December 2009). We analyzed direct costs based on hospital charges, calculated expected payment using a decision support model, and profit margins (modeled expected payment-direct costs). Our waste comparison was measured in kilograms of solid waste per case. RESULTS: We performed MLNS in 148 patients (89 EBUS-TBNA, 39 MED, 20 EBUS + MED). Direct costs were lower for MED ($2,356) compared with EBUS-TBNA ($2,503), whereas expected payment was greater (MED, $3,449; EBUS-TBNA, $3,249), resulting in a profit margin that was $347 greater for MED. The amount of solid waste for each MED was 1.8 kg versus 0.5 kg for EBUS-TBNA. CONCLUSIONS: MED costs less than EBUS-TBNA in the OR setting but generates 3.6 times the amount of EBUS-TBNA waste. The cost of EBUS-TBNA may improve by performance in the endoscopy suite, and surgical pack revision could reduce the amount of MED solid waste. This comparison sets the stage for sophistication of our clinical decision making, taking into consideration the major threats to our health care system.",2014,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.04.104,98,3,1003-1007,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,Humans and Retrospective Studies and Costs and Cost Analysis and Bronchoscopy/*economics and Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration/*economics and Lymph Nodes/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology and Mediastinoscopy/*economics and Medical Waste/*economics,NA,NA,2014/09//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This design seems to increase the risk of coronary ostia obstruction after ViV procedures. DESCRIPTION: We report 5 patients with degenerated Mitroflow or Trifecta xenografts in whom different anatomic considerations led to different treatment strategies. EVALUATION: One patient underwent conventional redo aortic valve replacement, 2 patients underwent transcatheter ViV implantation with first-generation prostheses, and 2 patients underwent transcatheter ViV implantation using the Engager prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). All patients were discharged alive in good clinical condition and were alive at 30 days after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter ViV procedures can be performed safely in degenerated Mitroflow and Trifecta prostheses, if the anatomy of the aortic root is taken into consideration.

D. and Thourani, Vinod H. and MacGillivray, Thomas E. and Boden, Natalie and Sabik, Joseph F. 3rd",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) surveyed cardiothoracic surgeon participants in its Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD) to learn the extent of surgeon involvement in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. METHODS: An electronic survey was delivered to 2,594 surgeons in June 2016. When the survey closed 2 weeks later, 487 completed surveys had been submitted for a response rate of 18.8%. RESULTS: Among the 487 participants in the ACSD who responded to the survey, 410 (84.2%) reported that TAVR was performed at their institutions. Approximately three-quarters reported that they performed TAVR procedures as part of a heart team (77.5%; 313 of 404), cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons were jointly responsible for TAVR referrals (83.7%; 339 of 405), and TAVR programs were administered either jointly by the cardiology and cardiac surgery departments or exclusively by the cardiac surgery department (73.3%; 297 of 405). A majority were involved in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care of patients undergoing TAVR, with 91.4% (370 of 405) reporting participation in multidisciplinary meetings, at least 50% regularly performing technical aspects in 10 of 11 conduct of operation categories, and 86.6% (266 of 307) caring for patients undergoing TAVR after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgeons in the United States are active participants in the management of patients with aortic stenosis as part of the heart team.

We compared survival after medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting in such patients who developed non-LAD territory jeopardy. METHODS: From 1971 to 2000, 4,640 patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting that included left internal thoracic artery to LAD grafting were found on angiography during active follow-up to have a patent left internal thoracic artery to LAD graft, but at least 50% stenosis of non-LAD territories or grafts to them. Two survival analyses were performed: (1) intent-to-treat, which included patients undergoing reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 731) or percutaneous intervention (n = 994) within 6 weeks of angiography or medical management (n = 2,782), and (2) competing risk/crossover, in which patients were classified as medically managed until crossover to coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis, propensity-adjusted early (<1 year) survival was similar for all patients, but late survival was slightly better after percutaneous intervention than with medical management (p < or = 0.05). In the competing risk/crossover analysis, adjusted survival was best for medically treated patients early; however, late survival was similar among all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with patent left internal thoracic artery to LAD grafts who develop non-LAD territory jeopardy derive no survival benefit from reintervention, consistent with previous observations that for coronary reintervention to improve survival, the LAD territory must be jeopardized. Reintervention in patients with a patent left internal thoracic artery to LAD graft may be warranted to relieve symptoms, without expecting a survival benefit.",2009,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.02.032,87,5,1392-1398; discussion 1400,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Survival Analysis and *Decision Making and Patients/*psychology and Survivors and Coronary Artery Bypass/adverse effects/*methods/*mortality and Coronary Restenosis/mortality/surgery and Mammary Arteries/surgery/*transplantation and Reoperation/mortality/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Twenty UK surgical trainees (equivalent to cardiothoracic surgery resident physicians in the United States) in their first year of residency training were evaluated. Assessment of skills in pulmonary wedge resection and cardiopulmonary bypass were undertaken before and after 2 boot camp-style courses, including live animal operating (boot camp 1 and boot camp 2). Resident performance was evaluated by surgical trainers using objective structured assessment of technical skills matrices. Trainers completed a survey on skill development and trainer confidence in the trainee precourse and postcourse. RESULTS: Trainee assessment scores pre- and postcourses were analyzed using a 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrating a significant improvement in trainee performance in boot camp 1 in performing cardiopulmonary bypass (median score, 21 precourse and 28 postcourse; P = .001) and pulmonary wedge resection (median score, 25 precourse and 32 postcourse; P = .012), and in boot camp 2, in performing cardiopulmonary bypass (median score, 28 precourse and 30.5 postcourse; P = .018) and pulmonary wedge resection (median score, 31.5 precourse and 37 postcourse; P = .018). Trainers reported increased confidence and decision-making competency of residents and increased confidence of trainers to allow more participation in management.

The objective of this pilot study was to develop a comprehensive program to sharpen performance of experienced cardiac surgical teams in acute crisis management. METHODS: We developed and implemented an educational program for cardiac surgery based on high realism acute crisis simulation scenarios and interactive whole-unit workshop. The impact of these interventions was assessed with postintervention questionnaires, preintervention and 6-month postintervention surveys, and structured interviews. RESULTS: The realism of the acute crisis simulation scenarios gradually improved; most participants rated both the simulation and whole-unit workshop as very good or excellent. Repeat simulation training was recommended every 6 to 12 months by 82% of the participants. Participants of the interactive workshop identified 2 areas of highest priority: encouraging speaking up about critical information and interprofessional information sharing. They also stressed the importance of briefings, early communication of surgical plan, knowing members of the team, and continued simulation for practice. The pre/post survey response rates were 70% (55/79) and 66% (52/79), respectively. The concept of working as a team improved between surveys (P = .028), with a trend for improvement in gaining common understanding of the plan before a procedure (P = .075) and appropriate resolution of disagreements (P = .092). Interviewees reported that the training had a positive effect on their personal behaviors and patient care, including speaking up more readily and communicating more clearly.

METHODS: The committee consisted of 4 surgeons with at least 1 senior surgeon at any given time with a rotating schedule. Patients with a Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality above specified thresholds were mandated for referral to the committee in addition to patients referred at the discretion of the surgeon. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to model survival. RESULTS: A total of 110 consecutive patients were reviewed by the committee. The most common procedure types for referral were isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (47.3%; n = 52) and coronary artery bypass grafting with concomitant aortic valve replacement (19.1%; n = 21).

Previous reports suggest that epiaortic ultrasonography (EU) is superior to transesophageal echocardiography and manual palpation in identifying ascending aortic atheroma. Its impact on surgical decision making has not been thoroughly investigated, however. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 6051 consecutive patients who underwent EU of their ascending aorta during cardiac operations between 1996 and 2006 to determine a potential impact on intraoperative surgical decision making. Aortic atheroma was graded according to standard classification. Neurologic complications were evaluated according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeon definition for stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). RESULTS: The overall impact of EU on surgical decision making was 4.1% and included a change in the technique for inducing cardiac arrest in 1.8%, aortic atherectomy or replacement surgery in 0.8%, requirement for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 0.6%, avoidance of aortic cross-clamping and use of ventricular fibrillatory arrest in 0.5%, change in arterial cannulation site in 0.2%, or avoidance of aortic cannulation in 0.2%. The greatest affect of EU was observed in patients undergoing combined CABG with aortic/mitral valve procedures (6.7%). The smallest impact was seen in patients undergoing mitral valve operations (1.4%). Aortic atheroma was more frequent on the anterior aspect of the aorta (n = 171) in patients with a change in surgical plan than on the posterior aspect (n = 78). The overall stroke rate was lower in patients with intraoperative EU compared with all patients undergoing surgical procedures.

Jr and Naunheim, Keith S. and Rich, Jeffrey B. and Bavaria, Joseph E.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"Strategies to value physician work continue to evolve. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database have an increasingly important role in this evolution. An understanding of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) system (American Medical Association [AMA], Chicago, IL) and the Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) is necessary to comprehend how physician work is valued. In 1965, with the dawn of increasingly complex medical care, immense innovation, and the rollout of Medicare, the need for a common language describing medical services and procedures was recognized as being of critical importance. In 1966, the AMA, in cooperation with multiple major medical specialty societies, developed the CPT system, which is a coding system for the description of medical procedures and medical services. The RUC was created by the AMA in response to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, legislation of the United States of America Federal government that mandated that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services adopt a relative value methodology for Medicare physician payment. The role of the RUC is to develop relative value recommendations for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These recommendations include relative value recommendations for new procedures or services and also updates to relative value recommendations for previously valued procedures or services. These recommendations pertain to all physician work delivered to Medicare beneficiaries and propose relative values for all physician services, including updates to those based on the original resource-based relative value scale developed by Hsaio and colleagues. In so doing, widely differing work and services provided can be reviewed and comparisons of their relative value (to each other) can be established. The resource-based relative value scale assigns value to physician services using relative value units (RVUs), which consist of three components: work RVU, practice expense RVU, and malpractice RVU, also known as professional liability insurance RVU. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services retains the final decision-making authority on the RVUs associated with each procedure or service. The purpose of this article is to discuss the role that the CPT codes and the RUC play in the valuation of physician work and to provide an example of how the methodology for valuation of physician work continues to evolve.",2017,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.11.059,103,2,373-380,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"United States and Humans and *Societies, Medical and Medicare/*legislation & jurisprudence and Physicians/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Reimbursement Mechanisms/*economics",NA,NA,2017/02//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study developed a preoperative clinical decision support tool to predict perioperative red blood cell transfusions in the setting of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, observational study of 20,377 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting among patients at 39 hospitals participating in the Michigan Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative's PERFusion measures and outcomes (PERForm) registry between 2011 and 2015. Candidates' preoperative risk factors were identified based on previous work and clinical input. The study population was randomly divided into a 70% development sample and a 30% validation sample. A generalized linear mixed-effect model was developed to predict perioperative red blood cell transfusion. The model's performance was assessed for calibration and discrimination. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the model in different clinical subgroups. RESULTS: Transfusions occurred in 36.8% of patients. The final regression model included 16 preoperative variables. The correlation between the observed and expected transfusions was 1.0. The risk prediction model discriminated well (receiver operator characteristic [ROC](development), 0.81; ROC(validation), 0.82) and had satisfactory calibration (correlation between observed and expected rates was r = 1.00).

We aimed to achieve early prediction of critical events, that is, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emergency endotracheal intubation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in infants with single-ventricle physiology before second-stage surgery. We hypothesized that naive Bayesian models learned from expert knowledge and clinical data can predict critical events early and accurately. METHODS: We collected 93 patients with single-ventricle physiology admitted to intensive care units in a single tertiary pediatric hospital between 2014 and 2017. Using knowledge elicited from experienced cardiac-intensive-care-unit providers and machine-learning techniques, we developed and evaluated the Cardiac-intensive-care Warning INdex (C-WIN) system, consisting of a set of naive Bayesian models that leverage routinely collected data. We evaluated predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. We performed the evaluation at 5 different prediction horizons: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours before the onset of critical events. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the C-WIN models ranged between 0.73 and 0.88 at different prediction horizons. At 1 hour before critical events, C-WIN was able to detect events with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.92) and a sensitivity of 84% at the 81% specificity level. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive models may enhance clinicians' ability to identify infants with single-ventricle physiology at high risk of critical events.

This study aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm to augment clinical decision making related to VA-ECMO. METHODS: Patients supported by VA-ECMO at a single institution from May 2011 to October 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Laboratory values from only the initial 48 hours of VA-ECMO support were used. Data were split into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% withheld for testing. Feature importance was estimated, and dimensionality reduction techniques were used. A deep neural network was trained to predict survival to discharge, and the final model was assessed using the independent testing cohort. Model performance was compared with that of the SAVE (Survival After Veno-arterial ECMO) score by using a receiver operator characteristic curve. RESULTS: Of the 282 eligible adult patients who were undergoing VA-ECMO, 117 (41%) survived to discharge. A total of 1.96 million laboratory values were extracted from the electronic medical record, from which 270 different summary variables were derived for each patient. The most important variables in predicting the primary outcome included lactate, age, total bilirubin, and creatinine. For the testing cohort, the final model achieved 82% overall accuracy and a greater area under the curve than the SAVE score (0.92 vs 0.65; P = .01) in predicting survival to discharge.

In this study, we examined reasons for medical management of aortic stenosis in relation to operative risks and outcomes for veterans with and without valve replacement. METHODS: The echocardiography database was screened from 2000 to 2007 for severe aortic stenosis. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores and survival were determined for patients with and without aortic valve replacement. RESULTS: Of 132 severe aortic stenosis patients included, 42% were medically managed. Predicted operative mortality risk was lower for surgical patients than for medical patients (4.5%<c2><b1>4.2% versus 6.8%<c2><b1>5.1%, p=0.002). Overall, the most common reason for medical management of aortic stenosis was assumption that the patient was high risk for surgery (30.4%). The surgery group had significantly higher median survival (92.2 versus 32.4 months) and 5-year survival (71% versus 37%, p<0.001) than the medical group. Cardiac surgery was not consulted in 61% of medically managed patients, of whom only 18% had Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score of 10 or greater. Aortic valve replacement was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.43, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Although operative risk was higher among patients who did not undergo surgery, most were not the 10% or greater required for transcatheter valves.

Jr and Hamman, Baron",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Use of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is expected to increase as the population ages. Short-term adverse outcomes models and their application to the decision-making process have greatly increased the safety and effectiveness of CABG. However, similar tools addressing long-term survival have not been developed. We examined the effect of the preoperative risk factors included in short-term outcomes models on long-term survival in patients who survive CABG. METHODS: A Cox survival model considering preoperative risk factors identified by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons was developed for 8,529 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG between January 1, 1997, and August 31, 2010, at Baylor University Medical Center (Dallas, Texas) and were alive 30-days post-CABG. RESULTS: There were 2,388 (27.9%) deaths during follow-up (<e2><89><a4>14 years). Unadjusted survival was 83.8% and 65% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The Cox model showed that most established preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with survival. Their effect was minimal, however; the variation explained by their cumulative effect in predicting survival was 16.8% (R2=0.168). CONCLUSIONS: Established operative risk factors may not be good predictors of long-term post-CABG survival. Late mortality may be attributable to many causes, not necessarily related to patients' cardiovascular and general health at the time of operation.

Previous literature regarding patient safety highlighted communication as a common area for improvement. This study utilized a qualitative approach to analyze a national mortality audit data set to identify and describe communication issues that could potentially contribute to patient mortality following cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS: We utilized a peer-reviewed audit of surgical deaths after cardiothoracic surgery in Australian hospitals from 2009 to 2015 via the Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality. Cases were identified with clinical management issues then individual analysis of cases highlighting communication issues was undertaken. A total of 91 reports from surgeons and assessors were analysed using a thematic analytic approach. RESULTS: A total of 908 cases of potentially avoidable mortality were identified as being associated with clinical management issues, and communication issues were identified in 91 (10%) of these cases, which served as the basis for this analysis. The study found that failure to achieve shared decision making was the most common theme (n = 38, 41.8%), followed by failure to notify patient deterioration (n = 22, 24.1%), misreporting of patient condition (n = 10, 11.0%) and issues related to informed consent (n = 9, 10.0%). The most frequent communication issues occurred between surgeons and the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Poor communication was identified in patients who died after cardiothoracic surgery.

J. and Babidge, Wendy J. and Worthington, Michael G. and Maddern, Guy J.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Independent peer review of mortality cases has potential to identify issues in cardiothoracic surgical patients. The Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality aims to improve surgical care through peer-reviewed assessment of all surgical mortality. The aim of this study was to describe common clinical management issues that contribute to patient mortality in a cohort of Australian cardiothoracic surgical patients. This approach may subsequently provide a basis for quality improvement. METHODS: Cardiothoracic mortality reports to the Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality from February 2009 through December 2015 were reviewed. The surgeon report and assessor comments were coded to identify clinical management issues. These were divided into perioperative stages (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative), and at each stage a thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of the 908 cases analyzed, 1371 clinical management issues were identified. Postoperative issues were the most common (n = 552), followed by preoperative (n = 378) and intraoperative issues (n = 370). Communication issues were present at all 3 stages (n = 71). Overall the most common theme was intraoperative technical issues (n = 287). Many of these issues revolved around unintentional injury to anatomic structures during surgery and inadequate myocardial protection. Communication issues commonly related to surgical handover to the intensive care unit and lack of shared decision-making. Also common were consultant surgeons being unaware of patient deterioration or significant changes in management.

We assessed the impact of perceived frailty by measuring the influence of a short video of a standardized patient on surgical risk estimates. METHODS: Thoracic surgeons and cardiothoracic trainees estimated the risk of major complications for lobectomy based on clinical vignettes of varied risk categories (low, average, high). After each vignette, subjects viewed a randomly selected video of a standardized patient exhibiting either vigorous or frail behavior, then reestimated risk. Subjects were asked to rate 5 vignettes paired with 5 different standardized patients. RESULTS: Seventy-one physicians participated. Initial risk estimates varied according to the vignette risk category: low 15.2%<c2><b1>11.2% risk; average 23.7%<c2><b1>16.1%; high 37.3%<c2><b1>18.9% (p<0.001 by analysis of variance). Concordant information in vignettes and videos moderately altered estimates (high risk vignette, frail video 10.6%<c2><b1>27.5% increase in estimate, p=0.006; low risk vignette, vigorous video 14.5%<c2><b1>45.0% decrease, p=0.009). Discordant findings influenced risk estimates more substantially (high risk vignette, vigorous video 21.2%<c2><b1>23.5% decrease in second risk estimate, p<0.001; low risk vignette, frail video 151.9%<c2><b1>209.8% increase, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons differentiated relative risk of lobectomy based on clinical vignettes.

Craig",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Disproportionate reduction of the mitral septal-lateral annular dimension is the goal in the surgical treatment of ischemic or functional mitral regurgitation and avoids the need for ring ""downsizing."" How much the new annuloplasty rings designed for patients with ischemic/functional mitral regurgitation reduce annular septal-lateral dimension, however, is proprietary information and debated. METHODS: Outer and inner septal-lateral and commissure-commissure diameters of all available sizes of Edwards GeoForm, Edwards IMR ETlogix (both Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif), St Jude Medical Rigid Saddle Annuloplasty Ring (St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn), and Medtronic Profile 3D (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) annuloplasty rings with and without the fabric covering were measured with electronic calipers. These rings were compared with a Carpentier-Edwards Physio ring (Edwards Lifesciences) to assess the relative amount of septal-lateral and commissure-commissure dimension change. Average fractional changes (% +/-1 standard deviation) versus the Physio ring were calculated. RESULTS: The GeoForm provided the greatest outer septal-lateral reduction relative to Physio ring (-24% +/- 2%), followed by the IMR ETlogix (-9% +/- 2%) and Profile 3D (-8% +/- 5%). The septal-lateral diameter of the Rigid Saddle Annuloplasty Ring was similar to that of the Physio ring (+1% +/- 3%). Although commissure-commissure outer diameters of the IMR ETlogix, Rigid Saddle Annuloplasty Ring, and Profile 3D were similar to that of the Physio ring (0% +/- 2%, +4% +/- 3%, and +3% +/- 4%, respectively), the GeoForm had a larger commissure-commissure dimension (+12% +/- 2%). The inner diameter septal-lateral reductions were even more pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the Physio ring, the GeoForm has the most outer and inner septal-lateral reduction but larger commissure-commissure dimension; the IMR ETlogix and Profile 3D provide a moderate degree of septal-lateral reduction without affecting commissure-commissure dimension, and Rigid Saddle Annuloplasty Ring septal-lateral and commissure-commissure diameters are similar to those of the Physio ring.

In the initial document, 180 clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, extent of medical therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, and coronary anatomy. This update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios the writing group felt to be affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. The methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document, and the definition of appropriateness was unchanged. The technical panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate and likely to improve patients' health outcomes or survival. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate revascularization is considered inappropriate and unlikely to improve health outcomes or survival. Scores in the mid-range (4 to 6) indicate a clinical scenario for which the likelihood that coronary revascularization will improve health outcomes or survival is uncertain. In general, as seen with the prior AUC, the use of coronary revascularization for patients with acute coronary syndromes and combinations of significant symptoms and/or ischemia is appropriate. In contrast, revascularization of asymptomatic patients or patients with low-risk findings on noninvasive testing and minimal medical therapy are viewed less favorably. The technical panel felt that based on recent studies, coronary artery bypass grafting remains an appropriate method of revascularization for patients with high burden of coronary artery disease (CAD).

METHODS: Data were obtained from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database for 50,231 patients undergoing combinations of aortic (A), mitral (M), and tricuspid (T) surgery between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2010, divided into developmental (2004 to 2009) and validation (2010) samples. Pulmonary valve operations, aortic root replacements, and dissection procedures were excluded, and insufficient AT procedures were available to model. Using stepwise logistic regression, the risk of operative mortality was estimated for each valve surgery type: AM, n=27,035; MT, n=18,686; and AMT, n=4,510. Two separate models were estimated, one that included only patient characteristics and status at presentation, and thereby would be suitable for performance profiling; and another that added discretionary operative variables such as arrhythmia ablation or valve repair. RESULTS: Unadjusted operative mortality was 7.6% for MT, 9.4% for AM, and 13.1% for AMT procedures. Significant risk factors for mortality included emergency presentation, advanced age, renal failure, reoperation, endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, severe chronic lung disease, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and female sex.

Univariate analyses were used to determine significant associations between mortality and the new risk factors in version 2.73. We then performed multivariable analysis, incorporating the STS predicted risk of mortality into our regression. RESULTS: In the univariate model, patients with illicit drug use, syncope, unresponsive neurologic state, cancer within the last 5 years, current smoking history, other tobacco use, or sleep apnea had no significant difference in mortality (p > 0.05). Patients with liver disease, elevated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, mediastinal radiation, prolonged 5-meter walk test, home oxygen use, inhaled medications or bronchodilator therapy, decreased forced expiratory volume, and history of recent pneumonia had significant increases in operative mortality (p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis incorporating the STS predicted risk models, liver disease, elevated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, prolonged 5-meter walk test, home oxygen use, bronchodilator therapy, and abnormal pulmonary function tests were independently predictive of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Several of the new STS data variables were significantly associated with operative mortality after cardiac surgery. The addition of these patient factors improves our understanding of evolving patient demographics and comorbid conditions and their impact on perioperative risk. This will improve both shared decision making and assessments of provider performance.",2015,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.02.085,100,2,516-521,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Adult and Risk Assessment and Risk Factors and Societies, Medical and *Databases, Factual and Thoracic Surgery and Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*mortality",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ad_2013_ThAnofthsu,JOUR,Impact of clinical presentation and surgeon experience on the decision to perform surgical ablation,"Ad, Niv and Henry, Linda and Hunt, Sharon and Holmes, Sari D.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing cardiac surgery have higher morbidity and decreased survival. Recent data revealed that surgical ablation (SA) is performed in only 39% of these patients, with variability among surgeons. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of clinical presentation and surgeon experience when making the decision to treat AF concomitantly with another cardiac surgical procedure. METHODS: Since 2005, we identified 983 nonemergent patients with preoperative AF at our institution with 41% (n=401) having a concomitant SA. Logistic regression identified independent predictors for SA. The number of SAs performed captured surgeon experience in AF ablation. RESULTS: Major growth in the percent of SA performed for AF was noted (31% in 2005 vs 49% in 2010; p<0.001). Independent predictors (<cf><87>2=283.5, p<0.001, area under the curve=0.80) for SA were found, including concomitant mitral valve surgery (odds ratio [OR]=5.81) and lower creatinine (OR=4.34). Surgeon experience predicted SA with 6% greater odds for every 10 SA cases performed (OR=1.06, p<0.001). The group of surgeons with 50 or greater SA cases ablated, 57% of AF patients (301 of 526), compared with those with less than 50 cases ablated, 22% (101 of 457; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that patient acuity and surgeon experience are significantly associated with the decision to perform concomitant SA for AF. Only the most experienced surgeons performed SA in patients with more complex clinical presentation. These findings, together with the negative impact of AF on patient outcomes, should prompt a comprehensive approach to educate and train surgeons in the performance of SA for AF when clinically justified.",2013,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.03.066,96,3,763-8; discussion 768-769,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Logistic Models and Decision Making and Cohort Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Odds Ratio and Severity of Illness Index and Survival Rate and Patient Selection and Confidence Intervals and Education, Medical, Continuing and *Clinical Competence and Hospital Mortality/*trends and 24 and Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis/*mortality/*surgery and Cardiac Surgical Procedures/methods/mortality and Catheter Ablation/*methods/mortality",NA,NA,2013/09//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our study investigated the prognostic value of MI classification in the setting of surgical revascularization within 21 days of MI. METHODS: We studied 2412 consecutive patients between 1995 and 2007 who underwent an isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedure within 21 days after MI. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and major adverse events, which included death, MI, stroke, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. RESULTS: Rates of crude in-hospital mortality and major adverse events were higher in ST-elevation MI patients. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that MI subtype (ST-elevation MI vs non-ST-elevation MI) did not predict in-hospital mortality or major adverse events. A secondary analysis using propensity score matching showed similar surgical outcomes between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical risks of patients with recent MI are independent of MI subtype.

Owen_2013_ThAnofthsu,JOUR,Routine intraoperative frozen section analysis of bronchial margins is of limited utility in lung cancer resection,"Owen, Rachel M. and Force, Seth D. and Gal, Anthony A. and Feingold, Paul L. and Pickens, Allan and Miller, Daniel L. and Fernandez, Felix G.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Residual disease at the bronchial margin after resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adversely affects survival. To ensure an R0 resection, thoracic surgeons commonly use intraoperative frozen section analysis of the bronchial margin. We hypothesize that frozen section of the bronchial margin is rarely positive and seldom changes intraoperative management. METHODS: Our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgery database was queried for all patients undergoing planned lobectomy for NSCLC from 2009 to 2011. Clinical variables, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were reviewed. Specifically, intraoperative frozen section and final pathology results of all bronchial margins were examined. The frequency that frozen section results affected intraoperative decision making was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 287 lobectomies for NSCLC were performed. Frozen section of the bronchial margin was performed in 270 patients (94.1%). There were 6 (2.2%) true-positive bronchial margins and 1 (0.4%) false-negative margin. In no cases did a positive frozen section lead to a change in operative management; reasons included unable to tolerate further resection (n = 5) and advanced-stage disease (n = 1). Positive margins were more frequent with open techniques (7%) than in video-assisted thoracoscopic operations (0.05%; p < 0.01). Tumors with positive margins were closer to the bronchial margin (1.0 vs 2.5 cm; p = 0.04). Frozen section was not used in 17 patients (5.9%), and none had positive margins on final pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Frozen section analysis of the bronchial margin rarely yields a positive result and infrequently changes intraoperative management in patients undergoing NSCLC resection.

We characterized the natural history of the disease and the effect of surgical intervention. METHODS: Ninety-five children diagnosed with supravalvular aortic stenosis between 1976 and 2006 were studied. Procedural and repeated echocardiography reports were analyzed. RESULTS: Stenosis morphology (localized, 82%; diffuse, 18%) was independent of Williams syndrome (n = 59, 62%). The risk of open operation (n = 47) was 46% +/- 6% at 10 years. Increased risk of operation was associated with higher baseline LVOT peak gradients (p < 0.001), smaller minimum LVOT z scores (p < 0.01; thresholds > 50 mm Hg and < -3, respectively), and the absence of Williams syndrome (p = 0.01). Patients who did not undergo operations had gradually reducing LVOT gradients and enlarging ascending aorta z scores over time. Persistently small minimum LVOT z scores and higher gradients were associated with children who required an operation. Operation resulted in persistent relief of LVOT obstruction and accelerated increases in ascending aorta dimensions. Overall survival was 94% +/- 3% and 85% +/- 7% at 10 and 15 years and was similar for surgical and nonsurgical groups. No independent risk factors for death were identified on univariate or multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Many children-particularly those with Williams syndrome-show regression of stenosis without intervention. Children who undergo operation have high LVOT gradients and smaller LVOT z scores that do not improve over time. Surgical intervention alters the natural history: LVOT obstruction is relieved and does not recur, and ascending aortic dimensions progressively enlarge towards normal values.",2008,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.08.031,86,6,1919-1927; discussion 1927,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Decision Making and Cohort Studies and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Age Factors and Survival Analysis and Severity of Illness Index and Education, Medical, Continuing and Echocardiography, Doppler and Aortic Stenosis, Supravalvular/*congenital/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery/therapy and Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*methods/mortality and Heart Defects, Congenital/diagnostic imaging/mortality/therapy and Williams Syndrome/diagnosis/mortality/therapy",NA,NA,2008/12//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The value of this score in predicting short- and long-term survival with medical or surgical management in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) is unknown. METHODS: In a cohort of 694 patients (aged 71 <c2><b1> 11 years) with isolated, asymptomatic severe AS (velocity <e2><89><a5>4 m/s), STS score was calculated at baseline and its link to survival analyzed. Patients were stratified by STS score less than 4%, 4% to 6.5%, and 6.5% or greater. RESULTS: The STS score showed no association with operative mortality within 1 year of diagnosis or any time (1%, 2.9%, and 6.1%, respectively, by strata; p = 0.08) and a weak association with 1-year survival (p = 0.04). Conversely, long-term survival (10-year) was strongly predicted by STS score strata (78%, 47%, and 16%, respectively; p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, STS score independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio/1%, 1.15 [1.12 to 1.18], p < 0.0001) or cardiac death (1.21 [1.17 to 1.25], p < 0.0001). Aortic valve replacement within 1 year of diagnosis markedly improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.58, p < 0.001). However, benefit of early surgery varied according to strata, with no overt benefit with low score (p = 0.83), whereas early surgery considerably improved survival in the intermediate strata (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with asymptomatic severe AS, STS score is a powerful tool for predicting long-term outcome and for selecting patients (particularly those at intermediate risk) who benefit markedly from early surgery. Hence, risk-scoring using STS score should be routinely performed in patients with AS to support the clinical decision-making process.",2010,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.07.070,90,6,1876-1883,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Risk Factors and Prognosis and Predictive Value of Tests and Follow-Up Studies and Severity of Illness Index and United States/epidemiology and Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/*methods and Survival Rate/trends and Blood Flow Velocity/physiology and Cause of Death/trends and Echocardiography, Doppler and Aortic Valve Stenosis/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy and Catheterization/*methods",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to develop a simple scoring system and investigate its applicability on predicting donor selection and early post-lung-transplant (LTx) outcomes. METHODS: Data of all donors referred to our institution in 2001 were initially analyzed to create a LTx donor score. Five domains, age, smoking history, chest X-ray, secretions, and arterial blood gas results, were included. A larger cohort of transplant recipients (years 2002 to 2005) was analyzed to validate the score against early post-LTx outcomes. RESULTS: In the initial 2001 cohort, 36 of 87 (41%) donors were used for 41 LTx (used group) and 51 (59%) were declined for medical (lung-exclusion group, n = 31) and general (general-exclusion group, n = 20) reasons. The median donor scores in the used, general-exclusion, and lung-exclusion groups were 2.0, 2.0, and 10.0, respectively (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis of the validation cohort, the donor score in bilateral LTx was significantly associated with post-transplant ratio of arterial oxygen tension and inspired oxygen fraction (coefficient = -16.19, p = 0.002), primary graft dysfunction grade (coefficient = 0.21, p < 0.0001), and intubation hours (coefficient = 0.05, p = 0.04); however, a significant association was not seen in single LTx.

Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches vary widely given the low incidence. Reporting additional cases may help inform medical decision making. METHODS: We reviewed diagnostic data--including echocardiography, catheterization, and MRI--and outcomes for all patients with IPADO at our institution. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients who met inclusion criteria were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 3 months (range, 1 day-45 years). In 11 patients, the duct supplying the IPADO was patent (ie, patent ductus arteriosis [PDA]); the duct had closed (ligamentum) in the other 26 patients. When performed, catheterization delineated the anatomy in 90% (100% if PDA) versus 54% with magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with a PDA were more likely to undergo intervention (100% vs 58%, P=.02) and had earlier first intervention (1 vs 20 months; P<.001). Patients diagnosed at age<e2><89><a4>6 months were more likely to undergo intervention (86% vs 50%; P=.03) and unifocalization (81% vs 44%; P=.04), and had greater IPADO flow at follow-up (40% vs 14%; P<.001). Patients who underwent any intervention had greater IPADO flow than those without intervention (38% vs 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Early IPADO diagnosis is important in long-term outcome. However, successful interventions can be performed on older patients. Diagnosis relies on angiography but magnetic resonance imaging may play an increasingly important role.

Therefore, this study characterizes cancer recurrence and its risks, assesses survival after recurrence, and contextualizes overall survival and its risks. METHODS: From 1991 to 2001, 285 patients underwent resection of stage I adenocarcinoma (pathologic) of the lung. They were followed cross-sectionally for evidence of cancer recurrence (mean follow-up 7.7 <c2><b1> 4.3 years). Risk factors for recurrence and all-cause mortality were sought among demographic, medical history, cancer pathology, and surgical procedure data. RESULTS: Cancer recurred in 99 patients. Freedom from recurrence was 92%, 72%, and 57% at 1, 5, and 10 years. Two phases of risk were found: an early hazard phase and an essentially constant late phase after 5 years, with recurrences equally distributed. Early recurrence was associated with larger tumor size in patients who did not undergo mediastinal lymphadenectomy (p = 0.004). Late recurrence was more common in patients with higher pack-years of smoking (p = 0.007). Survival after recurrence was 40% and 17% at 1 and 5 years. Overall survival (65% and 40% at 5 and 10 years) depended not only on variables related to cancer recurrence, but also those of vitality (older age, pulmonary dysfunction, postpneumonectomy state).

We also analyzed the impact of these data on surgical decision-making and adequacy of septal myectomy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 198 patients who underwent transaortic septal myectomy and evaluated baseline and provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradients obtained by Doppler echocardiography and by direct measurement of pressures in the left ventricle and aorta. RESULTS: After induction of anesthesia before myectomy, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, assessed by direct measurement, was less than the gradient documented by preoperative Doppler echocardiography in 119 patients (60%) (41 <c2><b1> 31 vs 76 <c2><b1> 40 mm Hg; P < .001). In 75 patients (38%), the obstruction was more severe (64 <c2><b1> 32 vs 35 <c2><b1> 31 mm Hg; P < .001); 4 patients (2%) had similar left ventricular outflow tract gradients. After myectomy, left ventricular outflow tract gradient decreased markedly (49 <c2><b1> 33 vs 4 <c2><b1> 8 mm Hg [P < .001] by direct measurement; 59 <c2><b1> 42 vs 4 <c2><b1> 6 mm Hg [P < .001] by transesophageal echocardiography). Cardiopulmonary bypass was resumed for more extensive myectomy in 8 (4%) patients because of a persistent residual left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 33 <c2><b1> 14 mm Hg. Of note, for 78 patients (39%) intraoperative Doppler echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular outflow tract gradient was technically inadequate.

New transcatheter therapies-including transcatheter pulmonary valves-have been developed, and their utilization could be justified by these data. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review that included baseline and operative data with cross-sectional follow-up on adolescents aged 10 to 21 years who underwent pulmonary valve replacement (n=254). We compared homograft conduits (n=84) with bioprosthetic pulmonary valves (n=170) in terms of freedom from valve dysfunction--right ventricular outflow tract obstruction greater than 50 mm Hg, or moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation--and reintervention. RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 4.4 years and was longer in the homograft cohort. Freedom from valvar dysfunction was 72%<c2><b1>4% at 5 years and 48%<c2><b1>8% at 10 years. Freedom from right ventricular outflow tract reintervention was 90%<c2><b1>3% at 5 years, 67%<c2><b1>5% at 10 years, and 47%<c2><b1>8% at 15 years. No differences existed for dysfunction or reintervention between the homograft and bioprosthetic valve cohorts. Shorter freedom from dysfunction was associated with younger age, smaller implanted valve Z-score, valve replacement after prior homograft, and higher preoperative right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) gradient. Shorter freedom from reintervention was associated with younger age, smaller implanted valve Z-score, and more recent valve implant. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents represent an important age group as an increasing number are undergoing pulmonary valve replacement, and they may be particularly impacted by new transcatheter therapies.

Jr and Hamman, Baron and Sass, Danielle M. and Harbor, Jessica P. and Mack, Michael J.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: The age and risk profile of patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is increasing, which will likely increase the proportion of CABG patients discharged to nursing homes, rehabilitation, or long-term care. Because discharge disposition can be important to a patient's treatment goals, developing and using predictive tools will improve informed treatment decision making. We examined the utility of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk of mortality score in predicting discharge disposition after CABG. METHODS: From January 1, 2004 to October 31, 2011, 5,119 patients underwent isolated CABG at The Heart Hospital Baylor Plano or Baylor University Medical Center (Texas) and were discharged alive. The association between STS risk of mortality and discharge to nursing home, rehabilitation, or long-term care was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, body surface area, marital status, site, and year of operation. RESULTS: At discharge, 216 patients (4.21%) went to nursing homes, 153 (2.99%) to rehabilitation, and 115 (2.25%) to long-term care. The STS risk of mortality score was significantly positively associated with discharge status (p < 0.001). Patients with 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% STS risk of mortality had 11.25%, 22.10%, 29.45%, 35.00%, and 38.50% probability, respectively, of not being discharged home. When the STS risk of mortality was 5%, the risk of not being discharged home was 47.9% for off-pump patients and 38.10% for on-pump patients. CONCLUSIONS: STS risk score is strongly associated with CABG discharge status. Patients with a risk score exceeding 2 are at high risk (>22%) of not being discharged home. This risk should be discussed when treatment decisions are being made.",2013,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.05.042,96,4,1287-1292,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Factors and Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care and Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data and 23 and *Coronary Artery Bypass/rehabilitation,NA,NA,2013/10//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation there has been a surge in referral for treatment. We present the outcome of patients referred to a multidisciplinary meeting. METHODS: A total of 175 patients were reviewed between January 2008 and March 2010. Patients' characteristics, investigations, and their outcome designated for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, surgical aortic valve replacement, and medical therapy were studied. The decision making process was a combination of known risk factors accounted for in the European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation and factors unaccounted for in traditional scoring systems. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent transcatheter implantation, 74 underwent surgical valve replacement, and 38 were treated medically. There were no deaths at 30 days in the transcatheter or surgical group. There were more strokes (6.3% vs 1.4%, p = 0.057) and pacemaker implantations (25% vs 0, p = 0.0001) in the transcatheter group compared with the surgical group. The patients in the transcatheter group had shorter ventilation and intensive care stays. Similar numbers were discharged home or to their original residence. At median follow-up of 466 days, more patients had paravalvular and central aortic valve regurgitation in the transcatheter group. At one year there were more deaths in the medically managed group (30%), compared with the transcatheter (17%) or surgical groups (4%).

Accurate prediction of a patient's risk of this morbid complication is hindered by its low relative incidence. In an effort to support clinical decision making and quality improvement, we developed a preoperative prediction model for postoperative pneumonia after CABG. METHODS: We undertook an observational study of 16,084 patients undergoing CABG between the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2014 across 33 institutions participating in the Michigan Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative. Variables related to patient demographics, medical history, admission status, comorbid disease, cardiac anatomy, and the institution performing the procedure were investigated. Logistic regression through forward stepwise selection (p < 0.05 threshold) was utilized to develop a risk prediction model for estimating the occurrence of pneumonia. Traditional methods were used to assess the model's performance. RESULTS: Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 3.30% of patients. Multivariable analysis identified 17 preoperative factors, including demographics, laboratory values, comorbid disease, pulmonary and cardiac function, and operative status. The final model significantly predicted the occurrence of pneumonia, and performed well (C-statistic: 0.74). These findings were confirmed through sensitivity analyses by center and clinically important subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 17 readily obtainable preoperative variables associated with postoperative pneumonia.

A new risk model for in-hospital stroke after TAVR was developed and used to estimate site-specific performance. METHODS: We included 97,600 TAVR procedures from 521 sites in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry from July 2014 to June 2017. Association between baseline covariates and in-hospital stroke was estimated by logistic regression. Discrimination was evaluated by C-statistic. Calibration was tested internally via cross-validation. Hierarchical modeling was used to estimate risk-adjusted site-specific performance. RESULTS: Median age was 82 years, 44,926 (46.0%) were women, and 1,839 (1.9%) had in-hospital stroke. Covariates associated with stroke (odds ratio) included transapical access (1.44), access excluding transapical and transfemoral (1.77), prior stroke (1.57), prior transient ischemic attack (1.50), preprocedural shock, inotropes or mechanical assist device (1.48), smoking (1.28), porcelain aorta (1.23), peripheral arterial disease (1.21), age per 5 years (1.11), glomerular filtration rate per 5 mL/min (0.97), body surface area per m(2) (0.55 male; 0.43 female), and prior aortic valve (0.78) and nonaortic valvular (0.42) procedures. The C-statistic was 0.622. Calibration curves demonstrated agreement between observed and expected stroke rates. Hierarchical modeling showed 10 (1.9%) centers with significantly higher odds ratios for in-hospital stroke than their peers.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of preterm infants born 28(+6) weeks or less gestational age with persistent large patent ductus arteriosus being considered for surgical ligation after unsuccessful medical therapy. Infants in epoch 1 (July 2009 to June 2012) were immediately referred for ligation, and infants in epoch 2 (July 2012 to June 2015) were treated with oral acetaminophen and referred for ligation in the absence of improvement. The primary outcome was a composite of death or chronic lung disease. RESULTS: A total of 92 infants with median (interquartile range) gestational age 25.2 weeks (24.4-26.3) had persistent large patent ductus arteriosus (43 in epoch 1, 49 in epoch 2). Infants in epoch 2 had decreased surgical ligation (26 [53%] vs 31 [72%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.89) but increased chronic lung disease (36 [73%] vs 25 [58%]; aOR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.05-10.58) and increased death/chronic lung disease of borderline significance (39 [80%] vs 29 [67%]; aOR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.99-9.63). Infants in epoch 2 took longer to wean off of positive pressure ventilation (28.5 vs 24 days after enrollment; aOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Late oral acetaminophen therapy for infants with persistent patent ductus arteriosus is associated with reduced surgical ligation but increased chronic lung disease.

Chad",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: A growing literature describes aneurysmal deterioration after implantation of the stentless porcine aortic Medtronic Freestyle bioprosthesis (MFB; Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN), with some suggesting inadequate tissue fixation with immune response as a cause. However, disjointed reports make the significance of these findings difficult to interpret. We address this concern by aggregating available data. METHODS: We reviewed institutional data, the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience registry, and the medical literature for mention of aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm after MFB. Case details were aggregated, and the rate of aneurysmal deterioration was estimated. Immunohistopathologic examination of institutional explanted specimens was performed to elucidate a cause. RESULTS: We found 42 cases of aneurysmal deterioration with adequate detail for analysis; all occurred with full root replacement and valve sizes ranging from 23 to 29 mm. The rate of aneurysmal deterioration considering all data sources was 1.1% (9 of 851; 95% confidence interval, 0.5% to 2.0%) vs 4.7% (4 of 86; 95% confidence interval, 1.3% to 11.5%) at our institution, where yearly surveillance imaging is performed. Rate of aneurysmal deterioration appeared constant until 5 years after the operation; however, events are reported out to 10 years. Consistent with previous reports, histopathology demonstrated an immune cell infiltrate in areas of MFB wall breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal deterioration is an increasingly described complication of MFB implantation as a full root, with an incidence as high as 4.7%. Given the observed immune reaction and lack of occurrence in smaller (19-mm and 21-mm) valve sizes, inadequate pressure fixation of larger valves is a potential etiology. Patients with MFB require annual surveillance imaging, and consideration of this complication should factor into preoperative decision making because treatment mandates redo root replacement, which may not be feasible in high-risk patients.",2014,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.06.062,98,6,2061-2067,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Prospective Studies and Animals and Follow-Up Studies and Postoperative Complications and Swine and Tomography, X-Ray Computed and Imaging, Three-Dimensional and Prosthesis Design and Bioprosthesis/*adverse effects and Prosthesis Failure and Heart Valve Prosthesis/*adverse effects and Aneurysm, False/diagnosis/*etiology and Angiography and Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnosis/*etiology and Aortic Valve Stenosis/diagnosis/*surgery and Aortic Valve/surgery and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine",NA,NA,2014/12//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

While its benefits have been thoroughly explored in infants weighing more than 3 kg, similar analyses are lacking in lower weight neonates. This single-center study investigated outcomes and risks for poor survival among infants weighing 3 kg or less. METHODS: A retrospective review of infants 3 kg or less who required postcardiotomy ECMO support was performed (January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2010). Primary outcome was 30-day survival after decannulation. Factors analyzed for association with poor outcome included demographics, cardiac anatomy, bypass and circulatory arrest times, total ECMO support time, postoperative lactate, inotrope use, and need for renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: During the study period, 64 patients weighing 3 kg or less required postcardiotomy ECMO. Median gestational age and age at ECMO initiation were 38 weeks (interquartile range, 36 to 39) and 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 9), respectively, with median ECMO support time of 164 hours (interquartile range, 95 to 231). Overall 30-day survival after decannulation was 33%. Factors associated with poor outcome were longer duration of support (231 hours or more, 12% survival, versus less than 231 hours, 40% survival; p = 0.05) and renal replacement therapy (n = 36, survival 17% versus 54%; p = 0.002). Multivariable regression analysis identified renal replacement therapy as the only independent factor associated with poor survival (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 14.9, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: For infants weighing 3 kg or less, 30-day survival after decannulation after cardiac ECMO is poor. Factors associated with poor prognosis were need for renal replacement therapy and longer duration of ECMO support.

The incidence and outcomes of federal cases related to cardiac surgery have not been previously explored. METHODS: A legal research service was queried for cardiac surgery-related terms. Citations and related documents were reviewed for relevance and case details. Inclusion criteria were federal district court cases involving cardiac operations. Exclusion criteria were rulings on solely procedural matters. Associations were explored using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of 354 unique citations from 1956 to 2017, 19.2% (n = 68) met criteria. The highest number of cases (25% [n = 17]) were litigated in the Third Circuit. Operations involved coronary artery bypass grafting in 33.8% (n = 23), valves in 32.4% (n = 22), and congenital operations in 19.1% (n = 13). Litigation was prompted by media reporting in 10.3% (n = 7) and involved neurologic injury in 17.6% (n = 12), death in 33.8% (n = 23), and informed consent issues in 29.4% (n = 20). Findings were summary judgment for the defendant in 45.6% (n = 31), partial summary judgment in 17.6% (n = 12), dismissal in 27.9% (n = 19), and ruling for the plaintiff in 7.4% (n = 5).

Jr and Melby, Spencer J.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: The recently developed American College of Cardiology Foundation-Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Collaboration on the Comparative Effectiveness of Revascularization Strategy (ASCERT) Long-Term Survival Probability Calculator is a valuable addition to existing short-term risk-prediction tools for cardiac surgical procedures but has yet to be externally validated. METHODS: Institutional data of 654 patients aged 65 years or older undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between 2005 and 2010 were reviewed. Predicted survival probabilities were calculated using the ASCERT model. Survival data were collected using the Social Security Death Index and institutional medical records. Model calibration and discrimination were assessed for the overall sample and for risk-stratified subgroups based on (1) ASCERT 7-year survival probability and (2) the predicted risk of mortality (PROM) from the STS Short-Term Risk Calculator. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate additional perioperative variables contributing to death. RESULTS: Overall survival was 92.1% (569 of 597) at 1 year and 50.5% (164 of 325) at 7 years. Calibration assessment found no significant differences between predicted and actual survival curves for the overall sample or for the risk-stratified subgroups, whether stratified by predicted 7-year survival or by PROM. Discriminative performance was comparable between the ASCERT and PROM models for 7-year survival prediction (p < 0.001 for both; C-statistic = 0.815 for ASCERT and 0.781 for PROM). Prolonged ventilation, stroke, and hospital length of stay were also predictive of long-term death. CONCLUSIONS: The ASCERT survival probability calculator was externally validated for prediction of long-term survival after coronary artery bypass grafting in all risk groups. The widely used STS PROM performed comparably as a predictor of long-term survival.

Duane and Lowe, James E. and Smith, Peter K.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,"BACKGROUND: The development of laser-assisted extraction techniques for chronically implanted pacemaker and defibrillator leads has reduced the need for open surgical removal. Reports of the mortality from laser-assisted extraction range from 1.9% to 3.4%. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of major cardiovascular injury and emphasize the need for cardiothoracic surgical participation in this procedure. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of 112 consecutive laser-assisted lead extractions at a single university medical center during a 6-year period. Patient and lead characteristics were analyzed as well as indications, outcomes, and major complications. RESULTS: Successful lead extraction was accomplished in 103 (92%) of the 112 patients. Elective sternotomy after failure of laser-assisted lead removal was successfully performed in 4 patients. Emergent surgical intervention was required in 4 patients for caval perforation (n = 2), subclavian vein injury (n = 1), or right atrial injury (n = 1). Three of the 4 patients requiring emergent intervention died, for an overall series mortality of 2.6%. In July of 2006, a policy of cardiothoracic surgeon presence during the laser-assisted extraction was instituted. Since that time, there has been one emergent sternotomy and one elective sternotomy for lead removal with no procedure-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent advances in laser technology for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads, the potential for major cardiovascular injury and death remains. Involvement of the cardiothoracic surgeon in both the preoperative decision-making process as well as the laser-assisted lead extraction is critical to prevent or emergently treat any major complications.",2009,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.02.015,87,5,1446-50; discussion 1450-1451,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Equipment Failure and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology and Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*standards and Defibrillators, Implantable/*adverse effects and Device Removal/instrumentation/*methods and Electrodes, Implanted/*adverse effects and Heart Arrest/etiology and Lasers and Pacemaker, Artificial/*adverse effects and Sick Sinus Syndrome/etiology and Tachycardia, Ventricular/etiology and Thoracic Surgery/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: All patients who underwent redo cardiac operations in which the initial and subsequent procedures were performed through a median sternotomy were included. A logistic regression model was created to identify independent preoperative predictors of in-hospital mortality. The results were then used to create a scorecard predicting operative risk. RESULTS: A total of 1,521 patients underwent redo procedures between 1995 and 2010 at a single institution. Coronary bypass procedures were the most common previous (58%) or planned operations (54%). The unadjusted in-hospital mortality for all redo cases was higher than for first-time procedures (9.7% vs. 3.4%; p<0.001). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were a composite urgency variable (odds ratio [OR], 3.47), older age (70-79 years, OR, 2.74; <e2><89><a5>80 years, OR, 3.32), more than 2 previous sternotomies (OR, 2.69), current procedure other than isolated coronary or valve operation (OR, 2.64), preoperative renal failure (OR, 1.89), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (OR, 1.55); all p<0.05. A scorecard was generated using these independent predictors, stratifying patients undergoing redo cardiac operations into 6 risk categories of in-hospital mortality ranging from <5% risk to >40%. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperation represents a significant proportion of modern cardiac surgical procedures and is often associated with significantly higher mortality than first-time operations. We created an easy-to-use scorecard to assist clinicians in estimating operative mortality to ensure optimal decision making in the care of patients facing redo cardiac operations.",2012,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.04.062,94,3,778-784,eng,1552-6259 0003-4975,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Sex Factors and Cohort Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Odds Ratio and Age Factors and Incidence and Survival Rate and Academic Medical Centers and Statistics, Nonparametric and Hospital Mortality/*trends and *Cause of Death and *Preoperative Care and Postoperative Care/methods and Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/methods/*mortality and Coronary Artery Bypass/adverse effects/methods/mortality and Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality and Postoperative Complications/mortality/surgery and Reoperation/methods/mortality",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,Ann Thorac Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
