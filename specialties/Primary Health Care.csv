Kueper_2020_Anoffame,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence and Primary Care Research: A Scoping Review,"Kueper, Jacqueline K. and Terry, Amanda L. and Zwarenstein, Merrick and Lizotte, Daniel J.",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: Rapid increases in technology and data motivate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to primary care, but no comprehensive review exists to guide these efforts. Our objective was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on AI for primary care. METHODS: We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published or gray literature databases with terms pertaining to AI (eg, machine learning, bayes* network) and primary care (eg, general pract*, nurse). We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by 7 attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS: Of 5,515 unique documents, 405 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Research on AI for primary care is at an early stage of maturity. For the field to progress, more interdisciplinary research teams with end-user engagement and evaluation studies are needed.",2020,10.1370/afm.2518,18,3,250-258,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,artificial intelligence and Humans and decision support and electronic health records and data mining and big data and treatment and diagnosis and primary care and health informatics and health information technology and *Artificial Intelligence and *Primary Health Care and scoping review and family medicine and Interdisciplinary Research/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Matulis_2021_Joofgeinme,JOUR,"Patient-Centered Appointment Scheduling: a Call for Autonomy, Continuity, and Creativity","Matulis, John C. and McCoy, Rozalina",Journal of general internal medicine,"When making an appointment, patients are generally unaware of how much clinician time is available to address their concerns. Similarly, the primary care clinician is often unaware of what the patient expects to accomplish during the visit, leading to uncertainty about how much time they can allot to each sequentially appearing concern, and whether they can reasonably expect to address necessary preventive services and chronic disease management. Neither patient nor clinician expectations can be adequately managed through standardized scheduling templates, which assign a fixed appointment length based on a single stated reason for the visit. As such, standardized appointment scheduling may contribute to inefficient use of valuable face-to-face time, patient and clinician dissatisfaction, and low-value care. Herein, we suggest several potential mechanisms for improving the scheduling process, including (1) entrusting scheduling to the primary care team; (2) advance visit planning; (3) pro-active engagement of ancillary team members including behavioral health, nursing, social work, and pharmacy; and (4) application of innovative, technologically advanced solutions such as telehealth and artificial intelligence to the scheduling process. These changes have the potential to improve efficiency, patient and clinician satisfaction, and health outcomes, while decreasing low-value testing and return visits for unaddressed concerns.",2021,10.1007/s11606-020-06058-9,36,2,511-514,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Primary Health Care and Chronic Disease and *Artificial Intelligence and *Appointments and Schedules and call center and primary healthcare and appointments and schedules and healthcare quality and professional autonomy,NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wilfling_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,Big data analysis techniques to address polypharmacy in patients - a scoping review,"Wilfling, D. and Hinz, A. and Steinhauser, J.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy is a key challenge in healthcare especially in older and multimorbid patients. The use of multiple medications increases the potential for drug interactions and for prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. eHealth solutions are increasingly recommended in healthcare, with big data analysis techniques as a major component. In the following we use the term analysis of big data as referring to the computational analysis of large data sets to find patterns, trends, and associations in large data sets collected from a wide range of sources in contrast to using classical statistics programs. It is hypothesized that big data analysis is able to reveal patterns in patient data that would not be identifiable using conventional methods of data analysis. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether there are existing big data analysis techniques that can help to identify patients consuming multiple drugs and to assist in the reduction of polypharmacy in patients. METHODS: A computerized search was conducted in February 2019 and updated in May 2020, using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. The search strategy was defined by the principles of a systematic search, using the PICO scheme. All studies evaluating big data analytics about patients consuming multiple drugs were considered. Two researchers assessed all search results independently to identify eligible studies. The data was then extracted into standardized tables. RESULTS: A total of 327 studies were identified through the database search. After title and abstract screening, 302 items were removed. Only three studies were identified as addressing big data analysis techniques in patients with polypharmacy. One study extracted antipsychotic polypharmacy data, the second introduced a decision support system to evaluate side-effects in patients with polypharmacy and the third evaluated a decision support system to identify polypharmacy-related problems in individuals. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies to date which have used big data analysis techniques for identification and management of polypharmacy. There may be a need to further explore interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and healthcare professionals, to develop and evaluate big data analysis techniques that can be implemented to manage polypharmacy.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01247-1,21,1,180,eng,1471-2296,Humans and Aged and Big Data and Big data and Polypharmacy and eHealth and Potentially Inappropriate Medication List and *Data Analysis and *Polypharmacy and Multimorbidity,NA,NA,2020/09/03/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lin_2019_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Ten Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Primary Care,"Lin, Steven Y. and Mahoney, Megan R. and Sinsky, Christine A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised as a transformational force in healthcare. This paper presents a current environmental scan, through the eyes of primary care physicians, of the top ten ways AI will impact primary care and its key stakeholders. We discuss ten distinct problem spaces and the most promising AI innovations in each, estimating potential market sizes and the Quadruple Aims that are most likely to be affected. Primary care is where the power, opportunity, and future of AI are most likely to be realized in the broadest and most ambitious scale. We propose how these AI-powered innovations must augment, not subvert, the patient-physician relationship for physicians and patients to accept them. AI implemented poorly risks pushing humanity to the margins; done wisely, AI can free up physicians' cognitive and emotional space for patients, and shift the focus away from transactional tasks to personalized care. The challenge will be for humans to have the wisdom and willingness to discern AI's optimal role in twenty-first century healthcare, and to determine when it strengthens and when it undermines human healing. Ongoing research will determine the impact of AI technologies in achieving better care, better health, lower costs, and improved well-being of the workforce.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-05035-1,34,8,1626-1630,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,artificial intelligence and Humans and primary care and Risk Assessment/methods and Artificial Intelligence/*trends and patient-physician relationship and Primary Health Care/economics/organization & administration/*trends and Quadruple Aim,NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chawla_2013_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Bringing big data to personalized healthcare: a patient-centered framework,"Chawla, Nitesh V. and Davis, Darcy A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"Faced with unsustainable costs and enormous amounts of under-utilized data, health care needs more efficient practices, research, and tools to harness the full benefits of personal health and healthcare-related data.

We sought to identify and characterize latent subgroups of high-risk patients based on risk score trajectories. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of 7289 patients discharged from Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals during a 1-week period in November 2012 and categorized in the top 5th percentile of risk for hospitalization. METHODS: Using VA administrative data, we calculated weekly risk scores using the validated Care Assessment Needs model, reflecting the predicted probability of hospitalization. We applied the non-parametric k-means algorithm to identify latent subgroups of patients based on the trajectory of patients' hospitalization probability over a 2-year period. We then compared baseline sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, health service use, and social instability markers between identified latent subgroups. RESULTS: The best-fitting model identified two subgroups: moderately high and persistently high risk. The moderately high subgroup included 65% of patients and was characterized by moderate subgroup-level hospitalization probability decreasing from 0.22 to 0.10 between weeks 1 and 66, then remaining constant through the study end. The persistently high subgroup, comprising the remaining 35% of patients, had a subgroup-level probability increasing from 0.38 to 0.41 between weeks 1 and 52, and declining to 0.30 at study end. Persistently high-risk patients were older, had higher prevalence of social instability and comorbidities, and used more health services. CONCLUSIONS: On average, one third of patients initially identified as high risk stayed at very high risk over a 2-year follow-up period, while risk for the other two thirds decreased to a moderately high level. This suggests that multiple approaches may be needed to address high-risk patient needs longitudinally or intermittently.",2018,10.1007/s11606-018-4653-x,33,12,2120-2126,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and patient-centered medical home and risk stratification and Follow-Up Studies and United States/epidemiology and Hospitalization/*trends and high risk and Hospitals, Veterans/standards/*trends and latent subgroups and Machine Learning/standards/*trends and trajectory and United States Department of Veterans Affairs/standards/*trends",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Khanna_2019_Anoffame,JOUR,Practice Transformation Analytics Dashboard for Clinician Engagement,"Khanna, Niharika and Gritzer, Lauren and Klyushnenkova, Elena and Montgomery, Russ and Dark, Michael and Shah, Savyasachi and Shaya, Fadia",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: Practice transformation in primary care is a movement toward data-driven redesign of care, patient-centered care delivery, and practitioner activation. A critical requirement for achieving practice transformation is availability of tools to engage practices. METHODS: A total of 48 practices with 109 practice sites participate in the Garden Practice Transformation Network in Maryland (GPTN-Maryland) to work together toward practice transformation and readiness for the Quality Payment Program implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Practice-specific data are collected in GPTN-Maryland by practices themselves and by practice transformation coaches, and are provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These data are overwhelming to practices when presented piecemeal or together, a barrier to practices taking action to ensure progress on the transformation spectrum. The GPTN-Maryland team therefore created a practice transformation analytics dashboard as a tool to present data that are actionable in care redesign. RESULTS: When practices reviewed their data provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services using the dashboard, they were often seeing, for the first time, cost data on their patients, trends in their key performance indicator data, and their practice transformation phase. Overall, 72% of practices found the dashboard engaging, and 48% found the data as presented to be actionable. CONCLUSIONS: The practice transformation analytics dashboard encourages practices to advance in practice transformation and improvement of patient care delivery. This tool engaged practices in discussions about data, care redesign, and costs of care, and about how to develop sustainable change within their practices. Research is needed to study the impact of the dashboard on costs and quality of care delivery.",2019,10.1370/afm.2382,17,Suppl 1,S73-S76,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"United States and Humans and Quality Indicators, Health Care and primary care and value-based care and Maryland and health information technology and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Patient Care Management/organization & administration and quality indicators, health care and analytics data dashboard and Medicare/statistics & numerical data and Patient-Centered Care/economics/*organization & administration/standards and practice transformation and practice-based research and Quality of Health Care/economics/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2019/08/12/,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Molokhia_2017_BMCfampra,JOUR,Current and future perspectives on the management of polypharmacy,"Molokhia, Mariam and Majeed, Azeem",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Because of ageing populations, the growth in the number of people with multi-morbidity and greater compliance with disease-specific guidelines, polypharmacy is becoming increasingly common. Although the correct drug treatment in patients with complex medical problems can improve clinical outcomes, quality of life and life expectancy, polypharmacy is also associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events, some severe enough to result in hospital admission and even death. Hence, having systems in place to ensure that medications are started only when there is a suitable indication, ensuring patients are fully aware of the benefits and complications that may arise from their treatment, and reviewing patients regularly to ensure their medication regime remains appropriate, are essential. DISCUSSION: The development and rapid uptake of electronic patient records - particularly in primary care settings where the majority of prescribing takes place - makes monitoring of patients more straightforward than in the past; and allows identification of sub-groups of patients at particularly high risk of adverse drug events and complications. It also facilitates 'deprescribing' the process by which medications are reviewed and stopped if not clinically beneficial. In recent years, we have also seen the development of smartphone 'apps' to improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals, improve people's understanding of their conditions and their treatment, and maintain a record of changes made to patient's medication. In the longer term, developments such as the introduction of artificial intelligence and clinical decision support systems also have the potential to improve prescribing and minimise the risks from polypharmacy. Finally, there is considerable scope to improve the quality of prescribing and reduce risks from poly-pharmacy using non-medical groups such as pharmacists, specialist nurses and physician assistants. Polypharmacy has increased in recent decades and will continue to increase as populations age and the number of people with multiple long-term conditions increases. As with all areas of medicine, the evidence-base in this area continues to evolve. Further trials on the impact on patients with polypharmacy of new interventions such as technology-based solutions and the use of different professional groups are needed to improve the evidence-base in this area.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0642-0,18,1,70,eng,1471-2296,Patient safety and Humans and Risk Assessment and Aged and Forecasting and Patient Participation and Risk Factors and Polypharmacy and Medication Reconciliation and Multimorbidity/trends and *Polypharmacy and Multimorbidity and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/etiology/prevention & control,NA,NA,2017/06/06/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hojat_2020_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Doubling Hepatitis C Virus Screening in Primary Care Using Advanced Electronic Health Record Tools-A Non-Randomized Controlled Trial,"Hojat, Leila and Avery, Ann and Greco, Peter J. and Kaelber, David C.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health burden, affecting over 4 million people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening everyone born between 1945 and 1965, but screening rates remain low. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bulk ordering and electronic messaging to patients improves guideline-based HCV screening rates. DESIGN: A non-randomized controlled trial of 1024 adults from November 2016 to March 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Patients due for HCV screening with at least one primary care office visit in one of three primary care clinics and enrolled in the healthcare system's tethered personal health record (tPHR). INTERVENTIONS: Control patients received normal care for HCV screening, consisting of passive HCV reminders to providers during face-to-face visits and passive HCV screening notification through the patient's tPHR. Intervention patients received normal care and also had HCV antibody tests ordered for them and customized messages sent through their tPHR inviting them to go directly to the lab for HCV screening over a 12-week period. MAIN MEASURES: Percentage/number of patients receiving HCV antibody tests during the intervention period. Percentage/number of intervention group patients receiving HCV screening with other blood work. KEY RESULTS: In the intervention group, 33% (168 of 514) completed HCV testing, compared with 19% (97 of 510) of controls (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.1). Bulk lab ordering appeared to have a large impact while bulk messaging appeared to have a less significant role. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging population analytics and bulk ordering in an electronic health record with bulk messaging to a tPHR directly engages patients in blood screening tests and can significantly improve completion. This methodology has a broad range of applications including many recommended screening or disease-specific testing. This bulk ordering and direct-to-patient messaging approach improves patient screening while decreasing provider/staff work.

Krishnakumar_2019_BMCfampra,JOUR,What rationale do GPs use to choose a particular antibiotic for a specific clinical situation?,"Krishnakumar, Jegatha and Tsopra, Rosy",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated the ways in which physicians decide whether to prescribe antibiotics, but very few studies have focused on the reasons for which general practitioners (GPs) choose to prescribe a particular antibiotic in a specific clinical situation. Improvements in our understanding of the rationale behind GPs' decisions would provide insight into the reasons for which GPs do not always prescribe the antibiotic recommended in clinical practice guidelines and facilitate the development of appropriate interventions to improve antibiotic prescription. The objective of the study was to understand the rationale used by GPs to decide which antibiotic to prescribe in a specific clinical situation, and to propose a model representing this rationale. METHODS: We used a three-step process. First, data were collected from interviews with 20 GPs, and analysed according to the grounded theory approach. Second, data were collected from publications exploring the factors used by GPs to choose an antibiotic. Third, data were used to develop a comprehensive model of the rationale used by GPs to decide which antibiotic to prescribe. RESULTS: The GPs considered various factors when choosing antibiotics: factors relating to microbiology (bacterial resistance), pharmacology (adverse effects, efficacy, practicality of the administration protocol, antibiotic class, drug cost), clinical conditions (patient profile and comorbid conditions, symptoms, progression of infection, history of antibiotic treatment, preference), and personal factors (GP's experience, knowledge, emotion, preference). CONCLUSIONS: Various interventions, targeting all the factors underlying antibiotic choice, are required to improve antibiotic prescription. GP-related factors could be improved through interventions aiming to improve the GPs' knowledge of antibiotics (e.g. continuing medical education). Factors relating to microbiology, pharmacology and clinical conditions could be targeted through the use of clinical decision support systems in everyday clinical practice.",2019,10.1186/s12875-019-1068-7,20,1,178,eng,1471-2296,"General practice and Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Interviews as Topic and General Practitioners/*psychology and *Choice Behavior and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Clinical decision-making and Antibacterial agents",NA,NA,2019/12/20/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

These include the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR) initiated in 2010, the 500 Cities Project initiated in 2016, and the City Health Dashboard project initiated in 2017. Such projects provide data on a range of factors that determine health-such as socioeconomic factors, behavioral factors, health care access, and environmental factors-either at the county or city level. They provided state-of-the-art data visualization and interaction tools so that clinicians, public health practitioners, and policymakers can easily understand population health data at the local level. However, these recent initiatives were all built from data collected using long-standing and extant public health surveillance systems from organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Census Bureau.

Medical tourism introduces challenges to decision-making that impact and are impacted by the physician-patient trust relationship-a relationship on which the foundation of beneficent health care lies. The objective of the study is to examine the views of Canadian family physicians about the roles that trust plays in decision-making about medical tourism, and the impact of medical tourism on the therapeutic relationship. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups with 22 family physicians in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Data were analyzed thematically using deductive and inductive codes that captured key concepts across the narratives of participants. RESULTS: Family physicians indicated that they trust their patients to act as the lead decision-makers about medical tourism, but are conflicted when the information they are managing contradicts the best interests of the patients. They reported that patients distrust local health care systems when they experience insufficiencies in access to care and that this can prompt patients to consider going abroad for care. Trust fractures in the physician-patient relationship can arise from shame, fear and secrecy about medical tourism. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians face diverse tensions about medical tourism as they must balance their roles in: (1) providing information about medical tourism within a context of information deficits; (2) supporting decision-making while distancing themselves from patients' decisions to engage in medical tourism; and (3) acting both as agents of the patient and of the domestic health care system.

Braun_2009_Anoffame,JOUR,Reconceptualizing the experience of surrogate decision making: reports vs genuine decisions,"Braun, Ursula K. and Naik, Aanand D. and McCullough, Laurence B.",Annals of family medicine,"BACKGROUND: We propose a reconceptualization of surrogate decision making when patients lack an advance directive stating their preferences about life-sustaining treatment. This reconceptualization replaces the current 2-standard model of substituted judgment (based on the patient's prior preferences and values) and best interests (an assessment of how best to protect and promote the patient's health-related and other interests). METHODS: We undertook a conceptual analysis based on the ethics of informed consent, a qualitative study of how surrogates of seriously ill patients experience the surrogate's role, and descriptions of decision making. RESULTS: When the surrogate can meet the substituted judgment standard, the experience of the surrogate should be understood as providing a report, not making a decision. Surrogate decisions based on the best interest standard are experienced as genuine decisions, and the label ""surrogate decision making"" should be reserved to characterize only these experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should identify clinically reasonable options and elicit the surrogate's sense of decision-making burden. Some surrogates will be able to make reports, and the physician should make a clear recommendation that implements the patient's reported preference. Some surrogates will confront genuine decisions, which should be managed by negotiating treatment goals. Requests by the surrogate that everything be done may represent a psychosocially burdensome decision, and support should be provided to help the surrogate work through the decision-making process.",2009,10.1370/afm.963,7,3,249-253,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Advance Care Planning and Ethics, Medical and *Decision Making and Caregivers/*psychology and Professional-Family Relations and Terminal Care/ethics/methods/*psychology and Informed Consent/ethics and Physicians/ethics",NA,NA,2009/06//May undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also summarize the rules included in the register according to various characteristics. METHODS: To identify relevant articles, we searched the MEDLINE database (PubMed) for the years 1980 to 2009 and supplemented the results with searches of secondary sources (books on clinical prediction rules) and personal resources (eg, experts in the field). The rules described in relevant articles were classified according to their clinical domain, the stage of development, and the clinical setting in which they were studied. RESULTS: Our search identified clinical prediction rules reported between 1965 and 2009. The largest share of rules (37.2%) were retrieved from PubMed. The number of published rules increased substantially over the study decades. We included 745 articles in the register; many contained more than 1 clinical prediction rule study (eg, both a derivation study and a validation study), resulting in 989 individual studies. In all, 434 unique rules had gone through derivation; however, only 54.8% had been validated and merely 2.8% had undergone analysis of their impact on either the process or outcome of clinical care. The rules most commonly pertained to cardiovascular disease, respiratory, and musculoskeletal conditions. They had most often been studied in the primary care or emergency department settings. CONCLUSIONS: Many clinical prediction rules have been derived, but only about half have been validated and few have been assessed for clinical impact. This lack of thorough evaluation for many rules makes it difficult to retrieve and identify those that are ready for use at the point of patient care. We plan to develop an international web-based register of clinical prediction rules and computer-based clinical decision support systems.",2014,10.1370/afm.1640,12,4,359-366,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and decision making and primary care and Emergency Service, Hospital and Decision Support Systems, Clinical and Patient Care and Primary Health Care/*standards and *Decision Support Techniques and clinical decision support systems and decision aid and clinical prediction rule and Registries/*statistics & numerical data and score card",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Swindell_2010_Anoffame,JOUR,Beneficent persuasion: techniques and ethical guidelines to improve patients' decisions,"Swindell, J. S. and McGuire, Amy L. and Halpern, Scott D.",Annals of family medicine,"Physicians frequently encounter patients who make decisions that contravene their long-term goals. Behavioral economists have shown that irrationalities and self-thwarting tendencies pervade human decision making, and they have identified a number of specific heuristics (rules of thumb) and biases that help explain why patients sometimes make such counterproductive decisions. In this essay, we use clinical examples to describe the many ways in which these heuristics and biases influence patients' decisions. We argue that physicians should develop their understanding of these potentially counterproductive decisional biases and, in many cases, use this knowledge to rebias their patients in ways that promote patients' health or other values. Using knowledge of decision-making psychology to persuade patients to engage in healthy behaviors or to make treatment decisions that foster their long-term goals is ethically justified by physicians' duties to promote their patients' interests and will often enhance, rather than limit, their patients' autonomy. We describe techniques that physicians may use to frame health decisions to patients in ways that are more likely to motivate patients to make choices that are less biased and more conducive to their long-term goals. Marketers have been using these methods for decades to get patients to engage in unhealthy behaviors; employers and policy makers are beginning to consider the use of similar approaches to influence healthy choices. It is time for clinicians also to make use of behavioral psychology in their interactions with patients.",2010,10.1370/afm.1118,8,3,260-264,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Health Promotion and Motivation and Bias and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Health Behavior and Informed Consent and *Directive Counseling and Professional Autonomy and Physicians/psychology and *Decision Making and *Ethics, Medical and *Persuasive Communication and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Patient Education as Topic/ethics",NA,NA,2010/06//May undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Han_2013_Anoffame,JOUR,National evidence on the use of shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen screening,"Han, Paul K. J. and Kobrin, Sarah and Breen, Nancy and Joseph, Djenaba A. and Li, Jun and Frosch, Dominick L. and Klabunde, Carrie N.",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: Recent clinical practice guidelines on prostate cancer screening using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test (PSA screening) have recommended that clinicians practice shared decision making-a process involving clinician-patient discussion of the pros, cons, and uncertainties of screening. We undertook a study to determine the prevalence of shared decision making in both PSA screening and nonscreening, as well as patient characteristics associated with shared decision making. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 3,427 men aged 50 to 74 years participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey responded to questions on the extent of shared decision making (past physician-patient discussion of advantages, disadvantages, and scientific uncertainty associated with PSA screening), PSA screening intensity (tests in past 5 years), and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds (64.3%) of men reported no past physician-patient discussion of advantages, disadvantages, or scientific uncertainty (no shared decision making); 27.8% reported discussion of 1 to 2 elements only (partial shared decision making); 8.0% reported discussion of all 3 elements (full shared decision making). Nearly one-half (44.2%) reported no PSA screening, 27.8% reported low-intensity (less-than-annual) screening, and 25.1% reported high-intensity (nearly annual) screening. Absence of shared decision making was more prevalent in men who were not screened; 88% (95% CI, 86.2%-90.1%) of nonscreened men reported no shared decision making compared with 39% (95% CI, 35.0%-43.3%) of men undergoing high-intensity screening. Extent of shared decision making was associated with black race, Hispanic ethnicity, higher education, health insurance, and physician recommendation. Screening intensity was associated with older age, higher education, usual source of medical care, and physician recommendation, as well as with partial vs no or full shared decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Most US men report little shared decision making in PSA screening, and the lack of shared decision making is more prevalent in nonscreened than in screened men. Screening intensity is greatest with partial shared decision making, and different elements of shared decision making are associated with distinct patient characteristics. Shared decision making needs to be improved in decisions for and against PSA screening.",2013,10.1370/afm.1539,11,4,306-314,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and decision making and Risk Factors and Prevalence and United States/epidemiology and *Attitude to Health and Biomarkers, Tumor/blood and Early Detection of Cancer/*methods/psychology and mass screening and Mass Screening/*methods/psychology and Patient Navigation and Patient Participation/*methods/psychology and prostate-specific antigen and Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood and Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*prevention & control/psychology",NA,NA,2013/08//Jul undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
von.dem.Knesebeck_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,Medical decision making among patients with heart failure - does migration background matter?,"von dem Knesebeck, Olaf and Scherer, Martin and Marx, Gabriella and Koens, Sarah",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Some studies, mainly coming from the U.S., indicate disparities in heart failure (HF) treatment according to migration/ethnicity. However, respective results are inconsistent and cannot be transferred to other health care systems. Thus, we will address the following research question: Are there differences in the diagnosis and management of HF between patients with and without a Turkish migration background in Germany? METHODS: A factorial experimental design with video vignettes was applied. In the filmed simulated initial encounters, professional actors played patients, who consulted a primary care physician because of typical HF symptoms. While the dialog was identical in all videos, patients differed in terms of Turkish migration history (no/yes), sex (male/female), and age (55 years/75 years). After viewing the video, primary care physicians (N = 128) were asked standardized and open ended questions concerning their decisions on diagnosis and therapy. RESULTS: Analyses revealed no statistically significant differences (p < 0.05), but a consistent tendency: Primary care doctors more often asked lifestyle and psychosocial questions, they more often diagnosed HF, they gave more advice to rest and how to behave in case of deterioration, they more often auscultated the lung, and more often referred to a specialist when the patient has a Turkish migration history compared to a non-migrant patient. Differences in the medical decisions between the two groups ranged between 1.6 and 15.8%. In 10 out of 12 comparisons, differences were below 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that are no significant inequalities in diagnosis and management of HF according to a Turkish migration background in Germany. Primary care physicians' behaviour and medical decision making do not seem to be influenced by the migration background of the patients. Future studies are needed to verify this result and to address inequalities in HF therapy in an advanced disease stage.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01260-4,21,1,189,eng,1471-2296,Primary care and Treatment and Heart failure and Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Germany and Disparities and *Clinical Decision-Making and Migration and *Heart Failure/diagnosis/therapy and Medical decisions,NA,NA,2020/09/13/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

This reflects the importance given to primary care services in health care system reform. However, the literature provides little insight into the medical decision-making processes in general practice. Our main objective was to better understand how organizational and environmental factors influence the work of GPs. METHODS: We interviewed 28 GPs working in contrasting organizational settings and environments. The data analysis involved using structuration theory to enrich the interpretation of empirical material. RESULTS: We identified four main factors that influence the practice of GPs: mode of remuneration, peer-to-peer interactions, patients' demands and the availability of other medical resources in the environment. These four conditions of action - what we call primary effects - can directly influence the performance of medical acts and time management, as well as the degree of specialization of GPs. Decisions related to each of those aspects can have a variety of both intentional and non-intentional consequences - what we call secondary effects - that are then likely to become conditions for subsequent action. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study helps shed light on the complex causal loops of interrelated factors that shape the work of GPs.",2008,10.1186/1471-2296-9-12,9,NA,12,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Data Collection and Fee-for-Service Plans and Health Services Research and Access to Information and Qualitative Research and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Quebec and *Decision Making and National Health Programs and Primary Health Care/*organization & administration and Fees and Charges and *Family Practice/economics/organization & administration",NA,NA,2008/02/19/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ackerman_2020_Anoffame,JOUR,Patients Assess an eConsult Model's Acceptability at 5 US Academic Medical Centers,"Ackerman, Sara L. and Dowdell, Kim and Clebak, Karl T. and Quinn, Meagban and Shipman, Scott A.",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: Electronic consultation (eConsult), involving asynchronous primary care clinician-to-specialist consultation, is being adopted at a growing number of health systems. Most evaluations of eConsult programs have assessed clinical and financial impacts and clinician acceptability. Less attention has been focused on patients' opinions. We set out to understand patient perspectives and preferences for hypothetical eConsult use at 5 US academic medical centers in the process of adopting an eConsult model. METHODS: We invited adult primary care patients to participate in focus groups. Participants were introduced to the eConsult model, considered its potential benefits and drawbacks, judged the acceptability of a hypothetical copay, and expressed their preferences for future involvement in eConsult decision making and communication. Thematic analysis was used for data interpretation. RESULTS: One focus group was conducted at each of the 5 sites with a total of 52 participants. Focus groups responded positively to the idea of eConsult, with quicker access to specialty care and convenience identified as key benefits. Approval was particularly high among those with a trusted primary care clinician. Preference for involvement in eConsult decision making and communication varied and enthusiasm about eConsult waned when a hypothetical copay was introduced. Concerns included potential misuse of eConsult and exclusion of the patient's illness narrative in the eConsult exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care patients expressed strong support for eConsult, particularly when used by a trusted primary care clinician, in addition to voicing several concerns. Patient involvement in eConsult outreach and education efforts could help to enhance the model's effectiveness and acceptability.",2020,10.1370/afm.2487,18,1,35-41,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Decision Making and primary care and telemedicine and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Academic Medical Centers and *Patient Preference and Primary Health Care/*organization & administration and access to health care and clinician-patient communication and eConsult and patient preferences and referral and consultation and Remote Consultation/economics/*methods,NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Purkaple_2016_Anoffame,JOUR,Encouraging Patient-Centered Care by Including Quality-of-Life Questions on Pre-Encounter Forms,"Purkaple, Becky A. and Mold, James W. and Chen, Sixia",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: Patient participation in clinical decision making improves outcomes, including quality of life (QOL), but the typical problem-oriented approach may impede consideration of functional goals. We wondered if patients could encourage primary care physicians to pay attention to their QOL goals by writing them on pre-encounter forms. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of 2 different pre-visit questionnaires on the content of patient-physician encounters in a family medicine practice at an academic medical center. Using investigator-blinded block randomization, we arranged for 8 faculty and 8 resident physicians to participate in 2 intervention and 2 control videotaped encounters each for a total of 64 encounters. The intervention questionnaire included questions about QOL goals and concerns, while the control questionnaire asked about symptoms. Videotapes were reviewed to determine whether the patients' QOL goals were mentioned and whether they were used in decision making. We also scored encounters using Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis, which assesses and codifies patient and physician communication, and the Modified Carkhuff-Truax Scale, which measures empathy, attending, congruence, and positive regard. RESULTS: Patients were able to record QOL goals and concerns, but QOL issues were mentioned in only 2 of the 64 encounters, once by a patient and once by a physician. In neither case was this information used in decision making. More empathy was expressed by physicians during control encounters (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients were able to articulate their QOL goals on paper, but that did not prime them or their physicians to alter the process or content of the clinical encounters. In fact, providing QOL information was associated with reduced physician empathy.",2016,10.1370/afm.1905,14,3,221-226,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and general practice and quality of life and patient-centered care and Academic Medical Centers and Goals and Video Recording and *Quality of Life and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Patient Participation and *Clinical Decision-Making and Empathy and family medicine and *Physicians, Family and goal-directed care and Oklahoma and Patient-Centered Care/*standards",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Study protocol of a pilot clustered randomised controlled trial,"Legare, France and Labrecque, Michel and Leblanc, Annie and Thivierge, Robert and Godin, Gaston and Laurier, Claudine and Cote, Luc and O'Connor, Annette M. and Allain-Boule, Nadine and Rousseau, Jean and Tapp, Sylvie",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: In North America, although it varies according to the specific type of acute respiratory infections (ARI), use of antibiotics is estimated to be well above the expected prevalence of bacterial infections. The objective of this pilot clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of a larger clustered RCT aiming at evaluating the impact of DECISION+, a continuing professional development (CPD) program in shared decision making, on the optimal use of antibiotics in the context of ARI. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot study is a cluster RCT conducted with family physicians from Family Medicine Groups (FMG) in the Quebec City area, Canada. Participating FMG are randomised to an immediate DECISION+ group, a CPD program in shared decision making, (experimental group), or a delayed DECISION+ group (control group). Data collection involves recruiting five patients consulting for ARI per physician from both study groups before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) exposure of the experimental group to the DECISION+ program, and after exposure of the control group to the DECISION+ program (Phase 3). The primary outcome measures to assess the feasibility of a larger RCT include: 1) proportion of contacted FMG that agree to participate; 2) proportion of recruited physicians who participate in the DECISION+ program; 3) level of satisfaction of physicians regarding DECISION+; and 4) proportion of missing data in each data collection phase. Levels of agreement of the patient-physician dyad on the Decisional Conflict Scale and physicians' prescription profile for ARI are performed as secondary outcome measures.

Krist_2007_Anoffame,JOUR,How physicians approach prostate cancer screening before and after losing a lawsuit,"Krist, Alex H. and Woolf, Steven H. and Johnson, Robert E.",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: In 2004, a commentary by Merenstein was published in JAMA describing how he was sued for engaging a patient in shared decision making for prostate cancer screening. The article sparked considerable debate on the impact of litigation on medical care. A natural experiment (a study assessing shared decision making under way at the practice that was sued) enabled us to evaluate whether physicians changed their prostate cancer screening behavior after the lawsuit. METHODS: As part of a randomized controlled trial conducted between January 2002 and November 2004, patients and physicians completed exit questionnaires about prostate cancer screening discussions after health maintenance examinations. We compared responses before, during, and after physicians became aware of the lawsuit. RESULTS: A total of 432 of 497 patients completed questionnaires (180 before the practice became aware of the lawsuit, 87 as knowledge of the case diffused through the practice, and 165 after publication of Merenstein's commentary). Comparing patients' responses over the 3 time periods, there were no changes in the average locus of decision-making control, time spent discussing screening, number of screening topics discussed, knowledge scores, or decisional conflict. The frequency with which physicians reported performing prostate-specific antigen testing increased (before vs after: 84% vs 90%; P = .03), and physicians were more likely to report that they, rather than the patients, had made the screening decision (before vs after: 3.3% vs 11.1%; P = .003).

METHODS: We used 2014-2016 prescription and procedure Medicare data to train 3 sets of random forest classifiers (prescription only, procedure only, and combined) to predict specialty. Self-reported specialties were condensed to 27 categories. Physicians were assigned to testing and training cohorts, and random forest models were trained and then applied to 2014-2016 data sets for the testing cohort to generate a series of specialty predictions. Comparing the predicted specialty to self-report, we assessed performance with F1 scores and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values. RESULTS: A total of 564,986 physicians were included. The combined model had a greater aggregate (macro) F1 score (0.876) than the prescription-only (0.745; P <.01) or procedure-only (0.821; P <.01) model. Mean F1 scores across specialties in the combined model ranged from 0.533 to 0.987. The mean F1 score was 0.920 for primary care. The mean AUROC value for the combined model was 0.992, with values ranging from 0.982 to 0.999. The AUROC value for primary care was 0.982.

Barrett_2016_BMCfampra,JOUR,Communicating statin evidence to support shared decision-making,"Barrett, Bruce and Ricco, Jason and Wallace, Margaret and Kiefer, David and Rakel, Dave",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: The practice of clinical medicine rests on a foundation of ethical principles as well as scientific knowledge. Clinicians must artfully balance the principle of beneficence, doing what is best for patients, with autonomy, allowing patients to make their own well-informed health care decisions. The clinical communication process is complicated by varying degrees of confidence in scientific evidence regarding patient-oriented benefits, and by the fact that most medical options are associated with possible harms as well as potential benefits. DISCUSSION: Evidence-based clinical guidelines often neglect patient-oriented issues involved with the thoughtful practice of shared decision-making, where individual values, goals, and preferences should be prioritized. Guidelines on the use of statin medications for preventing cardiovascular events are a case in point. Current guidelines endorse the use of statins for people whose 10-year risk of cardiovascular events is as low as 7.5%. Previous guidelines set the 10-year risk benchmark at 20%. Meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that statins can reduce cardiovascular event rates by about 25%, bringing 10-year risk from 7.5 to 5.6%, for example, or from 20 to 15%. Whether or not these benefits should justify the use of statins for individual patients depends on how those advantages are valued in comparison with disadvantages, such as side effect risks, and with inconveniences associated with taking a pill each day and visiting clinicians and laboratories regularly. CONCLUSIONS: Whether or not the overall benefit-harm balance justifies the use of a medication for an individual patient cannot be determined by a guidelines committee, a health care system, or even the attending physician. Instead, it is the individual patient who has a fundamental right to decide whether or not taking a drug is worthwhile. Researchers and professional organizations should endeavor to develop shared decision-making tools that provide up-to-date best evidence in easily understandable formats, so as to assist clinicians in helping their patients to make the decisions that are right for them.",2016,10.1186/s12875-016-0436-9,17,NA,41,eng,1471-2296,Decision making and Primary care and Evidence-based medicine and Cost-benefit analysis and Uncertainty and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Lipids and Guidelines and Quality of life and Statins and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Outcomes and Cholesterol and Personal Autonomy and *Communication and *Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use and *Clinical Decision-Making/ethics/methods and *Decision Making/ethics and Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control and Patient preference and Shared decision-making and Patient Preference/psychology and *Patient Participation/methods/psychology and Attitude to health and Clinical significance and Minimal important difference and Preventive cardiology,NA,NA,2016/04/06/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are currently no universally accepted methods to assess medical students' competence in shared decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To characterize medical students' shared decision-making with standardized patients (SPs) and determine if students' use of shared decision-making correlates with SP ratings of their communication. DESIGN: Retrospective study of medical students' performance with four SPs. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty fourth-year medical students. MEASUREMENTS: Objective blinded coding of shared decision-making quantified as decision moments (exploration/articulation of perspective, information sharing, explicit closure for a particular decision); SP scoring of communication skills using a validated checklist. RESULTS: Of 779 decision moments generated in 240 encounters, 312 (40%) met criteria for shared decision-making. All students engaged in shared decision-making in at least two of the four cases, although in two cases 5% and 12% of students engaged in no shared decision-making. The most commonly discussed decision moment topics were medications (n = 98, 31%), follow-up visits (71, 23%), and diagnostic testing (44, 14%). Correlations between the number of decision moments in a case and students' communication scores were low (rho = 0.07 to 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Although all students engaged in some shared decision-making, particularly regarding medical interventions, there was no correlation between shared decision-making and overall communication competence rated by the SPs.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 7 focus groups with junior and senior physicians. We performed a thematic analysis during an iterative cycle of data collection and analysis.

Physicians next considered the following interrelated factors: (1) nature/strength of the relationship with the nonpatient, (2) amount of trust in his/her own knowledge and skills, (3) expected consequences of making mistakes, (4) importance of work-life balance, and (5) risk of disturbing the physician-patient process. Senior physicians applied more nuanced considerations when deciding whether to respond, whereas junior physicians experienced more difficulties dealing with these requests, were less inclined to respond, and were more concerned about disturbing the existing relationship that a person had with his/her own physician. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the complexity that physicians face when managing medical questions and requests from nonpatients. Facilitated group discussions during which experiences are shared can help junior physicians become more confident in dealing with these complex issues as they formulate their own personal strategy regarding provision of medical advice or treatment to family and friends.",2018,10.1370/afm.2152,16,1,45-51,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Trust and qualitative research and primary care and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Guidelines as Topic and Netherlands and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Family and medical education and family medicine and practice-based research and *Physicians, Family and *Friends and Work-Life Balance",NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wilkes_2013_Anoffame,JOUR,Pairing physician education with patient activation to improve shared decisions in prostate cancer screening: a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Wilkes, Michael S. and Day, Frank C. and Srinivasan, Malathi and Griffin, Erin and Tancredi, Daniel J. and Rainwater, Julie A. and Kravitz, Richard L. and Bell, Douglas S. and Hoffman, Jerome R.",Annals of family medicine,"BACKGROUND: Most expert groups recommend shared decision making for prostate cancer screening. Most primary care physicians, however, routinely order a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test with little or no discussion about whether they believe the potential benefits justify the risk of harm. We sought to assess whether educating primary care physicians and activating their patients to ask about prostate cancer screening had a synergistic effect on shared decision making, rates and types of discussions about prostate cancer screening, and the physician's final recommendations. METHODS: Our study was a cluster randomized controlled trial among primary care physicians and their patients, comparing usual education (control), with physician education alone (MD-Ed), and with physician education and patient activation (MD-Ed+A). Participants included 120 physicians in 5 group practices, and 712 male patients aged 50 to 75 years. The interventions comprised a Web-based educational program for all intervention physicians and MD-Ed+A patients compared with usual education (brochures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The primary outcome measure was patients' reported postvisit shared decision making regarding prostate cancer screening; secondary measures included unannounced standardized patients' reported shared decision making and the physician's recommendation for prostate cancer screening. RESULTS: Patients' ratings of shared decision making were moderate and did not differ between groups. MD-Ed+A patients reported that physicians had higher prostate cancer screening discussion rates (MD-Ed+A = 65%, MD-Ed = 41%, control=38%; P <.01). Standardized patients reported that physicians seeing MD-Ed+A patients were more neutral during prostate cancer screening recommendations (MD-Ed+A=50%, MD-Ed=33%, control=15%; P <.05). Of the male patients, 80% had had previous PSA tests. CONCLUSIONS: Although activating physicians and patients did not lead to significant changes in all aspects of physician attitudes and behaviors that we studied, interventions that involved physicians did have a large effect on their attitudes toward screening and in the discussions they had with patients, including their being more likely than control physicians to engage in prostate cancer screening discussions and more likely to be neutral in their final recommendations.",2013,10.1370/afm.1550,11,4,324-334,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and decision making and doctor-patient communication and patient-centered care and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and United States/epidemiology and *Physician-Patient Relations and patient activation and Early Detection of Cancer/*methods/psychology and Mass Screening/*methods/psychology and Patient Participation/*methods/psychology and Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*prevention & control/psychology and randomized controlled trial and medical uncertainty and Patient Navigation/*methods and patient-physician relationship and prostate and shared and standardized patient",NA,NA,2013/08//Jul undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lessard_2009_BMCfampra,JOUR,The role of economic evaluation in the decision-making process of family physicians: design and methods of a qualitative embedded multiple-case study,"Lessard, Chantale and Contandriopoulos, Andre-Pierre and Beaulieu, Marie-Dominique",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: A considerable amount of resource allocation decisions take place daily at the point of the clinical encounter; especially in primary care, where 80 percent of health problems are managed. Ignoring economic evaluation evidence in individual clinical decision-making may have a broad impact on the efficiency of health services. To date, almost all studies on the use of economic evaluation in decision-making used a quantitative approach, and few investigated decision-making at the clinical level. An important question is whether economic evaluations affect clinical practice. The project is an intervention research study designed to understand the role of economic evaluation in the decision-making process of family physicians (FPs). The contributions of the project will be from the perspective of Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theory. METHODS/DESIGN: A qualitative research strategy is proposed. We will conduct an embedded multiple-case study design. Ten case studies will be performed. The FPs will be the unit of analysis. The sampling strategies will be directed towards theoretical generalization. The 10 selected cases will be intended to reflect a diversity of FPs. There will be two embedded units of analysis: FPs (micro-level of analysis) and field of family medicine (macro-level of analysis). The division of the determinants of practice/behaviour into two groups, corresponding to the macro-structural level and the micro-individual level, is the basis for Bourdieu's mode of analysis. The sources of data collection for the micro-level analysis will be 10 life history interviews with FPs, documents and observational evidence. The sources of data collection for the macro-level analysis will be documents and 9 open-ended, focused interviews with key informants from medical associations and academic institutions. The analytic induction approach to data analysis will be used. A list of codes will be generated based on both the original framework and new themes introduced by the participants. We will conduct within-case and cross-case analyses of the data. DISCUSSION: The question of the role of economic evaluation in FPs' decision-making is of great interest to scientists, health care practitioners, managers and policy-makers, as well as to consultants, industry, and society. It is believed that the proposed research approach will make an original contribution to the development of knowledge, both empirical and theoretical.",2009,10.1186/1471-2296-10-15,10,NA,15,eng,1471-2296,"*Decision Making and Family Practice/*standards and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*economics and Resource Allocation",NA,NA,2009/02/11/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Frich_2010_BMCfampra,JOUR,General practitioners and tutors' experiences with peer group academic detailing: a qualitative study,"Frich, Jan C. and Hoye, Sigurd and Lindbaek, Morten and Straand, Jorund",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: The Prescription Peer Academic Detailing (Rx-PAD) project is an educational intervention study aiming at improving GPs' competence in pharmacotherapy. GPs in CME peer groups were randomised to receive a tailored intervention, either to support a safer prescription practice for elderly patients or to improve prescribing of antibiotics to patients with respiratory tract infections. The project was based on the principles of peer group academic detailing, incorporating individual feedback on GPs' prescription patterns. We did a study to explore GPs and tutors' experiences with peer group academic detailing, and to explore GPs' reasons for deviating from recommended prescribing practice. METHODS: Data was collected through nine focus group interviews with a total of 39 GPs and 20 tutors. Transcripts from the interviews were analyzed by two researchers according to a procedure for thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A shared understanding of the complex decision-making involved in prescribing in general practice was reported by both GPs and tutors as essential for an open discussion in the CME groups. Tutors experienced that CME groups differed regarding structure and atmosphere, and in some groups it was a challenge to run the scheme as planned. Individual feedback motivated GPs to reflect on and to improve their prescribing practice, though feedback reports could cause distress if the prescribing practice was unfavourable. Explanations for inappropriate prescriptions were lack of knowledge, factors associated with patients, the GP's background, the practice, and other health professionals or health care facilities. CONCLUSIONS: GPs and tutors experienced peer group academic detailing as a suitable method to discuss and learn more about pharmacotherapy. An important outcome for GPs was being more reflective about their prescriptions. Disclosure of inappropriate prescribing can cause distress in some doctors, and tutors must be prepared to recognise and manage such reactions.",2010,10.1186/1471-2296-11-12,11,NA,12,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Decision Making and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Attitude of Health Personnel and Drug Therapy/*standards and *Peer Group and Education, Medical, Continuing/*methods and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards and Physicians, Family/*education/psychology",NA,NA,2010/02/12/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is known about barriers for application. The objective of this study was to evaluate barriers impeding the application of cardiovascular prediction rules in primary prevention. METHODS: We performed a postal survey among general physicians in two Swiss Cantons by a purpose designed questionnaire. RESULTS: 356 of 772 dispatched questionnaires were returned (response rate 49.3%). About three quarters (74%) of general physicians rarely or never use cardiovascular prediction rules. Most often stated barriers to apply prediction rules among rarely- or never-users are doubts concerning over-simplification of risk assessment using these instruments (58%) and potential risk of (medical) over-treatment (54%). 57% report that the numerical information resulting from prediction rules is often not helpful for decision-making in practice.

METHODS: The study was based on a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (phase III) with continuing medical education (CME) groups of family physicians as the unit of randomization. In the intervention arm, 44 physicians (7 CME groups) consecutively recruited 550 patients in whom cholesterol levels were measured. Forty-seven physicians in the control arm (7 CME groups) similarly included 582 patients. Four hundred sixty patients (83.6%) of the intervention arm and 466 patients (80.1%) of the control arm were seen at follow-up. Physicians attended 2 interactive CME sessions and received a booklet, a paper-based risk calculator, and individual summary sheets for each patient. Control physicians attended 1 CME-session on an alternative topic. Main outcome measures were patient satisfaction and participation after the index consultation, change in CVD risk status, and decisional regret at 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: Intervention patients were significantly more satisfied with process and result (Patient Participation Scale, difference 0.80, P<.001). Decisional regret was significantly lower at follow-up (difference 3.39, P = .02). CVD risk decreased in both groups without a significant difference between study arms. CONCLUSION: A simple transactional decision aid based on calculating absolute individual CVD risk and promoting shared decision making in CVD prevention can be disseminated through CME groups and may lead to higher patient satisfaction and involvement and less decisional regret, without negatively affecting global CVD risk.",2008,10.1370/afm.854,6,3,218-227,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Health Behavior and Physicians, Family and Primary Health Care/*methods and *Decision Making and *Decision Support Techniques and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Patient Participation and Patient Education as Topic/methods and Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2008/06//May undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
van.der.Zande_2019_BMCfampra,JOUR,"General practitioners' accounts of negotiating antibiotic prescribing decisions with patients: a qualitative study on what influences antibiotic prescribing in low, medium and high prescribing practices","van der Zande, Marieke M. and Dembinsky, Melanie and Aresi, Giovanni and van Staa, Tjeerd P.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is high on the UK public health policy agenda, and poses challenges to patient safety and the provision of health services. Widespread prescribing of antibiotics is thought to increase AMR, and mostly takes place in primary medical care. However, prescribing rates vary substantially between general practices. The aim of this study was to understand contextual factors related to general practitioners' (GPs) antibiotic prescribing behaviour in low, high, and around the mean (medium) prescribing primary care practices. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 41 GPs working in North-West England. Participants were purposively sampled from practices with low, medium, and high antibiotic prescribing rates adjusted for the number and characteristics of patients registered in a practice. The interviews were analysed thematically. RESULTS: This study found that optimizing antibiotic prescribing creates tensions for GPs, particularly in doctor-patient communication during a consultation. GPs balanced patient expectations and their own decision-making in their communication. When not prescribing antibiotics, GPs reported the need for supportive mechanisms, such as regular practice meetings, within the practice, and in the wider healthcare system (e.g. longer consultation times). In low prescribing practices, GPs reported that increasing dialogue with colleagues, having consistent patterns of prescribing within the practice, supportive practice policies, and enough resources such as consultation time were important supports when not prescribing antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Insight into GPs' negotiations with patient and public health demands, and consistent and supportive practice-level policies can help support prudent antibiotic prescribing among primary care practices.",2019,10.1186/s12875-019-1065-x,20,1,172,eng,1471-2296,"Shared decision making and England and Humans and Female and Male and Qualitative research and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Primary health care and *Physician-Patient Relations and General Practitioners/*psychology and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Decision Making, Shared and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and *Negotiating and Antibiotic prescribing and Attitudes of health care personnel",NA,NA,2019/12/10/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lepiece_2014_BMCfampra,JOUR,General practice and ethnicity: an experimental study of doctoring,"Lepiece, Brice and Reynaert, Christine and van Meerbeeck, Philippe and Lorant, Vincent",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: There is extensive evidence of health inequality across ethnic groups. Inequity is a complex social phenomenon involving several underlying factors, including ethnic discrimination. In the field of health care, it has been established that ethnic discrimination stems partially from bias or prejudice on the part of doctors. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that patient ethnicity may affect doctors' social cognition, thus modifying their social interactions and decision-making processes. General practitioners (GPs) are the primary access point to health care for ethnic minority groups. In this study, we examine whether patient ethnicity affects the relational and decisional features of doctoring. METHODS: The sample was made up of 171 Belgian GPs, who were each randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions. One group were given a hypertension vignette case with a Belgian patient (non-minority patient), while the other group were given a hypertension vignette case with a Moroccan patient (minority patient). We evaluated the time devoted by GPs to examining medical history; time devoted by GPs to examining socio-relational history; cardiovascular risk assessments by GPs; electrocardiogram (ECG) recommendations by GPs, and drug prescriptions by GPs. RESULTS: We observed that for ethnic minority patients, GPs prescribed more drugs and devoted less time to examining socio-relational history. Neither cardiovascular risk assessments nor ECG recommendations were affected by patient ethnicity. GPs who were very busy devoted less time to examining medical history when dealing with minority patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that GPs discriminated against ethnic minority patients when it came to medical decisions. However, our study did identify a risk of drugs being used inappropriately in some ethnic-specific encounters. We also observed that, with ethnic minority patients, GPs engage less in the relational dimension of doctoring, particularly when working within a demanding environment. In general practice, the quality of the relationship between doctor and patient is an essential component of the effective management of chronic illness. Our research highlights the complexity of ethnic discrimination in general practice, and the need for further studies.",2014,10.1186/1471-2296-15-89,15,NA,89,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Prejudice and Belgium and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology and General Practice/*standards and Hypertension/*ethnology/*therapy and Morocco/ethnology",NA,NA,2014/05/09/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous work has produced evidence of such biases in medical students. OBJECTIVE: To identify contextual attributes in medical schools associated on average with low levels of racial/gender clinical decision-making biases. DESIGN: A mixed-method design using comparison case studies of 15 medical schools selected based on results of a previous survey of student decision-making bias: 7 schools whose students collectively had, and 8 schools whose students had not shown evidence of such biases. PARTICIPANTS: Purposively sampled faculty, staff, underrepresented minority medical students, and clinical-level medical students at each school. MAIN MEASURES: Quantitative descriptive data and qualitative interview and focus group data assessing 32 school attributes theorized in the literature to be associated with formation of decision-making and biases. We used a mixed-method analytic design with standard qualitative analysis and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. KEY RESULTS: Across the 15 schools, a total of 104 faculty, administrators and staff and 21 students participated in individual interviews, and 196 students participated in 29 focus groups. While no single attribute or group of attributes distinguished the two clusters of schools, analysis showed some contextual attributes were seen more commonly in schools whose students had not demonstrated biases: longitudinal reflective small group sessions; non-accusatory approach to training in diversity; longitudinal, integrated diversity curriculum; admissions priorities and action steps toward a diverse student body; and school service orientation to the community.

We examine a causal model linking PDM to improved clinical outcomes that included patient activation and medication adherence. METHODS: This observational study was conducted in 5 family physician offices. Diabetic patients were recruited by mail and by completing a study interest card at the conclusion of their office visit. Two survey questionnaires, administered 12 months apart, elicited patients' ratings of their physician's PDM style at baseline and their level of activation and medication adherence both at baseline and at follow-up. Measures of glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A(1c)), systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were abstracted from the medical record starting 12 months before the baseline survey to 12 months after the follow-up survey. A path analysis using a structural equation model was used to test hypotheses. RESULTS: We mailed questionnaires to 236 participants; 166 (70%) returned the baseline questionnaire, and 141 (80%) returned the follow-up questionnaire. Hemoglobin A(1c) levels, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol values all declined significantly, and patient activation and medication adherence improved. PDM at baseline was associated with patient activation at follow-up. Patient activation at follow-up was associated with medication adherence at follow-up, and medication adherence at follow-up was associated with change in hemoglobin A(1c) levels and LDL cholesterol values but not with systolic blood pressure.

Our objective was to describe the decision-making process underlying referral of patients to specialists by general practitioners working in a university outpatient primary care center. METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted among general practitioners (10 residents and 8 chief residents) working in the Center for Primary Care and Public Health (Unisante) of the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland. Focus group data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. A feedback group of general practitioners validated the results. RESULTS: Participating general practitioners distinguished two kinds of situations regarding referral: a) ""clear-cut situations"", in which the decision to refer or not seems obvious and b) ""complex cases"", in which they hesitate to refer or not. Regarding the ""complex cases"", they reported various types of concerns: a) about the treatment, b) about the patient and the doctor-patient relationship and c) about themselves. General practitioners evoked numerous reasons for referring, including non-medical factors such as influencing patients' emotions, earning specialists' esteem or sharing responsibility. They also explained that they seek validation by colleagues and postpone referral so as to relieve some of the decision-related distress. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners' referral of patients to specialists cannot be explained in biomedical terms only. It seems necessary to take into account the fact that referral is a sensitive topic for general practitioners, involving emotionally charged interactions and relationships with patients, colleagues, specialists and supervisors. The decision to refer or not is influenced by multiple contextual, personal and clinical factors that dynamically interact and shape the decision-making process.",2019,10.1186/s12875-019-1053-1,20,1,165,eng,1471-2296,Primary care and Humans and Decision Making and Qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and *Referral and Consultation and *Medicine and *General Practitioners/psychology and *Tertiary Healthcare and General practitioner and Referral process and Tertiary healthcare,NA,NA,2019/12/01/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Philpot_2019_BMCfampra,JOUR,"A survey of the attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about medical cannabis among primary care providers","Philpot, Lindsey M. and Ebbert, Jon O. and Hurt, Ryan T.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers play a critical role in facilitating patient access to medical cannabis. However, previous surveys suggest only a minority of providers believe that medical cannabis confers benefits to patients. Significant new knowledge about the potential benefits and harms of medical cannabis has recently emerged. Understanding current attitudes and beliefs of providers may provide insight into the ongoing challenges they face as states expand access to medical cannabis. METHODS: We conducted an electronic survey of primary care providers in a large Minnesota-based healthcare system between January 23 and February 5, 2018. We obtained information about provider characteristics, attitudes and beliefs about medical cannabis, provider comfort level in answering patient questions about medical cannabis, and whether providers were interested in receiving additional education. RESULTS: Sixty-two providers completed the survey (response rate 31%; 62/199). Seventy-six percent of respondents were physicians and the average age was 46.3 years. A majority of providers believed (""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"") that medical cannabis was a legitimate medical therapy (58.1%) and 38.7% believed that providers should be offering to patients for managing medical conditions. A majority (> 50%) of providers believed that medical cannabis was helpful for treating the qualifying medical conditions of cancer, terminal illness, and intractable pain. A majority of providers did not know if medical cannabis was effective for managing nearly one-half of the other state designated qualifying medical conditions. Few believed that medical cannabis improved quality of life domains. Over one-third of providers believed that medical cannabis interacted with medical therapies. One-half of providers were not ready to or did not want to answer patient questions about medical cannabis, and the majority of providers wanted to learn more about it. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers generally believe that medical cannabis is a legitimate medical therapy. Provider knowledge gaps about the effectiveness of medical cannabis for state designated qualifying conditions need to be addressed, and accurate information about the potential for drug interactions needs to be disseminated to address provider concerns. Clinical trial data about how medical cannabis improves patient quality of life domains is desperately needed as this information can impact clinical decision-making.",2019,10.1186/s12875-019-0906-y,20,1,17,eng,1471-2296,"Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Animals and Minnesota and Internal Medicine and Physicians, Family and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Competence and *Physicians, Primary Care and *Medical Marijuana and Cannabis and Health care surveys and Medical marijuana and Primary care physicians",NA,NA,2019/01/22/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study aimed to explore physician behaviors during an unannounced standardized patient encounter that was part of a randomized controlled trial to educate physicians using a prostate cancer screening, interactive, Web-based module. METHODS: Participants included 118 internal medicine and family medicine physicians from 5 health systems in California, in 2007-2008. Control physicians received usual education about prostate cancer screening (brochures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Intervention physicians participated in the prostate cancer screening module. Within 3 months, all physicians saw unannounced standardized patients who prompted prostate cancer screening discussions in clinic.

Authors analyzed physician behaviors around screening: (1) engagement after prompting, (2) degree of shared decision making, and (3) final recommendations for prostate cancer screening. RESULTS: After prompting, 90% of physicians discussed prostate cancer screening. In comparison with control physicians, intervention physicians showed somewhat more shared decision making behaviors (intervention 14 items vs control 11 items, P <.05), were more likely to mention no screening as an option (intervention 63% vs control 26%, P <.05), to encourage patients to consider different screening options (intervention 62% vs control 39%, P <.05) and seeking input from others (intervention 25% vs control 7%, P<.05).

Most benefits and harms may or may not occur, and can be minor or major when they do. Medical research, especially randomized controlled trials, provides estimates of chance of occurrence and magnitude of event. Because there is no universally accepted method for weighing harms against benefits, and because the ethical principle of autonomy mandates informed choice by patient, medical decision-making is inherently an individualized process. It follows that the practice of aiming for universal implementation of standardized guidelines is irrational and unethical. Irrational because the possibility of benefits is implicitly valued more than the possibility of comparable harms, and unethical because guidelines remove decision making from the patient and give it instead to a physician, committee or health care system.

In a previous project, a SDM programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction has been developed. It is aimed at supporting patients with type 2 diabetes to make informed choices on preventive options, to share the decision making process with the health care team, and to improve adherence to the chosen treatment. In this study, the programme will be implemented and evaluated in primary care practices. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised, controlled trial will be conducted to compare the SDM programme with standard care enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 306) from primary care practices (N = 24). The intervention programme comprises a six hours provider training, a patient decision aid including evidence-based information, a 90 minutes structured teaching session provided by medical assistants, a sheet to document the patients' individual treatment goals, and a structured consultation with the general practitioner for sharing information, setting treatment goals, and for adapting treatment regimens if necessary. Patients in the control group receive a brief extract of recommendations of the German National Disease Management Guideline on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome measure is adherence to blood pressure treatment and statin treatment at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures comprise informed choice and the achievement of patients' treatment goals. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods will be used to explore the implementation processes. DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, information on the efficacy of the SDM programme in the primary care context will be available. In addition, processes that might interfere with or that might promote a successful implementation will be identified.

Ohman and Crosson, Jesse C. and Miller, William L. and Crabtree, Benjamin F.",Annals of family medicine,"PURPOSE: The Using Learning Teams for Reflective Adaptation (ULTRA) study used facilitated reflective adaptive process (RAP) teams to enhance communication and decision making in hopes of improving adherence to multiple clinical guidelines; however, the study failed to show significant clinical improvements. The purpose of this study was to examine qualitative data from 25 intervention practices to understand how they engaged in a team-based collaborative change management strategy and the types of issues they addressed. METHODS: We analyzed field notes and interviews from a multimethod practice assessment, as well as field notes and audio-taped recordings from RAP meetings, using an iterative group process and an immersion-crystallization approach. RESULTS: Despite a history of not meeting regularly, 18 of 25 practices successfully convened improvement teams. There was evidence of improved practice-wide communication in 12 of these practices. At follow-up, 8 practices continued RAP meetings and found the process valuable in problem solving and decision making. Seven practices failed to engage in RAP primarily because of key leaders dominating the meeting agenda or staff members hesitating to speak up in meetings. Although the number of improvement targets varied considerably, most RAP teams targeted patient care-related issues or practice-level organizational improvement issues. Not a single practice focused on adherence to clinical care guidelines. CONCLUSION: Primary care practices can successfully engage in facilitated team meetings; however, leaders must be engaged in the process. Additional strategies are needed to engage practice leaders, particularly physicians, and to target issues related to guideline adherence.",2010,10.1370/afm.1159,8,5,425-432,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"Organizational Culture and United States and Problem Solving and Humans and Organizational Innovation and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Qualitative Research and Private Practice and Group Practice and Quality of Health Care/*organization & administration and Primary Health Care/*organization & administration and Health Services Research/*organization & administration and *Institutional Management Teams and Practice Management, Medical/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2010/10//Sep undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this paper is to describe the methodology of a study to analyse cognitive aspects of the process by which primary care (PC) physicians diagnose dyspnoea. It examines the possible links between the use of heuristics, suboptimal cognitive acts and diagnostic errors, using Reason's taxonomy of human error (slips, lapses, mistakes and violations). The influence of situational factors (professional experience, perceived overwork and fatigue) is also analysed. METHODS: Cohort study of new episodes of dyspnoea in patients receiving care from family physicians and residents at PC centres in Granada (Spain). With an initial expected diagnostic error rate of 20%, and a sampling error of 3%, 384 episodes of dyspnoea are calculated to be required. In addition to filling out the electronic medical record of the patients attended, each physician fills out 2 specially designed questionnaires about the diagnostic process performed in each case of dyspnoea. The first questionnaire includes questions on the physician's initial diagnostic impression, the 3 most likely diagnoses (in order of likelihood), and the diagnosis reached after the initial medical history and physical examination. It also includes items on the physicians' perceived overwork and fatigue during patient care. The second questionnaire records the confirmed diagnosis once it is reached. The complete diagnostic process is peer-reviewed to identify and classify the diagnostic errors. The possible use of heuristics of representativeness, availability, and anchoring and adjustment in each diagnostic process is also analysed. Each audit is reviewed with the physician responsible for the diagnostic process. Finally, logistic regression models are used to determine if there are differences in the diagnostic error variables based on the heuristics identified. DISCUSSION: This work sets out a new approach to studying the diagnostic decision-making process in PC, taking advantage of new technologies which allow immediate recording of the decision-making process.",2014,10.1186/1471-2296-15-92,15,NA,92,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Health Services Research and Surveys and Questionnaires and Prospective Studies and Research Design and Spain and Diagnosis, Differential and *Primary Health Care and Diagnostic Errors/*statistics & numerical data and Dyspnea/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2014/05/12/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Barstow_2018_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,Evaluating Medical Decision-Making Capacity in Practice,"Barstow, Craig and Shahan, Brian and Roberts, Melissa",American family physician,"Medical decision-making capacity is the ability of a patient to understand the benefits and risks of, and the alternatives to, a proposed treatment or intervention (including no treatment). Capacity is the basis of informed consent. Patients have medical decision-making capacity if they can demonstrate understanding of the situation, appreciation of the consequences of their decision, and reasoning in their thought process, and if they can communicate their wishes. Capacity is assessed intuitively at every medical encounter and is usually readily apparent. However, a more formal capacity evaluation should be considered if there is reason to question a patient's decision-making abilities. Such reasons include an acute change in mental status, refusal of a clearly beneficial recommended treatment, risk factors for impaired decision making, or readily agreeing to an invasive or risky procedure without adequately considering the risks and benefits. Any physician can evaluate capacity, and a structured approach is best. Several formal assessment tools are available to help with the capacity evaluation. Consultation with a psychiatrist may be helpful in some cases, but the final determination on capacity is made by the treating physician. If a patient is found not to have capacity, a surrogate decision maker should be identified and consulted. If the patient is unable to give consent and identifying a surrogate decision maker will result in a delay that might increase the risk of death or serious harm, physicians can provide emergency care without formal consent.",2018,NA,98,1,40-46,eng,1532-0650 0002-838X,"Humans and *Patient Participation and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Guidelines as Topic and Informed Consent/*standards and *Education, Medical, Continuing",NA,NA,2018/07/01/,Am Fam Physician,NA,NA,NA,NA
Frank_2019_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Clerkship Grading Committees: the Impact of Group Decision-Making for Clerkship Grading,"Frank, Annabel K. and O'Sullivan, Patricia and Mills, Lynnea M. and Muller-Juge, Virginie and Hauer, Karen E.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Faculty and students debate the fairness and accuracy of medical student clerkship grades. Group decision-making is a potential strategy to improve grading. OBJECTIVE: To explore how one school's grading committee members integrate assessment data to inform grade decisions and to identify the committees' benefits and challenges. DESIGN: This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with grading committee chairs and members conducted between November 2017 and March 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included the eight core clerkship directors, who chaired their grading committees. We randomly selected other committee members to invite, for a maximum of three interviews per clerkship. APPROACH: Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. KEY RESULTS: We interviewed 17 committee members. Within and across specialties, committee members had distinct approaches to prioritizing and synthesizing assessment data. Participants expressed concerns about the quality of assessments, necessitating careful scrutiny of language, assessor identity, and other contextual factors. Committee members were concerned about how unconscious bias might impact assessors, but they felt minimally impacted at the committee level. When committee members knew students personally, they felt tension about how to use the information appropriately. Participants described high agreement within their committees; debate was more common when site directors reviewed students' files from other sites prior to meeting. Participants reported multiple committee benefits including faculty development and fulfillment, as well as improved grading consistency, fairness, and transparency. Groupthink and a passive approach to bias emerged as the two main threats to optimal group decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Grading committee members view their practices as advantageous over individual grading, but they feel limited in their ability to address grading fairness and accuracy. Recommendations and support may help committees broaden their scope to address these aspirations.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-04879-x,34,5,669-676,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Decision Making and Educational Measurement/*methods and Qualitative Research and evaluation and Students, Medical and group decision-making and Education, Medical/*organization & administration and clerkship grading and clinical competence and Faculty, Medical/*organization & administration and grading committees and medical education-qualitative methods and medical education-undergraduate",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dwairy_2011_BMCfampra,JOUR,The application of foraging theory to the information searching behaviour of general practitioners,"Dwairy, Mai and Dowell, Anthony C. and Stahl, Jean-Claude",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: General Practitioners (GPs) employ strategies to identify and retrieve medical evidence for clinical decision making which take workload and time constraints into account. Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) initially developed to study animal foraging for food is used to explore the information searching behaviour of General Practitioners. This study is the first to apply foraging theory within this context.Study objectives were: 1. To identify the sequence and steps deployed in identifiying and retrieving evidence for clinical decision making. 2. To utilise Optimal Foraging Theory to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of General Practitioner information searching. METHODS: GPs from the Wellington region of New Zealand were asked to document in a pre-formatted logbook the steps and outcomes of an information search linked to their clinical decision making, and fill in a questionnaire about their personal, practice and information-searching backgrounds. RESULTS: A total of 115/155 eligible GPs returned a background questionnaire, and 71 completed their information search logbook. GPs spent an average of 17.7 minutes addressing their search for clinical information. Their preferred information sources were discussions with colleagues (38% of sources) and books (22%). These were the two most profitable information foraging sources (15.9 min and 9.5 min search time per answer, compared to 34.3 minutes in databases). GPs nearly always accessed another source when unsuccessful (95% after 1st source), and frequently when successful (43% after 2nd source). Use of multiple sources accounted for 41% of searches, and increased search success from 70% to 89%. CONCLUSIONS: By consulting in foraging terms the most 'profitable' sources of information (colleagues, books), rapidly switching sources when unsuccessful, and frequently double checking, GPs achieve an efficient trade-off between maximizing search success and information reliability, and minimizing searching time. As predicted by foraging theory, GPs trade time-consuming evidence-based (electronic) information sources for sources with a higher information reward per unit time searched. Evidence-based practice must accommodate these 'real world' foraging pressures, and Internet resources should evolve to deliver information as effectively as traditional methods of information gathering.",2011,10.1186/1471-2296-12-90,12,NA,90,eng,1471-2296,Humans and Psychological Theory and *Information Seeking Behavior and General Practitioners/*psychology,NA,NA,2011/08/23/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is known about primary care physicians' use of pre-screening discussions to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening. The aim of this study is to explore physicians' use of pre-screening discussions and reasons why physicians would or would not try to persuade patients to be screened if they initially refuse testing. METHODS: Primary care physicians completed a self-administered survey about prostate cancer screening practices for informed decision making. RESULTS: Sixty-six physicians (75.9%) completed the survey, and 63 were used in the analysis. Thirteen physicians (20.6%) reported not using prescreening discussions, 45 (71.4%) reported the use of prescreening discussions, and 3 (4.8%) reported neither ordering the PSA test nor discussing it with patients. Sixty-nine percent of physicians who reported not having discussions indicated they were more likely to screen African American patients for prostate cancer, compared to 50% of physicians who reported the use of discussions (Chi-square(1) = 1.62, p = .20). Similarly, 91% of physicians who reported not having discussions indicated they are more likely to screen patients with a family history of prostate cancer, compared to 46% of those who reported the use of discussion (Chi-square(1) = 13.27, p < .001). Beliefs about the scientific evidence and efficacy of screening, ethical concerns regarding patient autonomy, and concerns about time constraints differed between physicians who would and would not try to persuade a patient to be tested. CONCLUSION: Although guidelines recommend discussing the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening, physicians report varying practice styles. Future research needs to consider the nature of discussions and the degree to which informed decision making is being achieved in clinical practice.",2009,10.1186/1471-2296-10-19,10,NA,19,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Patient Participation and Surveys and Questionnaires and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Health Care Surveys and Mass Screening and Attitude of Health Personnel and Guideline Adherence and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood and Physicians, Family/*statistics & numerical data and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/ethnology",NA,NA,2009/03/18/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aarseth_2017_BMCfampra,JOUR,'Working is out of the question': a qualitative text analysis of medical certificates of disability,"Aarseth, Guri and Natvig, Bard and Engebretsen, Eivind and Lie, Anne Kveim",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Medical certificates influence the distribution of economic benefits in welfare states; however, the qualitative aspects of these texts remain largely unexplored. The present study is the first systematic investigation done of these texts. Our aim was to investigate how GPs select and mediate information about their patients' health and how they support their conclusions about illness, functioning and fitness for work in medical certificates. METHODS: We performed a textual analysis of thirty-three medical certificates produced by general practitioners (GP) in Norway at the request of the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV).The certificates were subjected to critical reading using the combined analytic methods of narratology and linguistics. RESULTS: Some of the medical information was unclear, ambiguous, and possibly misleading. Evaluations of functioning related to illness were scarce or absent, regardless of diagnosis, and, hence, the basis of working incapacity was unclear. Voices in the text frequently conflated, obscuring the source of speaker. In some documents, the expert's subtle use of language implied doubts about the claimant's credibility, but explicit advocacy also occurred. GPs show little insight into their patients' working lives, but rather than express uncertainty and incompetence, they may resort to making too absolute and too general statements about patients' working capacity, and fail to report thorough assessments. CONCLUSIONS: A number of the texts in our material may not function as sufficient or reliable sources for making decisions regarding social benefits. Certificates as these may be deficient for several reasons, and textual incompetence may be one of them. Physicians in Norway receive no systematic training in professional writing. High-quality medical certificates, we believe, might be economical in the long term: it might increase the efficiency with which NAV processes cases and save costs by eliminating the need for unnecessary and expensive specialist reports. Moreover, correct and coherent medical certificates can strengthen legal protection for claimants. Eventually, reducing advocacy in these documents may contribute to a fairer evaluation of whether claimants are eligible for disability benefits or not. Therefore, we believe that professional writing skills should be validated as an important part of medical practice and should be integrated in medical schools and in further education as a discipline in its own right, preferably involving humanities professors.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0627-z,18,1,55,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Decision Making and Databases, Factual and GP and Norway and General Practitioners and Quality Control and Return to Work/*statistics & numerical data and *Disability Evaluation and *Work Capacity Evaluation and Disabled Persons/statistics & numerical data and Document analysis and Family Practice/*methods and Insurance, Disability/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Medical certificates of incapacity for work and Sick Leave/economics/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2017/04/20/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

The older biomedical model views SDM as affecting which therapy is chosen, but not the nature or likelihood of any health outcomes produced by the therapy. Research indicates, however, that both the content and manner in which information is shared with the patient, and the patient's experience of being involved in the decision, can directly alter therapeutic outcomes via placebo responses. An ethical tension is thereby created between SDM aimed strictly and solely at conveying accurate information, and ""outcome engineering"" in which SDM is adapted toward therapeutic goals. Several practical strategies mitigate this tension and promote respect for autonomous decision-making while still utilizing the therapeutic potential of SDM.",2012,10.1007/s11606-011-1977-1,27,6,739-742,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Models, Theoretical and Patient Participation and Treatment Outcome and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and *Placebo Effect and Evidence-Based Medicine/methods",NA,NA,2012/06//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schuling_2012_BMCfampra,JOUR,Deprescribing medication in very elderly patients with multimorbidity: the view of Dutch GPs. A qualitative study,"Schuling, Jan and Gebben, Henkjan and Veehof, Leonardus Johannes Gerardus and Haaijer-Ruskamp, Flora Marcia",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with multimorbidity who are treated according to guidelines use a large number of drugs. This number of drugs increases the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). Stopping medication may relieve these effects, and thereby improve the patient's wellbeing. To facilitate management of polypharmacy expert-driven instruments have been developed, sofar with little effect on the patient's quality of life. Recently, much attention has been paid to shared decision-making in general practice, mainly focusing on patient preferences. This study explores how experienced GPs feel about deprescribing medication in older patients with multimorbidity and to what extent they involve patients in these decisions. METHODS: Focusgroups of GPs were used to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and categorizing the GP's view on the subject. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and studied by the first and second author. They selected independently relevant textfragments. In a next step they labeled these fragments and sorted them. From these labelled and sorted fragments central themes were extracted. RESULTS: GPs discern symptomatic medication and preventive medication; deprescribing the latter category is seen as more difficult by the GPs due to lack of benefit/risk information for these patients.Factors influencing GPs'deprescribing were beliefs concerning patients (patients have no problem with polypharmacy; patients may interpret a proposal to stop preventive medication as a sign of having been given up on; and confronting the patient with a discussion of life expectancy vs quality of life is 'not done'), guidelines for treatment (GPs feel compelled to prescribe by the present guidelines) and organization of healthcare (collaboration with prescribing medical specialists and dispensing pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: The GPs' beliefs concerning elderly patients are a barrier to explore patient preferences when reviewing preventive medication. GPs would welcome decision support when dealing with several guidelines for one patient. Explicit rules for collaborating with medical specialists in this field are required.

OBJECTIVES: To better understand the challenges of decision-making from the surrogate's perspective. DESIGN: Semistructured telephone interview study of the experience of surrogate decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty designated surrogates with previous decision-making experience. APPROACH: We asked surrogates to describe and reflect on their experience of making medical decisions for others. After coding transcripts, we conducted a content analysis to identify and categorize factors that made decision-making more or less difficult for surrogates. RESULTS: Surrogates identified four types of factors: (1) surrogate characteristics and life circumstances (such as coping strategies and competing responsibilities), (2) surrogates' social networks (such as intrafamily discord about the ""right"" decision), (3) surrogate-patient relationships and communication (such as difficulties with honoring known preferences), and (4) surrogate-clinician communication and relationship (such as interacting with a single physician whom the surrogate recognizes as the clinical spokesperson vs. many clinicians). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide insights into the challenges that surrogates encounter when making decisions for loved ones and indicate areas where clinicians could intervene to facilitate the process of surrogate decision-making.

H. M.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: No more than 10-15% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients achieve all treatment goals regarding glycaemic control, lipids and blood pressure. Shared decision making (SDM) should increase that percentage; however, not all support decision tools are appropriate. Because the ADDITION-Europe study demonstrated two (almost) equally effective treatments but with slightly different intensities, it may be a good starting point to discuss with the patients their diabetes treatment, taking into account both the intensity of treatment, clinical factors and patients' preferences. We aim to evaluate whether such an approach increases the proportion of patients that achieve all three treatment goals. METHODS: In a cluster-randomised trial including 40 general practices, that participated until 2009 in the ADDITION Study, 150 T2DM patients 60-80 years, known with T2DM for 8-15 years, will be included. Practices are randomised a second time, i.e. intervention practices in the ADDITION study could be control practices in the current study and vice versa. For the GPs from the intervention group a 2-hour training in SDM was developed as well as a decision support tool to be used during the consultation. GPs plan the first visit with the patients to decide on the intensity of the treatment, personalised targets and the priorities of treatment. The control group will continue with the treatment they were allocated to in the ADDITION study. FOLLOW-UP: 24 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve all three treatment goals. Secondary outcomes are the proportion of patients who achieve five treatment goals (HbA1c, blood pressure, total cholesterol, body weight, not smoking), evaluation of the SDM process (SDM-Q9 and CPS), satisfaction with the treatment (DTSQ), wellbeing and quality of life (W-BQ12, ADD QoL-19), health status (SF-36, EQ-5D) and coping (DCMQ). The proportions of achieved treatment goals will be compared between both groups. For the secondary outcomes mixed models will be used. The Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht has approved the study protocol (Protocol number: 11-153). DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence whether an intervention with a multi-faceted decision support tool increases the proportion of achieved personalised goals in type 2 diabetes patients.

It is necessary to understand the origins of such biases before interventions can be developed to eliminate them. As a first step toward this understanding, we tested for the presence of bias in senior medical students. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine whether bias based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status influenced clinical decision-making among medical students. DESIGN: We surveyed seniors at 84 medical schools, who were required to choose between two clinically equivalent management options for a set of cardiac patient vignettes. We examined variations in student recommendations based on patient race, gender, and socioeconomic status. PARTICIPANTS: The study included senior medical students. MAIN MEASURES: We investigated the percentage of students selecting cardiac procedural options for vignette patients, analyzed by patient race, gender, and socioeconomic status. KEY RESULTS: Among 4,603 returned surveys, we found no evidence in the overall sample supporting racial or gender bias in student clinical decision-making. Students were slightly more likely to recommend cardiac procedural options for black (43.9 %) vs. white (42 %, p = .03) patients; there was no difference by patient gender. Patient socioeconomic status was the strongest predictor of student recommendations, with patients described as having the highest socioeconomic status most likely to receive procedural care recommendations (50.3 % vs. 43.2 % for those in the lowest socioeconomic status group, p < .001). Analysis by subgroup, however, showed significant regional geographic variation in the influence of patient race and gender on decision-making. Multilevel analysis showed that white female patients were least likely to receive procedural recommendations.

The quantitative part consisted of a rating of pre-defined statements in these areas. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 87 older, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy, to whom their GP offered a drug change, did not pursue all offers. Nineteen of these 22 were interviewed by telephone. The 19 patients were on average 76.9 (SD 10.0) years old, 74% female, and took 8.9 (SD 2.6) drugs per day. Drugs for acid-related disorders, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs were the three most common drug groups where patient involvement and the shared-decision-making (SDM) process led to the joint decision to not pursue the GPs offer. Eighteen of 19 patients fully trusted their GP, 17 of 19 participated in SDM even before this study and 8 of 19 perceived polypharmacy as a substantial burden. Conservatism/inertia and fragmented medical care were the main barriers towards deprescribing. No patient felt devalued as a consequence of the deprescribing offer. Our exploratory findings were supported by patients' ratings of predefined statements. CONCLUSION: We identified patient involvement in deprescribing and coordination of care as key issues for deprescribing among older multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. GPs concerns regarding patients' devaluation should not prevent them from actively discussing the reduction of drugs.

Perneger_2008_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Patient assessments of the most important medical decision during a hospitalization,"Perneger, Thomas V. and Charvet-Berard, Agathe and Perrier, Arnaud",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: How medical decisions are made in real-life situations is largely unexplored. We explored patients' perceptions of decision-making during a hospitalization and examined the conformity of the decision process with expert recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To describe the conformity of the decision-making process with current expert opinion and examine the associations between various aspects of the decision-making process and a global assessment of the decision. METHODS: Mail survey of patients discharged from a teaching hospital in Geneva, Switzerland. Patients identified the main medical decision during their stay, and rated the decision process (11-item ""decision process score"") and their satisfaction with the decision (five-item ""decision satisfaction score""). Both scores were scaled between 0 (worst) and 100 (best). PARTICIPANTS: The survey had 1467 respondents. MAIN RESULTS: In total 862 (58.8%) of 1467 respondents reported having made a medical decision while in the hospital. The decision process score (mean 78.5, SD 21.5) and the decision satisfaction score (mean 86.5, SD 20.4) were moderately correlated (r = 0.62). Men, healthier patients, patients discharged from the department of surgery, and those who reported sharing the decision with their doctor gave the highest ratings on both scales. Five process variables were independently associated with high satisfaction with the decision: the doctor explained all possible treatments and examinations, the patient was aware of risks at the time of the decision, the doctor's explanations were easy to understand, the patient was involved in the decision as much as desired or more, and the patient was not pressured into the decision. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients discharged from a general hospital were able to identify and rate a medical decision. Recommended features of the process of medical decision-making were associated with greater satisfaction with the decision.",2008,10.1007/s11606-008-0736-4,23,10,1659-1665,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Aged, 80 and over and *Decision Making and *Patient Satisfaction and Patient Participation/*methods and *Hospitalization/trends",NA,NA,2008/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of three different machine learning algorithms for identifying subgroups of high-cost patients. DESIGN: We applied three different clustering algorithms-connectivity-based clustering using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, centroid-based clustering with the k-medoids algorithm, and density-based clustering with the OPTICS algorithm-to a clinical and administrative dataset. We then examined the extent to which each algorithm identified subgroups of patients that were (1) clinically distinct and (2) associated with meaningful differences in relevant utilization metrics. PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in a national Medicare Advantage plan, categorized in the top decile of spending (n = 6154). MAIN MEASURES: Post hoc discriminative models comparing the importance of variables for distinguishing observations in one cluster from the rest. Variance in utilization and spending measures. KEY RESULTS: Connectivity-based, centroid-based, and density-based clustering identified eight, five, and ten subgroups of high-cost patients, respectively. Post hoc discriminative models indicated that density-based clustering subgroups were the most clinically distinct. The variance of utilization and spending measures was the greatest among the subgroups identified through density-based clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can be used to segment a high-cost patient population into subgroups of patients that are clinically distinct and associated with meaningful differences in utilization and spending measures. For these purposes, density-based clustering with the OPTICS algorithm outperformed connectivity-based and centroid-based clustering algorithms.",2019,10.1007/s11606-018-4760-8,34,2,211-217,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and *Algorithms and Cluster Analysis and United States/epidemiology and *Health Care Costs/trends and high-cost patients and Machine Learning/*economics/trends and Medicare Part C/*economics/trends and patient segmentation",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a lack of studies on medical errors in primary care settings. The aim of the study is to determine the extent of diagnostic inaccuracies and management errors in public funded primary care clinics. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in twelve public funded primary care clinics in Malaysia. A total of 1753 medical records were randomly selected in 12 primary care clinics in 2007 and were reviewed by trained family physicians for diagnostic, management and documentation errors, potential errors causing serious harm and likelihood of preventability of such errors. RESULTS: The majority of patient encounters (81%) were with medical assistants. Diagnostic errors were present in 3.6% (95% CI: 2.2, 5.0) of medical records and management errors in 53.2% (95% CI: 46.3, 60.2). For management errors, medication errors were present in 41.1% (95% CI: 35.8, 46.4) of records, investigation errors in 21.7% (95% CI: 16.5, 26.8) and decision making errors in 14.5% (95% CI: 10.8, 18.2). A total of 39.9% (95% CI: 33.1, 46.7) of these errors had the potential to cause serious harm.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a brief intervention for facilitating shared decision making skills in clinicians and student clinicians. DESIGN: Multi-centre randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seven medical students, physiotherapy or occupational therapy students undertaking a compulsory course in evidence-based practice as part of their undergraduate or postgraduate degree from two Australian universities. INTERVENTION: The 1-h small-group intervention consisted of facilitated critique of five-step framework, strategies, and pre-recorded modelled role-play. Both groups were provided with a chapter about shared decision making skills. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was skills in shared decision making and communicating evidence [Observing Patient Involvement (OPTION) scale, items from the Assessing Communication about Evidence and Patient Preferences (ACEPP) Tool], rated by a blinded assessor from videorecorded role-plays. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: confidence in these skills and attitudes towards patient-centred communication (Patient Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS)). KEY RESULTS: Of participants, 95 % (102) completed the primary outcome measures. Two weeks post-intervention, intervention group participants scored significantly higher on the OPTION scale (adjusted group difference = 18.9, 95 % CI 12.4 to 25.4), ACEPP items (difference = 0.9, 95 % CI 0.5 to 1.3), confidence measure (difference = 13.1, 95 % CI 8.5 to 17.7), and the PPOS sharing subscale (difference = 0.2, 95 % CI 0.1 to 0.5). There was no significant difference for the PPOS caring subscale. CONCLUSIONS: This brief intervention was effective in improving student clinicians' ability, attitude towards, and confidence in shared decision making facilitation.

E.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain from the five most common presentations to primary care (back, neck, shoulder, knee or multi-site pain), where the majority of patients are managed, is a costly global health challenge. At present, first-line decision-making is based on clinical reasoning and stratified models of care have only been tested in patients with low back pain. We therefore, examined the feasibility of; a) a future definitive cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), and b) General Practitioners (GPs) providing stratified care at the point-of-consultation for these five most common MSK pain presentations. METHODS: The design was a pragmatic pilot, two parallel-arm (stratified versus non-stratified care), cluster RCT and the setting was 8 UK GP practices (4 intervention, 4 control) with randomisation (stratified by practice size) and blinding of trial statistician and outcome data-collectors. Participants were adult consulters with MSK pain without indicators of serious pathologies, urgent medical needs, or vulnerabilities. Potential participant records were tagged and individuals sent postal invitations using a GP point-of-consultation electronic medical record (EMR) template. The intervention was supported by the EMR template housing the Keele STarT MSK Tool (to stratify into low, medium and high-risk prognostic subgroups of persistent pain and disability) and recommended matched treatment options. Feasibility outcomes included exploration of recruitment and follow-up rates, selection bias, and GP intervention fidelity. To capture recommended outcomes including pain and function, participants completed an initial questionnaire, brief monthly questionnaire (postal or SMS), and 6-month follow-up questionnaire. An anonymised EMR audit described GP decision-making. RESULTS: GPs screened 3063 patients (intervention = 1591, control = 1472), completed the EMR template with 1237 eligible patients (intervention = 513, control = 724) and 524 participants (42%) consented to data collection (intervention = 231, control = 293). Recruitment took 28 weeks (target 12 weeks) with > 90% follow-up retention (target > 75%). We detected no selection bias of concern and no harms identified. GP stratification tool fidelity failed to achieve a-priori success criteria, whilst fidelity to the matched treatments achieved ""complete success"". CONCLUSIONS: A future definitive cluster RCT of stratified care for MSK pain is feasible and is underway, following key amendments including a clinician-completed version of the stratification tool and refinements to recommended matched treatments.

Nejasmic_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,"Awareness, attitudes, barriers, and knowledge about evidence-based medicine among family physicians in Croatia: a cross-sectional study","Nejasmic, Danijel and Vrdoljak, Davorka and Bralic Lang, Valerija and Borovac, Josip Andelo and Marusic, Ana",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) aims to assist physicians in making medical decisions based on the integration of the current best evidence, clinical expertise, and patients' values. Extensive research has been conducted regarding physicians' awareness, attitudes, barriers, and knowledge about EBM. In Croatia, there is a lack of research on this topic, especially among family physicians (FP). The aim of this study was to assess the awareness, attitudes, barriers, and knowledge about EBM among FPs in Croatia after six years of educational activities organized and provided by Cochrane Croatia. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, conducted in 2016, we offered to FPs in Croatia a printed or online validated questionnaire to assess attitudes toward and barriers when considering the use of EBM, awareness about sources of evidence, and their level of understanding of evidence-based medicine terminology. The physicians were approached during mandatory continuing medical education courses and through their professional associations. We compared results from two groups of physicians, one with family medicine specialization and the other without. RESULTS: 295 (14%) of all officially registered FPs responded to the questionnaire. Respondents were very positive toward the promotion and usage of EBM. 160 (67%) indicated that they did not have access to the Cochrane Library. The majority reported lack of time available for finding evidence (80%), and patients' unrealistic expectations that influence doctors' choice of treatment (72%). Between the two groups of physicians, more family medicine specialists reported time restrictions for finding evidence. The highest level of EBM terminology understanding was reported for study design terms, and the lowest for statistical terms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that FPs in Croatia had very positive attitudes toward the use of EBM, they agreed that EBM improves patient care, and they estimated that more than two thirds of their practice is EBM-based. Compared to the results of the first assessment of physicians in 2010, there was some increase in the level of EBM awareness among FPs. However, to further increase the quality of EBM practice in Croatia better access to EBM sources and further educational activities are needed.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01162-5,21,1,88,eng,1471-2296,"Education and Evidence-based medicine and Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Quality of health care and Surveys and Questionnaires and Needs Assessment and Educational Measurement and Attitude of Health Personnel and Croatia and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Family physicians and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Awareness and Physicians, Family/*statistics & numerical data and *Education, Medical, Continuing/organization & administration/standards and *Evidence-Based Medicine/education/standards and *Family Practice/education/methods/standards",NA,NA,2020/05/16/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Scherz_2017_BMCfampra,JOUR,Internists' career choice towards primary care: a cross-sectional survey,"Scherz, Nathalie and Markun, Stefan and Aemissegger, Vera and Rosemann, Thomas and Tandjung, Ryan",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Swiss primary care (PC) is facing workforce shortage. Up to 2011 this workforce was supplied by two board certifications: general medicine and internal medicine. To strengthen them against subspecialties, they were unified into one: general internal medicine. However, since unification general practitioners' career options are no longer restrained by early commitment to PC. This may lead to a decrease of future primary care physicians (PCPs). METHODS: To gain insights in timing and factors influencing career choice of internists, we addressed a cross sectional survey to all board certified internists in the years 2000-2010 (n = 1462). Main measures were: final career choice (PCPs, hospital internists or subspecialists), timing and factors influencing career choice, and attractiveness of PCP career during medical school and residency. RESULTS: Response rate was 53.2%, 44.8% were female and median age was 45 years old. Final career choice was PCP for 39.1% of participants, 15.0% chose to become hospital internists, 41.8% became subspecialists and 4.0% other. Timing of career choice significantly differed between groups. Most of the subspecialists have chosen their career during residency (65.3%), while only 21.9% of the PCPs chose during residency. Work experience in an academic hospital was negatively associated with becoming PCP (P < 0.001). Family influence on career choice was more frequently reported among PCPs and chiefs' influence more reported among non-PCPs (P < 0.001). Fifty-nine percent of the participants considered a career as PCP to be attractive during medical school, this proportion decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of career choice of PCPs and subspecialists strongly differed. PCPs opted late for their career and potentially modifiable external factors seem to contribute to their decision. This stresses the importance of fostering attractiveness of PC during medical school as well as during and after residency and of tailored residency positions for future PCPs in the hospital-dominated new general internal medicine training.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0624-2,18,1,52,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Risk Assessment and Decision Making and Forecasting and Sex Factors and Age Factors and Switzerland and *Surveys and Questionnaires and *Primary Health Care and *Career Choice and Internal Medicine/*education and Medical education and career choice, Primary care, Survey research, Workforce and Health Workforce/*trends",NA,NA,2017/04/05/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Burrows_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,A quantitative assessment of the parameters of the role of receptionists in modern primary care using the work design framework,"Burrows, Michael and Gale, Nicola and Greenfield, Sheila and Litchfield, Ian",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Amidst increased pressures on General Practice across England, the receptionist continues to fulfil key administrative and clinically related tasks. The need for more robust support for these key personnel to ensure they stay focussed and motivated is apparent, however, to be effective a more systematic understanding of the parameters of their work is required. Here we present a valuable insight into the tasks they fulfil, their relationship with colleagues and their organisation and their attitudes and behaviour at work collectively defined as their 'work design'. METHODS: Our aim was to quantitatively assess the various characteristics of receptionists in primary care in England using the validated Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) a 21 point validated questionnaire, divided into four categories: task, knowledge and social characteristics and work context with a series of sub-categories within each, disseminated online and as a postal questionnaire to 100 practices nationally. RESULTS: Seventy participants completed the WDQ, 54 online and 16 using the postal questionnaire with the response rate for the latter being 3.1%. The WDQ suggested receptionists experience high levels of task variety, task significance and of information processing and knowledge demands, confirming the high cognitive load placed on receptionists by performing numerous yet significant tasks. Perhaps in relation to these substantial responsibilities a reliance on colleagues for support and feedback to help negotiate this workload was reported. CONCLUSION: The evidence of our survey suggests that the role of modern GP receptionists requires an array of skills to accommodate various administrative, communicative, problem solving, and decision-making duties. There are ways in which the role might be better supported for example devising ways to separate complex tasks to avoid the errors involved with high cognitive load, providing informal feedback, and perhaps most importantly developing training programmes.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01204-y,21,1,138,eng,1471-2296,Primary care and England and Humans and Social Responsibility and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Needs Assessment and Quantitative research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Task Performance and Analysis and Professional Role and *Surveys and Questionnaires and *Interpersonal Relations and *Job Description and *General Practice/organization & administration/trends and *Medical Receptionists/psychology/standards and *Primary Health Care/methods/standards and *Social Skills and Health service delivery and Work Performance/*standards and Workload/psychology/standards,NA,NA,2020/07/10/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Freier_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,Prescribing and medical non-adherence after myocardial infarction: qualitative interviews with general practitioners in Germany,"Freier, Christian and Heintze, Christoph and Herrmann, Wolfram J.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: An increasing prevalence of having survived a myocardial infarction increases the importance of medical secondary prevention. Although preventive medication reduces mortality, prescribing and adherence are known to be frequently insufficient. General practitioners are the most important prescriber. However, their perspective on prescribing and medical non-adherence following myocardial infarction has not yet been explored. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the general practitioners' perspective on long-term care after myocardial infarction focussing on medical prevention. METHODS: In this qualitative interview study we conducted episodic interviews with sixteen general practitioners from rural and urban surgeries in Germany. Framework analysis with focus on general practitioners' prescribing and patients' non-adherence was performed. RESULTS: Almost all general practitioners reported following guidelines for myocardial infarction aftercare and prescribing the medication that was initiated in the hospital; however, they described deviating from guidelines because of drugs' side effects or patients' intolerances. Some questioned the benefits of medical secondary prevention for the oldest of patients. General practitioners perceived good adherence among their patients who had had an MI while they regarded their methods for assessing medical non-adherence as limited. They perceived diverse reasons for non-adherence, particularly side effects, patients' freedom from symptoms and patients' indifference to health. They attributed mainly negative characteristics, like lack of knowledge and understanding, to non-adherent patients. These characteristics contribute to the difficulty of convincing these patients to take medications as prescribed. General practitioners improved adherence by preventing side effects, explaining the medication's necessity, facilitating intake and involving patients in decision-making. However, about half of the general practitioners reported threatening their patients with negative consequences of non-adherence. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners should be aware that discharge medication can be insufficient and thus, should always check hospital recommendations for accordance with guideline recommendations. Improving physicians' communication skills and informing and motivating patients in an adequate manner, for example in simple language, should be an important goal in the hospital and the general practitioner setting. General practitioners should assess patients' motivations through motivational interviewing, which no general practitioner mentioned during the interviews, and talk with them about adherence and long-term treatment goals regularly.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01145-6,21,1,81,eng,1471-2296,"Interviews and General practice and Primary care and Myocardial infarction and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Prescribing and Qualitative research and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Germany and Secondary Prevention and Motivational Interviewing and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *General Practitioners and Aftercare and Medication adherence and *Patient Compliance/psychology and Family practice and Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/prevention & control and Secondary prevention",NA,NA,2020/05/08/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to evaluate an intervention to improve the uptake of anticoagulation. METHODS: We carried out a national, cluster randomised controlled trial in the Australian primary health care setting. General practitioners received an educational session, delivered via telephone by a medical peer and provided information about their patients selected either because they were not receiving anticoagulation or for whom anticoagulation was considered challenging. General practitioners were randomised to receive feedback from a medical specialist about the cases (expert decisional support) either before or after completing a post-test audit. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients reported as receiving oral anticoagulation. A secondary outcome assessed antithrombotic treatment as appropriate against guideline recommendations. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine general practitioners participated in the trial, contributing information about 590 cases. At post-test, 152 general practitioners (84.9%) completed data collection on 497 cases (84.2%).

Comparisons were made with statistically test between the contracted and non-contracted residents in four policy targeted dimensions, doctor-visiting behavior, health management and status, medical cost control and satisfaction. RESULTS: Compared with the non-contracted residents, the contracted residents (72.9%) presented a higher prevalence rate of chronic diseases (32.6%), a higher proportion (51.9%) in first-contact in the community health service center and a higher proportion to refer to specialists as well (P < 0.001).The result showed that the average annual medical expense were significantly higher than non-contracted residents (P < 0.001), however, the difference disappeared after age, medical insurance and other socio-demographic variables were controlled. In terms of self-management of non-communicable diseases and complication prevention, the blood pressure control rate and blood glucose control rate for the contracted group were also higher than the counterparts, reaching up to 85.6 and 72.7% respectively.

Ensuring that all essential educational issues are addressed during training is problematic given the scale of the tasks to be undertaken. Human error and the reliability of local systems may increase the risk of safety-critical topics being inadequately covered. However adherence to a checklist reminder may improve the reliability of task delivery and maximise harm reduction. We aimed to prioritise the most safety-critical issues to be addressed in the first 12-weeks of specialty training in the general practice environment and validate a related checklist reminder. METHODS: We used mixed methods with different groups of GP educators (n=127) and specialty trainees (n=9) in two Scottish regions to prioritise, develop and validate checklist content. Generation and refinement of checklist themes and items were undertaken on an iterative basis using a range of methods including small group work in dedicated workshops; a modified-Delphi process; and telephone interviews. The relevance of potential checklist items was rated using a 4-point scale content validity index to inform final inclusion. RESULTS: 14 themes (e.g. prescribing safely; dealing with medical emergency; implications of poor record keeping; and effective & safe communication) and 47 related items (e.g. how to safety-net face-to-face or over the telephone; knowledge of practice systems for results handling; recognition of harm in children) were judged to be essential safety-critical educational issues to be covered. The mean content validity index ratio was 0.98. CONCLUSION: A checklist was developed and validated for educational supervisors to assist in the reliable delivery of safety-critical educational issues in the opening 12-week period of training, and aligned with national curriculum competencies. The tool can also be adapted for use as a self-assessment instrument by trainees to guide patient safety-related learning needs. Dissemination and implementation of the checklist and self-rating scale are proceeding on a national, voluntary basis with plans to evaluate its feasibility and educational impact.",2012,10.1186/1471-2296-13-62,13,NA,62,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Specialization and Time Factors and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Reproducibility of Results and Interprofessional Relations and Self-Assessment and Scotland and *Curriculum and *Checklist and Clinical Competence/standards and *Harm Reduction and *Safety Management/methods/standards and Education, Continuing and Faculty, Medical/standards and General Practice/*education and Holistic Health and Medical Errors/prevention & control and Quality Assurance, Health Care/*standards",NA,NA,2012/06/21/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Fraenkel_2007_Joofgeinme,JOUR,What are the essential elements to enable patient participation in medical decision making?,"Fraenkel, Liana and McGraw, Sarah",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Patient participation in shared decision making (SDM) results in increased patient knowledge, adherence, and improved outcomes. Despite the benefits of the SDM model, many patients do not attain the level of participation they desire. OBJECTIVE: To gain a more complete understanding of the essential elements, or the prerequisites, critical to active patient participation in medical decision making from the patient's perspective. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Individual, in-depth patient interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Two analysts independently read the transcripts and jointly developed a list of codes. PATIENTS: Twenty-six consecutive subjects drawn from community dwelling subjects undergoing bone density measurements. MEASUREMENTS: Respondents' experiences and beliefs related to patient participation in SDM. RESULTS: Five elements were repeatedly described by respondents as being essential to enable patient participation in medical decision making: (1) patient knowledge, (2) explicit encouragement of patient participation by physicians, (3) appreciation of the patient's responsibility/rights to play an active role in decision making, (4) awareness of choice, and (5) time. LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of the results is limited by the homogeneity of the study sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have important clinical implications and suggest that several needs must be met before patients can become active participants in decisions related to their health care. These needs include ensuring that patients (1) appreciate that there is uncertainty in medicine and ""buy in"" to the importance of active patient participation in decisions related to their health care, (2) understand the trade-offs related to available options, and (3) have the opportunity to discuss these options with their physician to arrive at a decision concordant with their values.",2007,10.1007/s11606-007-0149-9,22,5,614-619,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and *Physician-Patient Relations and Interviews as Topic/methods and Patient Participation/*methods,NA,NA,2007/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prognostic models that use electronic medical record (EMR) data to determine 1-year death risk can improve end-of-life planning and risk adjustment for research. OBJECTIVE: Determine if the final set of demographic, vital sign, and laboratory data from a hospitalization can be used to accurately quantify 1-year mortality risk. DESIGN: A retrospective study using electronic medical record data linked with the state death registry. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 59,848 hospitalized patients within a six-hospital network over a 4-year period. MAIN MEASURES: The last set of vital signs, complete blood count, basic and complete metabolic panel, demographic information, and ICD codes. The outcome of interest was death within 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Model performance was measured on the validation data set. Random forests (RF) outperformed logisitic regression (LR) models in discriminative ability. An RF model that used the final set of demographic, vitals, and laboratory data from the final 48 h of hospitalization had an AUC of 0.86 (0.85-0.87) for predicting death within a year. Age, blood urea nitrogen, platelet count, hemoglobin, and creatinine were the most important variables in the RF model. Models that used comorbidity variables alone had the lowest AUC. In groups of patients with a high probability of death, RF models underestimated the probability by less than 10%.

However, many physicians are not able to adequately communicate risks to patients due to a lack of understanding of statistics as well as inadequate management of conflicts of interest (COI). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an integrated curriculum encompassing COI and shared decision-making on the participants' risk communication competence, that is, their competence to advise patients on the benefits and harms of diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. DESIGN: A rater-blind randomized controlled trial with a 30 (<c2><b1> 1)-week follow-up conducted from October 2016 to June 2017 at two German academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three medical students in their fourth or fifth year. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either a newly developed 15-h curriculum or a course manual adapted from teaching as usual. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome: change in risk communication performance in a video-observed structured clinical examination (VOSCE). KEY RESULTS: Participants were 25.7 years old on average (SD 3.6); 73% (46/63) were female. Increase in risk communication performance was significantly higher in the intervention group with post-intervention Cohen's d of 2.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62 to 3.01, p < 0.01) and of 1.83 (CI 1.13 to 2.47, p < 0.01) 30 (<c2><b1> 1) weeks later. Secondary outcomes with the exception of frequency of interactions with the pharmaceutical industry also showed relevant improvements in the intervention as compared with the control group (d between 0.91 and 2.04 (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that an integrated curriculum encompassing COI and risk communication leads to a large and sustainable increase in risk communication performance. We interpret the large effect sizes to be a result of the integration of topics that are usually taught separately, leading to a more effective organization of knowledge.

Van.Roy_2013_BMCfampra,JOUR,What makes up good consultations? A qualitative study of GPs' discourses,"Van Roy, Kaatje and Vanheule, Stijn and Deveugele, Myriam",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: In medical literature, several principles that define 'good consultations' have been outlined. These principles tend to be prescriptive in nature, overlooking the complexity of general practitioners (GPs)' perspectives of everyday practice. Focusing on perspectives might be particularly relevant, since they may affect decisions and actions. Therefore, the present study adopts a bottom-up approach, analyzing GPs' narratives about 'good' and 'bad' consultations. We aimed at describing the range of discourses GPs use in relating on their practice. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 Belgian GPs. By means of a qualitative analysis, the authors mapped patterns in the interview narratives and described the range of different discourses. RESULTS: Four discourses were identified: a biomedically-centered discourse, a communication-focused discourse, a problem-solving discourse and a satisfaction-oriented discourse. Each discourse was further specified in terms of predominant themes, problems the GPs prefer to deal with and inherent difficulties. Although most participants used elements from all four discourses, the majority of the GPs relied on an individual set of predominant discourses and focused on a limited number of themes. CONCLUSION: This study clearly indicates that there is no uniform way in which GPs perceive clinical practice. Each of the participants used a subtle mix of different criteria to define good and bad medical consultations. Some discourse elements appear to be rooted in medical literature, whereas others are of a more personal nature. By focusing on the limitations of each discourse, this study can shed new light on some of the difficulties GPs encounter in their daily practice: being confronted with specific problems might be an effect of adhering to a specific discourse. The typification of different discourses on consultations may function as a framework to help GPs reflect on how they perceive their practice, and help them manage some of the challenges met in daily practice.",2013,10.1186/1471-2296-14-62,14,NA,62,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Belgium and *Physician-Patient Relations and General Practitioners/*psychology and General Practice/*standards and Referral and Consultation/*standards and Patient-Centered Care/methods and Clinical Competence/statistics & numerical data and Group Practice/statistics & numerical data and Private Practice/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/05/16/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relationship between health literacy and decisional conflict while making a major medical treatment decision is not understood. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of individuals making major medical treatment decisions for themselves or someone else and to explore the relationships between decisional conflict and circumstances of the decision as well as the decision-maker. DESIGN: Two-phase survey study: in phase 1, we screened for who made a major treatment decision; in phase 2, we asked eligible respondents about their experience making the decision. PARTICIPANTS: Address-based random sample of 4000 Wisconsin residents; 1072 completed phase 1 and 464 completed phase 2. MAIN MEASURES: We asked respondents about types of decisions made, the most difficult decision made, and characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision. We included the Decisional Conflict Scale and four domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire. Open-ended questions also allowed respondents to describe their experiences. KEY RESULTS: About 43% of respondents reported making a major medical treatment decision. Decisions about major surgery and life support were regarded as the most difficult decisions. Respondents who made the decision for a spouse/partner (<ce><b2> = 6.65, p = 0.012), parent (<ce><b2> = 9.27, p < 0.001), or someone else (<ce><b2> = 10.7, p < 0.001) had higher decisional conflict.

There are few data describing how medical decisions are made for such patients before and during the guardianship process. OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of medical decision-making for incapacitated, hospitalized adults for whom court-appointed guardians are requested. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive cohort study. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were identified from the legal files of a public, urban hospital. Medical and legal records were reviewed for demographic data, code status, diagnoses, code status orders and invasive procedures and person authorizing the order or procedure, dates of incapacitation and appointment of temporary guardian, reason for guardianship, and documentation of communication with a guardian. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients met inclusion criteria; 68.4% were male and 56.2% African-American. The median age was 65 years. Of the 71 patients with medical records available 89% of patients had a temporary guardianship petitioned because of the need for placement only. Seventeen patients had a new DNR order written during hospitalization, eight of which were ordered by physicians without consultation with a surrogate decision maker. Overall, 32 patients underwent a total of 81 documented invasive procedures, 16 of which were authorized by the patient, 15 by family or friend, and 11 by a guardian; consent was not required for 39 of the procedures because of emergency conditions or because a procedure was medically necessary and no surrogate decision maker was available.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether reflecting and revisiting the ""patient"" during a standardized patient (SP) examination improves junior medical students' performance and to analyze students' perceptions of its value. DESIGN: Students completed a six-encounter clinical skills examination, writing a guided assessment after each encounter to trigger reflection. SPs evaluated the students with Medical Skills and Patient Satisfaction checklists. During the last three encounters, students could opt to revisit the SP and be reevaluated with identical checklists. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-nine third year medical students. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in scores in the Medical Skills and Patient Satisfaction checklists between first visit and revisit were tested separately per case as well as across cases. RESULTS: On the medical skills and patient satisfaction checklists, mean revisit scores across cases were significantly higher than mean first visit scores [12.6 vs 12.2 (pooled SD = 2.4), P = .0001; 31.2 vs 31.0 (pooled SD = 3.5), P = .0001)]. Sixty-five percent of the time, students rated ""reflect-revisit"" positively, 34% neutrally, and 0.4% negatively. Five themes were identified in the positive comments: enhancement of (1) medical decision making, (2) patient education/counseling, (3) student satisfaction/confidence, (4) patient satisfaction/confidence, and (5) clinical realism. CONCLUSIONS: Offering third year medical students the option to reflect and revisit an SP during a clinical skills examination produced a small but nontrivial increase in clinical performance.

M.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to osteoporosis treatment is crucial for good treatment effects. However, adherence has been shown to be poor and a substantial part of the patients don't even initiate treatment. This study aimed to gain insight into the considerations of both osteoporosis patients and general practitioners (GP) concerning intentional non-initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. METHODS: Osteoporosis patients and GPs were recruited from the SALT Osteoporosis Study and a transmural fracture liaison service, both carried out in the Netherlands. Using questionnaires, we identified non-starters and starters of bisphosphonate treatment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain a detailed overview of all considerations until saturation of the data was reached. Starters were asked to reflect on the considerations that were brought forward by the non-starters. Interviews were open coded and the codes were classified into main themes and subthemes using an inductive approach. RESULTS: 16 non-starters, 10 starters, and 13 GPs were interviewed. We identified three main themes: insufficient medical advice, attitudes towards medication use including concerns about side effects, and disease awareness. From patients' as well as GPs' perspective, insufficient or ambiguous information from the GP influenced the decision of the non-starters to not start bisphosphonates. In contrast, starters were either properly informed, or they collected information themselves. Patients' aversion towards medication, fear of side effects, and a low risk perception also contributed to not starting the medication, whereas starters were aware of their fracture risk and were confident of the outcome of the treatment. Concerns about osteoporosis treatment and its side effects were also expressed by several GPs. Some GPs appeared to have a limited understanding of the current osteoporosis guidelines and the indications for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Many reasons we found for not starting bisphosphonate treatment were related to the patients or the GPs themselves being insufficiently informed. Attitudes of the GPs were shown to play a role in the decision of patients not to start treatment. Interventions need to be developed that are aimed at GPs, and at education of patients.",2018,10.1186/s12875-018-0828-0,19,1,141,eng,1471-2296,Humans and Osteoporosis and Female and Male and Aged and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Attitude to Health and Attitude of Health Personnel and Netherlands and Clinical Decision-Making and *General Practitioners and General practitioner and Bisphosphonates and Bone Density Conservation Agents/*therapeutic use and Diphosphonates/*therapeutic use and Non-initiation and Osteoporosis/complications/*drug therapy and Osteoporotic Fractures/etiology/*prevention & control,NA,NA,2018/08/23/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mulvale_2016_BMCfampra,JOUR,'Gearing Up' to improve interprofessional collaboration in primary care: a systematic review and conceptual framework,"Mulvale, Gillian and Embrett, Mark and Razavi, Shaghayegh Donya",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Interprofessional Primary Care Teams (IPCTs) have been shown to benefit health systems and patients, particularly those patients with complex care needs. The literature suggests a wide range of factors that may influence collaboration in IPCTs, however the evidence base is unclear for many of these factors. To target improvement efforts, we identify studies that demonstrate an association between suggested factors and collaborative processes in IPCTs. METHODS: A systematic review of 25 years of peer-review literature was conducted to identify studies that test associations between policy, organizational, care team and individual factors, and collaboration in IPCTs. We searched Medline, ProQuest subject, ProQuest abstract, CINAHL, HealthSTAR, and Embase electronic databases between January 1990 to June 2015 and hand-searched reference lists of identified articles. RESULTS: The electronic searches identified 1421 articles, nine of which met inclusion criteria. Eighteen factors were significantly associated with collaboration in at least one article. We present the findings within a proposed conceptual model of interrelated 'gears'. The model offers a taxonomy of factors that policy makers (macro gear), organizational managers (meso gear), care teams (micro gear) and health professionals (individual gear) can adjust to improve interprofessional collaboration in IPC teams. Thirteen of the eighteen identified factors were within the micro gear, or team level of decision-making. These pertained to formal processes such as quality audits and group problem-solving; social processes such as open communication and supportive colleagues; team attitudes such as feeling part of the team; and team structure such as team size and having a collaboration champion or facilitator. Fewer policy (eg governance), organizational (eg information systems, organizational culture) or individual (eg belief in interprofessional collaboration care and personal flexibility) level factors were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that individual IPCTs have opportunities to improve collaboration regardless of the organizational or policy context within which they operate. Evidence supports the importance of having a team vision and shared goals, formal quality processes, information systems, and professionals feeling part of the team.

Brand_2019_Joofgeinme,JOUR,The Stage IV Shuffle: Elusiveness of Straight Talk About Advanced Cancer,"Brand, Donald A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"During the initial consultation with a patient to communicate a diagnosis of late-stage cancer, the oncologist may refrain from giving survival statistics, redirecting the conversation from the bad news (incurability) to the practical aspects of the patient's care (treatments, timetables, appointments, and testing to monitor response to treatment). Whether conscious or unconscious, this diversion helps cushion the impact of the disturbing news. This paper shows that clinicians' gingerly handling of harsh facts when they talk with patients also applies to health educators and researchers when they write about late-stage cancer. As a result, these cancer patients typically lack an understanding of their poor prognosis and the limited effectiveness of most available treatments, possibly compromising their ability to make informed choices. To remedy this problem, I describe an approach to straight talk about late-stage cancer that can give a patient realistic hopes instead of false hopes that are apt to betray later on. I also propose an enhanced method of displaying and interpreting comparative efficacy data that can facilitate understanding and serve as a basis for shared decision making.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-05158-5,34,11,2637-2642,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"communication and Humans and Risk Assessment and ethics and Prognosis and cancer and *Physician-Patient Relations and patient engagement and Decision Making, Shared and Medical Oncology/methods and *Truth Disclosure and Neoplasms/drug therapy/*psychology",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thampy_2019_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Assessing Clinical Reasoning: Targeting the Higher Levels of the Pyramid,"Thampy, Harish and Willert, Emma and Ramani, Subha",Journal of general internal medicine,"Clinical reasoning is a core component of clinical competency that is used in all patient encounters from simple to complex presentations. It involves synthesis of myriad clinical and investigative data, to generate and prioritize an appropriate differential diagnosis and inform safe and targeted management plans.The literature is rich with proposed methods to teach this critical skill to trainees of all levels. Yet, ensuring that reasoning ability is appropriately assessed across the spectrum of knowledge acquisition to workplace-based clinical performance can be challenging.In this perspective, we first introduce the concepts of illness scripts and dual-process theory that describe the roles of analytic system 1 and non-analytic system 2 reasoning in clinical decision making. Thereafter, we draw upon existing evidence and expert opinion to review a range of methods that allow for effective assessment of clinical reasoning, contextualized within Miller's pyramid of learner assessment. Key assessment strategies that allow teachers to evaluate their learners' clinical reasoning ability are described from the level of knowledge acquisition, through to real-world demonstration in the clinical workplace.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-04953-4,34,8,1631-1636,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Problem Solving and Humans and Patient Care/standards and *Clinical Competence and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Patient Simulation and Education, Medical/*methods and clinical reasoning and medical education-assessment method and medical education-assessment/evaluation and medical education-cognition/problem solving",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sturman_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,With a grain of salt? Supervisor credibility and other factors influencing trainee decisions to seek in-consultation assistance: a focus group study of Australian general practice trainees,"Sturman, Nancy and Jorm, Christine and Parker, Malcolm",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: 'Ad hoc' help-seeking by trainees from their supervisors during trainee consultations is important for patient safety, and trainee professional development. We explored trainee objectives and activities in seeking supervisor assistance, and trainee perceptions of the outcomes of this help-seeking (including the utility of supervisor responses). METHODS: Focus groups with Australian general practice trainees were undertaken. All data was audio-recorded and transcribed, coded using in-vivo and descriptive codes, and analysed by the constant comparison of provisional interpretations and themes with the data. Findings are reported under the over-arching categories of help-seeking objectives, activities and outcomes. RESULTS: Early in their general practice placements trainees needed information about practice facilities, and the ""complex maze"" of local patient resources and referral preferences: some clinical presentations were also unfamiliar, and many trainees were unaccustomed to making patient management decisions. Subsequent help-seeking was often characterised informally as ""having a chat"" or ""getting a second opinion"" so as not to ""miss anything"" when trainees were ""not 100% sure"". Trainees emphasised the importance of being (and demonstrating that they were) clinically safe. Workflow constraints, and supervisory and doctor-patient relationships, had a powerful influence on trainee help-seeking activities. An etiquette for providing help in front of patients was described. Trainees assessed the credibility of supervisors based on their approach to risk and their clinical expertise in the relevant area. Several trainees reported reservations about their supervisor's advice on occasions. CONCLUSION: A trainee's subsequent help-seeking is strongly influenced by how their supervisor responds when their help is sought. Trainees prefer to seek help from credible supervisors who respond promptly and maintain trainee 'face' in front of patients. Trainees learn through help-seeking to make their own clinical decisions but may remain uncertain about professional and societal expectations, and curious about how other general practitioners practise. Trainees value opportunities throughout their training to observe expert general practice.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-1084-7,21,1,28,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Expertise and Australia and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and Education, Medical, Graduate and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Competence and *Help-Seeking Behavior and *Patient Safety and General Practice/*education and Clinical oversight and General practice training and Help-seeking",NA,NA,2020/02/07/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand to what extent hospitalized older adults and their caregivers are empowered to make a high-quality decision about utilizing an SNF for post-acute care and what contextual or process elements led to satisfaction with the outcome of their decision once in SNF. DESIGN: Qualitative inquiry using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF), a conceptual framework that describes key components of high-quality decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two previously community-dwelling older adults (<e2><89><a5> 65 years old) and 22 caregivers interviewed at three different hospitals and three skilled nursing facilities. MAIN MEASURES: We used key components of the ODSF to identify elements of context and process that affected decision-making and to what extent the outcome was characteristic of a high-quality decision: informed, values based, and not associated with regret or blame. KEY RESULTS: The most important contextual themes were the presence of active medical conditions in the hospital that made decision-making difficult, prior experiences with hospital readmission or SNF, relative level of caregiver support, and pressure to make a decision quickly for which participants felt unprepared. Patients described playing a passive role in the decision-making process and largely relying on recommendations from the medical team. Patients commonly expressed resignation and a perceived lack of choice or autonomy, leading to dissatisfaction with the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding and intervening to improve the quality of decision-making regarding post-acute care supports is essential for improving outcomes of hospitalized older adults. Our results suggest that simply providing information is not sufficient; rather, incorporating key contextual factors and improving the decision-making process for both patients and clinicians are also essential.",2018,10.1007/s11606-017-4298-1,33,5,678-684,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and hospital and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and *Decision Making and Caregivers/psychology and *Skilled Nursing Facilities and post-acute care and skilled nursing facility and Subacute Care/*psychology",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is a fairly unrecognized key challenge in the healthcare systems. In some cases, local and national Continuous Professional Development (CPD) initiatives target these challenges; however there have been few international initiatives, possibly because challenges emerging from different studies have not been linked across national boundaries. In this context, the authors have compiled data about gaps and/or barriers inherent to GP/FP care of persons with type 2 diabetes from Austria, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. METHODS: Secondary analyzes of pre-existing studies were conducted to identify challenges in the care of patients with type 2 diabetes as faced by GPs/FPs. Two sources of data were reviewed: unpublished research data from collaborating organizations and articles from a literature search (in English and German). Articles retrieved were scanned by the research team for relevance to the study objectives and to extract existing gaps and barriers. The identified challenges were then categorized along three major axes: (1) phase of the continuum of care {from screening to management}; (2) learning domain {knowledge, skills, attitudes, behavior, context}; and (3) by country/region. Compilation and categorization were performed by qualitative researchers and discrepancies were resolved through discussion until concordance was achieved. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirteen challenges faced by GPs/FPs in the care for patients with type 2 diabetes were common in at least 3 of the 4 targeted countries/regions. These issues were found across the entire continuum of care and included: pathophysiology of diabetes, diagnostic criteria, treatment targets assessment, drugs' modes of action, decision-making in therapies, treatment guidelines, insulin therapy, adherence, management of complications, lifestyle changes, team integration, bureaucracy and third-party payers. The issues reported were not restricted to the physicians' knowledge, but also related to their skills, attitudes, behaviours and context. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed challenges faced by GPs/FPs when caring for patients with diabetes, which were similar across international and health system borders. Common issues might be addressed more efficiently through international educational designs, adapted to each country's healthcare system, helping develop and maintain physicians' competencies.",2011,10.1186/1471-2296-12-27,12,NA,27,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and International Cooperation and Canada and United Kingdom and Germany and Austria and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Clinical Competence/*standards and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*therapy and Continuity of Patient Care/*standards and Education, Medical, Continuing/*standards and Family Practice/*education/standards and Primary Health Care/organization & administration",NA,NA,2011/05/11/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ong_2008_BMCfampra,JOUR,Call-duration and triage decisions in out of hours cooperatives with and without the use of an expert system,"Ong, Rob S. G. and Post, Johan and van Rooij, Harry and de Haan, Jan",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Cooperatives delivering out of hours care in the Netherlands are hesitant about the use of expert systems during triage. Apart from the extra costs, cooperatives are not sure that quality of triage is sufficiently enhanced by these systems and believe that call duration will be prolonged drastically. No figures about the influence of the use of an expert system during triage on call duration and triage decisions in out of hours care in the Netherlands are available. METHODS: Electronically registered data concerning call duration and triage decisions were collected in two cooperatives. One in Tilburg, a cooperative in a Southern city of the Netherlands using an expert system, and one in Groningen, a cooperative in a Northern city not using an expert system. Some other relevant information about the care process was collected additionally. Data about call duration was compared using an independent sample t-test. Data about call decisions was compared using Chi Square. RESULTS: The mean call time in the cooperative using the TAS expert system is 4.6 minutes, in the cooperative not using the expert system 3.9 minutes. A significant difference of 0.7 minutes (0.4 - 1.0, 95% CI) minutes. In the cooperative with an expert system a larger percentage of patients is handled by the assistant, patients are less often referred to a telephone consultation with the GP and are less likely to be offered a visit by the GP.A quick interpretation of the impact of the difference in triage decisions, show that these may be large enough to support the hypothesis that longer call duration is compensated for by less contacts with the GP (by telephone or face-to-face). There is no proof, however, that these differences are caused by the use of the triage system. The larger amount of calls handled by the assistant may be partly caused by the fact that the assistants in the cooperative with an expert system more often consult the GP during triage. And it is not likely that the larger amount of home visits in Groningen can be attributed to the absence of an expert system. The expert system only offers advice whether a GP should be seen, not in which way (by consultation in the office or by home visit). CONCLUSION: The differences in call times between a cooperative using an expert system and a cooperative not using an expert system are small; 0.4 - 1.0 min. Differences in triage decisions were found, but it is not proven that these can be contributed to the use of an expert system.",2008,10.1186/1471-2296-9-11,9,NA,11,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Time Factors and Netherlands and Telephone and Group Practice and *Decision Making and *Expert Systems and Triage/*methods/standards and After-Hours Care/*organization & administration and Medical Records Systems, Computerized/statistics & numerical data and Remote Consultation/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2008/02/13/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aboumatar_2013_Joofgeinme,JOUR,"The impact of health literacy on desire for participation in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported outcomes among patients with hypertension","Aboumatar, Hanan J. and Carson, Kathryn A. and Beach, Mary Catherine and Roter, Debra L. and Cooper, Lisa A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Low health literacy (HL) is associated with poor healthcare outcomes; mechanisms for these associations remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how HL influences patients' interest in participating in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported visit outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to improve patient adherence to hypertension treatments. Participants were 41 primary care physicians and 275 of their patients. Prior to the enrollment visit, physicians received a minimal intervention or communication skills training and patients received a minimal intervention or a pre-visit coaching session. This resulted in four intervention groups (minimal patient/minimal physician; minimal patient/intensive physician; intensive patient/minimal physician; and intensive patient/intensive physician). MEASUREMENTS: Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; patients' desire for involvement in decision making; communication behaviors; patient ratings of participatory decision making (PDM), trust, and satisfaction. RESULTS: A lower percentage of patients with low versus adequate literacy had controlled blood pressure. Both groups were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. Communication behaviors did not differ based on HL except for medical question asking by patients, which was lower among low literacy patients. This was particularly true in the intensive patient /intensive physician group (3.85 vs. 6.42 questions; p = 0.002). Overall, ratings of care didn't differ based on HL; however, in analyses stratified by intervention assignment, patients with low literacy in minimal physician intervention groups reported significantly lower PDM scores than adequate literacy patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and adequate literacy were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. However, low literacy patients were less likely to experience PDM in their visits. Low literacy patients in the intensive physician intervention groups asked fewer medical questions. Patients with low literacy may be less able to respond to physicians' use of patient-centered communication approaches than adequate literacy patients.",2013,10.1007/s11606-013-2466-5,28,11,1469-1476,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Patient Satisfaction and Follow-Up Studies and Self Report and *Physician-Patient Relations and Delivery of Health Care/methods/*trends and Health Literacy/*trends and Hypertension/diagnosis/*therapy and Office Visits/*trends and Patient Participation/methods/*trends,NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

These conversations focus on preferences regarding serious illness and may involve patients, decision makers, and health care providers. We describe the feasibility of the first primary care-based group visit model focused on advance care planning. METHODS: We conducted a pilot demonstration of an advance care planning group visit in a geriatrics clinic. Patients were aged at least 65 years. Groups of patients met in 2 sessions of 2 hours each facilitated by a geriatrician and a social worker. Activities included considering personal values, discussing advance care planning, choosing surrogate decision-makers, and completing advance directives. We used the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the project. RESULTS: Ten of 11 clinicians referred patients for participation. Of 80 patients approached, 32 participated in 5 group visit cohorts (a 40% participation rate) and 27 participated in both sessions (an 84% retention rate). Mean age was 79 years; 59% of participants were female and 72% white. Most evaluated the group visit as better than usual clinic visits for discussing advance care planning. Patients reported increases in detailed advance care planning conversations after participating (19% to 41%, P = .02). Qualitative analysis found that older adults were willing to share personal values and challenges related to advance care planning and that they initiated discussions about a broad range of relevant topics.

Prompt diagnosis is crucial in patients with MI, but many patients delay seeking medical care. The aims of this study was to 1) describe background characteristics, symptoms, actions and delay times in patients contacting the PHC before hospitalisation when falling ill with an acute MI, 2) compare those patients with acute MI patients not contacting the PHC, and 3) explore factors associated with a PHC contact in acute MI patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicentre study, enrolling consecutive patients with MI within 24 hours of admission to hospital from Nov 2012 until Feb 2014. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients with MI, 519 men and 169 women, were included; the mean age was 66<c2><b1>11 years. One in five people contacted PHC instead of the recommended emergency medical services (EMS), and 94% of these patients experienced cardinal symptoms of an acute MI; i.e., chest pain, and/or radiating pain in the arms, and/or cold sweat. Median delay time from symptom-onset-to-decision-to-seek-care was 2:15 hours in PHC patients and 0:40 hours in non-PHC patients (p<0.01). The probability of utilising the PHC before hospitalisation was associated with fluctuating symptoms (OR 1.74), pain intensity (OR 0.90) symptoms during off-hours (OR 0.42), study hospital (OR 3.49 and 2.52, respectively, for two of the county hospitals) and a final STEMI diagnosis (OR 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: Ambulance services are still underutilized in acute MI patients. A substantial part of the patients contacts their primary healthcare centre before they are diagnosed with MI, although experiencing cardinal symptoms such as chest pain.

Such knowledge could provide a basis for the design of interventions to change prescribing patterns for psychotropics. The aim of this study was to explore the views of general practitioners (GPs), GP interns, and heads of primary care units on factors affecting the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in primary care. METHODS: We performed four focus group discussions in Gothenburg, Sweden, with a total of 21 participants (GPs, GP interns, and heads of primary care units). The focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using manifest content analysis. RESULTS: Three different themes emerged from the focus group discussions. The first theme Seeking care for symptoms, reflects the participants' understanding of why patients approach primary care and comprised categories such as knowledge, attitudes, and society and the media. The second theme, Lacking a framework, resources, and treatment alternatives, which reflects the conditions for the physician-patient interaction, comprised categories such as economy and resources, technology, and organizational aspects. The third theme, Restricting or maintaining prescriptions, with the subthemes Individual factors and External influences, reflects the physicians' internal decision making and comprised categories such as emotions, knowledge, and pharmaceutical industry. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that a variety of factors may affect the prescribing of psychotropic medications in primary care. Many factors were related to characteristics of the patient, the physician or their interaction, rather than the patients' medical needs per se.

Ginsburg_2008_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Know when to rock the boat: how faculty rationalize students' behaviors,"Ginsburg, Shiphra and Lingard, Lorelei and Regehr, Glenn and Underwood, Kathryn",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: When faculty evaluate medical students' professionalism, they make judgments based on the observation of behaviors. However, we lack an understanding of why they feel certain behaviors are appropriate (or not). OBJECTIVE: To explore faculty's reasoning around potential student behaviors in professionally challenging situations. DESIGN: Guided interviews with faculty who were asked to respond to 5 videotaped scenarios depicting students in professionally challenging situations. SUBJECTS: Purposive sample of 30 attending Internists and surgeons. APPROACH: Transcripts were analyzed using modified grounded theory to search for emerging themes and to attempt to validate a previous framework based on student responses. RESULTS: Faculty's reasoning around behaviors were similar to students' and were categorized by three general themes: Imperatives (e.g., take care of patients, behave honestly, know your place), Affect (factors relating to a student's ""gut instincts"" or personality), or Implications (for the student, patients, and others). Several new themes emerged, including ""know when to fudge the truth"", ""do what you're told"", and ""know when to step up to the plate"". These new codes, along with a near ubiquitous reference to Affect, suggests that faculty feel students are responsible for knowing when (and how) to bend the rules. Potential reasons for this are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although faculty are aware of the conflicts students face when encountering professional challenges, their reliance on students to ""just know"" what to do reflects the underlying complexity and ambiguity that surrounds decision making in these situations.

German GPs report that they are under ""pressure to prescribe"" antibiotics particularly in consultations with Turkish immigrants. And so a qualitative approach was used to learn more about the socio-medical context of Turkish patients in regard to acute coughs. A German leaflet designed to improve the doctor-patient communication has been positively tested and then adapted for Turkish patients. METHODS: The original leaflet was first translated into Turkish. Then 57 patients belonging to 8 different GPs were interviewed about the leaflet using a semi-standardised script. The material was audio recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed by three independent researchers. As a first step a comprehensive content analysis was performed. Secondly, elements crucial to any Turkish version of the leaflet were identified. RESULTS: The interviews showed that the leaflets' messages were clearly understood by all patients irrespective of age, gender, and educational background. We identified no major problems in the perception of the translated leaflet but identified several minor points which could be improved.

It is an explicit, quantitative, and systematic approach to decision making under conditions of uncertainty. In this article, we present two teaching tips aimed at helping clinical learners understand the use and relevance of decision analysis. The first tip demonstrates the structure of a decision tree. With this tree, a clinician may identify the optimal choice among complicated options by calculating probabilities of events and incorporating patient valuations of possible outcomes. The second tip demonstrates how to address uncertainty regarding the estimates used in a decision tree. We field tested the tips twice with interns and senior residents. Teacher preparatory time was approximately 90 minutes. The field test utilized a board and a calculator. Two handouts were prepared. Learners identified the importance of incorporating values into the decision-making process as well as the role of uncertainty. The educational objectives appeared to be reached.

The traditional diagnostic pathway can be complex and time-consuming, and innovative solutions may provide easy access to diagnostics and better use of healthcare resources. We aimed to describe use, clinical outcomes and time used when providing general practitioners (GPs) with a direct-access pathway to hospital-based, single whole-leg compression ultrasound (CUS) for patients with suspected DVT. Furthermore we aimed to describe the resources used in the new direct-access pathway and compare it with the previous pathway. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year descriptive cohort study (2016-2017) including 449 consecutively referred patients for diagnosis of DVT in a Danish regional hospital. The previous pathway included pre-test at the medical department, a proximal leg CUS if required based on the pre-test and a re-scan if the first CUS was negative. The new pathway included two strategies: 1) a 'yes-no strategy', where GPs referred patients directly to whole-leg CUS and if positive, treated at the medical department and if negative, discharged to the GP, 2) a 'follow-up strategy' where GPs could require that patients were seen at the medical department, irrespective of the CUS result. Data included extractions from the Radiology Information and Patient Administrative Systems, and mean salaries of healthcare professionals at Silkeborg Regional Hospital, Denmark. Descriptive statistics were used to describe prevalence, timelines and costs. RESULTS: GPs referred 318 (71%) patients through the yes-no strategy and 131 (29%) via the follow-up strategy with DVT diagnosed in 48 (15%) and 51 (39%) patients, respectively (p < 0.001). For the 263 patients completed after CUS in the yes-no strategy, median pathway time was 24 min (IQI: 16-36), and for those with DVT (including both strategies) 202 min (IQI: 158-273). Direct-access pathway costs were <e2><82><ac>49.7 less per patient than the previous pathway. CONCLUSION: Direct-access to CUS for suspected DVT was achievable, had short time intervals and required fewer resources. The difference in DVT prevalence indicates that GPs distinguish between patients with low and high risk of DVT.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01267-x,21,1,195,eng,1471-2296,Diagnosis and General practice and Denmark and Humans and Cohort Studies and Family Practice and Ultrasonography and *General Practice and Clinical decision-making and *Venous Thrombosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology and Venous thrombosis,NA,NA,2020/09/21/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chapman_2013_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Physicians and implicit bias: how doctors may unwittingly perpetuate health care disparities,"Chapman, Elizabeth N. and Kaatz, Anna and Carnes, Molly",Journal of general internal medicine,"Although the medical profession strives for equal treatment of all patients, disparities in health care are prevalent. Cultural stereotypes may not be consciously endorsed, but their mere existence influences how information about an individual is processed and leads to unintended biases in decision-making, so called ""implicit bias"". All of society is susceptible to these biases, including physicians. Research suggests that implicit bias may contribute to health care disparities by shaping physician behavior and producing differences in medical treatment along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender or other characteristics. We review the origins of implicit bias, cite research documenting the existence of implicit bias among physicians, and describe studies that demonstrate implicit bias in clinical decision-making. We then present the bias-reducing strategies of consciously taking patients' perspectives and intentionally focusing on individual patients' information apart from their social group. We conclude that the contribution of implicit bias to health care disparities could decrease if all physicians acknowledged their susceptibility to it, and deliberately practiced perspective-taking and individuation when providing patient care. We further conclude that increasing the number of African American/Black physicians could reduce the impact of implicit bias on health care disparities because they exhibit significantly less implicit race bias.",2013,10.1007/s11606-013-2441-1,28,11,1504-1510,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and *Decision Making and *Physician-Patient Relations and Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology and *Physicians/psychology and Attitude of Health Personnel/*ethnology and Blacks/ethnology/psychology and Prejudice/*ethnology/psychology,NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Norrmen_2008_BMCfampra,JOUR,How primary health care physicians make sick listing decisions: the impact of medical factors and functioning,"Norrmen, Gunilla and Svardsudd, Kurt and Andersson, Dan K. G.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: The decision to issue sickness certification in Sweden for a patient should be based on the physician's assessment of the reduction of the patient's work capacity due to a disease or injury, not on psychosocial factors, in spite of the fact that they are known as risk factors for sickness absence. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of medical factors and functioning on sick listing probability. METHODS: Four hundred and seventy-four patient-physician consultations, where sick listing could be an option, in general practice in Orebro county, central Sweden, were documented using physician and patient questionnaires. Information sought was the physicians' assessments of causes and consequences of the patients' complaints, potential to recover, diagnoses and prescriptions on sick leave, and the patients' view of their family and work situation and functioning as well as data on the patients' former and present health situation. The outcome measure was whether or not a sickness certificate was issued. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Complaints entirely or mainly somatic as assessed by the physician decreased the risk of sick listing, and complaints resulting in severe limitation of occupational work capacity, as assessed by the patient as well as the physician, increased the risk of sick listing, as did appointments for locomotor complaints. The results for patients with infectious diseases or musculoskeletal diseases were partly similar to those for all diseases. CONCLUSION: The strongest predictors for sickness certification were patient's and GP's assessment of reduced work capacity, with a striking concordance between physician and patient on this assessment. When patient's complaints were judged to be non-somatic the risk of sickness certification was enhanced.",2008,10.1186/1471-2296-9-3,9,NA,3,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Multivariate Analysis and Educational Status and Risk Factors and Absenteeism and Socioeconomic Factors and Sweden and Incidence and Attitude of Health Personnel and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Sickness Impact Profile and Employment/*statistics & numerical data and Sick Leave/*statistics & numerical data and *Work Capacity Evaluation and Family Practice/*methods and Primary Health Care/standards/trends",NA,NA,2008/01/21/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

National guidelines have called for earlier referral of CKD patients, but it is unclear how these should apply to older adults. OBJECTIVE: This scholarly review aims to explore the current literature about upstream referral decisions for CKD within the context of decisions about initiation of dialysis and general referral decisions. The authors propose a model for understanding the referral process and discuss future directions for research to guide decision making for older patients with CKD. RESULTS: While age has been shown to be influential in decisions to refer patients for dialysis and other medical therapies, the role of other patient factors such as competing medical co-morbidities, functional loss, or cognitive impairment in the decision making of physicians has been less well elucidated, particularly for CKD. CONCLUSIONS: More information is needed on the decision-making behavior of physicians for upstream referral decisions like those being advocated for CKD.

DeMeester_2016_Joofgeinme,JOUR,A Model of Organizational Context and Shared Decision Making: Application to LGBT Racial and Ethnic Minority Patients,"DeMeester, Rachel H. and Lopez, Fanny Y. and Moore, Jennifer E. and Cook, Scott C. and Chin, Marshall H.",Journal of general internal medicine,"Shared decision making (SDM) occurs when patients and clinicians work together to reach care decisions that are both medically sound and responsive to patients' preferences and values. SDM is an important tenet of patient-centered care that can improve patient outcomes. Patients with multiple minority identities, such as sexual orientation and race/ethnicity, are at particular risk for poor SDM. Among these dual-minority patients, added challenges to clear and open communication include cultural barriers, distrust, and a health care provider's lack of awareness of the patient's minority sexual orientation or gender identity. However, organizational factors like a culture of inclusion and private space throughout the visit can improve SDM with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (""LGBT"") racial/ethnic minority patients who have faced stigma and discrimination. Most models of shared decision making focus on the patient-provider interaction, but the health care organization's context is also critical. Context-an organization's structure and operations-can strongly influence the ability and willingness of patients and clinicians to engage in shared decision making. SDM is most likely to be optimal if organizations transform their contexts and patients and providers improve their communication. Thus, we propose a conceptual model that suggests ways in which organizations can shape their contextual structure and operations to support SDM. The model contains six drivers: workflows, health information technology, organizational structure and culture, resources and clinic environment, training and education, and incentives and disincentives. These drivers work through four mechanisms to impact care: continuity and coordination, the ease of SDM, knowledge and skills, and attitudes and beliefs. These mechanisms can activate clinicians and patients to engage in high-quality SDM. We provide examples of how specific contextual changes could make SDM more effective for LGBT racial/ethnic minority populations, focusing especially on transformations that would establish a safe environment, build trust, and decrease stigma.",2016,10.1007/s11606-016-3608-3,31,6,651-662,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Organizational Culture and Humans and disparities and shared decision making and Professional-Patient Relations and Attitude of Health Personnel and Workflow and Patient Care Team/organization & administration and Prejudice and *Decision Making and *Models, Organizational and transgender and *Patient Participation and Medical Informatics/*organization & administration and race and ethnicity and bisexual and Ethnicity/psychology and gay and lesbian and Minority Groups/*psychology and practice redesign and Sexual and Gender Minorities/*psychology",NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is known, however, about whether and how often primary care clinicians adhere to the advice they receive. We evaluated how primary care clinicians use recommendations conveyed by specialists via the Champlain BASE (Building Access to Specialists through eConsultation) eConsult service and how eConsult affects clinical management of patients in primary care. METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis based on a retrospective chart audit of 291 eConsults done between January 20, 2017 and August 31, 2017 at the Bruyere Family Health Team, located in Ottawa, Canada. Patients' charts were reviewed until 6 months after specialist response for the following main outcomes: implementation of specialist advice by primary care clinicians, communication of the results to the patients, method, and time frame of communication. RESULTS: Primary care clinicians adhered to specialist advice in 82% of cases. Adherence ranged from 62% to 93% across recommendation categories. Questions asked by primary care clinicians related to diagnosis (63%), management (27%), drug treatment (10%), and procedures (1%). Recommendations of the eConsult were communicated to patients in 79% of cases, most often by face-to-face visit (38%), telephone call (32%), or use of the patient portal (9%). Communication occurred in a median of 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of barriers to implementing specialist advice with use of eConsult, which suggests recommendations given through service were actionable. With a high primary care clinician adherence to specialist recommendations and primary care clinician-to-patient communication, we conclude that eConsult delivers good-quality care and improves patient management.",2019,10.1370/afm.2355,17,2,150-157,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Aged and decision making and health informatics and Infant, Newborn and Medical Audit and *Communication and access to care and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Cooperative Behavior and delivery of health care and *Remote Consultation and practice-based research and *Physicians, Family and eConsult and integrated and *Nurse Practitioners and coordination of care and primary care clinician adherence and professional practice",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cuesta.Vargas_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,Cross-cultural adaptation and validity of the Spanish fear-avoidance components scale and clinical implications in primary care,"Cuesta-Vargas, Antonio I. and Neblett, Randy and Gatchel, Robert J. and Roldan-Jimenez, Cristina",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Pain-related fear-avoidance (FA) is a common problem affecting many patients with painful medical conditions. As there is great interest in the clinical importance of the relationship between FA and disability, several questionnaires have been developed to measure FA. The Fear-Avoidance Components Scale (FACS) is a recently developed patient-reported instrument that addresses critical issues not previously considered in previous FA-related questionnaires. The original English version of the FACS demonstrated good reliability, internal consistency, and construct, criterion, and predictive validity. Two factors were determined: General Fear Avoidance and Types of Activities That are Avoided. The aim of this study was to to translate the FACS into European-style Spanish (FACS-Sp), and validate its psychometric properties. METHODS: This two-stage psychometric study included 330 subjects with various chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. An initial translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the FACS, from English to Spanish, was performed. Then, critical psychometric properties were analysed, including internal consistency by Cronbach's <ce><b1> coefficients, structural validity from the Maximum Likelihood Extraction (MLE), and convergent validity by Pearson correlation with the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). RESULTS: This study reports for the first time the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the FACS. Total scores ranged from 0 to 88 points, with a mean of 30.49 (<c2><b1>17.18). The FACS-Sp showed a high internal consistency for factor 1 (<ce><b1> = 0.902) and factor 2 (<ce><b1> = 0.88). Factor structure was two-dimensional and supported structural validity, accounting for 48.75% of the total variance. Convergent validity analysis found a significant Pearson correlation r = 0.414. CONCLUSION: This study reports for the first time the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the FACS-Sp. Psychometric properties supported the validation of FACS-Sp and ensured the conceptual equivalence with the original English version. In primary care and chronic pain rehabilitation, FA assessment is crucial for clinical decision-making and treatment guidance. The FACS-Sp offers a new measure of FA in Spanish speaking populations. Future research on the FACS-Sp should evaluate test-retest reliability, treatment responsiveness and psychometric comparisons with other translated versions.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01116-x,21,1,44,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Chronic Disease and Reproducibility of Results and Spain and Primary Health Care/*methods and Cross-Cultural Comparison and Psychometrics/*methods and *Avoidance Learning and *Musculoskeletal Pain/psychology/rehabilitation and Chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders, patient health questionnaire, decision making and FACS and Fear-avoidance and Fear/*psychology and Patient Health Questionnaire/*standards and The fear-avoidance components scale and Translations and Weights and Measures",NA,NA,2020/02/27/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bernard_2020_BMCfampra,JOUR,Exploring patient-reported barriers to advance care planning in family practice,"Bernard, Carrie and Tan, Amy and Slaven, Marissa and Elston, Dawn and Heyland, Daren K. and Howard, Michelle",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Although patient-centred care has become increasingly important across all medical specialties, when it comes to end of life care, research has shown that treatments ordered are not often concordant with people's expressed preferences. Patient and family engagement in Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the primary care setting could improve the concordance between patients' wishes and the healthcare received when patients cannot speak for themselves. The aim of this study was to better understand the barriers faced by older patients regarding talking to their family members and family physicians about ACP. METHODS: In this multi-site cross-sectional study, three free text questions regarding reasons patients found it difficult to discuss ACP with their families or their family physicians were part of a self-administered questionnaire about patients' knowledge of and engagement in ACP. The questionnaire, which included closed ended questions followed by three probing open ended questions, was distributed in 20 family practices across 3 provinces in Canada. The free text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and form the basis of this paper. RESULTS: One hundred two participants provided an analyzable response to the survey when asked why they haven't talked to someone about ACP. Two hundred fifty-four answered the question about talking to their physician and 340 answered the question about talking to family members. Eight distinct themes emerged from the free text response analysis: 1. They were too young for ACP; 2. The topic is too emotional; 3. The Medical Doctor (MD) should be responsible for bringing up ACP 4. A fear of negatively impacting the patient-physician relationship; 5. Not enough time in appointments; 6. Concern about family dynamics; 7. It's not a priority; and 8. A lack of knowledge about ACP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in our sample described many barriers to ACP discussions, including concerns about the effect these discussions may have on relationships with both family members and family physicians, and issues relating to patients' knowledge and interpretation of the importance, responsibility for, or relevance of ACP itself. Family physicians may be uniquely placed to leverage the longitudinal, person- centred relationship they have with patients to mitigate some of these barriers.",2020,10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,21,1,94,eng,1471-2296,Communication and Decision making and Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Qualitative Research and Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Canada/epidemiology and *Patient Preference and Family/psychology and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Older adults and Advance Care Planning/*organization & administration and *Communication Barriers and End-of-life and Family Practice/*methods and *Terminal Care/ethics/methods/psychology,NA,NA,2020/05/25/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Advance Care Planning in Substance Use Disorders,"Fleshner, Michelle J. and Kennedy, Amy J. and Veldkamp, Peter J. and Childers, Julie W.",Journal of general internal medicine,"Primary care physicians are increasingly incorporating screening tools for substance use disorders (SUDs) and referral to treatment into their practice. Despite efforts to provide access to treatment, patients with SUDs remain at an increased risk of mortality, both from overdose and from general medical conditions. Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for patients with chronic, progressive medical conditions such as malignancies or heart failure. Though SUDs are widely acknowledged to be chronic diseases associated with an increased risk of mortality, there has been little discussion on ACP in this population. ACP is a discussion regarding future care, often including selection of a surrogate decision-maker and completion of an advanced directive. ACP has been associated with better quality of end-of-life and care more consistent with patient preferences. Studies in other vulnerable populations have shown that marginalized and high-risk individuals may be less likely to receive ACP. Similarly, patients with SUDs may employ different decision-makers than that defined by law (i.e., friend vs. family member), increasing the importance of discussing patient values and social structure. Physicians should routinely conduct ACP conversations with patients with SUDs, especially those with chronic, progressive medical conditions and/or severe, uncontrolled substance use disorders.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-05223-z,34,11,2630-2633,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and addiction and Practice Guidelines as Topic and *Physician-Patient Relations and Clinical Decision-Making and medical decision-making and Primary Health Care/methods and advance directives and advance care planning and Advance Care Planning/*standards and substance use disorders (SUDs) and Substance-Related Disorders/psychology/*therapy,NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The CCS portion of Step 3 is unique in that examinees are exposed to interactive patient-care simulations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the following study is to investigate whether the type and length of examinees' postgraduate training impacts performance on the CCS component of Step 3, consistent with previous research on overall Step 3 performance. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Medical school graduates from U.S. and Canadian institutions completing Step 3 for the first time between March 2007 and December 2009 (n = 40,588). METHODS: Post-graduate training was classified as either broadly focused for general areas of medicine (e.g. pediatrics) or narrowly focused for specific areas of medicine (e.g. radiology). A three-way between-subjects MANOVA was utilized to test for main and interaction effects on Step 3 and CCS scores between the demographic characteristics of the sample and type of residency. Additionally, to examine the impact of postgraduate training, CCS scores were regressed on Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores. Residuals from the resulting regressions were plotted. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in CCS scores between broadly focused (<ce><bc> = 216, <cf><83> = 17) and narrowly focused (<ce><bc>=211, <cf><83> = 16) residencies (p < 0.001). Examinees in broadly focused residencies performed better overall and as length of training increased, compared to examinees in narrowly focused residencies. Predictors of Step 1 and Step 2 CK explained 55% of overall Step 3 variability and 9% of CCS score variability. CONCLUSIONS: Factors influencing performance on the CCS component may be similar to those affecting Step 3 overall.

However, opportunistic screening for prostate cancer is still wanted by many patients and it is widely used in primary care clinics, with potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Better tools for risk assessment have been called for, to better target such opportunistic screening. Our aim was to explore perceptions about prostate cancer risk and subsequent opportunistic screening among patients who were not at increased risk of prostate cancer after a first PSA test plus a genetic lifetime risk assessment. METHODS: We undertook semi-structured patient interviews with recording and verbatim transcription of interviews. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: uncertainty of the nature of prostate cancer; perceived benefits of testing; and conflicting public health recommendations. Prostate cancer was spoken of as an inescapable risk in older age. The aphorism ""you die with it, not from it"" was prominent in the interviews but patients focused on the benefits of testing now rather than the future risks associated with treatment relating to potential overdiagnosis. Many expressed frustration with perceived mixed messages about early detection of cancer, in which on one side men feel that they are encouraged to seek medical testing to act responsibly regarding the most common cancer disease in men, and on the other side they are asked to refrain from opportunistic testing for prostate cancer. Taken together, personal risks of prostate cancer were perceived as high in spite of a normal PSA test and a genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk. CONCLUSION: Patients saw prostate cancer risk as high and increasing with age. They focused on the perceived benefit of early detection using PSA testing. It was also commonly acknowledged that most cases are indolent causing no symptoms and not shortening life expectancy. There was a frustration with mixed messages about the benefit of early detection and risk of overdiagnosis. These men's genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk did not appear to influence current intentions to get PSA testing in the future.",2018,10.1186/s12875-018-0717-6,19,1,32,eng,1471-2296,"Risk and Decision making and Cancer and Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Age Factors and Primary health care and Genetics and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Genetic Predisposition to Disease and Medical Overuse and Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood and *Early Detection of Cancer/methods and Behaviors and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics and Screening and prevention",NA,NA,2018/02/17/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: In a semi-structured interview, 21 GPs were asked to describe why they do or do not refer a patient presenting with chest pain. Interviews were taped, transcribed and qualitatively analysed. RESULTS: Histories of 21 patients were studied. Six were not referred, seven were referred to a cardiologist and eight to the emergency department. GPs' reasons for referral were background knowledge about the patient, patient's age and cost-benefit estimation, the perception of a negative attitude from the medical rescue team, recent patient contact with a cardiologist without detection of a coronary disease and the actual presentation of signs and symptoms, gut feeling, clinical examination and ECG results.

Multiple-provider prescribing, due to either fragmented care or ""doctor-shopping,"" contributes to the problem. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect of provider professional relationships on multiple-provider prescribing of benzodiazepines, using social network analytics. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of commercial healthcare claims spanning the years 2008 through 2011. Provider patient-sharing networks were modelled using social network analytics. Care team cohesion was measured using care density, defined as the ratio between the total number of patients shared by provider pairs within a patient's care team and the total number of provider pairs in the care team. Relationships within provider pairs were further quantified using a range of network metrics, including the number and proportion of patients or collaborators shared. MAIN MEASURES: The relationship between patient-sharing network metrics and the likelihood of multiple prescribing of benzodiazepines. PARTICIPANTS: Patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years who received two or more benzodiazepine prescriptions from multiple providers, with overlapping coverage of more than 14 days. RESULTS: A total of 5659 patients and 1448 provider pairs were included in our study. Among these, 1028 patients (18.2 %) received multiple prescriptions of benzodiazepines, involving 445 provider pairs (30.7 %). Patients whose providers rarely shared patients had a higher risk of being prescribed overlapping benzodiazepines; the median care density was 8.1 for patients who were prescribed overlapping benzodiazepines and 10.1 for those who were not (p < 0.0001). Provider pairs who shared a greater number of patients and collaborators were less likely to co-prescribe overlapping benzodiazepines.

Stigmatizing Language and the Transmission of Bias in the Medical Record,"P Goddu, Anna and O'Conor, Katie J. and Lanzkron, Sophie and Saheed, Mustapha O. and Saha, Somnath and Peek, Monica E. and Haywood, Carlton Jr and Beach, Mary Catherine",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Clinician bias contributes to healthcare disparities, and the language used to describe a patient may reflect that bias. Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, no studies have evaluated patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether stigmatizing language written in a patient medical record is associated with a subsequent physician-in-training's attitudes towards the patient and clinical decision-making. DESIGN: Randomized vignette study of two chart notes employing stigmatizing versus neutral language to describe the same hypothetical patient, a 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 413 physicians-in-training: medical students and residents in internal and emergency medicine programs at an urban academic medical center (54% response rate). MAIN MEASURES: Attitudes towards the hypothetical patient using the previously validated Positive Attitudes towards Sickle Cell Patients Scale (range 7-35) and pain management decisions (residents only) using two multiple-choice questions (composite range 2-7 representing intensity of pain treatment). KEY RESULTS: Exposure to the stigmatizing language note was associated with more negative attitudes towards the patient (20.6 stigmatizing vs. 25.6 neutral, p < 0.001). Furthermore, reading the stigmatizing language note was associated with less aggressive management of the patient's pain (5.56 stigmatizing vs. 6.22 neutral, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing language used in medical records to describe patients can influence subsequent physicians-in-training in terms of their attitudes towards the patient and their medication prescribing behavior. This is an important and overlooked pathway by which bias can be propagated from one clinician to another. Attention to the language used in medical records may help to promote patient-centered care and to reduce healthcare disparities for stigmatized populations.",2018,10.1007/s11606-017-4289-2,33,5,685-691,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"communication and Language and Humans and Female and Male and language and disparities and bias and Medical Records/*standards and Internship and Residency and clinical decision-making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Students, Medical/psychology and stigma and *Stereotyping and medical record",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Marshall and Sabo, Roy T. and Jiang, Vivian and Day, Teresa and Rozman, Julia S. and Kashiri, Paulette Lail and Krist, Alex H.",Annals of family medicine,"BACKGROUND: Primary care clinicians write 45% of all opioid prescriptions in the United States, but little is known about the characteristics of patients who receive them and the clinicians who prescribe opioids in primary care settings. Our study aimed to describe the patient and clinician characteristics and clinicians' perspectives of chronic opioid prescribing in primary care. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach, we completed an analysis of 2016 electronic health records from 21 primary care practices to identify patients who had received chronic opioids, which we defined as in receipt of an opioid prescription for at least 3 consecutive months. We compared those receiving chronic opioids with those not in terms of their demographics, prescribing clinician characteristics, and risk factors for opioid-related harms, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline on Opioid Prescribing for Chronic Pain. We then interviewed 16 primary care clinicians about their perspectives on chronic opioid prescribing. RESULTS: Of 84,029 patients, 1.1% (902/84,929) received chronic opioid prescriptions. Characteristics associated with being prescribed chronic opioids include being female, being of black or African American race, and having risks for opioid-related harms, such as mental health diagnoses, substance use disorder, and concurrent benzodiazepine use. Clinicians report multiple difficulties in weaning patients from chronic opioids, including medical contraindications of nonopioid alternatives and difficulty justifying weaning by stable long-term patients. CONCLUSION: Although patients prescribed opioids in primary care have higher risks of opioid-related harms, clinicians report multiple barriers in deprescribing chronic opioids. Future studies should examine strategies to mitigate these harms and engage patients in shared decision making about their chronic opioid use.",2019,10.1370/afm.2357,17,3,200-206,eng,1544-1717 1544-1709,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Case-Control Studies and Risk Factors and Qualitative Research and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage and opiates and prescription drugs and primary care physicians",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Ann Fam Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mammography screening decisions are an exemplar of where health literacy may impact decision-making and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe informational needs and shared decision-making (SDM) experiences among women ages 40-54 who have limited health literacy and primary care providers (PCPs). DESIGN: Qualitative, in-depth interviews explored experiences with mammography counseling and SDM. PARTICIPANTS: Women ages 40-54 with limited health literacy and no history of breast cancer or mammogram in the prior 9 months were approached before a primary care visit at a Boston academic, safety-net hospital. PCPs practicing at this site were eligible for PCP interviews. APPROACH: Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A set of deductive codes for each stakeholder group was developed based on literature and the interview guide. Inductive codes were generated during codebook development. Codes were compared within and across patient and PCP interviews to create themes relevant to mammography decision-making. KEY RESULTS: The average age of 25 interviewed patients was 46.5; 18 identified as black, 3 as Hispanic, 2 as non-Hispanic white, and 2 had no recorded race or ethnicity. Of 20 PCPs, 15 were female; 12 had practiced for >5 years. Patients described a lack of technical (appropriate tests and what they do) and process (what happens during a mammogram visit) knowledge, viewing these as necessary for decision-making. PCPs were reluctant to engage patients with limited health literacy in SDM due to time constraints and feared that increased information might confuse patients or deter them from having mammograms. Both groups felt pre-visit education would facilitate mammography-related SDM during clinical visits. CONCLUSION: Both patients and PCPs perceived a need for tools to relay technical and process knowledge about mammography prior to clinical encounters to address the scope of information that patients with limited health literacy desired.",2021,10.1007/s11606-020-06213-2,36,4,938-945,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,health literacy and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care and Decision Making and Patient Participation and Early Detection of Cancer and Mammography and *Health Literacy and mammography and breast cancer and shared decision-making,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Strumilo_2016_BMCfampra,JOUR,Combined assessment of clinical and patient factors on doctors' decisions to prescribe antibiotics,"Strumilo, Julia and Chlabicz, Slawomir and Pytel-Krolczuk, Barbara and Marcinowicz, Ludmila and Rogowska-Szadkowska, Dorota and Milewska, Anna Justyna",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic overprescription is a worldwide problem. Decisions regarding antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are influenced by medical and non-medical factors. METHODS: In family medicine practices in Bialystok, Poland, family medicine residents directly observed consultations with patients with RTI symptoms. The observing residents completed a questionnaire including patient data, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, any prescribed antibiotic, and assessment of ten patient pressure factors. RESULTS: Of 1546 consultations of patients with RTIs, 54.26 % resulted in antibiotic prescription. Antibiotic prescription was strongly associated with rales (OR 26.90, 95 % CI 9.00-80.40), tonsillar exudates (OR 13.03, 95 % CI 7.10-23.80), and wheezing (OR 14.72, 95 % CI 7.70-28.10). The likelihood of antibiotic prescription was increased by a >7-day disease duration (OR 3.94, 95 % CI 2.80-5.50), purulent nasal discharge (OR 3.87, 95 % CI 2.40-6.10), starting self-medication with antibiotics (OR 4.11, 95 % CI 2.30-7.30), and direct request for antibiotics (OR 1.87, 95 % CI 1.30-2.80). Direct request not to prescribe antibiotics decreased the likelihood of receiving antibiotics (OR 0.34, 95 % CI 0.27-0.55). CONCLUSION: While clinical signs and symptoms principally impact prescribing decisions, patient factors also contribute. The most influential patient pressure factors were starting self-medication with antibiotics, and directly requesting antibiotic prescription or no antibiotic prescription. Interventions aiming to improve clinical sign and symptom interpretation and to help doctors resist direct patient pressure could be beneficial for reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.",2016,10.1186/s12875-016-0463-6,17,NA,63,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Aged and Time Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Infant, Newborn and Severity of Illness Index and Symptom Assessment and Patient Preference and *Clinical Decision-Making and Family physicians and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Diagnostic Self Evaluation and Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/*drug therapy and *Family Practice and Antimicrobial agents and Exudates and Transudates and Palatine Tonsil and Physician-patient relations and Respiratory Sounds/etiology and Respiratory tract infections and Self Medication",NA,NA,2016/06/03/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Limited research has examined factors associated with antibiotic prescribing practices in outpatient settings. The goals of this study were to explore elements influencing provider decisions to prescribe antibiotics, identify provider recommendations for interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, and inform the clinical management of patients in the outpatient environment for infections that do not require antibiotics. METHODS: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with key informants. Seventeen outpatient providers (10 medical doctors and 7 advanced care practitioners) within a large healthcare system in Charlotte, North Carolina, participated. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes. RESULTS: Primary barriers to reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing included patient education and expectations, system-level factors, and time constraints. Providers indicated they would be interested in having system-wide, evidence-based guidelines to inform their prescribing decisions and that they would also be receptive to efforts to improve their awareness of their own prescribing practices. Results further suggested that providers experience a high demand for antibiotic prescriptions; consequently, patient education around appropriate use would be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting is influenced by many pressures, including patient demand and patient satisfaction. Training on appropriate antibiotic prescribing, guideline-based decision support, feedback on prescribing practices, and patient education are recommended interventions to improve levels of appropriate prescribing.",2018,10.1186/s12875-018-0788-4,19,1,96,eng,1471-2296,"Primary care and Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Female and Male and Qualitative research and Patient Satisfaction and Decision Support Techniques and Qualitative Research and Patient Education as Topic and Ambulatory Care and Nurse Practitioners and Physicians, Family and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Clinical Decision-Making and Pediatricians and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Physician Assistants and Antibiotic prescribing and *Inappropriate Prescribing and Antibiotic prescribing decisions and Antimicrobial Stewardship and Outpatient setting and Patient antibiotic education and Patient-provider relationships",NA,NA,2018/06/23/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

A Qualitative Study of Shared Decision-Making in Lung Cancer Screening,"Melzer, Anne C. and Golden, Sara E. and Ono, Sarah S. and Datta, Santanu and Crothers, Kristina and Slatore, Christopher G.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended and required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for patients considering lung cancer screening (LCS). OBJECTIVE: We examined clinicians' communication practices and perceived barriers of SDM for LCS at three medical centers with established screening programs. DESIGN: Multicenter qualitative study of clinicians participating in LCS. APPROACH: We performed semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed and analyzed using directed content analysis, guided by a theoretical model of patient-clinician communication. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 24 clinicians including LCS coordinators (2), pulmonologists (3), and primary care providers (17), 4 of whom worked for the LCS program, a thoracic surgeon, and a radiologist. RESULTS: All clinicians agreed with the goal of SDM, to ensure the screening decision was congruent with the patient's values. The depth and type of information presented by each clinician role varied considerably. LCS coordinators presented detailed information including numeric estimates of benefit and harm. Most PCPs explained the process more generally, focusing on logistics and the high rate of nodule detection. No clinician explicitly elicited values or communication preferences. Many PCPs tailored the conversation based on their implicit understanding of patients' values and preferences, gained from past experiences. PCPs reported that time, lack of detailed personal knowledge of LCS, and patient preferences were barriers to SDM. Many clinicians perceived that a significant proportion of patients were not interested in specific percentages and preferred to receive a clinician recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that clinicians support the goal of SDM for LCS decisions but PCPs may not perform some of its elements. The lack of completion of some elements, such as PCPs' lack of in-depth information exchange, may reflect perceived patient preferences for communication. As LCS is implemented, further research is needed to support a personalized, patient-centered approach to produce better outcomes.",2020,10.1007/s11606-019-05516-3,35,2,546-553,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"communication and United States and Medicare and Humans and Aged and Decision Making and Patient Participation and Qualitative Research and *Early Detection of Cancer and shared decision-making and Decision Making, Shared and *Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis and lung cancer screening",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Race and ethnicity may affect such decision making. Few studies have described how different racial/ethnic groups experience end-of-life surrogate decision making. OBJECTIVES: To describe the self-reported experience the self-reported experience of African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic surrogate decision makers of seriously ill patients and to examine the relationship of race, ethnicity, and culture to that experience. DESIGN: Purposive sample to include racial/ethnic minorities in a qualitative study using focus group interviews. PARTICIPANTS: The participants of the study were 44 experienced, mostly female, surrogate decision makers for older veterans. APPROACH: Transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to identify major themes, with particular attention to themes that might be unique to each of the three groups. RESULTS: The experience of burden of end-of-life decision making was similar in all three groups. This burden in its medical, personal, and familial dimensions is compounded by uncertainty about prognosis and the patient's preferences. Racial/ethnic variations of responses to this burden concerned the physician-family relationship, religion and faith, and past experiences with race/ethnicity concordant versus non-concordant physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of race/ethnicity, surrogates for seriously ill patients appeared to experience increased significant, multidimensional burdens of decision making under conditions of uncertainty about a patient's preferences. This aspect of the burden of surrogate decision making may not be fully appreciated by physicians. Physicians should identify and be especially attentive to strategies used by surrogates, which may vary by race/ethnicity, to reduce the uncertainty about a patient's preferences and thus the burden of surrogate decision making to assist them in this difficult process.",2008,10.1007/s11606-007-0487-7,23,3,267-274,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Surveys and Questionnaires and Cohort Studies and Terminally Ill and *Decision Making and *Cross-Cultural Comparison and Advance Directives/trends and African Americans/psychology and Whites/psychology and Advance Care Planning/standards/*trends and Attitude to Death/*ethnology and Hispanic or Latino/psychology and Terminal Care/standards/*trends,NA,NA,2008/03//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Reschovsky_2015_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Factors Contributing to Variations in Physicians' Use of Evidence at The Point of Care: A Conceptual Model,"Reschovsky, James D. and Rich, Eugene C. and Lake, Timothy K.",Journal of general internal medicine,"There is ample evidence that many clinical decisions made by physicians are inconsistent with current and generally accepted evidence. This leads to the underuse of some efficacious diagnostic, preventive or therapeutic services, and the overuse of others of marginal or no value to the patient. Evolving new payment and delivery models place greater emphasis on the provision of evidence-based services at the point of care. However, changing physician clinical behaviors is likely to be difficult and slow. Policy makers therefore need to design interventions that are most effective in promoting greater evidence-based care. To help identify modifiable factors that can influence clinical decisions at the point of care, we present a conceptual model and literature review of physician decision making. We describe the multitude of factors--drawn from different disciplines--that have been shown to influence physician point-of-care decisions. We present a conceptual framework for organizing these factors, dividing them into patient, physician, practice site, physician organization, network, market, and public policy influences. In doing so, we review some of the literature that speak to these factors. We then identify areas where additional research is especially needed, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for health services and policy researchers to gain a better understanding of these factors, particularly those that are potentially modifiable by policymakers and organizational leaders.",2015,10.1007/s11606-015-3366-7,30 Suppl 3,Suppl 3,561-S555,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Decision Making and Health Care Reform and Models, Organizational and Practice Management, Medical and Delivery of Health Care/*methods and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Point-of-Care Systems",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Caleb",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients frequently lack decision-making ability, yet little is known about physicians' approaches to surrogate decision making. OBJECTIVE: To describe physicians' experiences with surrogate communication and decision making for hospitalized adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional written survey. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-one physicians who recently cared for adult inpatients in one academic and two community hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Key features of physicians' most recent surrogate decision-making experience, including the nature of the decision, the physician's reaction, physician-surrogate communication and physician-surrogate agreement about the best course of action. RESULTS: Nearly three fourths of physicians (73%, n = 206) had made a major decision with a surrogate during the past month. Although nearly all patients (90%) had a surrogate, physicians reported trouble contacting the surrogate in 21% of cases. Conflict was rare (5%), and a majority of physicians agreed with surrogates about the medical facts (77%), prognosis (72%) and best course of action (65%). After adjustment for patient, physician and decision characteristics, agreement about the best course of action was more common among surrogates for older patients [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.17 for each decade; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.31], ICU patients (PR = 1.40; CI 1.14-1.51) and patients who had previously discussed their wishes (PR = 1.60; CI 1.30-1.76), and less common when surrogates were difficult to contact (PR = 0.59; CI 0.29-0.92) or when the physician self-identified as Asian (PR = 0.60; CI 0.30-0.94).

How best to vet and adopt innovations is an open question. Washington State has been a leader in health care reform and is a rich laboratory for patient-centered innovations. We sought to understand the process of patient-centered care innovation undertaken by innovative health care organizations - from strategic planning to goal selection to implementation to maintenance. METHODS: We conducted key-informant interviews with executives at five health plans, five provider organizations, and ten primary care clinics in Washington State. At least two readers of each interview transcript identified themes inductively; final themes were determined by consensus. RESULTS: Innovation in patient-centered care was a strategic objective chosen by nearly every organization in this study. However, other goals were paramount: cost containment, quality improvement, and organization survival. Organizations commonly perceived effective chronic disease management and integrated health information technology as key elements for successful patient-centered care innovation. Inertia, resource deficits, fee-for-service payment, and regulatory limits on scope of practice were cited as barriers to innovation, while organization leadership, human capital, and adaptive culture facilitated innovation. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered care innovations reflected organizational perspectives: health plans emphasized cost-effectiveness while providers emphasized health care delivery processes. Health plans and providers shared many objectives, yet the two rarely collaborated to achieve them. The process of innovation is heavily dependent on organizational culture and leadership.

OBJECTIVE: To test the importance of IADL dependency as a predictor of 30-day readmissions and quantify its impact relative to other morbidities. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of the population-based Health and Retirement Study linked to Medicare claims data. Random forest was used to rank each predictor variable in terms of its ability to predict readmission. Classification and regression tree (CART) was used to identify complex multimorbidity combinations associated with high or low risk of readmission. Generalized linear regression was used to estimate the adjusted relative risk of readmission for IADL limitations. SUBJECTS: Hospitalizations of adults age 65 and older (n = 20,007), from 6617 unique subjects. MAIN MEASURES: The main outcome was 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The main predictor of interest was self-reported IADL limitation. Other key predictors were self-reported complex multimorbidity including chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, along with demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. KEY RESULTS: The overall 30-day readmission rate in the study was 16.4%. Random forest analysis ranked ADLs and IADL limitations as the two most important predictors of 30-day readmission. CART identified hospitalizations of patients with IADL limitations and diabetes as a subgroup at the highest risk of readmission (26% readmitted). Multivariable regression analyses showed that ADL limitations were associated with 1.17 (1.06-1.29) times higher risk of readmission even after adjusting for other patient covariates. Risk prediction was modest though for even the best model (AUC = 0.612). CONCLUSIONS: IADL limitations are key predictors of 30-day readmission as demonstrated using several machine learning methods.

Winthereik_2018_BMCfampra,JOUR,"Development, modelling, and pilot testing of a complex intervention to support end-of-life care provided by Danish general practitioners","Winthereik, Anna Kirstine and Neergaard, Mette Asbjoern and Jensen, Anders Bonde and Vedsted, Peter",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Most patients in end-of-life with life-threatening diseases prefer to be cared for and die at home. Nevertheless, the majority die in hospitals. GPs have a pivotal role in providing end-of-life care at patients' home, and their involvement in the palliative trajectory enhances the patient's possibility to stay at home. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot-test an intervention consisting of continuing medical education (CME) and electronic decision support (EDS) to support end-of-life care in general practice. METHODS: We developed an intervention in line with the first phases of the guidelines for complex interventions drawn up by the Medical Research Council. Phase 1 involved the development of the intervention including identification of key barriers to provision of end-of-life care for GPs and of facilitators of change. Furthermore the actual modelling of two components: CME meeting and EDS. Phase 2 focused on pilot-testing and intervention assessment by process evaluation. RESULTS: In phase 1 lack of identification of patients at the end of life and limited palliative knowledge among GPs were identified as barriers. The CME meeting and the EDS were developed. The CME meeting was a four-hour educational meeting performed by GPs and specialists in palliative care. The EDS consisted of two parts: a pop-up window for each patient with palliative needs and a list of all patients with palliative needs in the practice. The pilot testing in phase 2 showed that the CME meeting was performed as intended and 120 (14%) of the GPs in the region attended. The EDS was integrated in existing electronic records but was shut down early for external reasons; 50 (5%) GPs signed up. The pilot-testing demonstrated a need to strengthen the implementation as attending rate was low in the current set-up. CONCLUSION: We developed a complex intervention to support GPs in providing end-of-life care. The pilot-test showed general acceptance of the CME meetings. The EDS was shut down early and needs further evaluation before examining the whole intervention in a larger study, where evaluation could be based on patient-related outcomes and impact on end-of-life care.

Voigt_2016_BMCfampra,JOUR,Why do family doctors prescribe potentially inappropriate medication to elderly patients?,"Voigt, Karen and Gottschall, Mandy and Koberlein-Neu, Juliane and Schubel, Jeannine and Quint, Nadine and Bergmann, Antje",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Based on changes in pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in elderly patients, there are potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) that should be avoided in patients aged <e2><89><a5> 65 years. Current studies showed prescription rates of PIM between 22.5 and 28.4 % in the primary care setting. The evidence concerning reasons for PIM prescription by FPs is limited. METHODS: This mixed method study consisted of three research parts: 1) semi-standardized content analysis of patients' records, 2) qualitative interviews with FPs using a) open questions and b) selected patient-specific case vignettes and 3) qualitative interviews with FPs' medical assistants. The integration of qualitative interviews was used to explain the quantitative results (triangulation design). PIM were identified according to the German PRISCUS list. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis was done using SPSS 22.0. Qualitative content analysis of interviews was used to classify the content of the interviews for indicating pertinent categories. All data were pseudonymously recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Content analysis of 1846 patients' records and interviews with 7 related FPs were conducted. Elderly patients [n = 1241, mean age: 76, females: 56.6 %] were characterized in average by 8.3 documented chronic diagnosis. 23.9 % of elderly patients received at least one PIM prescription. Sedatives/hypnotics were the most frequent prescribed PIM-drugs (13.7 %). Mental disorders, gender and number of long-term medication were detected as predictors for the probability of a PIM prescription. Common reported reasons for PIM prescription by FPs concerned limited knowledge regarding PIM, limited applicability of PIM lists in daily practice, lack of time, having no alternatives in medication, stronger patient-related factors than age that influence prescription, own bad experiences regarding changes of medication or refusal of following prescriptions of sedative/hypnotics. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to see FPs in a complex decision making situation with several influencing factors on their prescribing, including: patient-oriented prioritization, FPs' experiences in daily practice, FPs' knowledge regarding existing recommendations and their trust in it and organizational characteristics of FPs' daily medical practice. These pros and cons of PIM prescription in elderly patients should be considered in FPs' advanced training.",2016,10.1186/s12875-016-0482-3,17,NA,93,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Time Factors and Chronic Disease and Sex Factors and Risk Factors and Comorbidity and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Polypharmacy and Clinical Competence and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Family doctor and Family Practice/*statistics & numerical data and Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic use and Inappropriate Prescribing/*statistics & numerical data and Mental Disorders/drug therapy and Mixed methods and Potentially inappropriate medication",NA,NA,2016/07/22/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

PARTICIPANTS: We utilized a purposeful sample of African-American adult patients with diabetes. All patients had insurance and received their care at an academic medical center. RESULTS: Patients identified multiple SDM barriers/facilitators, including the patient/provider power imbalance that was perceived to be exacerbated by race. Patient-related factors included health literacy, fear/denial, family experiences and self-efficacy. Reported physician-related barriers/facilitators include patient education, validating patient experiences, medical knowledge, accessibility and availability, and interpersonal skills. DISCUSSION: Barriers/facilitators of SDM exist among African-Americans with diabetes, which can be effectively addressed in the outpatient setting. Primary care physicians, particularly academic internists, may be uniquely situated to address these barriers/facilitators and train future physicians to do so as well.",2009,10.1007/s11606-009-1047-0,24,10,1135-1139,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and *Decision Making and *Physician-Patient Relations and Patient Education as Topic/methods and Interviews as Topic/methods and *Patient Participation/methods/psychology and African Americans/*ethnology/psychology and Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/psychology/therapy,NA,NA,2009/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Streit_2015_BMCfampra,JOUR,Clinical and haematological predictors of antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in adults in Swiss practices--an observational study,"Streit, Sven and Frey, Peter and Singer, Sarah and Bollag, Ueli and Meli, Damian N.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Acute cough is a common problem in general practice and is often caused by a self-limiting, viral infection. Nonetheless, antibiotics are often prescribed in this situation, which may lead to unnecessary side effects and, even worse, the development of antibiotic resistant microorganisms worldwide. This study assessed the role of point-of-care C-reactive protein (CRP) testing and other predictors of antibiotic prescription in patients who present with acute cough in general practice. METHODS: Patient characteristics, symptoms, signs, and laboratory and X-ray findings from 348 patients presenting to 39 general practitioners with acute cough, as well as the GPs themselves, were recorded by fourth-year medical students during their three-week clerkships in general practice. Patient and clinician characteristics of those prescribed and not-prescribed antibiotics were compared using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Of 315 patients included in the study, 22% were prescribed antibiotics. The two groups of patients, those prescribed antibiotics and those treated symptomatically, differed significantly in age, demand for antibiotics, days of cough, rhinitis, lung auscultation, haemoglobin level, white blood cell count, CRP level and the GP's license to self-dispense antibiotics. After regression analysis, only the CRP level, the white blood cell count and the duration of the symptoms were statistically significant predictors of antibiotic prescription. CONCLUSIONS: The antibiotic prescription rate of 22% in adult patients with acute cough in the Swiss primary care setting is low compared to other countries. GPs appear to use point-of-care CRP testing in addition to the duration of clinical symptoms to help them decide whether or not to prescribe antibiotics.",2015,10.1186/s12875-015-0226-9,16,NA,15,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Logistic Models and Switzerland and *Decision Making and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *General Practitioners and Point-of-Care Testing and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Leukocyte Count and General Practice and C-Reactive Protein/*analysis and Cough/*drug therapy",NA,NA,2015/02/06/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Brass_2009_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Basic biomedical sciences and the future of medical education: implications for internal medicine,"Brass, Eric P.",Journal of general internal medicine,"The academic model of medical education in the United States is facing substantial challenges. Apprenticeship experiences with clinical faculty are increasingly important in most medical schools and residency programs. This trend threatens to separate clinical education from the scientific foundations of medical practice. Paradoxically, this devaluation of biomedical science is occurring as the ability to use new discoveries to rationalize clinical decision making is rapidly expanding. Understanding the scientific foundations of medical practice and the ability to apply them in the care of patients separates the physician from other health care professionals. The de-emphasis of biomedical science in medical education poses particular dangers for the future of internal medicine as the satisfaction derived from the application of science to the solving of a clinical problem has been a central attraction of the specialty. Internists should be engaged in the ongoing discussions of medical education reform and provide a strong voice in support of rigorous scientific training for the profession.",2009,10.1007/s11606-009-0998-5,24,11,1251-1254,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Biomedical Research/methods/trends and Biological Science Disciplines/methods/*trends and Education, Medical/methods/*trends and Internal Medicine/*education/methods/*trends and Schools, Medical/*trends",NA,NA,2009/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hsieh_2015_Joofgeinme,JOUR,"Not just ""getting by"": factors influencing providers' choice of interpreters","Hsieh, Elaine",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Providers consistently underutilize professional interpreters in healthcare settings even when they perceive benefits to using professional interpreters and when professional interpreters are readily available. Little is known about providers' decision-making processes that shape their use of interpreters. OBJECTIVE: To understand the variety of considerations and parameters that influence providers' decisions regarding interpreters. DESIGN: A qualitative, semi-structured interview guide was used to explore providers' decision making about interpreter use. The author conducted 8 specialty-specific focus groups and 14 individual interviews, each lasting 60-90 minutes. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine healthcare professionals were recruited from five specialties (i.e., nursing, mental health, emergency medicine, oncology, and obstetrics-gynecology) in a large academic medical center characterized as having ""excellent"" interpreter services. APPROACH: Audio-recorded interviews and focus groups were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory to develop a theoretical framework for providers' decision-making processes. KEY RESULTS: Four factors influence providers' choice of interpreters: (a) time constraints, (b) alliances of care, (c) therapeutic objectives, and (d) organizational-level considerations. The findings highlight (a) providers' calculated use of interpreters and interpreting modalities, (b) the complexity of the functions and impacts of time in providers' decision-making process, and (c) the importance of organizational structures and support for appropriate and effective interpreter utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Providers actively engage in calculated use of professional interpreters, employing specific factors in their decision-making processes. Providers' understanding of time is complex and multidimensional, including concerns about disruptions to their schedules, overburdening others' workloads, and clinical urgency of patient condition, among others. When providers make specific choices due to time pressure, they are influenced by interpersonal, organizational, therapeutic, and ethical considerations. Organizational resources and guidelines need to be consistent with institutional policies and professional norms; otherwise, providers risk making flawed assessments about the effective and appropriate use of interpreters in bilingual health care.",2015,10.1007/s11606-014-3066-8,30,1,75-82,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Specialization and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Communication Barriers and Focus Groups and Multilingualism and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Choice Behavior and *Translating and Oklahoma,NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wurth_2018_Joofgeinme,JOUR,"""Getting by"" in a Swiss Tertiary Hospital: the Inconspicuous Complexity of Decision-making Around Patients' Limited Language Proficiency","Wurth, Kristina Maria and Reiter-Theil, Stella and Langewitz, Wolf and Schuster, Sylvie",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: While the need to address language barriers to provide quality care for all is generally accepted, little is known about the complexities of decision-making around patients' limited language proficiency in everyday clinical encounters. OBJECTIVE: To understand how linguistic complexities shape cross-cultural encounters by incorporating the perspective of both, patients and physicians. DESIGN: A qualitative hospital study with semi-structured interviews and participant-observation in a Swiss University Hospital. Thirty-two encounters were observed and 94 interviews conducted. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients of Turkish and 16 of Albanian origin and all actors (administration, nurses, physicians, if required, interpreters) involved in the patients' entire process. MAIN APPROACH: Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic content analysis was conducted using MAXQDA. For reporting, the COREQ guidelines were used. KEY RESULTS: Three themes were relevant to patients and physicians alike: Assessment of the language situation, the use of interpreters, and dealing with conversational limits. Physicians tend to assess patients' language proficiency by their body language, individual demeanor, or adequacy of responses to questions. Physicians use professional interpreters for ""high-stakes"" conversations, and ""get by"" through ""low-stakes"" topics by resorting to bilingual family members, for example. Patients are driven by factors like fearing costs or the wish to manage on their own. High acceptance of conversational limits by patients and physicians alike stands in stark contrast to the availability of interpreters. CONCLUSIONS: The decision for or against interpreter use in the ""real world"" of clinical care is complex and shaped by small, frequently inconspicuous decisions with potential for suboptimal health care. Physicians occupy a key position in the decision-making to initiate the process of medical interpreting. The development and testing of a conceptual framework close to practice is crucial for guiding physicians' assessment of patients' language proficiency and their decision-making on the use of interpreting services.",2018,10.1007/s11606-018-4618-0,33,11,1885-1891,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,decision-making and communication and Humans and Female and Male and ethics and qualitative research and *Physician-Patient Relations and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and Switzerland/epidemiology and *Communication Barriers and *Tertiary Care Centers and Culturally Competent Care/*ethnology/*methods and language barriers,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lin_2008_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Why physicians favor use of percutaneous coronary intervention to medical therapy: a focus group study,"Lin, Grace A. and Dudley, R. Adams and Redberg, Rita F.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed in many patients with stable coronary artery disease, despite evidence of little clinical benefit over optimal medical therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine physicians' beliefs, practices, and decision-making regarding elective PCI. DESIGN: Six focus groups, three with primary care physicians and three with cardiologists. Participants discussed PCI using hypothetical case scenarios. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory, and commonly expressed themes regarding the decision-making pathway to PCI were identified. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight primary care physicians and 20 interventional and non-interventional cardiologists in Butte County, Orange County, and San Francisco Bay Area, California, in 2006. RESULTS: A number of factors led primary care physicians to evaluate non-symptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients for coronary artery disease and refer them to a cardiologist. The use of screening tests often led to additional testing and referral, as well as fear of missing a coronary stenosis, perceived patient expectations, and medicolegal concerns. The end result was a cascade such that any positive test would generally lead to the catheterization lab, where an ""oculostenotic reflex"" made PCI a virtual certainty. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread use of PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease--despite evidence of little benefit in outcomes over medical therapy--may in part be due to psychological and emotional factors leading to a cascade effect wherein testing leads inevitably to PCI. Determining how to help physicians better incorporate evidence-based medicine into decision-making has important implications for patient outcomes and the optimal use of new technologies.",2008,10.1007/s11606-008-0706-x,23,9,1458-1463,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Cardiology and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Referral and Consultation and Focus Groups and Physicians, Family and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/*statistics & numerical data and Coronary Artery Disease/drug therapy/*therapy and Stents/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2008/09//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Berg_2009_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Providers' experiences treating chronic pain among opioid-dependent drug users,"Berg, Karina M. and Arnsten, Julia H. and Sacajiu, Galit and Karasz, Alison",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Successful management of chronic pain with opioid medications requires balancing opioid dependence and addiction with pain relief and restoration of function. Evaluating these risks and benefits is difficult among patients with chronic pain and pre-existing addiction, and the ambiguity is increased for patients on methadone maintenance therapy for opioid dependence. Providers treating both chronic pain and addiction routinely make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, but decision-making strategies in this context have not been well described. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was twofold. We sought first to explore providers' perceptions of ambiguity, and then to examine their strategies for making diagnostic and treatment decisions to manage chronic pain among patients on methadone maintenance therapy. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed health-care providers delivering integrated medical care and substance abuse treatment to patients in a methadone maintenance program. RESULTS: Providers treating pain and co-morbid addiction described ambiguity in all diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To cope with this inherent ambiguity, most providers adopted one of two decision-making frameworks, which determined clinical behavior. One framework prioritized addiction treatment by emphasizing the destructive consequences of abusing illicit drugs or prescription medications; the other prioritized pain management by focusing on the destructive consequences of untreated pain. Identification with a decision-making framework shaped providers' experiences, including their treatment goals, perceptions of treatment risks, pain management strategies, and tolerance of ambiguity. Adherence to one of these two frameworks led to wide variation in pain management practices, which created tension among providers. CONCLUSIONS: Providers delivering integrated medical care and substance abuse treatment to patients in a methadone maintenance program found tremendous ambiguity in the management of chronic pain. Most providers adopted one of the two divergent heuristic frameworks we identified, which resulted in significant variations in pain management. To reduce variation and determine best practices, studies should examine clinically relevant endpoints, including pain, illicit drug use, prescription drug abuse, and functional status. Until then, providers managing chronic pain in patients with co-morbid addiction should attempt to reduce tension by acknowledging ambiguity and engaging in open discourse.",2009,10.1007/s11606-009-0908-x,24,4,482-488,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Chronic Disease and Decision Making and Methadone/therapeutic use and Pain/*drug therapy and Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/methods and Opioid-Related Disorders/*complications",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Price.Haywood_2014_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Comparative effectiveness of audit-feedback versus additional physician communication training to improve cancer screening for patients with limited health literacy,"Price-Haywood, Eboni G. and Harden-Barrios, Jewel and Cooper, Lisa A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: We designed a continuing medical education (CME) program to teach primary care physicians (PCP) how to engage in cancer risk communication and shared decision making with patients who have limited health literacy (HL). OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether training PCPs, in addition to audit-feedback, improves their communication behaviors and increases cancer screening among patients with limited HL to a greater extent than only providing clinical performance feedback. DESIGN: Four-year cluster randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen PCPs and 168 patients with limited HL who were overdue for colorectal/breast/cervical cancer screening. INTERVENTIONS: Communication intervention PCPs received skills training that included standardized patient (SP) feedback on counseling behaviors. All PCPs underwent chart audits of patients' screening status semiannually up to 24 months and received two annual performance feedback reports. MAIN MEASURES: PCPs experienced three unannounced SP encounters during which SPs rated PCP communication behaviors. We examined between-group differences in changes in SP ratings and patient knowledge of cancer screening guidelines over 12 months; and changes in patient cancer screening rates over 24 months. KEY RESULTS: There were no group differences in SP ratings of physician communication at baseline. At follow-up, communication intervention PCPs were rated higher in general communication about cancer risks and shared decision making related to colorectal cancer screening compared to PCPs who only received performance feedback. Screening rates increased among patients of PCPs in both groups; however, there were no between-group differences in screening rates except for mammography. The communication intervention did not improve patient cancer screening knowledge. CONCLUSION: Compared to audit and feedback alone, including PCP communication training increases PCP patient-centered counseling behaviors, but not cancer screening among patients with limited HL. Larger studies must be conducted to determine whether lack of changes in cancer screening were due to clinic/patient sample size versus ineffectiveness of communication training to change outcomes.",2014,10.1007/s11606-014-2782-4,29,8,1113-1121,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Follow-Up Studies and *Communication and Cluster Analysis and *Physician-Patient Relations and Feedback, Psychological and Early Detection of Cancer/methods/*standards and Education, Medical, Continuing/methods/*standards and Health Literacy/methods/*standards and Medical Audit/methods/*standards",NA,NA,2014/08//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Alexander_2015_BMCfampra,JOUR,The challenges of trying to increase preventive healthcare for children in general practice: results of a feasibility study,"Alexander, Karyn E. and Brijnath, Bianca and Mazza, Danielle",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, general practice, the linchpin for delivery of preventive health care to large segments of the population, provides child-immunisation and preventive health alongside government services. Despite this, less than half of eligible children complete a Healthy Kids Check (HKC), a preschool preventative health assessment available since 2008. Using a rigorous theoretical process, the barriers that affected delivery and reduced general practitioner and practice nurse motivation to provide HKCs, were addressed. The resulting multifaceted intervention, aimed at increasing the proportion of children receiving evidence informed HKCs from general practice, was piloted to inform a future randomised controlled trial. METHODS: The intervention was piloted in a before and after study at three sites located southeast of Melbourne, between February and October 2014. The HKC-intervention involved: 1) Delivery of training modules that motivated reception and clinical staff by delivering key messages about local prevalence rates and the ""Core Story of Child Development"" 2) Practical advice to prepare clinics for specific HKC-examinations 3) Workflow advice regarding systems that included all staff in the HKC process, and 4) Provision of a ""Community Resources Folder"" that enabled decision making and referrals. A major component of the intervention incorporated the promotion of structured developmental screening by the practice team using Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status. RESULTS: Twenty of 22 practitioners and practice managers agreed to join the study. Post-training questionnaires showed participants had developed their skills working with young children as a result of the training and all respondents believed they had successfully implemented standardised HKC services. Post intervention proportions of children completing HKCs significantly increased in two of the practices and quality improvements in HKC-processes were recorded across all three sites. CONCLUSION: This pilot study confirmed the feasibility of delivering a multi-faceted intervention to increase HKCs from general practice and demonstrated that significant quality improvements could be made.

The goals of a medical test review are to identify and synthesize evidence to evaluate the impacts alternative testing strategies on health outcomes and to promote informed decision making.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether primary care providers (PCPs) are less likely to endorse directive counsel for morally controversial medical decisions than for typical ones and to identify predictors of endorsing directive counsel in such situations. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Surveys were mailed to two separate national samples of practicing primary care physicians. Survey 1 was conducted from 2009 to 2010 on 1,504 PCPs; Survey 2 was conducted from 2010 to 2011 on 1,058 PCPs. MAIN MEASURES: Survey 1: After randomization, half of the PCPs were asked if physicians should encourage patients to make the decision that the physician believes is best (directive counsel) with respect to ""typical"" medical decisions and half were asked the same question with respect to ""morally controversial"" medical decisions. Survey 2: After reading a vignette in which a patient asked for palliative sedation to unconsciousness, PCPs were asked whether it would be appropriate for the patient's physician to encourage the patient to make the decision the physician believes is best. KEY RESULTS: Of 1,427 eligible physicians, 896 responded to Survey 1 (63 %). Physicians asked about morally controversial decisions were half as likely (35 % vs. 65 % for typical decisions, p < 0.001) to endorse directive counsel.

The objective of this study was to estimate the 12-month cumulative incidence and predictors of a positive screen for depressive symptoms on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) among primary care patients with no history of physician-diagnosed depression. METHODS: We monitored a cohort of 2,929 adult primary care patients with no past history of physician-diagnosed depression and with baseline PHQ-9 scores of 9 or lower by telephone interview at 3, 6, and 12 months. A generalized linear mixed effects Poisson Model was used to explore factors associated with the incidence of PHQ-positive symptoms. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of positive screening on the PHQ-9 over 12 months was 5.23% (95% CI, 3.83%-6.64%). Positive predictors included being female, coming from a lower-income household, being a smoker, having at least 2 comorbidities, having a family history of depression, and having consulted a physician at least twice in the past 4 weeks. Consulting a physician with qualifications in both family medicine and psychological medicine was a negative predictor. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of PHQ-9-screened depressive symptoms in this study population was higher than those reported for depressive disorders in earlier systematic reviews.

Despite abundant research on decision-making, we have no direct research on how accurately patients envision their future well-being and how this influences their decisions. Outside medicine, psychological research on ""affective forecasting"" consistently shows that people poorly predict their future ability to adapt to adversity. This finding is important for medicine, since many serious health decisions hinge on quality-of-life judgments. We describe three specific mechanisms for affective forecasting errors that may influence health decisions: focalism, in which people focus more on what will change than on what will stay the same; immune neglect, in which they fail to envision how their own coping skills will lessen their unhappiness; and failure to predict adaptation, in which people fail to envision shifts in what they value. We discuss emotional and social factors that interact with these cognitive biases.

DuBenske_2018_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Key Elements of Mammography Shared Decision-Making: a Scoping Review of the Literature,"DuBenske, Lori L. and Schrager, Sarina B. and Hitchcock, Mary E. and Kane, Amanda K. and Little, Terry A. and McDowell, Helene E. and Burnside, Elizabeth S.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: New guidelines recommend shared decision-making (SDM) for women and their clinician in consideration of breast cancer screening, particularly for women ages 35-50 where guidelines for routine mammography are controversial. A number of models offer general guidelines for SDM across clinical practice, yet they do not offer specific guidance about conducting SDM in mammography. We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify the key elements of breast cancer screening SDM and synthesize these key elements for utilization by primary care clinicians. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus); PsycInfo, PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and SocIndex databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were original studies from peer-reviewed publications (from 2009 or later) reporting breast cancer screening (mammography), medical decision-making, and patient-centered care. Study populations needed to include female patients 18+ years of age facing a real-life breast cancer screening decision. Article findings were specific to shared decision-making and/or use of a decision aid. Data extracted includes study design, population, setting, intervention, and critical findings related to breast cancer screening SDM elements. Scoping analysis includes descriptive analysis of study features and content analysis to identify the SDM key elements. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles were retained. Three thematic categories of key elements emerged from the extracted elements: information delivery/patient education (specific content and delivery modes), interpersonal clinician-patient communication (aspects of interpersonal relationship impacting SDM), and framework of the decision (sociocultural factors beyond direct SDM deliberation). A number of specific breast cancer screening SDM elements relevant to primary care clinical practice are delineated. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the importance of the relationship between the patient and clinician and the necessity of spelling out each step in the SDM process. The clinician needs to be explicit in telling a woman that she has a choice about whether to get a mammogram and the benefits and harms of screening mammography. Finally, clinicians need to be aware of sociocultural factors that can influence their relationships and their patients' decision-making processes and attempt to identify and address these factors.",2018,10.1007/s11606-018-4576-6,33,10,1805-1814,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and primary care and patient-centered care and health communication and *Decision Making and Clinical Decision-Making and mammography and breast cancer screening and Breast Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging and Patient Education as Topic/methods and Primary Health Care/methods and shared decision-making and Patient-Centered Care/methods and Patient Participation/psychology and Early Detection of Cancer/methods/psychology and Mammography/*psychology and women's health,NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the purpose of our study, non-medical refers to all of the factors-other than the patient's clinical condition-that could potentially influence admission decisions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the influence of non-medical factors on physicians' decisions to admit non-critically ill patients presenting to the ED. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of hospital admissions at a single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Non-critically ill adult patients admitted to the hospital (n = 297) and the admitting emergency medicine physicians (n = 34). MAIN MEASURES: A patient survey assessed non-medical factors, including primary care access and utilization. A physician survey assessed clinical and non-medical factors influencing the decision to admit. Based on physician responses, admissions were characterized as ""strongly acuity-driven,"" ""moderately acuity-driven,"" or ""weakly acuity-driven."" Among these admission types, we compared length of stay, cost, and readmission within 30 days to the hospital or ED. KEY RESULTS: Based on the admitting physician's assessment, we categorized the motivation for admission as strongly acuity-driven in 185 (62 %) admissions, moderately acuity-driven in 92 (31 %), and weakly acuity-driven in 20 (7 %). Per the physician surveys, 51 % of hospitalizations were strongly or moderately influenced by one or more non-medical factors, including lack of information about baseline conditions (23 %); inadequate access to outpatient specialty care (14 %); need for a diagnostic testing or procedure (12 %); a recent ED visit (11 %); and inadequate access to primary care (10 %). Compared with strongly-acuity driven admissions, admissions that were moderately or weakly acuity-driven were shorter and less costly but were associated with similar rates of ED (35 %) and hospital (27 %) readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Non-medical factors are influential in the admission decisions for many patients presenting to the emergency department. Moderately and weakly acuity-driven admissions may represent a feasible target for alternative care pathways.",2016,10.1007/s11606-015-3438-8,31,1,37-44,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Time Factors and decision making and utilization and health care delivery and socioeconomic factors and Incidence and Critical Illness and access to care and United States/epidemiology and *Surveys and Questionnaires and medical decision making and emergency medicine and Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data and Patient Admission/*trends and Academic Medical Centers/statistics & numerical data and Acute Disease/epidemiology/*therapy and care transitions and hospital admission decision and non-medical factors and severity of illness",NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to examine relationships between electronic medical knowledge resource use, practice characteristics and examination scores among physicians recertifying in internal medicine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,958 United States physicians who took the Internal Medicine Maintenance of Certification Examination (IM-MOCE) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008, and who held individual licenses to one or both of two large electronic knowledge resource programs. We examined associations between physicians' IM-MOCE scores and their days of electronic resource use, practice type (private practice, residency teaching clinic, inpatient, nursing home), practice model (single or multi-specialty), sex, age, and medical school location. RESULTS: In the 365 days prior to the IM-MOCE, physicians used electronic resources on a mean (SD, range) of 20.3 (36.5, 0-265) days. In multivariate analyses, the number of days of resource use was independently associated with increased IM-MOCE scores (0.07-point increase per day of use, p = 0.02). Increased age was associated with decreased IM-MOCE scores (1.8-point decrease per year of age, p < 0.001). Relative to physicians working in private practice settings, physicians working in residency teaching clinics and hospital inpatient practices had higher IM-MOCE scores by 29.1 and 20.0 points, respectively (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent use of electronic resources was associated with modestly enhanced IM-MOCE performance.

Despite its impact on health care utilization, costs and error, measurement of diagnostic uncertainty is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review to describe how diagnostic uncertainty is defined and measured in medical practice. METHODS: We searched OVID Medline and PsycINFO databases from inception until May 2017 using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Additional search strategies included manual review of references identified in the primary search, use of a topic-specific database (AHRQ-PSNet) and expert input. We specifically focused on articles that (1) defined diagnostic uncertainty; (2) conceptualized diagnostic uncertainty in terms of its sources, complexity of its attributes or strategies for managing it; or (3) attempted to measure diagnostic uncertainty. KEY RESULTS: We identified 123 articles for full review, none of which defined diagnostic uncertainty. Three attributes of diagnostic uncertainty were relevant for measurement: (1) it is a subjective perception experienced by the clinician; (2) it has the potential to impact diagnostic evaluation-for example, when inappropriately managed, it can lead to diagnostic delays; and (3) it is dynamic in nature, changing with time. Current methods for measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice include: (1) asking clinicians about their perception of uncertainty (surveys and qualitative interviews), (2) evaluating the patient-clinician encounter (such as by reviews of medical records, transcripts of patient-clinician communication and observation), and (3) experimental techniques (patient vignette studies). CONCLUSIONS: The term ""diagnostic uncertainty"" lacks a clear definition, and there is no comprehensive framework for its measurement in medical practice. Based on review findings, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as a ""subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem."" Methodological advancements in measuring diagnostic uncertainty can improve our understanding of diagnostic decision-making and inform interventions to reduce diagnostic errors and overuse of health care resources.",2018,10.1007/s11606-017-4164-1,33,1,103-115,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and review and measurement and *Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Uncertainty and Delivery of Health Care/methods/*standards and diagnostic process and definition and diagnostic uncertainty and Medicine/methods/*standards,NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To identify rates of, characterize associations with, and explore physician decision-making around potentially preventable admissions. DESIGN: A comparative cohort study was used to determine rates of potentially preventable admissions and to identify associated factors and patient outcomes. A qualitative case study was used to explore physicians' clinical decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) to the general medicine (GM) service over a total of 4 weeks were included as cases (N = 401). Physicians from both emergency medicine (EM) and GM that were involved in the cases were included (N = 82). APPROACH: Physicians categorized admissions as potentially preventable. We examined differences in patient characteristics, admission characteristics, and patient outcomes between potentially preventable and control admissions. Interviews with participating physicians were conducted and transcribed. Transcriptions were systematically analyzed for key concepts regarding potentially preventable admissions. KEY RESULTS: EM and GM physicians categorized 22.2% (90/401) of admissions as potentially preventable. There were no significant differences between potentially preventable and control admissions in patient or admission characteristics. Potentially preventable admissions had shorter length of stay (2.1 vs. 3.6 days, p < 0.001). There was no difference in other patient outcomes. Physicians discussed several provider, system, and patient factors that affected clinical decision-making around potentially preventable admissions, particularly in the ""gray zone,"" including risk of deterioration at home, the risk of hospitalization, the cost to the patient, and the presence of outpatient resources. Differences in provider training, risk assessment, and provider understanding of outpatient access accounted for differences in decisions between EM and GM physicians.

Laue_2017_BMCfampra,JOUR,Self-treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requires more than symptom recognition - a qualitative study of COPD patients' perspectives on self-treatment,"Laue, Johanna and Melbye, Hasse and Risor, Mette Bech",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Self-treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce hospitalization rates, mortality and health costs. However, for reasons little understood, the effect of self-treatment, particularly when not part of comprehensive self-management programs, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to get insight into the patients' perspective on self-treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, focusing specifically on how patients decide for the right moment to start treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids, what they consider important when making this decision and aspects which might interfere with successful implementation. METHODS: We interviewed 19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using qualitative semi-structured interviews, and applied thematic analysis for data analysis. RESULTS: Patients were well equipped with experiential knowledge to recognize and promptly respond to worsening COPD symptoms. Worries regarding potential adverse effects of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids played an important role in the decision to start treatment and could result in hesitation to start treatment. Although self-treatment represented a practical and appreciated option for some patients with predictable symptom patterns and treatment effect, all patients favoured assistance from a medical professional when their perceived competence reached its limits. However, a feeling of obligation to succeed with self-treatment or distrust in their doctors or the health care system could keep patients from timely help seeking. CONCLUSION: COPD patients regard self-treatment of exacerbations with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids as a valuable alternative. How they engage in self-treatment depends on their concerns regarding the medications' adverse effects as well as on their understanding of and preferences for self-treatment as a means of health care. Caregivers should address these perspectives in a collaborative approach when offering COPD patients the opportunity for self-treatment of exacerbations.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0582-8,18,1,8,eng,1471-2296,"Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Qualitative Research and Disease Progression and *Decision Making and *Self Care and *Attitude to Health and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Patient perspective and COPD and Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*therapeutic use and Exacerbations and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis/*drug therapy and Self-treatment",NA,NA,2017/01/25/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how often specific treatments are withdrawn or withheld before death and to describe the associated patient, physician, and care characteristics. DESIGN: National mortality follow-back study in Switzerland in 2013/2014 using a standardized survey to collect information on the patient's end of life and demographics on the physician. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of adults who died non-suddenly without an external cause and who had met the physician completing the survey (N = 3051). MAIN MEASURES: Any of nine specific treatments was continued until death, withdrawn, or withheld. KEY RESULTS: In 2242 cases (84%), at least one treatment was either continued until death or withheld or withdrawn. The most common treatment was artificial hydration, which was continued in 23%, withdrawn in 4%, and withheld in 22% of all cases. The other eight treatments were withdrawn or withheld in 70-94% of applicable cases. The impact of physician characteristics was limited, but artificial hydration, antibiotics, artificial nutrition, and ventilator therapy were more likely to be withheld at home and in nursing homes than in the hospitals.

Riis_2019_BMCfampra,JOUR,A conceptual framework for increasing clinical staff member involvement in general practice: a proposed strategy to improve the management of low back pain,"Riis, Allan and Karran, Emma L. and Hill, Jonathan C. and Jensen, Martin B. and Thomsen, Janus L.",BMC family practice,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain affects about 80% of all adults, many of whom consult general practice. Providing management can be challenging, in part due to the scarcity of effective treatment methods. There is broad consensus in international clinical practice guidelines to provide patients with information about the nature of their pain and recommend them to stay active despite discomfort. Delivering this information is time-demanding and challenged by the limited available resources in general practice in many countries. Furthermore, general practice settings are highly variable in size and in their composition of clinical staff members - which presents difficulties, but also opportunities for developing alternative approaches to clinical management. Expanding the patient consultation time by involving clinical staff members (aside from the general practitioner) has been found feasible for other conditions. We propose that this approach is applied for non-specific low back pain. Consequently, we suggest the involvement of clinical staff members as part of a new strategy for managing low back pain in general practice. MAIN TEXT: Multifaceted implementation strategies have the potential to effectively enable change in the clinical management of patients with low back pain in general practice if they are based on theory and are tailored to stake holders. Inspired by the Medical Research Council's guidance for complex interventions and the ChiPP (Change in professional performance) statement, we suggest applying the following two policy categories: organizational change (environmental/social planning) and service provision. This will involve attention to environmental restructuring, modelling, enabling, education, training, persuasion, and incentivising of general practices, with an over-arching strategy of involving clinical staff members in the management of low back pain. CONCLUSION: This is a pre-clinical proposal of a multifaceted strategy to support the delivery of evidence-based treatment for patients with low back pain in general practice. As an original idea, we suggest it would be feasible to involve clinical staff members in the delivery of information and advice to patients, whilst the general practitioner remains responsible for diagnostic decision-making.",2019,10.1186/s12875-019-0923-x,20,1,30,eng,1471-2296,General practice and Humans and Organizational Innovation and Implementation and Organizational change and Exercise and Patient Education as Topic and General Practitioners and *Physician's Role and *Self-Management and *Nurse's Role and General Practice/methods/*organization & administration and Low back pain and Low Back Pain/*therapy,NA,NA,2019/02/21/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, general practitioners (GPs) face many difficulties when initiating appropriate discussion on proactive shared palliative care. Anticipating palliative care is increasingly important given the ageing population and is an aim shared by many countries. We aimed to examine how French GPs approached and provided at-home palliative care. We inquired about their strategy for delivering care, and the skills and resources they used to devise new care strategies. METHODS: Twenty-one GPs from the South of France recruited by phone according to their various experiences of palliative care agreed to participate. Semi-structured interview transcripts were examined using a phenomenological approach inspired by Grounded theory, and further studied with semiopragmatic analysis. RESULTS: Offering palliative care was perceived by GPs as a moral obligation. They felt vindicated in a process rooted in the paradigm values of their profession. This study results in two key findings: firstly, their patient-centred approach facilitated the anticipatory discussions of any potential event or intervention, which the GPs openly discussed with patients and their relatives; secondly, this approach contributed to build an ""end-of-life project"" meeting patients' wishes and needs. The GPs all shared the idea that the end-of-life process required human presence and recommended that at-home care be coordinated and shared by multi-professional referring teams. CONCLUSIONS: The main tenets of palliative care as provided by GPs are a patient-centred approach in the anticipatory discussion of potential events, personalized follow-up with referring multi-professional teams, and the collaborative design of an end-of-life project meeting the aspirations of the patient and his or her family. Consequently, coordination strategies involving specialized teams, GPs and families should be modelled according to the specificities of each care system.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0602-8,18,1,27,eng,1471-2296,"General practice and Humans and Female and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Palliative care and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and France and Patient Participation/*statistics & numerical data and Home Care Services/*organization & administration and Palliative Care/*organization & administration and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/trends and Terminal Care/*organization & administration and General Practitioners/*ethics and Patient-centred approach and Qualitative phenomenological study and Semiopragmatic analysis",NA,NA,2017/02/23/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Bosslet, Gabriel T. and Montz, Kianna and Inger, Lev and Burke, Emily S. and Torke, Alexia M.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Many hospitalized adults do not have the capacity to make their own health care decisions and thus require a surrogate decision-maker. While the ethical standard suggests that decisions should focus on a patient's preferences, our study explores the principles that surrogates consider most important when making decisions for older hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine how frequently surrogate decision-makers prioritized patient preferences in decision-making and what factors may predict their doing so. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a secondary data analysis of a study conducted at three local hospitals that surveyed surrogate decision-makers for hospitalized patients 65 years of age and older. MAIN MEASURES: Surrogates rated the importance of 16 decision-making principles and selected the one that was most important. We divided the surrogates into two groups: those who prioritized patient preferences and those who prioritized patient well-being. We analyzed the two groups for differences in knowledge of patient preferences, presence of advance directives, and psychological outcomes. KEY RESULTS: A total of 362 surrogates rated an average of six principles as being extremely important in decision-making; 77.8% of surrogates selected a patient well-being principle as the most important, whereas only 21.1% selected a patient preferences principle. Advance directives were more common to the patient preferences group than the patient well-being group (61.3% vs. 44.9%; 95% CI: 1.01-3.18; p = 0.04), whereas having conversations with the patient about their health care preferences was not a significant predictor of surrogate group identity (81.3% vs. 67.4%; 95% CI: 0.39-1.14; p = 0.14). We found no differences between the two groups regarding surrogate anxiety, depression, or decisional conflict. CONCLUSIONS: While surrogates considered many factors, they focused more often on patient well-being than on patient preferences, in contravention of our current ethical framework.

In 2012, the VA integrated a two-question Homelessness Screening Clinical Reminder (HSCR) into the electronic medical record in outpatient clinics to identify Veterans experiencing housing instability and ensure referral to appropriate services. OBJECTIVE: This study explores perspectives of VA clinical providers regarding administration of the HSCR, their role in addressing housing status, and how a patient's housing status impacts clinical decision-making. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviewing. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two providers were interviewed (20 physicians and two nurse practitioners) between March and September 2016. APPROACH: Interviews were conducted with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) physician and non-physician practitioners who had administered the HSCR and documented at least five positive screens between 2013 and 2015. Our interview guide investigated provider experiences with administering the HSCR and addressing affirmative responses. The guide also elicited details about how patients' housing instability was identified (if at all) prior to implementation of the screening reminder, and how practices changed following implementation of the HSCR. Transcripts were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. KEY RESULTS: Providers reported that the HSCR prompted them to incorporate patient housing status into routine assessment, which they typically did not do prior to its implementation. Providers discussed adverse impacts of housing instability on patients' overall health and described how they factored patients' housing instability into clinical decision-making. Although providers viewed the health system as having an important role in addressing housing concerns, there were mixed opinions on whether it was the role of providers to directly administer the screening. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of a screener for housing instability into the electronic medical record increased provider attention to housing instability into the social history, and positive responses commonly impacted plans of care.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-04895-x,34,7,1213-1219,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Male and Veterans and qualitative research and screening and homelessness and social determinants of health and United States/epidemiology and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Veterans/psychology and Health Personnel/psychology/*standards and Homeless Persons/psychology and Housing/*standards and Mass Screening/methods/psychology/*standards and Social Determinants of Health/*standards and United States Department of Veterans Affairs/*standards,NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, PrCS discussions remain complex, challenging and often emotional for physicians and average-risk men. OBJECTIVE: In July 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a multidisciplinary expert panel to identify priorities for funding agencies and development groups to promote evidence-based, value-concordant decisions between men at average risk for prostate cancer and their physicians. DESIGN: Two-day multidisciplinary expert panel in Atlanta, Georgia, with structured discussions and formal consensus processes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen panelists represented diverse specialties (primary care, medical oncology, urology), disciplines (sociology, communication, medical education, clinical epidemiology) and market sectors (patient advocacy groups, Federal funding agencies, guideline-development organizations). MAIN MEASURES: Panelists used guiding interactional and evaluation models to identify and rate strategies that might improve PrCS discussions and decisions for physicians, patients and health systems/society. Efficacy was defined as the likelihood of each strategy to impact outcomes. Effort was defined as the relative amount of effort to develop, implement and sustain the strategy. Each strategy was rated (1-7 scale; 7 = maximum) using group process software (ThinkTank(TM)). For each group, intervention strategies were grouped as financial/regulatory, educational, communication or attitudinal levers. For each strategy, barriers were identified. KEY RESULTS: Highly ranked strategies to improve value-concordant shared decision-making (SDM) included: changing outpatient clinic visit reimbursement to reward SDM; development of evidence-based, technology-assisted, point-of-service tools for physicians and patients; reframing confusing prostate cancer screening messages; providing pre-visit decision support interventions; utilizing electronic health records to promote benchmarking/best practices; providing additional training for physicians around value-concordant decision-making; and using re-accreditation to promote training.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate informed decision making (IDM) elements about CRC screening among low-income minority patients. DESIGN: Observational data were collected as part of a patient-level randomized controlled trial to improve CRC screening rates. Medical visits (November 2007 to May 2010) were audio-taped and coded for IDM elements about CRC screening. Near the end of the study one provider refused recording of patients' visits (33 of 270 patients). Among all patients in the trial, agreement to be audio taped was 43.5 % (103/237). Evaluable patient (n = 100) visits were assessed for CRC screening discussion occurrence, IDM elements, and who initiated discussion of each IDM element. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were African American (72.2 %), female (63.7 %), with annual household incomes <$20,000 (60.7 %), without health insurance (57.0 %), and limited health literacy (53.7 %). KEY RESULTS: Although CRC screening was mentioned during 48 (48 %) visits, no further discussion about screening occurred in 23 visits (19 times mentioned by the participant with no response from providers). During any visit, the maximum number of IDM elements was five; however, only two visits included five elements. The most common IDM element discussed in addition to the nature of the decision was the assessment of the patient's understanding in 16 (33.3 %) of the visits that included a CRC discussion.

The most commonly studied SDM intervention is the decision aid (DA). While DAs have been extensively studied, we know relatively little about their use in minority populations. We conducted a systematic review to characterize the application and effectiveness of DAs in racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. METHODS: We searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating DAs between 2004 and 2013. We included trials that enrolled adults (> 18 years of age) with > 50 % representation by minority patients. Four reviewers independently assessed 597 initially identified articles, and those with inconclusive results were discussed to consensus. We abstracted decision quality, patient-doctor communication, and clinical treatment decision outcomes. Results were considered significantly modified by the DA if the study reported p < 0.05. RESULTS: We reviewed 18 RCTs of DA interventions in minority populations. The majority of interventions (78 %) addressed cancer screening. The most common mode of delivery for the DAs was personal counseling (46 %), followed by multi-media (29 %), and print materials (25 %). Most of the trials studied racial (78 %) or ethnic (17 %) minorities with only one trial focused on sexual minorities and none on gender minorities. Ten studies tailored their interventions for their minority populations. Comparing intervention vs. control, decision quality outcomes improved in six out of eight studies and patient-doctor communication improved in six out of seven studies. Of the 15 studies that reported on clinical decisions, eight demonstrated significant changes in decisions with DAs. DISCUSSION: DAs have been effective in improving patient-doctor communication and decision quality outcomes in minority populations and could help address health disparities. However, the existing literature is almost non-existent for sexual and gender minorities and has not included the full breadth of clinical decisions that affect minority populations.",2016,10.1007/s11606-016-3609-2,31,6,663-676,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Communication and Humans and Patient Participation and Physician-Patient Relations and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and disparities and shared decision making and Health Status Disparities and *Decision Making and *Decision Support Techniques and medical decision making and race and ethnicity and systematic reviews and minority health and Ethnicity/psychology and Minority Groups/*psychology,NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ilgen_2016_Joofgeinme,JOUR,What's in a Label? Is Diagnosis the Start or the End of Clinical Reasoning?,"Ilgen, Jonathan S. and Eva, Kevin W. and Regehr, Glenn",Journal of general internal medicine,"Diagnostic reasoning has received substantial attention in the literature, yet what we mean by ""diagnosis"" may vary. Diagnosis can align with assignment of a ""label,"" where a constellation of signs, symptoms, and test results is unified into a solution at a single point in time. This ""diagnostic labeling"" conceptualization is embodied in our case-based learning curricula, published case reports, and research studies, all of which treat diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome. However, this conceptualization may oversimplify the richly iterative and evolutionary nature of clinical reasoning in many settings. Diagnosis can also represent a process of guiding one's thoughts by ""making meaning"" from data that are intrinsically dynamic, experienced idiosyncratically, negotiated among team members, and rich with opportunities for exploration. Thus, there are two complementary constructions of diagnosis: 1) the correct solution resulting from a diagnostic reasoning process, and 2) a dynamic aid to an ongoing clinical reasoning process. This article discusses the importance of recognizing these two conceptualizations of ""diagnosis,"" outlines the unintended consequences of emphasizing diagnostic labeling as the primary goal of clinical reasoning, and suggests how framing diagnosis as an ongoing process of meaning-making might change how we think about teaching and assessing clinical reasoning.",2016,10.1007/s11606-016-3592-7,31,4,435-437,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and diagnosis and Diagnosis, Differential and Clinical Competence/*standards and Clinical Decision-Making/*methods and problem-solving and medical decision-making and clinical reasoning and *Thinking and diagnostic reasoning",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Few studies have evaluated the impact of medical training on medical students' attitudes towards end-of-life decisions and none have compared them with an age-matched group of non-medical students. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of medical education on medical students' attitudes towards end-of-life decisions in acutely ill patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and two students at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. MEASUREMENTS: Completion of a questionnaire focused on end-of-life decisions.

Multimorbid patients demand highly complex patient-centered care which often includes polypharmacy, taking an average of six different drugs per day. Adverse drug reactions, adverse drug events and medication errors are all potential consequences of polypharmacy. Our study aims to detect the status quo of the health care situation in Saxony's general practices for multimorbid patients receiving multiple medications. We will identify the most common clinical profiles as well as documented adverse drug events and reactions that occur during the treatment of patients receiving multiple medications. We will focus on exploring the motives of general practitioners for the prescription of selected drugs in individual cases where there is evidence of potential drug-drug-interactions and potentially inappropriate medications in elderly patients.

METHODS/DESIGN: This is a retrospective cross sectional study using mixed methods. Socio-demographic data as well as diagnoses, medication regimens and clinically important events will be analyzed retrospectively using general practitioners documentation in patients' records. Based on these data, short vignettes will be generated and discussed by general practitioners in qualitative telephone interviews.

The neuropsychologist integrates information from the patient's medical history, laboratory tests, and imaging studies; an in-depth interview; collateral information from the family and other sources; and standardized assessment instruments to draw conclusions about diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. Family physicians can use this information in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with depression, dementia, concussion, and similar conditions, as well as to address concerns about decision-making capacity. Certain assessment instruments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, are readily available and easily performed in a primary care office. Distinguishing among depression, dementia, and other conditions can be challenging, and consultation with a neuropsychologist at this level can be diagnostic and therapeutic. The neuropsychologist typically helps the patient, family, and primary care team by establishing decision-making capacity; determining driving safety; identifying traumatic brain injury deficits; distinguishing dementia from depression and other conditions; and detecting malingering. Neuropsychologists use a structured set of therapeutic activities to improve a patient's ability to think, use judgment, and make decisions (cognitive rehabilitation).

Patient decision support interventions for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have been shown to promote informed decision making and reduce PSA testing in efficacy trials, but their impact in real world settings is not clear. OBJECTIVE: We performed an effectiveness trial of PSA decision support interventions in primary care. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of three distribution strategies was compared to a control. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 2,550 men eligible for PSA testing (76.6 % of the eligible population) and 2001 survey respondents (60.1 % survey response rate). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention groups were: 1) mailed the DESI in DVD format, 2) offered a shared medical appointment (SMA) to view the DESI with other men and discuss, and 3) both options. MAIN MEASURES: We measured PSA testing identified via electronic medical record at 12 months and DESI use by self-report 4 months after the intervention mailing. KEY RESULTS: We found no differences in PSA testing across the three distribution strategies over a year-long follow-up period: 21 %, 24 %, 22 % in the DESI, SMA, and combined group respectively, compared to 21 % in the control group (p = 0.51).

KEY RESULTS: Six focus groups were conducted with 50 participants. Initial agreement in coding was 59-67% with 100% reached after reconciliation by the coding team. Three major themes emerged: 1) numeracy skills are applied to a broad range of communication and decision making tasks in health, 2) affective and cognitive responses to numeric information influence use of numbers in the health setting, and 3) there exists a strong desire to understand the meaning behind numbers used in health.

However, little is known about clinical reasoning curricula at US medical schools. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical reasoning curricula at US medical schools and to determine the attitudes of internal medicine clerkship directors toward teaching of clinical reasoning. DESIGN: Cross-sectional multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: US institutional members of the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM). MAIN MEASURES: Examined responses to a survey that was emailed in May 2015 to CDIM institutional representatives, who reported on their medical school's clinical reasoning curriculum. KEY RESULTS: The response rate was 74% (91/123). Most respondents reported that a structured curriculum in clinical reasoning should be taught in all phases of medical education, including the preclinical years (64/85; 75%), clinical clerkships (76/87; 87%), and the fourth year (75/88; 85%), and that more curricular time should be devoted to the topic. Respondents indicated that most students enter the clerkship with only poor (25/85; 29%) to fair (47/85; 55%) knowledge of key clinical reasoning concepts. Most institutions (52/91; 57%) surveyed lacked sessions dedicated to these topics. Lack of curricular time (59/67, 88%) and faculty expertise in teaching these concepts (53/76, 69%) were identified as barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Internal medicine clerkship directors believe that clinical reasoning should be taught throughout the 4 years of medical school, with the greatest emphasis in the clinical years.

DESIGN: Qualitative study entailing in-person individual interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two non-physician healthcare team members (69.6% of those approached) participated from 8 different primary care practices (community and academic) in the Boston area or in Chapel Hill, NC. APPROACH: Participants were asked to provide feedback on the DA, their thoughts on ways to make the DA available to older women, and factors that would make it easier and/or harder to implement.

Older Americans are particularly vulnerable to overuse and impacted by it, yet it is unknown whether older patients perceive overuse as a consequential problem. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences and perspectives of older adults with respect to healthcare overuse in order to develop a framework for understanding and reducing overuse in older adults. DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus group methodology. PARTICIPANTS: Five focus groups were held with people <e2><89><a5>65 years of age (N = 38) in four senior centers in Baltimore, Maryland, in 2016. APPROACH: Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify major themes. KEY RESULTS: Of the 38 participants, 28 were women and 29 were African-American; 31 had at least a 12th grade education. While virtually all reported experience with what they perceived to have been healthcare overuse, some expressed concern that they had been denied appropriate care. They perceived overuse to have occurred when interventions were applied in the absence of symptoms (excluding cancer screening), did not improve symptoms, were discordant with their preferences, or were duplicative. Some defined overuse as interventions that were offered before less intensive options or too early in the course of disease. Suggested contributors to overuse were poor quality communication between patients and healthcare providers, and between different healthcare providers. Participants reported suffering from treatment effects, high costs, worry, and inconvenience from what they perceived to be overuse. They suggested that overuse may be reduced when the patient is involved in decision making and has a trusted primary care doctor. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of older adults highlights potential sites of intervention to reduce healthcare overuse.

METHODS: Cross-sectional household survey based on random-digit dialing and conducted largely by telephone, supplemented by in-person interviews of households with no telephones. The sample for this analysis includes 32,210 adults who reported having a physician as their regular source of care. Measures of patient trust include overall trust, confidence in being referred to a specialist, and belief that the physician uses more services than necessary. Perceived quality measures include thoroughness of exam, ability to listen, and ability to explain. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, persons with high medical cost burdens had greater odds of lacking trust in their physician to put their needs above all else (OR = 1.43, CI = 1.19, 1.73), not referring them to specialists (OR = 1.39, CI = 1.22, 1.58), and performing unnecessary tests (OR = 1.42, CI = 1.20, 1.62). Patients with high medical cost burdens also had more negative assessments of the thoroughness of care they receive from their physician (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.02, 1.56). The association of high medical cost burdens with patient trust and perceived quality of care was greatest for privately insured persons. CONCLUSION: The rising cost of medical care threatens a vital aspect of the effective delivery of medical care-patient trust in their physician and continuity of care. Exposing patients to more of the costs could lead to greater skepticism and less trust of physicians' decision-making, thereby making health-care delivery less effective.",2009,10.1007/s11606-008-0879-3,24,3,415-420,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Interviews as Topic and Attitude to Health and *Trust and *Public Opinion and *Health Expenditures and Quality of Health Care/*economics,NA,NA,2009/03//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Beune, Thimpe and Faber, Marjan J. and Wollersheim, Hub",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that involving students in patient education can contribute to the quality of care and medical education. Interventions and outcomes in this field, however, have not yet been systematically reviewed. The authors examined the scientific literature for studies on interventions and outcomes of student-provided patient education. METHODS: Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO) were searched for studies reporting patient education, undergraduate medical students, and outcomes of patient education, published between January 1990 and October 2015. Facilitators of and barriers to educational interventions were assessed using the Learning Transfer System Inventory. The learning yield, impact on quality of care, and practical feasibility of the interventions were rated by patients, care professionals, researchers, and education professionals. RESULTS: The search resulted in 4991 hits. Eighteen studies were included in the final synthesis. Studies suggested that student-provided patient education improved patients' health knowledge, attitude, and behavior (nine studies), disease management (three studies), medication adherence (one study), and shared decision-making (one study). In addition, involving students in patient education was reported to enhance students' patient education self-efficacy (four studies), skills (two studies), and behavior (one study), their relationships with patients (two studies), and communication skills (two studies). DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that student-provided patient education-specifically, student-run patient education clinics, student-provided outreach programs, student health coaching, and clerkships on patient education-has the potential to improve quality of care and medical education. To enhance the learning effectiveness and quality of student-provided patient education, factors including professional roles for students, training preparation, constructive supervision, peer support on organizational and individual levels, and learning aids should be taken into account. Future research should focus on further investigating the effects found in this study with high-level evidence.",2017,10.1007/s11606-017-4065-3,32,9,1031-1043,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Physician-Patient Relations and transfer learning and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and quality of care and patient education and Patient Education as Topic/*methods and Education, Medical, Undergraduate/*methods and *Students, Medical and medical education and scoping review and Clinical Clerkship/methods and Health Literacy/methods",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

This could be due, in part, to primary care physicians' (PCP) screening practices, about which little is known. The objectives of this study were to identify factors that influence PCPs' decisions to screen patients for T2DM and to characterize their interpretation and communication of screening test results to patients. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured chart-stimulated recall interviews with 20 University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) primary care physicians. PCPs were asked about their recent decisions to screen or not screen 134 purposively sampled non-diabetic patients who met American Diabetes Association criteria for screening for T2DM. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative directed content analysis. Data on patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were abstracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: The most common reasons PCPs gave for not screening 63 patients for T2DM were knowledge of a previously normal screening test (49%) and a visit for reasons other than a health maintenance examination (48%). The most common reasons PCPs gave for screening 71 patients for T2DM were knowledge of a previously abnormal screening test (49%), and patients' weight (42%) and age (38%). PCPs correctly interpreted 89% of screening test results and communicated 95% of test results to patients. Among 24 patients found to have prediabetes, PCPs usually (58%) recommended weight loss and increased physical activity but never recommended participation in a Diabetes Prevention Program or use of metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Previous screening test results, visit types, and patients' weight and age influenced PCPs' decisions to screen for T2DM. When patients were screened, test results were generally correctly interpreted and consistently communicated. Recommendations to patients with prediabetes could better reflect evidence-based strategies to prevent T2DM.",2017,10.1186/s12875-017-0623-3,18,1,50,eng,1471-2296,"Communication and Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Preventive care and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Risk Reduction Behavior and Qualitative Research and Mass Screening and Early Diagnosis and Attitude of Health Personnel and Internal Medicine and Mental Recall and Physicians, Family and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Guideline Adherence and *Physicians, Primary Care and Type 2 diabetes mellitus and Early Medical Intervention and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/prevention & control/therapy and Diabetes prevention and Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use and lifestyle counseling and Metformin/therapeutic use and Prediabetes and Prediabetic State/*diagnosis/therapy",NA,NA,2017/04/04/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to assess the utility of exercise tests for the selection of primary-care patients for referral to cardiologic care, and to determine whether referral decisions were biased by gender or socioeconomic status. We also evaluated referral rates and cardiovascular events in patients with positive exercise tests. METHODS: We designed a prospective observational study of 438 men and 427 women from 28 Swedish primary-care clinics who were examined with exercise testing for suspected coronary disease. All participants were followed-up with respect to cardiologist referrals and cardiovascular events (hospitalisation for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death) within six months and revascularisation within 250 days. Variables associated with referral were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Socioeconomic status was determined by educational level and employment. RESULTS: Positive/inconclusive exercise tests and exertional chest pain predicted referral in men and women. Of 865 participants, patients with positive, inconclusive, or negative exercise tests were referred to cardiologists in 67.3%, 26.1%, and 3.5% of cases, respectively. Overall, there was no significant difference in referral rates related to gender or socioeconomic level. Self-employed women were referred more frequently compared to other women (odds ratio (OR) 3.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-10.99). Among non-manual employees, women were referred to cardiologic examination less frequently than men (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-1.00; p = 0.049; ORs adjusted for age, exertional chest pain, and exercise test result). In patients with positive exercise tests, the referral rate decreased continuously with age (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.97; adjusted for cardiovascular co-morbidity). Cardiovascular events occurred in 22.2% (4/18) of non-referred patients with positive exercise tests; 56% (10/18) of these patients were not considered for cardiologic care, with continuity problems in primary care as one possible contributing cause. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise tests are important for selecting patients for referral to cardiologic care. Interactions related to gender and socioeconomic status affected referral rates. In patients with positive exercise tests, referral rates decreased with age. An increased awareness of possible bias regarding age, gender, and socioeconomic status, which may influence medical decisions, is therefore necessary.",2014,10.1186/s12875-014-0182-9,15,NA,182,eng,1471-2296,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Sex Factors and Employment and Educational Status and Prospective Studies and Sweden and Social Class and Odds Ratio and Primary Health Care/*methods and *Referral and Consultation and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data and Angina, Unstable/epidemiology and Coronary Disease/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy and Exercise Test/*statistics & numerical data and Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology and Myocardial Revascularization/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2014/11/30/,BMC Fam Pract,NA,NA,NA,NA
Helfrich_2014_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Elements of team-based care in a patient-centered medical home are associated with lower burnout among VA primary care employees,"Helfrich, Christian D. and Dolan, Emily D. and Simonetti, Joseph and Reid, Robert J. and Joos, Sandra and Wakefield, Bonnie J. and Schectman, Gordon and Stark, Richard and Fihn, Stephan D. and Harvey, Henry B. and Nelson, Karin",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of the US primary care workforce reports burnout, which is associated with negative consequences for clinicians and patients. Many protective factors from burnout are characteristics of patient-centered medical home (PCMH) models, though even positive organizational transformation is often stressful. The existing literature on the effects of PCMH on burnout is limited, with most findings based on small-scale demonstration projects with data collected only among physicians, and the results are mixed. OBJECTIVE: To determine if components of PCMH related to team-based care were associated with lower burnout among primary care team members participating in a national medical home transformation, the VA Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT). DESIGN: Web-based, cross-sectional survey and administrative data from May 2012. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4,539 VA primary care personnel from 588 VA primary care clinics. MAIN MEASURES: The dependent variable was burnout, and the independent variables were measures of team-based care: team functioning, time spent in huddles, team staffing, delegation of clinical responsibilities, working to top of competency, and collective self-efficacy. We also included administrative measures of workload and patient comorbidity. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 39 % of respondents reported burnout. Participatory decision making (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.57, 0.74) and having a fully staffed PACT (OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.68, 0.93) were associated with lower burnout, while being assigned to a PACT (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.11, 1.93), spending time on work someone with less training could do (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.07, 1.57) and a stressful, fast-moving work environment (OR 4.33, 95 % CI 3.78, 4.96) were associated with higher burnout. Longer tenure and occupation were also correlated with burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Lower burnout may be achieved by medical home models that are appropriately staffed, emphasize participatory decision making, and increase the proportion of time team members spend working to the top of their competency level.",2014,10.1007/s11606-013-2702-z,29 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,666-S659,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Patient Care Team and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Health Personnel/*psychology and Primary Health Care/methods and *Patient-Centered Care/methods and *Hospitals, Veterans and Burnout, Professional/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Patient Acuity Rating (PAR) is a previously validated, 7-point scale that quantifies physician judgment of patient stability, where a higher score indicates a greater risk of clinical deterioration. Its impact on cross-covering physician understanding of patients is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine PAR contribution to sign-outs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS: Intern physicians at a university teaching hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were surveyed using randomly chosen, de-identified patient sign-outs, previously assigned PAR scores by their primary teams. For each sign-out, subjects assigned a PAR score, then responded to hypothetical cross-cover scenarios before and after being informed of the primary team's PAR. MAIN MEASURE: Changes in intern assessment of the scenario before and after being informed of the primary team's PAR were measured. In addition, responses between novice and experienced interns were compared. KEY RESULTS: Between May and July 2008, 23 of 39 (59 %) experienced interns and 25 of 42 (60 %) novice interns responded to 480 patient scenarios from ten distinct sign-outs. The mean PAR score assigned by subjects was 4.2 <c2><b1> 1.6 vs. 3.8 <c2><b1> 1.8 by the primary teams (p < 0.001). After viewing the primary team's PAR score, interns changed their level of concern in 47.9 % of cases, their assessment of the importance of immediate bedside evaluation in 48.7 % of cases, and confidence in their assessment in 43.2 % of cases. For all three assessments, novice interns changed their responses more frequently than experienced interns (p = 0.03, 0.009, and <0.001, respectively). Overall interns reported the PAR score to be theoretically helpful in 70.8 % of the cases, but this was more pronounced in novice interns (81.2 % vs 59.6 %, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The PAR adds valuable information to sign-outs that could impact cross-cover decision-making and potentially benefit patients.

Politi_2013_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Implementing clinical practice guidelines about health promotion and disease prevention through shared decision making,"Politi, Mary C. and Wolin, Kathleen Y. and Legare, France",Journal of general internal medicine,"Clinical practice guidelines aim to improve the health of patients by guiding individual care in clinical settings. Many guidelines specifically about health promotion or primary disease prevention are beginning to support informed patient choice, and suggest that clinicians and patients engage in shared discussions to determine how best to tailor guidelines to individuals. However, guidelines generally do not address how to translate evidence from the population to the individual in clinical practice, or how to engage patients in these discussions. In addition, they often fail to reconcile patients' preferences and social norms with best evidence. Shared decision making (SDM) is one solution to bridge guidelines about health promotion and disease prevention with clinical practice. SDM describes a collaborative process between patients and their clinicians to reach agreement about a health decision involving multiple medically appropriate treatment options. This paper discusses: 1) a brief overview of SDM; 2) the potential role of SDM in facilitating the implementation of prevention-focused practice guidelines for both preference-sensitive and effective care decisions; and 3) avenues for future empirical research to test how best to engage individual patients and clinicians in these complex discussions about prevention guidelines. We suggest that SDM can provide a structure for clinicians to discuss clinical practice guidelines with patients in a way that is evidence-based, patient-centered, and incorporates patients' preferences. In addition to providing a model for communicating about uncertainty at the individual level, SDM can provide a platform for engaging patients in a conversation. This process can help manage patients' and clinicians' expectations about health behaviors. SDM can be used even in situations with strong evidence for benefits at the level of the population, by helping patients and clinicians prioritize behaviors during time-pressured medical encounters. Involving patients in discussions could lead to improved health through better adherence to chosen options, reduced practice variation about preference-sensitive options, and improved care more broadly. However, more research is needed to determine the impact of this approach on outcomes such as morbidity and mortality.",2013,10.1007/s11606-012-2321-0,28,6,838-844,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Physician-Patient Relations and *Decision Making and *Practice Guidelines as Topic and Patient Participation/methods and Health Promotion/*organization & administration and Health Services Research/methods/trends,NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gonzalez_2019_Joofgeinme,JOUR,A Qualitative Study of New York Medical Student Views on Implicit Bias Instruction: Implications for Curriculum Development,"Gonzalez, Cristina M. and Deno, Maria L. and Kintzer, Emily and Marantz, Paul R. and Lypson, Monica L. and McKee, Melissa D.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: For at least the past two decades, medical educators have worked to improve patient communication and health care delivery to diverse patient populations; despite efforts, patients continue to report prejudice and bias during their clinical encounters. Targeted instruction in implicit bias recognition and management may promote the delivery of equitable care, but students at times resist this instruction. Little guidance exists to overcome this resistance and to engage students in implicit bias instruction; instruction over time could lead to eventual skill development that is necessary to mitigate the influence of implicit bias on clinical practice behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To explore student perceptions of challenges and opportunities when participating in implicit bias instruction. APPROACH: We conducted a qualitative study that involved 11 focus groups with medical students across each of the four class years to explore their perceptions of challenges and opportunities related to participating in such instruction. We analyzed transcripts for themes. KEY RESULTS: Our analysis suggests a range of attitudes toward implicit bias instruction and identifies contextual factors that may influence these attitudes. The themes were (1) resistance; (2) shame; (3) the negative role of the hidden curriculum; and (4) structural barriers to student engagement. Students expressed resistance to implicit bias instruction; some of these attitudes are fueled from concerns of anticipated shame within the learning environment. Participants also indicated that student engagement in implicit bias instruction was influenced by the hidden curriculum and structural barriers. CONCLUSIONS: These insights can inform future curriculum development efforts. Considerations related to instructional design and programmatic decision-making are highlighted. These considerations for implicit bias instruction may provide useful frameworks for educators looking for opportunities to minimize student resistance and maximize engagement in multi-session instruction in implicit bias recognition and management.",2019,10.1007/s11606-019-04891-1,34,5,692-698,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"New York and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and health disparities and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Curriculum and Education, Medical/organization & administration and *Bias and medical education and curriculum development and implicit bias and Students, Medical/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and unconscious bias",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding this variability is key for reducing inappropriate prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To measure how emergency department (ED) clinicians' perceptions of antibiotic prescribing risks affect their decision-making. DESIGN: Clinician survey based on fuzzy-trace theory, a theory of medical decision-making, combined with retrospective data on prescribing outcomes for URI/pneumonia visits in two EDs. The survey predicts the categorical meanings, or gists, that individuals derive from given information. PARTICIPANTS: ED physicians, residents, and physician assistants (PAs) who completed surveys and treated patients with URI/pneumonia diagnoses between August 2014 and December 2015. MAIN MEASURES: Gists derived from survey responses and their association with rates of antibiotic prescribing per visit. KEY RESULTS: Of 4474 URI/pneumonia visits, 2874 (64.2%) had an antibiotic prescription. However, prescribing rates varied from 7% to 91% for the 69 clinicians surveyed (65.2% response rate). Clinicians who framed therapy-prescribing decisions as a categorical choice between continued illness and possibly beneficial treatment (""why not take a risk?"" gist, which assumes antibiotic therapy is essentially harmless) had higher rates of prescribing (OR 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06-1.54]). Greater agreement with the ""antibiotics may be harmful"" gist was associated with lower prescribing rates (OR 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that clinicians who perceive prescribing as a categorical choice between patients remaining ill or possibly improving from therapy are more likely to prescribe antibiotics. However, this strategy assumes that antibiotics are essentially harmless. Clinicians who framed decision-making as a choice between potential harms from therapy and continued patient illness (e.g., increased appreciation of potential harms) had lower prescribing rates. These results suggest that interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing should emphasize the non-negligible possibility of serious side effects.",2017,10.1007/s11606-017-4099-6,32,10,1083-1089,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and Risk Factors and *Perception and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and *Drug Prescriptions/standards and Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use and antibiotic resistance and drivers of decision-making and Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects/physiology and Emergency Service, Hospital/standards/*trends and fuzzy-trace theory and gist of antibiotic therapy and Inappropriate Prescribing/prevention & control/*trends and non-negligible risks of unnecessary antibiotics",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of ethnicity--Hispanic whites vs. non-Hispanic whites--on respondents' self-reported interactions with healthcare providers. To understand, among Hispanic whites, how demographic and socioeconomic characteristics impact their interactions with healthcare providers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey on medical care conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. PARTICIPANTS: Civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged > or = 18 years who reported visiting a healthcare provider within the past 12 months prior to data collection. RESULTS: After controlling for several demographic and socioeconomic covariates, compared to non-Hispanic whites (reference group), Hispanic whites who had visited a doctor's office or clinic in the past 12 months were more likely to report that their healthcare provider ""always"" listened to them [odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.53], explained things so that they understood (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.41), showed respect for what they had to say (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.72), and spent enough time with them (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.38).

The training that medical students require in order to achieve this competency, however, is not well established (Med Sci Educ. 26:457-61, 2016), and few studies have examined non-physician healthcare professionals' perspectives regarding resident physicians' interprofessional skills. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe non-physicians' views on barriers to collaboration with physicians, as well as factors that contribute to good collaborative relationships. PARTICIPANTS: Nurses, social workers, case managers, dietitians, rehabilitation therapists, and pharmacists at one academic medical center, largely working in the inpatient setting. APPROACH: A qualitative study design was employed. Data were collected from individual interviews and focus groups comprising non-physician healthcare professionals. KEY RESULTS: Knowledge gaps identified as impeding interprofessional collaboration included inadequate understanding of current roles, potential roles, and processes for non-physician healthcare professionals. Specific physician behaviors that were identified as contributing to good collaborative relationships included mutual support such as backing up other team members and prioritizing multidisciplinary rounds, and communication including keeping team members informed, asking for their input, physicians explaining their rationale, and practicing joint problem-solving with non-physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Discussion of how physician trainees can best learn to collaborate as members of an interprofessional team must include non-physician perspectives. Training designed to provide medical students and residents with a better understanding of non-physician roles and to enhance mutual support and communication skills may be critical in achieving the AAMC's goals of making physicians effective members of interprofessional teams, and thus improving patient-centered care.

INNOVATION: The Toolkit is an online repository of ready-to-use tools created by VA clinic staff that physicians, nurses, and other team members may share, download, and adopt in order to more effectively implement PCMH principles and improve local performance on VA metrics. DESIGN: Multimethod evaluation using: (1) website usage analytics, (2) an online survey of the PACT community of practice's use of the Toolkit, and (3) key informant interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Survey respondents were PACT team members and coaches (n = 544) at 136 VA facilities. Interview respondents were Toolkit users and non-users (n = 32). MEASURES: For survey data, multivariable logistic models were used to predict Toolkit awareness and use. Interviews and open-text survey comments were coded using a ""common themes"" framework. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided data collection and analyses. KEY RESULTS: The Toolkit was used by 6,745 staff in the first 19 months of availability. Among members of the target audience, 80 % had heard of the Toolkit, and of those, 70 % had visited the website. Tools had been implemented at 65 % of facilities. Qualitative findings revealed a range of user perspectives from enthusiastic support to lack of sufficient time to browse the Toolkit. CONCLUSIONS: An online Toolkit to support PCMH implementation was used at VA facilities nationwide. Other complex health care organizations may benefit from adopting similar online peer-to-peer resource libraries.",2014,10.1007/s11606-013-2738-0,29 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,578-S572,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,United States and Humans and Patient Care Team/*standards and Data Collection/*methods and Patient-Centered Care/methods/*standards and United States Department of Veterans Affairs/*standards and Peer Review/methods/*standards,NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pappas_2016_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Defining Appropriate Use of Proton-Pump Inhibitors Among Medical Inpatients,"Pappas, Matt and Jolly, Sanjay and Vijan, Sandeep",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used among medical inpatients, both for prophylaxis against upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and continuation of outpatient use. While PPIs reduce the risk of UGIB, they also appear to increase the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Depending upon the underlying risks of these conditions and the changes in those risks with PPIs, use of proton-pump inhibitors may lead to a net benefit or net harm among medical inpatients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the net impact of PPIs on hospital mortality among medical inpatients. DESIGN: A microsimulation model, using literature-derived estimates of the risks of UGIB, HAP, and CDI among medical inpatients, along with the changes in risk associated with PPI use for each of these outcomes. The primary outcome was change in inpatient mortality. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated general medical inpatients outside the intensive care unit (ICU). MAIN MEASURE: Change in overall mortality during hospitalization. KEY RESULTS: New initiation of PPI therapy led to an increase in hospital mortality in about 90% of simulated patients. Continuation of outpatient PPI therapy on admission led to net increase in hospital mortality in 79% of simulated patients. Results were robust to both one-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses, with net harm occurring in at least two-thirds of patients in all scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of medical inpatients outside the ICU, use of PPIs likely leads to a net increase in hospital mortality. Even in patients at particularly high risk of UGIB, only those at the very lowest risk of HCAP and CDI should be considered for prophylactic PPI use. Continuation of outpatient PPIs may also increase expected hospital mortality. Apart from patients with active UGIB, use of PPIs in hospitalized patients should be discouraged.",2016,10.1007/s11606-015-3536-7,31,4,364-371,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Risk Factors and simulation and modeling and Inpatients and *Models, Theoretical and Hospital Mortality/*trends and medical decision making and Mortality/trends and hospital medicine and Clostridium Infections/chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality and Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/diagnosis/mortality/prevention & control and Pneumonia/chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis/methods/trends and Proton Pump Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects",NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Experiences of physician practices,"O'Malley, Ann S. and Grossman, Joy M. and Cohen, Genna R. and Kemper, Nicole M. and Pham, Hoangmai H.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Policies promoting widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) are premised on the hope that they can improve the coordination of care. Yet little is known about whether and how physician practices use current EMRs to facilitate coordination. OBJECTIVES: We examine whether and how practices use commercial EMRs to support coordination tasks and identify work-around practices have created to address new coordination challenges. DESIGN, SETTING: Semi-structured telephone interviews in 12 randomly selected communities. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty respondents, including 52 physicians or staff from 26 practices with commercial ambulatory care EMRs in place for at least 2 years, chief medical officers at four EMR vendors, and four national thought leaders. RESULTS: Six major themes emerged: (1) EMRs facilitate within-office care coordination, chiefly by providing access to data during patient encounters and through electronic messaging; (2) EMRs are less able to support coordination between clinicians and settings, in part due to their design and a lack of standardization of key data elements required for information exchange; (3) managing information overflow from EMRs is a challenge for clinicians; (4) clinicians believe current EMRs cannot adequately capture the medical decision-making process and future care plans to support coordination; (5) realizing EMRs' potential for facilitating coordination requires evolution of practice operational processes; (6) current fee-for-service reimbursement encourages EMR use for documentation of billable events (office visits, procedures) and not of care coordination (which is not a billable activity). CONCLUSIONS: There is a gap between policy-makers' expectation of, and clinical practitioners' experience with, current electronic medical records' ability to support coordination of care. Policymakers could expand current health information technology policies to support assessment of how well the technology facilitates tasks necessary for coordination. By reforming payment policy to include care coordination, policymakers could encourage the evolution of EMR technology to include capabilities that support coordination, for example, allowing for inter-practice data exchange and multi-provider clinical decision support.",2010,10.1007/s11606-009-1195-2,25,3,177-185,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration and Interviews as Topic/methods and Practice Management, Medical/*organization & administration and *Patient Care/methods and Physicians/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2010/03//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because no validated predictive tools exist, clinical judgment guides the decision-making process. Although there is insufficient evidence to support routine screening, evidence shows that asking high-risk patients about suicidal intent leads to better outcomes and does not increase the risk of suicide. Important elements of the history that permit evaluation of the seriousness of suicidal ideation include the intent, plan, and means; the availability of social support; previous suicide attempts; and the presence of comorbid psychiatric illness or substance abuse. After intent has been established, inpatient and outpatient management should include ensuring patient safety and medical stabilization; activating support networks; and initiating therapy for psychiatric diseases. Care plans for patients with chronic suicidal ideation include these same steps, as well as referral for specialty care. In the event of a completed suicide, physicians should provide support for family members who may be experiencing grief complicated by guilt, while also activating their own support networks and risk management systems.",2012,NA,85,6,602-605,eng,1532-0650 0002-838X,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Social Support and Risk Factors and Family Practice and Suicidal Ideation and Medical History Taking/*methods and Mass Screening/*methods and Suicide/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data and Patient Care Management/*methods,NA,NA,2012/03/15/,Am Fam Physician,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between communication quality and high-quality medical decisions, psychological well-being, and satisfaction for surrogates of hospitalized older adults. DESIGN: Observational study at three hospitals in a Midwest metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized older adults (65+ years) admitted to medicine and medical intensive care units who were unable to make medical decisions, and their family surrogates. Among 799 eligible dyads, 364 (45.6%) completed the study. MAIN MEASURES: Communication was assessed during hospitalization using the information and emotional support subscales of the Family Inpatient Communication Survey. Decision quality was assessed with the Decisional Conflict Scale. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 4-6 weeks post-discharge included anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), and satisfaction (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems). KEY RESULTS: The mean patient age was 81.9 years (SD 8.32); 62% were women, and 28% African American. Among surrogates, 67% were adult children. Six to eight weeks post-discharge, 22.6% of surrogates reported anxiety (11.3% moderate-severe anxiety); 29% reported depression, (14.0% moderate-severe), and 14.6% had high levels of post-traumatic stress. Emotional support was associated with lower odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.65, 95% CI 0.50, 0.85) and depression (AOR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.65, 0.99) at follow-up.

Stolper_2011_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Gut feelings as a third track in general practitioners' diagnostic reasoning,"Stolper, Erik and Van de Wiel, Margje and Van Royen, Paul and Van Bokhoven, Marloes and Van der Weijden, Trudy and Dinant, Geert Jan",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are often faced with complicated, vague problems in situations of uncertainty that they have to solve at short notice. In such situations, gut feelings seem to play a substantial role in their diagnostic process. Qualitative research distinguished a sense of alarm and a sense of reassurance. However, not every GP trusted their gut feelings, since a scientific explanation is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This paper explains how gut feelings arise and function in GPs' diagnostic reasoning. APPROACH: The paper reviews literature from medical, psychological and neuroscientific perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: Gut feelings in general practice are based on the interaction between patient information and a GP's knowledge and experience. This is visualized in a knowledge-based model of GPs' diagnostic reasoning emphasizing that this complex task combines analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. The model integrates the two well-known diagnostic reasoning tracks of medical decision-making and medical problem-solving, and adds gut feelings as a third track. Analytical and non-analytical diagnostic reasoning interacts continuously, and GPs use elements of all three tracks, depending on the task and the situation. In this dual process theory, gut feelings emerge as a consequence of non-analytical processing of the available information and knowledge, either reassuring GPs or alerting them that something is wrong and action is required. The role of affect as a heuristic within the physician's knowledge network explains how gut feelings may help GPs to navigate in a mostly efficient way in the often complex and uncertain diagnostic situations of general practice. Emotion research and neuroscientific data support the unmistakable role of affect in the process of making decisions and explain the bodily sensation of gut feelings.The implications for health care practice and medical education are discussed.",2011,10.1007/s11606-010-1524-5,26,2,197-203,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Judgment and *Attitude of Health Personnel and General Practitioners/*psychology and *Emotions and *Intuition and General Practice/*methods,NA,NA,2011/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To identify the motivations of people who choose IM for their primary care needs. DESIGN: Qualitative study from focus group data of regular users of IM. PARTICIPANTS: Six focus groups that include a total of 37 regular users of IM who consented to participate in a study of IM use. APPROACH: Focus group meetings were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis using grounded theory was used to derive the motivations for use of IM. RESULTS: Participants beliefs include the following: the combination of CAM and conventional medicine is better than either alone; health is a combination of physical, emotional, and spiritual well being; nutrition and lifestyle play a role in wellness; and pharmaceuticals should be avoided except as a last resort. Participants suffer from health problems that are not well treated by conventional medicine. Participants want to discuss CAM with physicians and obtain guidance on its use. Participants want time with their providers, to feel listened to and to have the opportunity for shared decision-making. CONCLUSION: Much of what patients are seeking in integrative medical care is likely universally shared: a strong therapeutic relationship with providers who listen and provide time and knowledgeable advice.

Kumar_2018_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,Preoperative Assessment in Older Adults: A Comprehensive Approach,"Kumar, Chandrika and Salzman, Brooke and Colburn, Jessica L.",American family physician,"Surgical outcomes are significantly influenced by patients' overall health, function, and life expectancy. A comprehensive geriatric preoperative assessment of older adults requires expanding beyond an organ-based or disease-based assessment. At a preoperative visit, it is important to establish the patient's goals and preferences, and to determine whether the risks and benefits of surgery match these goals and preferences. These discussions should cover the possibility of resuscitation and ventilator support, prolonged rehabilitation, and loss of independence. The assessment should include evaluation of medical comorbidities, cognitive function, decision-making capacity, functional status, fall risk, frailty, nutritional status, and potentially inappropriate medication use. Problems identified in any of these key areas are associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, institutionalization, functional decline, and, in some cases, mortality. If a patient elects to proceed with surgery, the risks should be communicated to surgical teams to allow for inpatient interventions that lower the risk of postoperative complications and functional decline, such as early mobilization and limiting medications that can cause delirium. Alcohol abuse and smoking are associated with increased rates of postoperative complications, and physicians should discuss cessation with patients before surgery. Physicians should also assess patients' social support systems because they are a critical component of discharge planning in this population and have been shown to predict 30-day postoperative morbidity.",2018,NA,98,4,214-220,eng,1532-0650 0002-838X,Humans and Aged and Risk Factors and Clinical Decision-Making and Risk Adjustment/*methods and Geriatric Assessment/*methods and *Postoperative Complications/classification/prevention & control and Preoperative Care/*methods,NA,NA,2018/08/15/,Am Fam Physician,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patients desire granular control over who receives what information in their electronic health record (EHR), but there are no current patient interfaces that allow them to record their preferences for EHR access. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to derive the user needs of patients regarding the design of a user interface that records patients' individual choices about who can access data in their EHRs. DESIGN: We used semi-structured interviews. SETTING: The study was conducted in Central Indiana. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients with data stored in an EHR, the majority of whom (70 %) had highly sensitive health EHR data, were included in the study. APPROACH: We conducted a thematic and quantitative analysis of transcribed interview data. KEY RESULTS: Patients rarely knew what data were in their EHRs, but would have liked to know. They also wanted to be able to control who could access what information in their EHR and wanted to be notified when their data we re accessed. CONCLUSIONS: We derived six implications for the design of a patient-centered tool to allow individual choice in the disclosure of EHR: easy patient access to their EHRs; an overview of current EHR sharing permissions; granular, hierarchical control over EHR access; EHR access controls based on dates; contextual privacy controls; and notification when their EHRs are accessed.",2015,10.1007/s11606-014-3049-9,30 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,16-S7,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Patient Participation and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Needs Assessment and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Professional-Patient Relations and Indiana and Medical Records Systems, Computerized/*organization & administration and *Decision Making and *Information Dissemination and Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2015/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, clinicians are largely unfamiliar with principles supporting clinical use of this type of data. For example, genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme can alter the clinical effects of some opioid analgesics (e.g., codeine, tramadol), whereas variability in the CYP2C19 enzyme affects the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. If testing is performed, patients who are ultrarapid or poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 should avoid codeine use (and possibly tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone) because of the potential for increased toxicity or lack of effectiveness. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes who are known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 should consider alternate antiplatelet therapy (e.g., ticagrelor, prasugrel). Some guidelines are available that address appropriate drug therapy changes, and others are in development.

Hospitalization improves quality of care, yet admission rates for TIA patients vary considerably. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify factors associated with the decision to admit patents with TIA. DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of a prior study's data including semi-structured interviews, administrative data, and chart review. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed multidisciplinary clinical staff involved with TIA care. Administrative data included information for TIA patients in emergency departments or inpatient settings at VA medical centers (VAMCs) for fiscal years (FY) 2011 and 2014. Chart reviews were conducted on a subset of patients from 12 VAMCs in FY 2011. APPROACH: For the qualitative data, we focused on interviewees' responses to the prompt: ""Tell me what influences you in the decision to or not to admit TIA patients."" We used administrative data to identify admission rates and chart review data to identify ABCD(2) scores (a tool to classify stroke risk after TIA). KEY RESULTS: Providers' decisions to admit TIA patients were related to uncertainty in several domains: lack of a facility TIA-specific policy, inconsistent use of ABCD(2) score, and concerns about facilities' ability to complete a timely workup. There was a disconnect between staff perceptions about TIA admission and facility admission rates. According to chart review data, staff at facilities with higher admission rates in FY 2011 reported consistent reliance on ABCD(2) scores and related guidelines in admission decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Many factors contributed to decisions regarding admitting a patient with TIA; however, clinicians' uncertainty appeared to be a key driver.

Public deliberation helps gather input on these types of issues by convening a group of diverse individuals to learn about and discuss values-based dilemmas. OBJECTIVE: To explore public perceptions of health care costs and how they intersect with medical mistrust. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This mixed-methods study analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial including four public deliberation groups (n = 96) and a control group (n = 348) comprising English-speaking adults aged 18 years and older. Data were collected in 2012 in four U.S. regions. APPROACH: We used data from four survey items to compare attitude shifts about costs among participants in deliberation groups to participants in the control group. We qualitatively analyzed deliberation transcripts to identify themes related to attitude shifts and to provide context for quantitative results about attitude shifts. KEY RESULTS: Deliberation participants were significantly more likely than control group participants to agree that doctors and patients should consider cost when making treatment decisions (<ce><b2> = 0.59; p < 0.01) and that people should consider the effect on group premiums when making treatment decisions (<ce><b2> = 0.48; p < 0.01). Qualitatively, participants mistrusted the health care system's profit motives (e.g., that systems prioritize making money over patient needs); however, after grappling with patient/doctor autonomy and learning about and examining their own views related to costs during the process of deliberation, they largely concluded that payers have the right to set some boundaries to curb costs. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are informed about costs may be receptive to boundaries that reduce societal health care costs, despite their mistrust of the health care system's profit motives, especially if decision makers communicate their rationale in a transparent manner.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether physicians' judgment is affected by another medical opinion given to a patient. DESIGN: Orthopedic surgeons and neurologists filled out questionnaires presenting eight hypothetical clinical scenarios with suggested treatments. One group of physicians (in each specialty) was told what the other physician's opinion was (study group), and the other group was not told what it was (control group). PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 332 physicians in Israel: 172 orthopedic surgeons (45.9% of their population) and 160 neurologists (64.0% of their population). MEASUREMENTS: Scoring was by choice of less or more interventional treatment in the scenarios. We used <cf><87>(2) tests and repeated measures ANOVA to compare these scores between the two groups. We also fitted a cumulative ordinal regression to account for the dependence within each physician's responses. RESULTS: Orthopedic surgeons in the study group chose a more interventionist treatment when the other physician suggested an intervention than those in the control group [F (1, 170) =4.6, p=0.03; OR=1.437, 95% CI 1.115-1.852]. Evaluating this effect separately in each scenario showed that in four out of the eight scenarios, they chose a more interventional treatment when the other physician suggested an intervention (scenario 1, p=0.039; scenario 2, p<0.001; scenario 3, p=0.033; scenario 6, p<0.001). These effects were insignificant among the neurologists [F (1,158) =0.44, p=0.51; OR=1.087, 95% CI 0.811-1.458]. In both specialties there were no differences in responses by level of clinical experience [orthopedic surgeons: F (2, 166) =0.752, p=0.473; neurologists: F (2,154) =1.951, p=0.146]. CONCLUSIONS: The exploratory survey showed that in some cases physicians' judgments may be affected by other physicians' opinions, but unaffected in other cases.

DESIGN: Medical residents diagnosed 16 medical cases (pass 1). Participants were then given the opportunity to reflect on each case and revise their diagnoses (pass 2). PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven medical Residents in post-graduate year (PGY) 1, 2 and 3 were recruited from Hamilton Health Care Centres. MAIN MEASURES: Diagnoses were scored as 0 (incorrect), 1 (partially correct) and 2 (correct). Accuracies and response times in pass 1 were analyzed using an ANOVA with three factors-PGY, Decision to revise yes/no, and Case 1-16, averaged across residents. The extent to which additional reflection affected accuracy was examined by analyzing only those cases that were revised, using a repeated measures ANOVA, with pass 1 or 2 as a within subject factor, and PGY and Case or Resident as a between-subject factor. KEY RESULTS: The mean score at pass 1 for each level was PGY1, 1.17 (SE 0.50); PGY2, 1.35 (SE 0.67) and PGY3, 1.27 (SE 0.94). While there was a trend for increased accuracy with level, this did not achieve significance. The number of residents at each level who revised at least one diagnosis was 12/19 PGY1 (63 %), 9/11 PGY2 (82 %) and 8/17 PGY3 (47 %). Only 8 % of diagnoses were revised resulting in a small but significant increase in scores from Pass 1 to 2, from 1.20/2 to 1.22 /2 (t = 2.15, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participants did engage in self-directed reflection for incorrect diagnoses; however, this strategy provided minimal benefits compared to knowing the correct answer.

Our objective was to systematically review the criteria for futility and the strength of empirical evidence across clinical studies that purport to support or refute claims of futility. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched for relevant articles published between 1980 and 2008. Selected studies reported original outcome data in critically ill or cardiac arrest patients and claimed that these data can support or refute decisions to limit treatment in comparable patients. Two authors independently abstracted data on patient characteristics, intervention, outcomes, cost, and design. RESULTS: Forty seven studies supporting a claim of futility and 45 refuting it were reviewed. Median point estimate for adverse outcome in studies supporting claims of futility was 100% (range 75% to 100%); median lower 95% confidence limit was 91% (range 48% to 99%). Explicit thresholds for futility were missing in 88% of articles. The original criteria for quantitative futility were fulfilled by only 28% of data, and almost exclusively in studies of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest. Substantial statistical overlap was observed between data brought in support of futility claims and data brought to refute them. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies that purport to guide determinations of futility are based on insufficient data to provide statistical confidence for clinical decision-making. They usually lack explicit a priori thresholds for determination of futility. Many studies draw disparate conclusions based on statistically similar data. In most circumstances these problems preclude confident determinations of futility.",2010,10.1007/s11606-010-1445-3,25,10,1083-1089,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and Treatment Outcome and Critical Illness/*therapy and *Medical Futility and *Empirical Research,NA,NA,2010/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

M.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Managing depression in primary care settings has increased with the rise of integrated models of care, such as patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs). The relationship between patient experience in PCMH settings and receipt of depression treatment is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In a large sample of Veterans diagnosed with depression, we examined whether positive PCMH experiences predicted subsequent initiation or continuation of treatment for depression. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a lagged cross-sectional study of depression treatment among Veterans with depression diagnoses (n = 27,362) in the years before (Y1) and after (Y2) they completed the Veterans Health Administration's national 2013 PCMH Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed patient experiences in four domains, each categorized as positive/moderate/negative. Depression treatment, determined from administrative records, was defined annually as 90 days of antidepressant medications or six psychotherapy visits. Multivariable logistic regressions measured associations between PCMH experiences and receipt of depression treatment in Y2, accounting for treatment in Y1. KEY RESULTS: Among those who did not receive depression treatment in Y1 (n = 4613), positive experiences in three domains (comprehensiveness, shared decision-making, self-management support) predicted greater initiation of treatment in Y2. Among those who received depression treatment in Y1 (n = 22,749), positive or moderate experiences in four domains (comprehensiveness, care coordination, medication decision-making, self-management support) predicted greater continuation of treatment in Y2.

OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines the way in which Research Ethics Boards (REBs; Institutional Review Boards) and clinical biochemists (CBs; laboratory medicine specialists) differ in their interpretation of what is research and what should be considered common practice versus innovation versus experimentation when introducing new procedures with patients. It also explores whether these groups agree on who is responsible for the ethical review of new procedures. METHODS: A validated case scenario for the introduction of a new diagnostic test into clinical practice was sent to CBs and REBs across Canada. Participants were asked to determine whether the scenario constituted research; whether the test procedure should be considered as experimental, innovative, or commonly accepted care; and whether the project required approval by a REB and, if not, who should be responsible for ethical review. RESULTS: Results showed 81% of 37 CBs and 52% of 27 REBs identified the scenario as research. Responsibility for ethical review was assigned to REBs by 44% of REBs and 54% of CBs. Of all participants, 53% classified the test procedure as 'innovative', 8% as 'experimental', whereas 17% classified it as 'commonly accepted'.

PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients aged 65 or older (n = 106, response rate = 27%). INTERVENTIONS: In the ""withhold"" version of the survey, participants indicated situations where they would want treatments withheld (i.e., the default preference was in favor of treatment). In the ""provide"" version, participants indicated situations where they would want treatment provided (i.e., the default preference was against treatment). In the forced-choice control version, participants made an explicit decision to withhold or provide treatment for each situation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Participants' treatment preferences. RESULTS: Preferences differed by condition, F(2, 103) = 3.61, MSE = 0.09, eta2 = .07, p = .03. Participants tended to express the default preference, and thus, were more likely to favor treatment in the ""withhold"" condition than in the ""provide"" condition.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the sensitivity and speed of ""Isabel"" (Isabel Healthcare Inc., USA), a new web-based clinical decision support system designed to suggest the correct diagnosis in complex medical cases involving adults. METHODS: We tested 50 consecutive Internal Medicine case records published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We first either manually entered 3 to 6 key clinical findings from the case (recommended approach) or pasted in the entire case history. The investigator entering key words was aware of the correct diagnosis. We then determined how often the correct diagnosis was suggested in the list of 30 differential diagnoses generated by the clinical decision support system. We also evaluated the speed of data entry and results recovery. RESULTS: The clinical decision support system suggested the correct diagnosis in 48 of 50 cases (96%) with key findings entry, and in 37 of the 50 cases (74%) if the entire case history was pasted in. Pasting took seconds, manual entry less than a minute, and results were provided within 2-3 seconds with either approach.

Guidelines recommend that physicians assess the risks of opioids and discuss them with patients when considering opioid use. There are no studies examining patient- and prescribing-related risk factors for opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) in hospitalized medical patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify independent risk factors for severe ORADEs in hospitalized medical patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Medical patients hospitalized at US, non-federal, and acute care facilities, with at least one pharmacy charge for an opioid during hospitalization. We excluded patients with metastatic malignancy, hospice, or palliative care billing codes. MAIN MEASURES: We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to identify risk factors for severe ORADEs, defined by a pharmacy charge for naloxone. Candidate risk factors were chosen a priori, based on clinical grounds and prior literature. KEY RESULTS: Among 731,208 hospitalizations (median age 60, 56.5% female), a severe ORADE occurred in 2727 (0.4%). Independent risk factors included patient characteristics (advanced age, female gender), comorbidities (congestive heart failure, opioid abuse/dependence, non-opioid drug abuse/dependence, psychosis, depression, obstructive sleep apnea), organ failures on admission (respiratory failure, shock/hypotension, renal failure, hepatic failure, acidosis, and neurologic failure), medication co-administrations (antipsychotics and short-acting benzodiazepines), and characteristics of the opioid prescriptions themselves (total dose for the day, parenteral route of administration, and receipt of multiple types of opioids in a day). Although a risk prediction model derived from these factors performed well on stratified k-fold cross-validation (average c-statistics 0.68-0.71), the low incidence of the outcome limited the positive predictive value of the risk score.

The lack of an objective measure has limited the study of ownership in physicians. OBJECTIVE: To develop an instrument to measure psychological ownership of patient care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Internal medicine trainees in a large, academic hospital completing an inpatient rotation. MAIN MEASURES: Our scale prototype adapted an existing ownership scale (developed in the non-medical setting) based on themes identified in qualitative studies of patient care ownership. We conducted cognitive interviews to determine face validity of the scale items. Our finalized scale measures ownership's key constructs: advocacy, responsibility, accountability, follow-through, knowledge, communication, initiative, continuity of care, autonomy, and perceived ownership. We distributed an online, anonymous, 46-question survey to 219 residents; 192 residents completed the survey; and 166 responses were included in the analysis. We calculated Cronbach's <ce><b1> to determine the scale's internal consistency. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore possible subscales. We examined construct validity using bivariate and correlational analysis. KEY RESULTS: The 15-item ownership scale demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's <ce><b1> = 0.89). We identified three possible subscales corresponding to assertiveness, being the ""go-to"" person, and diligence. Training level and prior intensive care unit experience significantly predicted ownership (p < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between ownership and age, gender, inpatient service type, call schedule, patient turnover, or supervisory experience of the attending physician. We found a significant negative correlation between ownership and perceived degree of burnout (r = - 0.33), depression (r = - 0.24), detachment (r = - 0.35), and frustration (r = - 0.31) and a significant positive association between ownership and fulfillment (r = 0.37) and happiness (r = 0.36). CONCLUSION: We developed an instrument to quantify patient care ownership in residents. Our scale demonstrates good internal consistency and preliminary evidence of validity.

This study explores the perspectives of the older patients affected by this change. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two lists of patients older than 60 years from the original office were generated: (1) those who had followed their PCPs to the further practice and (2) those who chose new PCPs at an affiliated nearby clinic. One hundred forty patients from each of the two lists were randomly selected for study. MEASUREMENT: Eight months after the clinic's closure, patients responded to an open-ended question asking patients to describe the transition. Using content analysis, two investigators independently coded all of the written responses. RESULTS: Over 85% of patients in both groups had been with their original PCP for longer than 2 years. Patients that elected to transition their care to a new PCP within their community were older (75 vs 70 years) and more likely to be living alone (38% vs 18%), both p < 0.01. There was still considerable frustration associated with the clinic's closure. Patients from both groups had variable levels of satisfaction with their new primary care arrangements. Patients who moved to the near clinic, now seeing a new physician, commented on being satisfied with the proximity of the site. On the other hand, these patients also expressed longing for the previous arrangement (the building, the staff, and especially their prior physician). Patients who transferred their care to the further clinic indicated a profound loyalty to their PCP and an appreciation of the added features at the new site. Yet, many patients still described being upset with the difficulties associated with the further distance. CONCLUSION: The closing of this practice was difficult for this cohort of older patients.

Sacha and Saini, Sameer D.",Journal of general internal medicine,"IMPORTANCE: Studies of interventions to reduce low-value care are increasingly common. However, little is known about how the effects of such interventions are measured. OBJECTIVE: To characterize measures used to assess interventions to reduce low-value care. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and Web of Science to identify studies published between 2010 and 2016 that examined the effects of interventions to reduce low-value care. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing studies. We extracted data on characteristics of studies, interventions, and measures. We then developed a framework to classify measures into the following categories: utilization (e.g., number of tests ordered), outcome (e.g., mortality), appropriateness (e.g., overuse of antibiotics), patient-reported (e.g., satisfaction), provider-reported (e.g., satisfaction), patient-provider interaction (e.g., informed decision-making elements), value, and cost. We also determined whether each measure was designed to assess unintended consequences. FINDINGS: A total of 1805 studies were identified, of which 101 published and 16 ongoing studies were included. Of published studies (N = 101), 68% included at least one measure of utilization, 41% of an outcome, 52% of appropriateness, 36% of cost, 8% patient-reported, and 3% provider-reported. Funded studies were more likely to use patient-reported measures (17% vs 0%). Of ongoing studies (registered trials) (N = 16), 69% included at least one measure of utilization, 75% of an outcome, 50% of appropriateness, 19% of cost, 50% patient-reported, 13% provider-reported, and 6% patient-provider interaction. Of published studies, 34% included at least one measure of an unintended consequence as compared to 63% of ongoing studies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most published studies focused on reductions in utilization rather than on clinically meaningful measures (e.g., improvements in appropriateness, patient-reported outcomes) or unintended consequences.

The most promising interventions for increasing depression treatment initiation in primary care settings remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of publicly available databases from inception through August 2017 to identify interventions designed to increase depression treatment initiation. Two authors independently selected, extracted data, and rated risk of bias from included studies. Eligible studies used a randomized or pre-post design and assessed depression treatment initiation (i.e., <e2><89><a5> 1 mental health visit or antidepressant fill) among adults, the majority of whom met criteria for depression. Interventions were classified as simple or complex and sub-classified into intervention strategies that were graded for strength of evidence. RESULTS: Of 9516 articles identified, we included 14 unique studies representing 16 (4 simple and 12 complex) interventions and 8 treatment initiation strategies. We found low to moderate strength of evidence for collaborative/integrated care (3 studies), treatment preference matching (2 studies), and case management (2 studies) strategies. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of cultural tailoring (2 studies), motivation (alone, with reminders or with cultural tailoring (5 studies)), education (1 study), and shared decision-making strategies (1 study). Overall, we found moderate strength of evidence for complex interventions (8 of 12 complex interventions demonstrated statistically significant effects on treatment initiation). DISCUSSION: Collaborative/integrated care, preference treatment matching, and case management strategies had the best evidence for improving depression treatment initiation, but none of the strategies had high strength of evidence. While primary care settings can consider using some of these strategies when referring depressed patients to treatment, our review highlights the need for further rigorous research in this area.",2018,10.1007/s11606-018-4554-z,33,11,1978-1989,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Humans and depression and Treatment Outcome and primary healthcare and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods and Depression/*diagnosis/psychology/*therapy and Early Medical Intervention/*methods/trends and patient engagement/participation and Primary Health Care/*methods/trends,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of and factors associated with physicians' moral distress caring for patients requiring a surrogate. DESIGN: Prospective survey. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians (n = 154) caring for patients aged 65 years and older and their surrogate decision-makers (n = 362 patient/surrogate dyads). Patients were admitted to medicine or medical intensive care services, lacked decisional capacity and had an identified surrogate. MAIN MEASURES: Moral distress thermometer. KEY RESULTS: Physicians experienced moral distress in the care of 152 of 362 patients (42.0%). In analyses adjusted for physician, patient, and surrogate characteristics, physician/surrogate discordance in preferences for the plan of care was not significantly associated with moral distress. Physicians were more likely to experience moral distress when caring for older patients (1.06, 1.02-1.10), and facing a decision about life-sustaining treatment (3.58, 1.54-8.32). Physicians were less likely to experience moral distress when caring for patients residing in a nursing home (0.40, 0.23-0.69), patients who previously discussed care preferences (0.56, 0.35-0.90), and higher surrogate ratings of emotional support from clinicians (0.94, 0.89-0.99). Physicians' internal discordance when they prefer a more comfort-focused plan than the patient is receiving was associated with significantly higher moral distress (2.22, 1.33-3.70) after adjusting for patient, surrogate, and physician characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Physician moral distress occurs more frequently when the physician is male, the patient is older or requires decisions about life-sustaining treatments. These findings may help target interventions to support physicians. Prior discussions about patient wishes is associated with lower distress and may be a target for patient-centered interventions.",2020,10.1007/s11606-020-05652-1,35,5,1405-1412,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Patients and Humans and Male and Aged and Prospective Studies and Morals and *Physicians and *Decision Making and surrogate decision-making and geriatric patients and physician moral distress,NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ackerman_2020_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Comparing Patients' Experiences with Electronic and Traditional Consultation: Results from a Multisite Survey,"Ackerman, Sara L. and Gleason, Nathaniel and Shipman, Scott A.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: There have been no large-scale studies to date of patients' experiences with electronic consultation (eConsult) between primary and specialty care. OBJECTIVE: Compare experiences with eConsult and referral for in-person specialist consultation. DESIGN: Online survey 2-6 weeks following eConsult or referral at 9 US academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with no more than one eConsult or referral order from a primary care provider (PCP) in the prior month. Over 9 months, 29,291 email invitations were sent (88% referral; 12% eConsult). MAIN MEASURES: Trust in and satisfaction with PCP; consult type awareness; agreement with decision to seek specialist input; timeliness of care; mode of PCP-patient eConsult communication; satisfaction with specialist's recommendations; future preference for eConsult or referral. KEY RESULTS: A 27.6% response rate yielded 8087 respondents (88.4% referral; 11.6% eConsult). Many did not know that their PCP had placed a referral (32.8% unaware) or eConsult (52.9%), and eConsult awareness was significantly higher among patients reporting better health (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.18-2.23). Most (81.4% eConsult; 82.0% referral) were satisfied with the specialist's recommendations. Those who had a good primary care experience were more likely to be satisfied (eConsult: OR 10.63, 95% CI 2.95-38.32; referral: OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.86-4.44). For a similar problem in the future, 78% of eConsult and 32% percent of referral patients preferred eConsult. CONCLUSIONS: This multisite study demonstrates that many patients find virtual consultation to be an acceptable strategy for the management of their medical condition and that trust and confidence in one's PCP are crucial ingredients for a satisfying eConsult experience. The lack of awareness of eConsult among many patients who were beneficiaries of the service warrants an increased effort to include patients in eConsult decision-making and communication.

Segal_2012_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Chapter 3: choosing the important outcomes for a systematic review of a medical test,"Segal, Jodi B.",Journal of general internal medicine,"In this chapter of the Evidence-based Practice Centers Methods Guide for Medical Tests, we describe how the decision to use a medical test generates a broad range of outcomes and that each of these outcomes should be considered for inclusion in a systematic review. Awareness of these varied outcomes affects how a decision maker balances the benefits and risks of the test; therefore, a systematic review should present the evidence on these diverse outcomes. The key outcome categories include clinical management outcomes and direct health effects; emotional, social, cognitive, and behavioral responses to testing; legal and ethical outcomes, and costs. We describe the challenges of incorporating these outcomes in a systematic review, suggest a framework for generating potential outcomes for inclusion, and describe the role of stakeholders in choosing the outcomes for study. Finally, we give examples of systematic reviews that either included a range of outcomes or that might have done so. The following are the key messages in this chapter: Consider both the outcomes that are relevant to the process of testing and those that are relevant to the results of the test. Consider inclusion of outcomes in all five domains: clinical management effects, direct test effects; emotional, social, cognitive and behavioral effects; legal and ethical effects, and costs. Consider to which group the outcomes of testing are most relevant. Given resource limitations, prioritize which outcomes to include.

Garcia.Retamero_2010_Joofgeinme,JOUR,How to reduce the effect of framing on messages about health,"Garcia-Retamero, Rocio and Galesic, Mirta",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Patients must be informed about risks before any treatment can be implemented. Yet serious problems in communicating these risks occur because of framing effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of different information frames when communicating health risks to people with high and low numeracy and determine whether these effects can be countered or eliminated by using different types of visual displays (i.e., icon arrays, horizontal bars, vertical bars, or pies). DESIGN: Experiment on probabilistic, nationally representative US (n = 492) and German (n = 495) samples, conducted in summer 2008. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' risk perceptions of the medical risk expressed in positive (i.e., chances of surviving after surgery) and negative (i.e., chances of dying after surgery) terms. KEY RESULTS: Although low-numeracy people are more susceptible to framing than those with high numeracy, use of visual aids is an effective method to eliminate its effects. However, not all visual aids were equally effective: pie charts and vertical and horizontal bars almost completely removed the effect of framing. Icon arrays, however, led to a smaller decrease in the framing effect. CONCLUSIONS: Difficulties with understanding numerical information often do not reside in the mind, but in the representation of the problem.",2010,10.1007/s11606-010-1484-9,25,12,1323-1329,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Health and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Risk Factors and *Communication and United States/epidemiology and Patient Education as Topic/*methods and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Germany/epidemiology and Health Surveys/*methods",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

The PCMH model is a departure from more traditional models of healthcare delivery and requires significant transformation to be realized. OBJECTIVE: To describe factors shaping mental models and practice culture driving the PCMH transformation process in a large multi-payer PCMH demonstration project. DESIGN: Individual interviews were conducted at 17 primary care practices in South Eastern Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 118 individual interviews were conducted with clinicians (N = 47), patient educators (N = 4), office administrators (N = 12), medical assistants (N = 26), front office staff (N = 7), nurses (N = 4), care managers (N = 11), social workers (N = 4), and other stakeholders (N = 3). A multi-disciplinary research team used a grounded theory approach to develop the key constructs describing factors shaping successful practice transformation. KEY RESULTS: Three central themes emerged from the data related to changes in practice culture and mental models necessary for PCMH practice transformation: 1) shifting practice perspectives towards proactive, population-oriented care based in practice-patient partnerships; 2) creating a culture of self-examination; and 3) challenges to developing new roles within the practice through distribution of responsibilities and team-based care. The most tension in shifting the required mental models was displayed between clinician and medical assistant participants, revealing significant barriers towards moving away from clinician-centric care. CONCLUSIONS: Key factors driving the PCMH transformation process require shifting mental models at the individual level and culture change at the practice level. Transformation is based upon structural and process changes that support orientation of practice mental models towards perceptions of population health, self-assessment, and the development of shared decision-making. Staff buy-in to the new roles and responsibilities driving PCMH transformation was described as central to making sustainable change at the practice level; however, key barriers related to clinician autonomy appeared to interfere with the formation of team-based care.",2013,10.1007/s11606-013-2415-3,28,9,1195-1201,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Organizational Innovation and Models, Organizational and Pennsylvania and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Models, Psychological and Patient-Centered Care/*organization & administration and Diagnostic Self Evaluation and Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration and *Organizational Culture and Primary Health Care/organization & administration and Health Services Research/methods and Patient Care Team/trends and Health Care Reform/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2013/09//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Perspectives of medical inpatients","Downar, James and Luk, Tracy and Sibbald, Robert W. and Santini, Tatiana and Mikhael, Joseph and Berman, Hershl and Hawryluck, Laura",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: The majority of patients who die in hospital have a ""Do Not Resuscitate"" (DNR) order in place at the time of their death, yet we know very little about why some patients request or agree to a DNR order, why others don't, and how they view discussions of resuscitation status. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews of English-speaking medical inpatients who had clearly requested a DNR or full code (FC) order after a discussion with their admitting team, and analyzed the transcripts using a modified grounded-theory approach. RESULTS: We achieved conceptual saturation after conducting 44 interviews (27 DNR, 17 FC) over a 4-month period. Patients in the DNR group were much older than those in the FC group, but they had broadly similar admission diagnoses and comorbidities. DNR patients reported much greater familiarity with the subject and described a more positive experience than FC patients with their resuscitation discussions. Participants typically requested FC or DNR orders based on personal, relational or philosophical considerations, but these considerations manifested differently depending on the participant's preference for resuscitation. Most FC patients stated that would not want a prolonged period of life support, and they would not want resuscitation in the event of a poor quality of life. FC and DNR patients understood resuscitation and DNR orders differently. DNR patients described resuscitation in graphic, concrete terms that emphasized suffering and futility, and DNR orders in terms of comfort or natural processes. FC patients understood resuscitation in an abstract sense as something that restores life, while DNR orders were associated with substandard care or even euthanasia. CONCLUSION: Our study identified important differences and commonalities between the perspectives of DNR and FC patients. We hope that this information can be used to help physicians better understand the needs of their patients when discussing resuscitation.",2011,10.1007/s11606-010-1616-2,26,6,582-587,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Choice Behavior and Resuscitation Orders/*psychology and Inpatients/education/*psychology",NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence suggests that preferences for prognostic information may be culturally determined. Yet little is known about the preferences of diverse elders for discussing prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the preferences for discussing prognosis of a diverse sample of older adults with late-life disability. DESIGN & PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 60 older adults with mean age 78 and mean 2.5 Activities of Daily Living dependencies. Participants were recruited from San Francisco's On Lok program, the first Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). Participants were interviewed in English, Spanish, and Cantonese, and responded to scenarios in which their doctors estimated they had 5 years and 1 year left to live. Open-ended questions explored the reasons for their responses. Results were analyzed qualitatively using grounded theory. KEY RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of participants wanted to discuss the prognosis if their doctor estimated they had <5 years to live and 75% if the estimate was <1 year. Three themes were prominent among patients who wanted to discuss prognosis: to prepare, to make the most of the life they had left, and to make medical or health-related decisions. Those who preferred not to discuss prognosis described emotional difficulty, the uncertainty of prognosis, or that it would not be useful. Nearly all participants said that doctors should not make assumptions based on race or ethnicity, though differences between ethnic groups emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in this diverse sample of disabled elders were interested in discussing prognosis, while a substantial minority was not. Among those participants who preferred to discuss prognosis, many said that prognostic information would be important as they made difficult medical and personal decisions in late-life.

OBJECTIVE: To describe how primary care physicians (PCPs) discuss and make clinical recommendations about genome sequencing results. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis. PARTICIPANTS: PCPs and their generally healthy patients undergoing genome sequencing. APPROACH: Patients received clinical genome reports that included four categories of results: monogenic disease risk variants (if present), carrier status, five pharmacogenetics results, and polygenic risk estimates for eight cardiometabolic traits. Patients' office visits with their PCPs were audio-recorded, and summative content analysis was used to describe how PCPs discussed genomic results. KEY RESULTS: For each genomic result discussed in 48 PCP-patient visits, we identified a ""take-home"" message (recommendation), categorized as continuing current management, further treatment, further evaluation, behavior change, remembering for future care, or sharing with family members. We analyzed how PCPs came to each recommendation by identifying 1) how they described the risk or importance of the given result and 2) the rationale they gave for translating that risk into a specific recommendation. Quantitative analysis showed that continuing current management was the most commonly coded recommendation across results overall (492/749, 66%) and for each individual result type except monogenic disease risk results. Pharmacogenetics was the most common result type to prompt a recommendation to remember for future care (94/119, 79%); carrier status was the most common type prompting a recommendation to share with family members (45/54, 83%); and polygenic results were the most common type prompting a behavior change recommendation (55/58, 95%). One-fifth of recommendation codes associated with monogenic results were for further evaluation (6/24, 25%). Rationales for these recommendations included patient context, family context, and scientific/clinical limitations of sequencing.

Kripke_2018_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,Adults with Developmental Disabilities: A Comprehensive Approach to Medical Care,"Kripke, Clarissa",American family physician,"Developmental disabilities are attributable to a cognitive impairment, physical impairment, or both. They manifest during the developmental period from birth to early adulthood, and are likely to continue indefinitely. The life expectancy of most persons with developmental disabilities now approaches that of the general population. According to the neurodiversity model of care, developmental disability is accepted as a valued part of human neurologic diversity. The social model focuses on improving participation in society with accommodations such as adaptive equipment or improvements to the social and physical environment. The goal of health care for patients with developmental disabilities is to improve their well-being, function, and participation in family and community. Physicians should communicate directly with their patients, even those who have communication or cognitive differences. Communication may include speech, sign language, writing, letter boards, voice output devices, pictures, facial expressions, gestures, vocalizations, and behavior. Supported decision making is a paradigm, support practice, and emerging legal structure that focuses on assisting patients with communicating their wants and needs as an alternative to guardianship or power of attorney. When establishing care, it is critical to get a detailed history of baseline traits and characteristics in the areas of cognition and communication; neuromuscular function; sensory function such as vision, hearing, and sensory processing; seizure threshold; mental health; and behavior. In general, guidelines for age-appropriate health maintenance in the general population should be followed unless the risk outweighs the benefit for an individual patient. With accurate diagnosis, psychiatric conditions can be treated effectively with the same medical, behavioral, and therapeutic modalities used in the general population.

Mulhem_2015_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,Prostate Cancer Screening,"Mulhem, Elie and Fulbright, Nikolaus and Duncan, Norah",American family physician,"Among American men, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has been used to screen for prostate cancer for more than 25 years, the test has low sensitivity and specificity, and there is no clear evidence for determining what threshold warrants prostate biopsy. Only one of five randomized controlled trials of PSA screening showed an effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality, and the absolute reduction in deaths from prostate cancer was one per 781 men screened after 13 years of follow-up. None of the trials showed benefit in all-cause mortality, and screening increased prostate cancer diagnoses by about 60%. Harms of screening include adverse effects from prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and anxiety. One-half of screen-detected prostate cancers will not cause symptoms in the patient's lifetime, and 80% to 85% of men who choose observation will not die from prostate cancer within 15 years. Adverse effects of radical prostatectomy include perioperative complications, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Radiation therapy can cause acute toxicity leading to urinary urgency, dysuria, diarrhea, and rectal pain; late toxicity includes erectile dysfunction, rectal bleeding, and urethral stricture.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how patients think about the harms and benefits of overused screening tests and how they consider these and other factors when making decisions. DESIGN: Semi-structured, qualitative interviews. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 50 patients, ages 50-84, who had previously received or not received any of four overused screening services: 1) prostate cancer screening (men ages 50-69), 2) colon cancer screening (men and women ages 76-85), 3) osteoporosis screening (low-risk women ages 50-64), or 4) cardiovascular disease screening (low-risk men and women ages 50-85). APPROACH: We conducted a thematic analysis, using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Two independent coders analyzed interview transcriptions to identify themes and exemplifying quotes. KEY RESULTS: Many patients could not name a harm of screening. When they did name harms, patients often focused on only the harms of the screening test itself and rarely mentioned harms further along the screening cascade (e.g., from follow-up testing and treatment). In contrast, patients could easily name benefits of screening, although many seemed to misunderstand or overestimate the magnitude of the benefits. Furthermore, patients described many additional factors they considered when making screening decisions, including their clinicians' recommendations, their age, family or friends' experiences with disease, and insurance coverage.

Patients were excluded if both a CPS and a physician were involved in the index visit, or they were enrolled in Home Based Primary Care, or if they displayed non-adherence to the plan. MAIN MEASURES: All data were obtained from review of electronic medical records. Outcomes included whether a patient received medication intensification at the index visit, and as the main measure, blood pressures between the index and next consecutive visit. KEY RESULTS: All patients had medication intensification. Patients receiving CPS-directed RNCM had greater decreases in systolic blood pressure compared to those receiving physician-directed RNCM (14 <c2><b1> 13 mmHg versus 10 <c2><b1> 11 mmHg; p = 0.04). After adjusting for the time between visits, initial systolic blood pressure, and prior stroke, provider type was no longer significant (p = 0.24). Change in diastolic blood pressure and attainment of blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg were similar between groups (p = 0.93, p = 0.91, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CPS-directed and physician-directed RNCM for hypertension demonstrated similar blood pressure reduction. These results support the utilization of CPSs as prescribers to support RNCM for chronic diseases.",2014,10.1007/s11606-014-2774-4,29 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,681-S675,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cooperative Behavior and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Hypertension/diagnosis/*therapy and *Case Management/standards and *Hospitals, Veterans/standards and *Nurses/standards and *Patient Care Team/standards and *Pharmacists/standards",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Koenig_2013_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Passing the baton: a grounded practical theory of handoff communication between multidisciplinary providers in two Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient settings,"Koenig, Christopher J. and Maguen, Shira and Daley, Aaron and Cohen, Greg and Seal, Karen H.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Handoffs are communication processes that enact the transfer of responsibility between providers across clinical settings. Prior research on handoff communication has focused on inpatient settings between provider teams and has emphasized patient safety. This study examines handoff communication within multidisciplinary provider teams in two outpatient settings. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an exploratory study that describes handoff communication among multidisciplinary providers, to develop a theory-driven descriptive framework for outpatient handoffs, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different handoff types. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 31 primary care, mental health, and social work providers in two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center outpatient clinics. APPROACH: Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Grounded Practical Theory to develop a theoretical model of and a descriptive framework for handoff communication among multidisciplinary providers. RESULTS: Multidisciplinary providers reported that handoff decisions across settings were made spontaneously and without clear guidelines. Two situated values, clinic efficiency and patient-centeredness, shaped multidisciplinary providers' handoff decisions. Providers reported three handoff techniques along a continuum: the electronic handoff, which was the most clinically efficient; the provider-to-provider handoff, which balanced clinic efficiency and patient-centeredness; and the collaborative handoff, which was the most patient-centered. Providers described handoff choice as a practical response to manage constituent features of clinic efficiency (time, space, medium of communication) and patient-centeredness (information continuity, management continuity, relational continuity, and social interaction). We present a theoretical and descriptive framework to help providers evaluate differential handoff use, reflect on situated values guiding clinic communication, and guide future research. CONCLUSIONS: Handoff communication reflected multidisciplinary providers' efforts to balance clinic efficiency with patient-centeredness within the constraints of day-to-day clinical practice. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses among alternative handoff options may enhance multidisciplinary provider handoff decision-making and may contribute to increased coordination and continuity of care across outpatient settings.",2013,10.1007/s11606-012-2167-5,28,1,41-50,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Communication and California and Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Models, Psychological and Patient Care Team/organization & administration and Continuity of Patient Care/*organization & administration and *Veterans and Patient-Centered Care/organization & administration and *Interprofessional Relations and Primary Health Care/organization & administration and Patient Transfer/*organization & administration and Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2013/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Women who have sex with women may be at disproportionate risk of obesity, tobacco use, substance use, mental health issues, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and some cancers. Disparities can exist throughout the lifetime. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents are vulnerable to bullying, family rejection, and risky sexual behavior that may lead to sexually transmitted infections or unintended pregnancy. Sexual minority stress, which is a response to stigmatization, prejudice, and internalized homophobia, contributes to many of these conditions. Family physicians should foster trust and communication to provide a nonjudgmental, welcoming environment supportive of culturally competent health care and optimal outcomes.

Gil",Journal of general internal medicine,"OBJECTIVE: There are few data available about factors which influence physicians' decisions to discharge patients from their practices. To study general internists' and family medicine physicians' attitudes and experiences in discharging patients from their practices. DESIGN: A cross-sectional mailed survey was used. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand general internists and family medicine physicians participated in this study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied the likelihood physicians would discharge 12 hypothetical patients from their practices, and whether they had actually discharged such patients. The effect of demographic data on the number of scenarios in which patients were likely to be discharged, and the number of patients actually discharged were analyzed via ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of 977 surveys received by subjects, 526 (54%) were completed and returned. A majority of respondents were willing to discharge patients in 5 of 12 hypothetical scenarios. Eighty-five percent had actually discharged at least one patient from their practices. Most respondents (71%) had discharged 10 or fewer patients, but 14% had discharged 11 to 200 patients. Respondents who were in private practice (p < 0.000001) were more likely to discharge both hypothetical and actual patients from their practices. Older physicians (> or =48 years old) were more likely to discharge actual patients from their practices (p = 0.005) as were physicians practicing in rural settings (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians in our sample were willing to discharge actual and hypothetical patients from their practices. This tendency may have significant implications for the initiation of pay-for-performance programs.

Gregory_2018_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,The Pregnant Patient: Managing Common Acute Medical Problems,"Gregory, David S. and Wu, Velyn and Tuladhar, Preyasha",American family physician,"Women often see their primary care physicians for common acute conditions during pregnancy. These conditions may be caused by pregnancy (obstetric problems) or worsened by pregnancy (obstetrically aggravated problems), or they may require special consideration during pregnancy because of maternal or fetal risks (nonobstetric problems). Primary care physicians should know the differential diagnosis for common conditions during pregnancy and recognize the important findings of obstetric and urgent nonobstetric problems. The family physician can evaluate and treat most nonobstetric problems, although obstetric problems require referral to a primary maternity care clinician. A tiered approach, including routinely looking for all-cause red flag symptoms and signs, while remaining aware of estimated gestational age, allows for high-quality care and shared decision making between the family physician and the pregnant patient. When treating common causes of nausea and epigastric pain/gastroesophageal reflux, lifestyle modifications are considered the safest and first-choice therapy, followed by well-established low-risk therapies, such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and doxylamine for nausea, and antacids not containing salicylates (found in bismuth combination products) for gastroesophageal reflux. Other common conditions during pregnancy are best treated with low-risk therapies, such as using antihistamines or topical steroids for rashes, first-generation cephalosporins or amoxicillin for cystitis, and physical therapy and acetaminophen for low back pain and headaches.",2018,NA,98,9,595-602,eng,1532-0650 0002-838X,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Acute Disease and Diagnosis, Differential and *Primary Health Care and Pregnancy Complications/*diagnosis/*therapy",NA,NA,2018/11/01/,Am Fam Physician,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present here a conceptual model of the potential role of behavioral tools in chronic disease control. Clinicians implicitly accept the assumption that patients will act rationally to maximize their self-interest. However, patients may not always be the rational actors that we imagine. Major behavioral barriers to optimal health behavior include patients' fear of threats to health, unwillingness to think about problems when risks are known or data are ambiguous, the discounting of risks that are far in the future, failure to act due to lack of motivation, insufficient confidence in the ability to overcome a health problem, and inattention due to pressures of everyday life. Financial incentives can stimulate initiation of health-promoting behaviors by reducing or eliminating financial barriers, but may not produce long-term behavior change without additional interventions. Strategies have been developed by behavioral economists and social psychologists to address each of these barriers to better decision-making. These include: labeling positive behaviors in ways consistent with patient life goals and priorities; greater focus on more immediate risks of chronic diseases; intermediate subgoals as steps to a large health goal; and implementation of specific plans as to when, where, and how an action will be taken. Such strategies hold promise for improving health behaviors and disease control, but most have not been studied in medical settings.

Jawad",American family physician,"Communication skills needed for patient-centered care include eliciting the patient's agenda with open-ended questions, especially early on; not interrupting the patient; and engaging in focused active listening. Understanding the patient's perspective of the illness and expressing empathy are key features of patient-centered communication. Understanding the patient's perspective entails exploring the patient's feelings, ideas, concerns, and experience regarding the impact of the illness, as well as what the patient expects from the physician. Empathy can be expressed by naming the feeling; communicating understanding, respect, and support; and exploring the patient's illness experience and emotions. Before revealing a new diagnosis, the patient's prior knowledge and preferences for the depth of information desired should be assessed. After disclosing a diagnosis, physicians should explore the patient's emotional response. Shared decision making empowers patients by inviting them to consider the pros and cons of different treatment options, including no treatment. Instead of overwhelming the patient with medical information, small chunks of data should be provided using repeated cycles of the ""ask-tell-ask"" approach.

OBJECTIVE: To describe participants' evaluation and utilization of print-based and web-based prostate cancer screening decision aids that were found to improve decisional outcomes in a prior randomized controlled trial. DESIGN: Men completed brief telephone interviews at baseline, one month, and 13 months post-randomization. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were primary care patients, 45-70 years old, who received the print-based (N = 628) or web-based decision aid (N = 625) and completed the follow-up assessments. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed men's baseline preference for web-based or print-based materials, time spent using the decision aids, comprehension of the overall message, and ratings of the content. KEY RESULTS: Decision aid use was self-reported by 64.3 % (web) and 81.8 % (print) of participants. Significant predictors of decision aid use were race (white vs. non-white, OR = 2.43, 95 % CI: 1.77, 3.35), higher education (OR = 1.68, 95 % CI: 1.06, 2.70) and trial arm (print vs. web, OR = 2.78, 95 % CI: 2.03, 3.83). Multivariable analyses indicated that web-arm participants were more likely to use the website when they preferred web-based materials (OR: 1.91, CI: 1.17, 3.12), whereas use of the print materials was not significantly impacted by a preference for print-based materials (OR: 0.69, CI: 0.38, 1.25). Comprehension of the decision aid message (i.e., screening is an individual decision) did not significantly differ between arms in adjusted analyses (print: 61.9 % and web: 68.2 %, p = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: Decision aid use was independently influenced by race, education, and the decision aid medium, findings consistent with the 'digital divide.'

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify whether particular CW recommendations were perceived by primary care providers as difficult to follow, difficult for patients to accept, or both. DESIGN: Two national surveys, one by mail to a random sample of 2000 U.S. primary care physicians in November 2013, and the second electronically to a random sample of 2500 VA primary care providers (PCPs) in October-December 2014. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 603 U.S. primary care physicians and 1173 VA primary care providers. Response rates were 34 and 48 %, respectively. MAIN MEASURES: PCP ratings of whether 12 CW recommendations for screening, testing and treatments applicable to adult primary care were difficult to follow and difficult for patients to accept; and ratings of potential barriers to reducing overutilization. KEY RESULTS: For four recommendations regarding not screening or testing in asymptomatic patients, less than 20 % of PCPs found the CW recommendations difficult to accept (range 7.2-16.6 %) or difficult for patients to follow (12.2-19.3 %). For five recommendations regarding testing or treatment for symptomatic conditions, however, there was both variation in reported difficulty to follow (9.8-32 %) and a high level of reported difficulty for patients to accept (35.7-87.1 %). The most frequently reported barriers to reducing overuse included malpractice concern, patient requests for services, lack of time for shared decision making, and the number of tests recommended by specialists.

Online platforms offer insights into potential drivers of high and low patient experience. OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze publicly available online review content of specialized drug treatment facilities and identify themes within high and low ratings. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of online ratings and reviews of specialized drug treatment facilities in Pennsylvania listed within the 2016 National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a machine learning approach to narrative text, was used to identify themes within reviews. Differential Language Analysis was then used to measure correlations between themes and star ratings. SETTING: Online reviews of Pennsylvania's specialized drug treatment facilities posted to Google and Yelp (July 2010-August 2018). RESULTS: A total of 7823 online ratings were posted over 8 years. The distribution was bimodal (43% 5-star and 34% 1-star). The average weighted rating of a facility was 3.3 stars. Online themes correlated with 5-star ratings were the following: focus on recovery (r = 0.53), helpfulness of staff (r = 0.43), compassionate care (r = 0.37), experienced a life-changing moment (r = 0.32), and staff professionalism (r = 0.29). Themes correlated with a 1-star rating were waiting time (r = 0.41), poor accommodations (0.26), poor phone communication (r = 0.24), medications given (0.24), and appointment availability (r = 0.23).

OBJECTIVE: To determine how patients' deductible levels and socioeconomic status may affect primary care physicians' recommendations for colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Screening recommendations were elicited using hypothetical vignettes from a national sample of 1,500 primary care physicians. Physicians were randomized to one of four vignettes describing a patient with either low or high socioeconomic status (SES) and either low- or high-deductible plan. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine how recommendations varied as a function of SES and deductible.

RESULTS: A total of 528 (49%) eligible physicians responded. Overall, 7.2% of physicians recommended inappropriate screening; 3.2% of patients with high SES in low-deductible plans received inappropriate screening recommendations and 11.4% of patients with low SES in high-deductible plans for an adjusted odds ratio of 0.22 (0.05-0.89). The odds of a colonoscopy recommendation were over ten times higher (AOR 11.46, 5.26-24.94) for patients with high SES in low-deductible plans compared to patients with low SES in high-deductible plans.

DESIGN: We used multinomial regression methods to estimate racial/ethnic differences in PCMH experiences reported on a 2013 national survey of Veterans Affairs patients. PARTICPANTS: Veterans with past-year MHSUD diagnoses (n = 65,930; 67 % White, 20 % Black, 11 % Hispanic, 1 % American Indian/Alaska Native[AI/AN], and 1 % Asian/Pacific Island[A/PI]). MAIN MEASURES: Positive and negative experiences from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) PCMH Survey. RESULTS: Veterans with MHSUDs reported the lowest frequency of positive experiences with access (22 %) and the highest frequency of negative experiences with self-management support (30 %) and comprehensiveness (16 %). Racial/ethnic differences (as compared to Whites) were observed in all seven healthcare domains (p values < 0.05). With access, Blacks and Hispanics reported more negative (Risk Differences [RDs] = 2 .0;3.6) and fewer positive (RDs = -2 .3;-2.3) experiences, while AI/ANs reported more negative experiences (RD = 5.7). In communication, Blacks reported fewer negative experiences (RD = -1.3); AI/ANs reported more negative (RD = 3.6) experiences; and AI/ANs and APIs reported fewer positive (RD = -6.5, -6.7) experiences. With office staff, Hispanics reported fewer positive experiences (RDs = -3.0); AI/ANs and A/PIs reported more negative experiences (RDs = 3.4; 3.7). For comprehensiveness, Blacks reported more positive experiences (RD = 3.6), and Hispanics reported more negative experiences (RD = 2.7). Both Blacks and Hispanics reported more positive (RDs = 2.3; 4.2) and fewer negative (RDs = -1.8; -1.9) provider ratings, and more positive experiences with decision making (RDs = 2.4; 3.0). Blacks reported more positive (RD = 3.9) and fewer negative (RD = -5.1) experiences with self-management support. CONCLUSIONS: In a national sample of Veterans with MHSUDs, potential deficiencies were observed in access, self-management support, and comprehensiveness. Racial/ethnic minorities reported worse experiences than Whites with access, comprehensiveness, communication, and office staff helpfulness/courtesy.",2016,10.1007/s11606-016-3776-1,31,12,1435-1443,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Random Allocation and Cohort Studies and patient-centered medical home and Aged, 80 and over and Primary Health Care/*methods and Veterans/*psychology and race and ethnicity and Ethnicity/psychology and health care experience and Mental Disorders/*ethnology/*psychology/therapy and mental health services and Mental Health/ethnology and Racial Groups/ethnology/psychology and Substance-Related Disorders/*ethnology/*psychology/therapy",NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical contexts and types of ethical concerns that arise in the care of patients with advanced kidney disease. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 28,568 Veterans with advanced kidney disease between 2000 and 2009 followed through death or 2011. EXPOSURE: Clinical scenarios that prompted clinicians to consider an ethics consultation as documented in the medical record. MAIN MEASURES: Dialysis initiation, dialysis discontinuation, receipt of an intensive procedure during the final month of life, and hospice enrollment. KEY RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 67.1 years, and the majority were male (98.5%) and white (59.0%). Clinicians considered an ethics consultation for 794 patients (2.5%) over a median follow-up period of 2.7 years. Ethical concerns involved code status (37.8%), dialysis (54.5%), other invasive treatments (40.6%), and noninvasive treatments (61.1%) and were related to conflicts between patients, their surrogates, and/or clinicians about treatment preferences (79.3%), who had authority to make healthcare decisions (65.9%), and meeting the care needs of patients versus obligations to others (10.6%).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate perceptions, preparedness, and knowledge among U.S. internists with regard to Ebola risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional Web-based national survey distributed by e-mail between December 2014 and January 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Practicing U.S. internists participating in a research panel representative of American College of Physicians (ACP) membership. MAIN MEASURES: Respondents' perceptions of Ebola, reported sources of information, and reported management of possible Ebola cases. The primary predictor was the possibility of encountering Ebola (based on respondents' geographic proximity to designated airports or confirmed Ebola cases, or on their patients' travel histories). Pre-specified outcomes included reported management intensity in clinical vignettes involving patients at low risk of symptomatic Ebola as well as reported Ebola preparedness. KEY RESULTS: The survey response rate was 46.1 %. Among the 202 respondents, 9.9 % (95 % CI 6.2-14.9 %) reported that they had recently evaluated a patient who had traveled to West Africa. Seventy percent (95 % CI 63.0-76.0 %) reported a practice-level protocol. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was the most popular source for Ebola information (75.2 %, 95 % CI 68.7-81.0 %). Most respondents felt very (45.0 %) or somewhat prepared (52.0 %) to communicate information about or diagnose Ebola, especially those with the possibility of encountering Ebola and those who reported medical journals, professional groups, or government as information sources. One-fifth of respondents (19.8 %, 95 % CI 14.5-26.0 %) reported overly intensive management for low-risk patients. Those with the possibility of encountering Ebola were less likely to report overly intensive management (3.1 vs. 22.9 %, p = 0.011).

Ray_2012_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Blood pressure monitoring technique impacts hypertension treatment,"Ray, Gretchen M. and Nawarskas, James J. and Anderson, Joe R.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: In 2005 the American Heart Association (AHA) released updated recommendations for blood pressure (BP) monitoring in order to ensure accurate BP measurements. OBJECTIVE: To determine if current methods of BP assessment in an ambulatory clinic result in significantly different BP measurements than those obtained by following the AHA recommendations and if these BP differences impact treatment decisions. RESEARCH DESIGN: Randomized prospective analysis. SETTING: University of New Mexico Hospital Adult Internal Medicine clinic. PATIENTS: Forty adults with hypertension METHODS: Patient BPs were measured using both the traditional triage method and the AHA-recommended method in cross-over fashion in random order. Two complete medical profile summaries were then constructed for each patient: one for each BP measurement obtained by each technique. These profiles were then reviewed by a panel of providers who provided hypothetical hypertension treatment recommendations. RESULTS: Individual BP results varied greatly between the two methods. SBP readings differed by <e2><89><a5>5 mmHg in either direction for 68% of patients while 78% of patient's DBP readings differed by <e2><89><a5>2 mmHg in either direction. Overall, 93% of patients had a BP difference of either <e2><89><a5>5 mmHg systolic or <e2><89><a5>2 mmHg diastolic. Five patients were determined to be at goal with the triage method, but were higher than their goal BP with the AHA method Significant differences were also seen in treatment recommendations for a given patient based on the differences seen between the two obtained BP readings. The number of patients with treatment variations between their two profiles ranged from 13% to 23% depending on the reviewing provider (p < 0.01 for all providers).

No qualitative study to date has examined women's perspectives about breast density in general or by states with and without notification laws. OBJECTIVE: Explore women's knowledge and perceptions of breast density and experiences of breast cancer screening across three states with and without notification laws. DESIGN: Qualitative research design using four focus groups conducted in 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven women who had a recent normal mammogram and dense breasts in registry data obtained through the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. APPROACH: Focus groups were 90 min, audio recorded, and transcribed for analysis. Data were analyzed using mixed deductive and inductive coding. KEY RESULTS: Women reported variable knowledge levels of personal breast density and breast density in general, even among women living in states with a notification law. A number of women were aware of the difficulty of detecting cancer with dense breasts, but only one knew that density increased breast cancer risk. Across all states, very few women reported receiving information about breast density during healthcare visits beyond being encouraged to get supplemental imaging or to pay for new mammography technology (i.e., breast tomosynthesis). Women offered more imaging or different technology held strong convictions that these were ""better,"" even though knowledge of differences, effectiveness, or harms across technologies seemed limited. Women from all states expressed a strong desire for more information about breast density. CONCLUSIONS: More research needs to be done to understand how the medical community can best assist women in making informed decisions related to breast density, mammography, and supplemental screening.

Jr and Goldstein, Karen M. and Gierisch, Jennifer M.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Technology-based systems can facilitate remote decision-making to triage patients to the appropriate level of care. Despite technologic advances, the effects of implementation of these systems on patient and utilization outcomes are unclear. We evaluated the effects of remote triage systems on healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes. METHODS: English-language searches of MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and CINAHL were performed from inception until July 2018. Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies of remote triage services that reported healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed study and intervention characteristics independently for study quality, strength of evidence, and risk of bias. RESULTS: The literature search identified 5026 articles, of which eight met eligibility criteria. Five randomized, two controlled before-and-after, and one interrupted time series study assessed 3 categories of remote triage services: mode of delivery, triage professional type, and system organizational level. No study evaluated any other delivery mode other than telephone and in-person. Meta-analyses were unable to be performed because of study design and outcome heterogeneity; therefore, we narratively synthesized data. Overall, most studies did not demonstrate a decrease in primary care (PC) or emergency department (ED) utilization, with some studies showing a significant increase. Evidence suggested local, practice-based triage systems have greater case resolution and refer fewer patients to PC or ED services than regional/national systems. No study identified statistically significant differences in safety outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our review found limited evidence that remote triage reduces the burden of PC or ED utilization. However, remote triage by telephone can produce a high rate of call resolution and appears to be safe. Further study of other remote triage modalities is needed to realize the promise of remote triage services in optimizing healthcare outcomes.

Wolf_2007_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Physician-patient communication about colorectal cancer screening,"Wolf, Michael S. and Baker, David W. and Makoul, Gregory",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Despite the documented benefits of colorectal cancer screening, patient participation rates remain low. Physician recommendation has been identified as a significant predictor of screening completion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate how primary care physicians perceive colorectal cancer screening communication tasks, as well as to explore the form and content of actual screening discussions. DESIGN: The research design includes a mailed physician survey and a separate observational study in a sample of videotaped medical encounters. PARTICIPANTS AND DATA SOURCES: The participants were 270 primary care physicians who completed a mailed questionnaire (57.9% response rate) and 18 physician-patient encounters that included discussions of colorectal cancer screening. MEASUREMENT: The questionnaire focused on perceived importance and accomplishment of communication tasks relevant to colorectal cancer screening. Two of the authors reviewed transcripts of videotaped physician encounters to determine whether the same communication tasks assessed in the survey were accomplished. Interrater reliability was high across all of the mutually exclusive coding categories (Kappa > .90). RESULTS: Physicians rated colonoscopy as the most important screening option to discuss; self-reports indicate that colonoscopy (84.8%) is more frequently mentioned than fecal occult blood test (FOBT; 49.4%), flexible sigmoidoscopy (34.1%), or computed tomography (CT) imaging (18.1%). Explaining benefits and risks, describing test procedure and frequency, eliciting patient preferences, and making a plan for screening were all viewed as very important. Self-reported accomplishment of these communication tasks was considerably higher than that observed in our separate videotape sample. CONCLUSION: Most physicians recognize and espouse the importance of recommending colorectal cancer screening to eligible patients. However, findings from both the physician survey and observational study suggest that physicians tend to overestimate the extent of discussions about screening.

Previous reviews show limited effect on patient outcomes. Our objective was to assess the impact of electronic prescribing strategies on medication errors and patient harm in hospitalized patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL were searched from January 2007 to January 2018. We included prospective studies that compared hospital-based electronic prescribing strategies with control, and reported on medication error or patient harm. Data were abstracted by two reviewers and pooled using random effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care and evidence quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included; comprised of 11 randomized control trials and 27 non-randomized interventional studies. Electronic prescribing strategies reduced medication errors (RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.13, 0.46), I(2) 98%, n = 11) and dosing errors (RR 0.17 (95% CI 0.08, 0.38), I(2) 96%, n = 9), with both risk ratios significantly affected by advancing year of publication.

Approximately 80 % of internal medicine residents and nearly two-thirds of primary care internal medicine residents do not plan to have a career in primary care or general internal medicine. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore contextual and programmatic factors within primary care residency training environments that may influence career choices. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study based on semi-structured, in-person interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Three primary care internal medicine residency programs were purposefully selected to represent a diversity of training environments. Second and third year residents were interviewed. APPROACH: We used a survey guide developed from pilot interviews and existing literature. Three members of the research team independently coded the transcripts and developed the code structure based on the constant comparative method. The research team identified emerging themes and refined codes. ATLAS.ti was used for the analysis. KEY RESULTS: We completed 24 interviews (12 second-year residents, and 12 third-year residents). The age range was 27-39 years. Four recurrent themes characterized contextual and programmatic factors contributing to residents' decision-making: resident expectations of a career in primary care, navigation of the boundary between social needs and medical needs, mentorship and perceptions of primary care, and structural features of the training program. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing aspects of training that may discourage residents from careers in primary care such as lack of diversity in outpatient experiences and resident frustration with their inability to address social needs of patients, and strengthening aspects of training that may encourage interests in careers in primary care such as mentorship and protected time away from inpatient responsibilities during primary care rotations, may increase the proportion of residents enrolled in primary care training programs who pursue a career in primary care.",2016,10.1007/s11606-016-3825-9,31,12,1452-1459,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,Primary care and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Workforce and Qualitative research and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Career Choice and Internal Medicine/*trends and Internship and Residency/methods/*trends and Meducation and Physicians/psychology/*trends and Primary Health Care/methods/*trends,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To understand self-management and health care navigation challenges that patients face due to MCCs and to identify opportunities to support these patients through new and enhanced eHealth technology. DESIGN: After administering a screening survey, we conducted 10 focus groups of 3-8 patients grouped by age, sex, and common chronic conditions. Patients discussed challenges associated with having MCCs and their use of (and desires from) technology to support self-management. Three investigators used standard content analysis methods to code the focus group transcripts. Emergent themes were reviewed with all collaborators, and final themes and representative quotes were validated with a sample of participants. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-three individuals with <e2><89><a5>3 chronic conditions and experience using technology for health-related purposes. KEY RESULTS: Focus group participants had an average of five chronic conditions. Participants reported using technology most frequently to search for health information (96%), communicate with health care providers (92%), track medical information (83%), track medications (77%), and support decision-making about treatment (55%). Three themes emerged to guide eHealth technology development: (1) Patients with MCCs manage a high volume of information, visits, and self-care tasks; (2) they need to coordinate, synthesize, and reconcile health information from multiple providers and about different conditions; (3) their unique position at the hub of multiple health issues requires self-advocacy and expertise. Focus groups identified desirable eHealth resources and tools that reflect these themes.

Most PC communication metrics are distal to the care encounter and lack clear attribution, thereby reducing relevance for leaders and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the acceptability of measuring PC communication at the point-of-care. DESIGN: A brief patient survey was conducted immediately post-primary care appointments at one Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Audit-feedback reports were created for clinicians and discussed in qualitative interviews. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 485 patients completed the survey. Thirteen interviews were conducted with clinicians and hospital leaders. MAIN MEASURE(S): Measures included collaboRATE (a 3-item tool measuring PC communication), a question about how well needs were met, and overall visit satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to characterize the mean and distribution of collaboRATE scores and determine the proportion of patients giving clinicians a ""top score"" on each item. Associations among responses were examined. Interviews focused on the value of measuring PC communication and were analyzed using a framework approach. KEY RESULTS: The proportion of patients giving PC communication ""top scores"" ranged from 41 to 92% for 16 clinicians who had <e2><89><a5> 25 completed surveys. Among patients who gave ""top scores"" for PC communication, the odds of reporting that needs were ""completely met"" were 10.8 times higher (p < .001) and the odds of reporting being ""very satisfied"" with their care were 13.3 times higher (p < .001) compared with patients who did not give ""top scores."" Interviewees found clinician-specific feedback useful; concerns included prioritizing this data when other measures are used to evaluate clinicians' performance.

MacQueen_2018_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Recruiting Rural Healthcare Providers Today: a Systematic Review of Training Program Success and Determinants of Geographic Choices,"MacQueen, Ian T. and Maggard-Gibbons, Melinda and Capra, Gina and Raaen, Laura and Ulloa, Jesus G. and Shekelle, Paul G. and Miake-Lye, Isomi and Beroes, Jessica M. and Hempel, Susanne",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Rural areas have historically struggled with shortages of healthcare providers; however, advanced communication technologies have transformed rural healthcare, and practice in underserved areas has been recognized as a policy priority. This systematic review aims to assess reasons for current providers' geographic choices and the success of training programs aimed at increasing rural provider recruitment. METHODS: This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015025403) searched seven databases for published and gray literature on the current cohort of US rural healthcare practitioners (2005 to March 2017). Two reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion; one reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias, with a senior systematic reviewer checking the data; quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 7276 screened citations, we identified 31 studies exploring reasons for geographic choices and 24 studies documenting the impact of training programs. Growing up in a rural community is a key determinant and is consistently associated with choosing rural practice. Most existing studies assess physicians, and only a few are based on multivariate analyses that take competing and potentially correlated predictors into account. The success rate of placing providers-in-training in rural practice after graduation, on average, is 44% (range 20-84%; N = 31 programs). We did not identify program characteristics that are consistently associated with program success. Data are primarily based on rural tracks for medical residents. DISCUSSION: The review provides insight into the relative importance of demographic characteristics and motivational factors in determining which providers should be targeted to maximize return on recruitment efforts. Existing programs exposing students to rural practice during their training are promising but require further refining. Public policy must include a specific focus on the trajectory of the healthcare workforce and must consider alternative models of healthcare delivery that promote a more diverse, interdisciplinary combination of providers.",2018,10.1007/s11606-017-4210-z,33,2,191-199,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,United States and Humans and Female and Male and rural health and Career Choice and Medically Underserved Area and *Decision Making and Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data and Professional Practice Location and Rural Health Services/*supply & distribution and provider recruitment and provider shortages and student training,NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scalability and cost may be barriers to widespread ACP, and video decision aids may help address such barriers. AIM: Our primary hypothesis was that ACP documentation would increase in Hilo after ACP video implementation. Secondary hypotheses included increased use of hospice, fewer deaths in the hospital, and decreased costs in the last month of life. SETTING: The city of Hilo in Hawai'i (population 43,263), which is served by one 276-bed hospital (Hilo Medical Center), one hospice (the Hospice of Hilo), and 30 primary care physicians. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The intervention consisted of a single, 1- to 4-h training and access to a suite of ACP video decision aids. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Prior to implementation, the rate of ACP documentation for hospitalized patients with late-stage disease was 3.2 % (11/346). After the intervention, ACP documentation was 39.9 % (1,107/2,773) (P < 0.001). Primary care providers in the intervention had an ACP completion rate for patients over 75 years of 37.0 % (1,437/3,888) compared to control providers, who had an average of 25.6 % (10,760/42,099) (P < 0.001). The rate of discharge from hospital to hospice for patients with late-stage disease was 5.7 % prior to the intervention and 13.8 % after the intervention (P < 0.001). The average total insurance cost for the last month of life among Hilo patients was $3,458 (95 % CI $3,051 to 3,865) lower per patient after the intervention when compared to the control region.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality of the patient-physician relationship between African-American and white patients and examine the extent to which relationship quality contributes to differences in advance care planning (ACP) and preferences for intensive life-sustaining treatment (LST). DESIGN: Cross sectional survey of 803 terminally ill African-American and white patients. MEASUREMENTS: Patient-reported quality of the patient-physician relationship (degree of trust, perceived respect, and joint decision making; skill in breaking bad news and listening; help in navigating the medical system), ACP, preferences for LST (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, major surgery, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis). RESULTS: The quality of the patient-physician relationship was worse for African Americans than for white patients by all measures except trust. African Americans were less likely to have an ACP (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.52-0.84), and were more likely to have a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and dialysis (aRR = 1.28, 95%CI = 1.03-1.58; aRR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.07-1.47, respectively).

Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention.

However, little is known regarding the differences in healthcare experiences across the various levels of income of patients. In a nationally representative US adult population, we evaluate the differences in healthcare experiences based on patient level of income. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the differences in patient healthcare experiences based on level of income. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 68,447 individuals (mean age, 48 <c2><b1> 18 years; 55% female) representing 176.8 million US adults, who had an established healthcare provider in the 2010-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey cohort. This retrospective study examined the differences in all five patient-reported healthcare experience measures (access to care, provider responsiveness, patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and patient satisfaction) under the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. We examined the relationship between patient income and their healthcare experience. RESULTS: Overall, 32% of the study participants were high-income earners while 23% had very-low income. Lower income was consistently associated with poor patient report on healthcare experience. Compared with those with high income, very-low-income-earning participants had 1.63 times greater odds (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.45-1.82) of experiencing difficulty accessing care, had 1.34 times higher odds (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.25-1.45) of experiencing poor communication, had higher odds (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.46-1.92) of experiencing delays in healthcare delivery, and were more likely to report poor provider satisfaction (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.37-1.61).

The lack of correlation may be due either to an overestimation of the value of PCC or to a measurement problem. If PCC measures do not capture elements of the interaction that determine whether the resulting care plan is patient-centered, they will confound efforts to link PCC to outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether one widely used measure of PCC, the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), captures patient-centered care planning. DESIGN: RIAS was employed in the coding of unannounced standardized patient (USP) encounters that were scripted so that the failure to address patient contextual factors would result in an ineffective plan of care. The design enabled an assessment of whether RIAS can differentiate between communication behavior that does and does not result in a care plan that takes into account a patient's circumstances and needs. PARTICIPANTS: Eight actors role playing four scripted cases (one African American and one Caucasian for each case) in 399 visits to 111 internal medicine attending physicians. MAIN MEASURES: RIAS measures included composites for physician utterance types and (in separate models) two different previously applied RIAS patient-centeredness summary composites. The gold standard comparison measure was whether the physician's treatment plan, as abstracted from the visit note, successfully addressed the patient's problem. Mixed effects regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between RIAS measures and USP measured performance, controlling for a variety of design features. KEY RESULTS: None of the RIAS measures of PCC differentiated encounters in which care planning was patient-centered from care planning in which it was not. CONCLUSIONS: RIAS, which codes each utterance during a visit into mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories, does not differentiate between conversations leading to and not leading to care plans that accommodate patients' circumstances and needs.",2013,10.1007/s11606-012-2221-3,28,2,254-260,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Psychometrics and Medical Errors and Role Playing and *Communication and Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/methods and *Physician-Patient Relations and Patient Simulation and Clinical Competence/standards and Patient-Centered Care/methods/*standards and Illinois and Patient Care Planning/standards",NA,NA,2013/02//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Parsimonious predictive indexes are important decision-making tools for clinicians, policy makers, and epidemiologists. OBJECTIVE: To develop 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality predictive indexes for nationally representative community-dwelling elderly people. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II). PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative civilian community-dwelling persons at least 70 years old. We randomly selected 60% of the sample for prediction development and used the remaining 40% for validation. MAIN MEASURES: Sociodemographics, impairments, and medical diagnoses were collected from the LSOA II baseline interviews. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) stages were derived to measure functional status. All-cause mortality was obtained from the LSOA II Linked Mortality Public-use File. RESULTS: The analyses included 7,373 sample persons with complete data, among which mortality rates were 3.7%, 23.3%, and 49.8% for 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Four, eight, and ten predictors were identified for 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality, respectively, in multiple logistic regression models to create three predictive indexes. Age, sex, coronary artery disease, and IADL stages were the most essential predictors for all three indexes. C-statistics of the three indexes were 0.72, 0.74, and 0.75 in the development cohort and 0.72, 0.72, and 0.74 in the validation cohort for 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality, respectively. Five risk groups were defined based on the scores. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality indexes include parsimonious predictor sets maximizing ease of mortality prediction in community settings.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize treatment type and subsequent survival for men with no more than a single comorbid condition. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective study of 1,031 veterans with non-metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed in 1997-2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and followed until 2010. We used multivariate analyses to determine probabilities and relative risks of undergoing treatment for each health state and competing-risks regression analyses to model non-prostate cancer mortality. RESULTS: Compared with subjects without any comorbid conditions, only men with moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were less likely to receive definitive treatment for their prostate cancer (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.44-0.99).

However, these discussions are often avoided. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the impact of a video decision tool for CPR and intubation on patients' choices, knowledge, medical orders, and discussions with providers. DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized trial conducted between 9 March 2011 and 1 June 2013 on the internal medicine services at two hospitals in Boston. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty seriously ill hospitalized patients over the age of 60 with an advanced illness and a prognosis of 1 year or less were included. Mean age was 76 and 51% were women. INTERVENTION: Three-minute video describing CPR and intubation plus verbal communication of participants' preferences to their physicians (intervention) (N = 75) or control arm (usual care) (N = 75). MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was participants' preferences for CPR and intubation (immediately after viewing the video in the intervention arm). Secondary outcomes included: orders to withhold CPR/intubation, documented discussions with providers during hospitalization, and participants' knowledge of CPR/ intubation (five-item test, range 0-5, higher scores indicate greater knowledge). RESULTS: Intervention participants (vs. controls) were more likely not to want CPR (64% vs. 32%, p <0.0001) and intubation (72% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001). Intervention participants (vs. controls) were also more likely to have orders to withhold CPR (57% vs. 19%, p < 0.0001) and intubation (64% vs.19%, p < 0.0001) by hospital discharge, documented discussions about their preferences (81% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001), and higher mean knowledge scores (4.11 vs. 2.45; p < 0.0001).

METHODS: We used two independent search strategies to identify articles relevant to women's health published between March 1, 2007 and February 29, 2008. First, we reviewed the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and journal indices from the ACP Journal Club, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Circulation, Diabetes, JAMA, JGIM, Journal of Women's Health, Lancet, NEJM, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Women's Health Journal Watch. Second, we performed a MEDLINE search using the medical subject heading term ""sex factors."" The authors, who all have clinical and/or research experience in the area of women's health, reviewed all article titles, abstracts, and, when indicated, full publications. We excluded articles related to obstetrical aspects of women's health focusing on those relevant to general internists. We had two acceptance criteria, scientific rigor and potential to impact women's health. We also identified new and/or updated women's health guidelines released during the same time period. RESULTS: We identified over 250 publications with potential relevance to women's health. Forty-six articles were selected for presentation as part of the Clinical Update, and nine were selected for a more detailed discussion in this paper. Evidence-based women's health guidelines are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Important Women's Health Guidelines in 2007-2008: New or Updated Topic Issuing organization Updated recommendations and comments Mammography screening in women 40-4917 ACP Individualized risk assessment and informed decision making should be used to guide decisions about mammography screening in this age group. To aid in the risk assessment, a discussion of the risk factors, which if present in a woman in her 40s increases her risk to above that of an average 50-year-old woman, is provided in the guidelines. In addition, available risk prediction models, such as the NIH Web site calculator (http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/) can also be used to estimate quantitative breast cancer risk. This model was updated in 2008 with race-specific data for calculating risk in African-American women.18 The harms and benefits of mammography should be discussed and incorporated along with a woman's preferences and breast cancer risk profile into the decision on when to begin screening. If a woman decides to forgo mammography, the decision should be readdressed every 1 to 2 years.

STD treatment guidelines20 CDC Flouroquinolones are NO longer recommended for treatment of N. gonorrhea, due to increasing resistance (as high as 15% of isolates in 2006). For uncomplicated infections, treatment of gonorrhea should be initiated with ceftriaxone 125 mg IM or cefixime 400 mg PO and co-treatment for chlamydia infection (unless ruled out with testing).

One key patient engagement strategy is patient, family, and community advisory boards/councils (PFACs), yet the evidence to guide PFACs is lacking. Systematic reviews on patient engagement may benefit from patient input, but feasibility is unclear. METHODS: A team of physicians, researchers, and a PFAC member conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of PFACs on health systems and describe optimal strategies for PFAC conduct. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Social Science Citation Index from inception through September 2016, as well as pre-identified websites. Two reviewers independently screened and abstracted data from studies, then assessed randomized studies for risk of bias and observational studies for quality using standardized measures. We performed a realist synthesis-which asks what works, for whom, under what circumstances-of abstracted data via 12 monthly meetings between investigators and two feedback sessions with a hospital-based PFAC. RESULTS: Eighteen articles describing 16 studies met study criteria. Randomized studies demonstrated moderate to high risk of bias and observational studies demonstrated poor to fair quality. Studies engaged patients at multiple levels of the health care system and suggested that in-person deliberation with health system leadership was most effective. Studies involving patient engagement in research focused on increasing study participation. PFAC recruitment was by nomination (n = 11) or not described (n = 5). No common measure of patient, family, or community engagement was identified. Realist synthesis was enriched by feedback from PFAC members. DISCUSSION: PFACs engage communities through individual projects but evidence of their impact on outcomes is lacking. A paucity of randomized controlled trials or high-quality observational studies guide strategies for engagement through PFACs. Standardized measurement tools for engagement are needed. Strategies for PFAC recruitment should be investigated and reported. PFAC members can feasibly contribute to systematic reviews.

OBJECTIVE: To assess organizational readiness for change in specialty mental health in order to facilitate locally tailored implementation strategies. DESIGN: EQUIP-2 is a site-level controlled trial at nine VA medical centers (four intervention, five control). Providers at all sites completed an organizational readiness for change (ORC) measure, and key stakeholders at the intervention sites completed a semi-structured interview at baseline. PARTICIPANTS: At the four intervention sites, 16 administrators and 43 clinical staff completed the ORC, and 38 key stakeholders were interviewed. MAIN RESULTS: The readiness domains of training needs, communication, and change were the domains with lower mean scores (i.e., potential deficiencies) ranging from a low of 23.8 to a high of 36.2 on a scale of 10-50, while staff attributes of growth and adaptability had higher mean scores (i.e., potential strengths) ranging from a low of 35.4 to a high of 41.1. Semi-structured interviews revealed that staff perceptions and experiences of change and decision-making are affected by larger structural factors such as change mandates from VA headquarters. CONCLUSIONS: Motivation for change, organizational climate, staff perceptions and beliefs, and prior experience with change efforts contribute to readiness for change in specialty mental health. Sites with less readiness for change may require more flexibility in the implementation of a quality improvement intervention. We suggest that uptake of evidence-based practices can be enhanced by tailoring implementation efforts to the strengths and deficiencies of the organizations that are implementing quality improvement changes.",2010,10.1007/s11606-009-1133-3,25 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,27-31,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Organizational Innovation and *Mental Health and *Motivation and Delivery of Health Care/methods/*organization & administration/trends and Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*therapy and United States Department of Veterans Affairs/*organization & administration/trends,NA,NA,2010/01//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Beach_2007_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Is patients' preferred involvement in health decisions related to outcomes for patients with HIV?,"Beach, Mary Catherine and Duggan, Patrick S. and Moore, Richard D.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that patients who are more involved in their medical care have better outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare health care processes and outcomes for patients with HIV based on their preferred level of involvement in health decisions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of audio computer-assisted interviews with patients at an urban HIV clinic. PATIENTS: One thousand and twenty-seven patients awaiting an appointment with their primary care provider. MEASURES: Patients were asked how they preferred to be involved in decisions (doctor makes most or all decisions, doctor and patient share decisions, patient makes all decisions). We also asked patients to rate the quality of communication with their HIV provider, and their self-reported receipt of and adherence to HAART. RESULTS: Overall, 23% patients preferred that their doctor make all or most decisions, 63% preferred to share decisions with their doctor, and 13% preferred to make all final decisions alone. Compared to patients who prefer to share decisions with their HIV provider, patients who prefer that their provider make all/most decisions were significantly less likely to adhere to HAART (OR [odds ratio] 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.86) and patients who preferred to make decisions alone were significantly less likely to receive HAART or to have undetectable HIV RNA in unadjusted analyses (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87 for receipt of HAART; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.95 for undetectable HIV RNA). After controlling for potentially confounding patient characteristics and differences in patient ratings of communication quality, patients who preferred that their provider make all/most decisions remained significantly less likely to adhere to HAART (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.89); however, the associations with receipt of HAART and undetectable HIV RNA were no longer significant (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34-1.05 for receipt of HAART; OR 0.80, 95% C.I 0.53-1.20 for undetectable HIV RNA). CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests that more patient involvement in health care decisions is better, this benefit may be reduced when the patient wants to make decisions alone. Future research should explore the extent to which this preference is modifiable so as to improve outcomes.",2007,10.1007/s11606-007-0241-1,22,8,1119-1124,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Patient Compliance and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Patient Satisfaction and HIV-1 and Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Patient Participation and HIV Infections/*drug therapy",NA,NA,2007/08//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pretorius_2013_Amerfamiphys,JOUR,Reducing the risk of adverse drug events in older adults,"Pretorius, Richard W. and Gataric, Gordana and Swedlund, Steven K. and Miller, John R.",American family physician,"Adverse drug events occur in 15 percent or more of older patients presenting to offices, hospitals, and extended care facilities. These events are potentially preventable up to 50 percent of the time. Common serious manifestations include falls, orthostatic hypotension, heart failure, and delirium. The most common causes of death are gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding and renal failure. Antithrombotic and antidiabetic medications, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause most of the preventable hospital admissions due to adverse drug events. Strategies to reduce the risk of adverse drug events include discontinuing medications, prescribing new medications sparingly, reducing the number of prescribers, and frequently reconciling medications. The Beers, STOPP (screening tool of older persons' potentially inappropriate prescriptions), and START (screening tool to alert doctors to right treatment) criteria can help identify medications causing adverse drug events. Not all potentially inappropriate medications can be avoided. Clinicians should involve patients in shared decision making and individualize prescribing decisions based on medical, functional, and social conditions; quality of life; and prognosis.",2013,NA,87,5,331-336,eng,1532-0650 0002-838X,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Risk Factors and Aged, 80 and over and Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems and Polypharmacy and United States/epidemiology and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and *Risk Reduction Behavior and Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*prevention & control and Health Services for the Aged/*organization & administration and Inappropriate Prescribing/adverse effects/*prevention & control and Medication Errors/adverse effects/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/03/01/,Am Fam Physician,NA,NA,NA,NA
White.VanGompel_2017_Joofgeinme,JOUR,Incidence and Predictors of Repeat Bone Mineral Densitometry: A Longitudinal Cohort Study,"White VanGompel, Emily C. and Franks, Peter and Robbins, John A. and Fenton, Joshua J.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use. OBJECTIVE: To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40-84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA. MAIN MEASURES: Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA. KEY RESULTS: Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91-1.30)]. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.",2017,10.1007/s11606-017-4094-y,32,10,1090-1096,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Cohort Studies and screening and Aged, 80 and over and Predictive Value of Tests and Incidence and practice variation and medical decision-making and osteoporosis and Absorptiometry, Photon/*methods/trends and Bone Density/*physiology and Densitometry/*methods/trends and Osteoporosis/*diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: We pilot-tested a physician-directed strategy aimed at improving rates of recommendation and patient colorectal cancer screening completion at 1 federally qualified health center serving low-income, African-American and Hispanic patients. Colonoscopy was specifically targeted. DESIGN: Single arm, pretest-posttest design. SETTING: Urban. PATIENTS: 154 screening-eligible, yet nonadherent primary care patients receiving care at an urban, federally qualified health center. INTERVENTION: 1) manually tracking screening-eligible patients, 2) mailing patients a physician letter and brochure before medical visits, 3) health literacy training to help physicians improve their communication with patients to work to resolution, and 4) establishing a ""feedback loop"" to routinely monitor patient compliance. MEASUREMENT: Chart review of whether patients received a physician recommendation for screening, and completion of any colorectal cancer screening test 12 months after intervention. Physicians recorded patients' qualitative reasons for noncompliance, and a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis for screening promotion was also conducted. RESULTS: The baseline screening rate was 11.5%, with 31.6% of patients having received a recommendation from their physician. At 1-year follow-up, rates of screening completion had increased to 27.9 percent (p < .001), and physician recommendation had increased to 92.9% (p < .001). Common reasons for nonadherence included patient readiness (60.7%), competing health problems (11.9%), and fear or anxiety concerning the procedure (8.3%). The total cost for implementing the intervention was $4,676 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention was $106 per additional patient screened by colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention appears to be a feasible means to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among patients served by community health centers. However, more attention to patient decision making and education may be needed to further increase screening rates.",2007,10.1007/s11606-007-0295-0,22,10,1410-1414,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Patient Compliance and Aged and Pilot Projects and Physician-Patient Relations and Risk Factors and Occult Blood and Community Health Centers and Urban Population and African Americans/statistics & numerical data and Colonoscopy/*statistics & numerical data and *Poverty Areas and Colorectal Neoplasms/ethnology/*prevention & control and Health Education/organization & administration and Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data and Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2007/10//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cooper_2011_Joofgeinme,JOUR,A randomized trial to improve patient-centered care and hypertension control in underserved primary care patients,"Cooper, Lisa A. and Roter, Debra L. and Carson, Kathryn A. and Bone, Lee R. and Larson, Susan M. and Miller, Edgar R. 3rd and Barr, Michael S. and Levine, David M.",Journal of general internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: African Americans and persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and receive less patient-centered care than less vulnerable patient populations. Moreover, continuing medical education (CME) and patient-activation interventions have infrequently been directed to improve the processes of care for these populations. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions targeting patients and physicians with the effectiveness of minimal interventions for underserved groups. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through August 2005, with patient follow-up at 3 and 12 months, in 14 urban, community-based practices in Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one primary care physicians and 279 hypertension patients. INTERVENTIONS: Physician communication skills training and patient coaching by community health workers. MAIN MEASURES: Physician communication behaviors; patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM), patient involvement in care (PIC), reported adherence to medications; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP control. KEY RESULTS: Visits of trained versus control group physicians demonstrated more positive communication change scores from baseline (-0.52 vs. -0.82, p = 0.04). At 12 months, the patient+physician intensive group compared to the minimal intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in patient report of physicians' PDM (<ce><b2> = +6.20 vs. -5.24, p = 0.03) and PIC dimensions related to doctor facilitation (<ce><b2> = +0.22 vs. -0.17, p = 0.03) and information exchange (<ce><b2> = +0.32 vs. -0.22, p = 0.005). Improvements in patient adherence and BP control did not differ across groups for the overall patient sample. However, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, non-significant reductions in systolic BP were observed among patients in all intervention groups-the patient+physician intensive (-13.2 mmHg), physician intensive/patient minimal (-10.6 mmHg), and the patient intensive/physician minimal (-16.8 mmHg), compared to the patient+physician minimal group (-2.0 mmHg). CONCLUSION: Interventions that enhance physicians' communication skills and activate patients to participate in their care positively affect patient-centered communication, patient perceptions of engagement in care, and may improve systolic BP among urban African-American and low SES patients with uncontrolled hypertension.",2011,10.1007/s11606-011-1794-6,26,11,1297-1304,eng,1525-1497 0884-8734,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Physician-Patient Relations and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Patient Satisfaction and Patient Education as Topic and Social Class and Statistics as Topic and United States/epidemiology and Health Promotion/*methods and Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use and African Americans/statistics & numerical data and *Medically Underserved Area and Delivery of Health Care/standards/statistics & numerical data and Hypertension/drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control and Patient-Centered Care/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Primary Health Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Quality Improvement/standards/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2011/11//undefined,J Gen Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
