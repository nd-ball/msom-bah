Jarvis_2020_PlaandrecsurGloope,JOUR,"Artificial Intelligence in Plastic Surgery: Current Applications, Future Directions, and Ethical Implications","Jarvis, Tyler and Thornburg, Danielle and Rebecca, Alanna M. and Teven, Chad M.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare delivery has become an important area of research due to the rapid progression of technology, which has allowed the growth of many processes historically reliant upon human input. AI has become particularly important in plastic surgery in a variety of settings. This article highlights current applications of AI in plastic surgery and discusses future implications. We further detail ethical issues that may arise in the implementation of AI in plastic surgery. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of all electronically available publications in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as of February 5, 2020. All returned publications regarding the application of AI in plastic surgery were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Of the 89 novel articles returned, 14 satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles procured from the references of those of the database search and those pertaining to historical and ethical implications were summarized when relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous applications of AI exist in plastic surgery. Big data, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and facial recognition are examples of AI-based technology that plastic surgeons may utilize to advance their surgical practice. Like any evolving technology, however, the use of AI in healthcare raises important ethical issues, including patient autonomy and informed consent, confidentiality, and appropriate data use. Such considerations are significant, as high ethical standards are key to appropriate and longstanding implementation of AI.",2020,10.1097/GOX.0000000000003200,8,10,e3200,eng,2169-7574,NA,NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,NA,NA,NA,NA

From the moment patients come into contact with the health care system, their entire medical history is recorded electronically. Whether a patient is in the operating room or on the hospital ward, technological advancement has facilitated the expedient and reliable measurement of clinically relevant health metrics, all in an effort to guide care and ensure the best possible clinical outcomes. However, as the volume and complexity of biomedical data grow, it becomes challenging to effectively process ""big data"" using conventional techniques. Physicians and scientists must be prepared to look beyond classic methods of data processing to extract clinically relevant information. The purpose of this article is to introduce the modern plastic surgeon to machine learning and computational interpretation of large data sets. What is machine learning? Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, can address clinically relevant problems in several domains of plastic surgery, including burn surgery; microsurgery; and craniofacial, peripheral nerve, and aesthetic surgery. This article provides a brief introduction to current research and suggests future projects that will allow plastic surgeons to explore this new frontier of surgical science.",2016,10.1097/PRS.0000000000002088,137,5,890e-897e,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Teaching and Humans and Datasets as Topic and *Machine Learning and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Motor Skills and Burns/surgery and Clinical Competence/standards and Craniosynostoses/diagnosis/surgery and Hand/surgery and Internship and Residency/standards and Microsurgery/methods and Peripheral Nerves/surgery and Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/education/*methods and Surgery, Plastic/education/*methods",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Particularly, in plastic surgery, improving the doctor-patient relationship by understanding the patient's emotions and expectations becomes a determining factor when choosing the best therapeutic strategy for the subject in question, which may also include nonsurgical eligibility. METHODS: Ninety patients with various plastic surgery disabilities were recruited and randomly divided into three groups: Patients in the first group underwent the ``traditional'' clinical interview, those in the second underwent the clinical approach called Shared Decision Making (SDM), and those in the third group received both the SDM and a questionnaire evaluating patient expectations (Expectation Questionnaire-Pgm). At the end of each interview, a specialist physician in Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery was asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding his/her satisfaction with the method used. Likewise, the patient filled in a questionnaire on his/her satisfaction with the interview. RESULTS: For the doctors, the third method was superior in investigating patient expectations, emotions, and personal preferences. For the patients, the third method scored significantly higher than the first one for overall satisfaction and ability to evaluate personal preferences and needs and higher than the first and second methods in assessing expectations. CONCLUSIONS: For doctors, the SDM coupled with the Expectation Questionnaire-Pgm proved to be the most useful tool to understand patient expectations and emotions and thus improve the medical-patient relationship through shared decision-making. The third method therefore aims for better patient coverage and improved informed consent, thereby reducing the likelihood of litigation and better assessing nonfitness for operation.",2019,10.1016/j.bjps.2019.05.037,72,11,1847-1855,eng,1878-0539 1748-6815,"Emotions and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and *Informed Consent and *Patient Satisfaction and *Physician-Patient Relations and Informed consent and Decision Making, Shared and *Reconstructive Surgical Procedures and Emotionality - medical satisfaction and Medical litigation and Medical-patient relationship and Patient's expectations and Plastic surgery",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Global open,"BACKGROUND: Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has been linked to textured breast implants, and is an emerging concern within the plastic and reconstructive surgery community. Many surgeons are struggling with how best to inform their patients and manage BIA-ALCL care without overwhelming their standard clinical practice. METHODS: Five educational group seminars were held for 53 patients. A thematic analysis of the field notes taken at each seminar was conducted to identify recurring patient and surgeon behaviors. RESULTS: The thematic analysis identified 5 key themes: seeking, amplifying, framing, trusting, and empowering. Seeking describes the knowledge sought by patients and their varying engagement in their care. Amplifying underlines how the emotionally charged topic of BIA-ALCL impacted patient and surgeon behaviors. Framing presents surgeon efforts to help patients understand the risk level of BIA-ALCL. Trusting addresses the ways BIA-ALCL has impacted patient trust in the medical community and the mechanisms to rebuild this trust. Empowering outlines surgeon efforts to engage patients in shared decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Herein is presented a possible framework for efficient BIA-ALCL patient education that can be adapted to different surgical practices. Lessons learned are: (1) patients want information on BIA-ALCL's clinical features and prophylactic implant removal; (2) BIA-ALCL discussions are emotionally charged and surgeons must remain cognizant of group dynamics and that the physician-patient power differential may impact patient decision-making; (3) patient trust has been strained but can be restored; and (4) patient responses to BIA-ALCL are variable and subjective; thus, surgeons should emphasize patient-centered care.",2020,10.1097/GOX.0000000000003142,8,9,e3142,eng,2169-7574,NA,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to examine decision making in women electing this therapy to further understand what influences and drives this decision. METHODS: The authors conducted a survey study, enrolling patients who elected BPM and reconstruction. Participants were mailed structured questionnaires utilizing validated and study specific tools addressing: demographics, treatment decisions, autonomy, decision making and information seeking preferences, and breast cancer treatment knowledge. Analysis was performed overall and by reconstruction. RESULTS: 40 patients responded (20 autologous, 19 implant and 1 combination, 66% response rate). The cohort was well educated and wealthy. Reconstructive options played a large role in the consideration of BPM. Patients were influenced by their physicians and less so by non-traditional means (media, internet, etc). Autologous reconstructions had a stronger desire to utilize their own tissue (p < 0.001) and were less concerned with the amount of surgery (0.02) and resulting scars (p = 0.01). Implant reconstructions more often stated that they did not have enough tissue for autologous reconstruction (p < 0.001) and did have a lower BMI, 24.2 vs. 27.5 (p = 0.03). Additionally, they were more influenced by non-traditional means (p < 0.001) and by other patients (p = 0.02).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate cosmetic questions and determine overlap with national procedural data. METHODS: Digital syllabi of six consecutive PSITE administrations (2008-2013) were analyzed for cosmetic surgery topics. Questions were classified by taxonomy, focus, anatomy, and procedure. Answer references were tabulated by source. Relationships between tested material and national procedural volume were assessed via Pearson correlation. RESULTS: 301 questions addressed cosmetic topics (26% of all questions) and 20 required image interpretations (7%). Question-stem taxonomy favored decision-making (40%) and recall (37%) skills over interpretation (23%, P < .001). Answers focused on treatments/outcomes (67%) over pathology/anatomy (20%) and diagnoses (13%, P < .001). Tested procedures were largely surgical (85%) and focused on the breast (25%), body (18%), nose (13%), and eye (10%). The most common surgeries were breast augmentation (12%), rhinoplasty (11%), blepharoplasty (10%), and body contouring (6%). Minimally invasive procedures were lasers (5%), neuromodulators (4%), and fillers (3%).

OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluate the decision-making process of patients undergoing BA, including how they seek information regarding the procedure, potential complications, the medical device itself, referral sources, and surgeon(s). METHODS: A written 36-item, blinded survey developed for this study was administered to all patients who underwent aesthetic primary BA by the senior author (JW) over a 12-month period in her metropolitan private practice. Patients were included only if they had undergone surgery after Food and Drug Administration approval of silicone implants and had at least four months of follow-up. Patients were excluded if they underwent reconstruction, revision, augmentation/mastopexy, or implant exchange. Data were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics; frequencies of responses were calculated with SPSS (version 16). RESULTS: Of 153 mailed surveys, 100 respondents returned completed questionnaires (65%). Mean age was 30 years (range, 20-50 years). Eighty-eight patients were in the workforce, eight were students, and three were homemakers. Thirty-three percent had completed some graduate work or had a graduate degree, and 41% had a college degree. In terms of how patients began their informational searches, 41% began with Google, 18% began with a BA portal Web site, and 1% went through referral from a primary care provider (PCP)/OB-GYN. The primary influence in a patient's decision to have BA was her own desire to change her appearance (36%), and second was her plastic surgeon's Web site (16%). On a graded scale of 10 factors ranking importance (1 = not at all and 5 = extremely), 52% said that their plastic surgeon's Web site very much or extremely influenced their decision. Of respondents, 82% had silicone implants (18% saline). The most influential factor in choosing implant filler was the feel of the silicone versus saline implants (for 41%), followed by the plastic surgeon's explanation of the difference (29%) and recent FDA approval (13%). Primary sources of information for possible complications were the plastic surgeon and BA portal sites. When asked what the worst complication could be, patients reported capsular contracture (37%), implant rupture or leak (22%), and infection (20%). The most powerful influence on choice of surgeon for BA was the plastic surgeon's Web site (49%); meeting the doctor in consultation was next (14%), followed by BA portal sites (9%). Thirty-six percent of respondents consulted with a psychiatrist or psychologist at some point in their lives, with depression, anxiety, and stress management as top-ranked reasons (in that order). CONCLUSIONS: The Internet (specifically Google, the plastic surgeon's Web site, and portal Web sites) is very important to patients ages 20 to 50 in their search for information on BA. Educational and reality TV may have less influence on this particular group than was previously thought. Patients are well educated, are part of the workforce, and seem to be independent and private thinkers when it comes to their decision making.

However, a variety of competing factors exert an influence on all decision-making processes. METHODS: Multiple competing factors that commonly influence decision-making by plastic surgeons, on both conscious and subconscious levels, are identified. By exploring the ramifications of these factors, a more ethical outcome can be achieved. RESULTS: Some of these competing interests that can sidetrack ethical decision-making include personal finances (e.g., ownership of surgical centers, selection of procedures, pricing); outside regulations (e.g., Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 and care of the uninsured); and professional duty (e.g., informed consent, discussion of error).

Global open,"Ventral hernias are a complex and costly burden to the health care system. Although preoperative radiologic imaging is commonly performed, the plethora of anatomic features present and available in routine imaging are seldomly quantified and integrated into patient selection, preoperative risk stratification, and perioperative planning. We herein aimed to critically examine the current state of computed tomography feature application in predicting surgical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were reviewed under search syntax ""computed tomography imaging"" and ""abdominal hernia"" for papers published between 2000 and 2020. RESULTS: Of the initial 1922 studies, 12 papers met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most frequently used radiologic features were hernia volume (n = 9), subcutaneous fat volume (n = 5), and defect size (n = 8). Outcomes included both complications and need for surgical intervention. Median area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio were 0.68 (<c2><b1>0.16) and 1.12 (<c2><b1>0.39), respectively. The best predictive feature was hernia neck ratio > 2.5 (AUC 0.903). CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography feature selection offers hernia surgeons an opportunity to identify, quantify, and integrate routinely available morphologic tissue features into preoperative decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: The authors propose to determine the rates of unplanned readmission following body contouring procedures and to analyze the predictors associated with it. METHODS: The 2011 and 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database was queried for body contouring procedures using the appropriate Current Procedural Terminology codes. The rate of unplanned readmission, preoperative risk factors, comorbidities, and medical and surgical postoperative complications data were analyzed using multivariate regression models to determine predictors of readmission after these procedures. RESULTS: We identified 5100 patients who underwent body contouring procedures, of which 142 (2.8%) experienced an unplanned readmission. Forty-eight per cent of readmitted patients experienced at least one surgical complication, and 23.9% experienced at least one medical complication. Multivariate regression analyses identified several independent predictors of unplanned readmission: increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.018 per year, P = 0.039), bleeding disorders (OR 3.674, P = 0.039), increased operative time (each additional hour conferring a 20% increased risk), surgical complications (OR 19.179, P < 0.001), and medical complications (OR 10.240, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The unplanned readmission rate for body contouring procedures is low overall (2.8%). We identified age, bleeding disorders, operative duration, and postoperative complication as independent risk factors for unplanned readmission. These data can help guide preoperative risk stratification and future interventions in high-risk patient populations.

Global open,"BACKGROUND: Patient expectations are important in bariatric and body contouring surgery because the goals include improvements in health-related quality of life, appearance, and body image. The aim of this study was to identify patient expectations along the weight loss journey and/or body contouring surgery. METHODS: This qualitative study took an interpretive description approach. Between September 2009 and February 2012, 49 patients were interviewed postbody contouring surgery. Data were analyzed using a line-by-line approach whereby expectations were identified and labeled as expected, unexpected, or neutral. Constant comparison was used to ensure coding was done consistently. Interviews continued until no new themes emerged. RESULTS: Participants described expectations according to appearance, health-related quality of life, and patient experience of care. Two areas stood out in terms of unmet expectations and included appearance and physical health, ie, recovery from body contouring surgery. Most participants, who underwent bariatric surgery, expected neither the extent of excess skin after weight loss nor how the excess skin would make them look and feel. For recovery, participants did not expect that it would be as long or as hard as it was in reality. CONCLUSIONS: A full understanding of outcomes and expectations for this patient population is needed to enhance patient education and improve shared medical decision making. Education materials should be informed by the collection of evidence-based patient-reported outcome information using measures such as the BODY-Q. A patient-reported outcome scale measuring patient expectations is needed for obese and bariatric patients.",2016,10.1097/GOX.0000000000000677,4,4,e694,eng,2169-7574,NA,NA,NA,2016/04//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,NA,NA,NA,NA

Global open,"BACKGROUND: Distress among newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is common and may have an impact on their surgical decision-making. The revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-r) is a validated instrument that provides an estimate of patients' total distress, and no previous study has related preoperative scores to the choice to have breast reconstruction. METHODS: Women with breast cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in 2014 were reviewed, and patient and tumor characteristics were collected from local databases. Breast reconstruction status was obtained from patients' electronic medical records until April 2017. A multivariable logistic regression model assessed for an independent association between preoperative ESAS-r total distress scores and patients' decision to have breast reconstruction. RESULTS: A total of 312 patients were analyzed. ESAS-r values had an overall median score of 10.0 and ranged from 0 to 69 (interquartile range, 17). Of these patients, 82 chose to undergo breast reconstruction surgery (26.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that higher ESAS-r scores were associated with patients forgoing breast reconstruction surgery (lumpectomy-alone group: odds ratio estimate, 1.034 [1.004-1.064], P = 0.025; mastectomy-alone group: odds ratio estimate, 1.031 [1.004-1.059], P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: This study of patients with breast cancer found that higher distress scores as measured by the ESAS-r were associated with reduced breast reconstruction. Distress in patients with breast cancer is important to address, as it is often treatable, and its resolution may unmask a desire for breast reconstruction, which has known benefits psychosocially.",2020,10.1097/GOX.0000000000002636,8,2,e2636,eng,2169-7574,NA,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gardiner_2012_Jopr.as.J,JOUR,"Telemedicine and plastic surgery: a review of its applications, limitations and legal pitfalls","Gardiner, Sonya and Hartzell, Tristan L.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS","BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding technology involving the exchange of medical information to assist diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Within the field of plastic surgery, where visual examination contributes heavily to patient management decision-making, telemedicine has great potential. However, privacy and medico-legal issues must be considered when using electronic communication to assist our clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of manuscripts published on telemedicine was performed. Articles were selected for relevance to plastic and reconstructive surgery and reviewed for applications, benefits and complications of telemedicine. In addition, the manuscripts were reviewed for conforming to current legal guidelines for the electronic transfer of patient information. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria (11 trauma and burns, 4 hand, 5 wound-care, 5 maxillofacial, 1 digital replantation, 2 free-flap monitoring, and 1 technical application). Twenty-eight (96%) manuscripts reported a benefit of telemedicine (commonly including increased access to expertise and costs saved through reduction of unnecessary transfers). However only five (17%) reported a statistical benefit compared to a standard treatment cohort (face-to-face interactions). Fifteen (51%) reported on adverse effects, which included misdiagnosis, time consumption, training, technical and cost issues. Only four manuscripts (14%) discussed conforming to legal guidelines within their institution. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine can improve access to the specialty of plastic surgery by facilitating the provision of expertise at remote sites. Its application can be used in many situations and between a variety of healthcare professionals. However, there is little critical analysis on the benefits and risks of telemedicine. In addition, its legal implications need to be carefully considered if it is to be safely integrated into our daily practice.",2012,10.1016/j.bjps.2011.11.048,65,3,53-e47,eng,1878-0539 1748-6815,"Humans and *Decision Making and *Surgery, Plastic and Telemedicine/*legislation & jurisprudence/trends",NA,NA,2012/03//undefined,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of this study was to compare current opinions of plastic and reconstructive surgeons (PRS) and surgical oncologists (SO) regarding the optimal timing of breast reconstruction for patients requiring PMRT. METHODS: Members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS), and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) were asked to participate in an anonymous web-based survey. Responses were solicited in accordance to the Dillman method, and they were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 330 members of the ASPS and 348 members of the ASBS and SSO participated in our survey. PRS and SO differed in patient-payor mix (p < 0.01) and practice setting (p < 0.01), but they did not differ by urban versus rural setting (p = 0.65) or geographic location (p = 0.30). Although PRS favored immediate reconstruction versus SO, overall timing did not significantly differ between the two specialists (p = 0.14). The primary rationale behind delayed breast reconstruction differed significantly between PRS and SO (p < 0.01), with more PRS believing that the reconstructive outcome is significantly and adversely affected by radiation. Both PRS and SO cited ""patient-driven desire to have immediate reconstruction"" (p = 0.86) as the primary motivation for immediate reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Although the optimal timing of reconstruction is controversial between PRS and SO, our study suggests that the timing of reconstruction in PMRT patients is ultimately driven by patient preferences and the desire of PRS to optimize aesthetic outcomes.",2015,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.06.026,68,11,1536-1542,eng,1878-0539 1748-6815,"Humans and Female and Time Factors and Decision Making and Follow-Up Studies and Societies, Medical and Medical Oncology and *Mastectomy and *Motivation and Mammaplasty/*psychology and Surgeons/*psychology and Radiotherapy, Adjuvant and Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/*surgery and Breast reconstruction and Current practices and Delayed breast reconstruction and Delayed-immediate breast reconstruction and Immediate breast reconstruction and Postmastectomy radiation therapy and Postoperative Care/*methods/psychology and Surgery, Plastic",NA,NA,2015/11//undefined,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is known about the medical decision-making process among adolescents with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and their families when faced with making complex treatment decisions. The experiences of these patients and their parents were analyzed to identify key factors in the decision-making process. METHODS: Eighteen adolescents with residual neonatal brachial plexus palsy deficits between 10 and 17 years and their parents were included. Qualitative research design was used involving separate, 1-hour, in person, semistructured interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed. Grounded theory was applied by two members of the research team to identify recurrent themes and create a codebook that was applied to the data. RESULTS: Medical decision-making among adolescents with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and their families is multifaceted and individualized, composed of both patient- and system-dependent factors. Four codes were identified: (1) knowledge acquisition, (2) multidisciplinary care, (3) adolescent autonomy, and (4) patient expectations and treatment desires. Overall, parental decision-making was heavily influenced by system-dependent factors, whereas adolescents largely based their decisions on individual treatment desires to improve function and/or aesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: There are many areas for improving the delivery of information and health care organization among adolescents with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and their families. The authors recommend the development of educational interdisciplinary programs and decision aids containing evidence-based management guidelines targeted toward primary care providers and patients. The authors believe that a computer-based learning module may provide the best avenue to achieve maximum penetrance and convenience of information sharing.

If psychological needs are identified at assessments, this creates 'on-costs' for psychological services, in terms of providing the necessary and indicated psychological interventions. The current study attempted to investigate clinical outcomes from psychological assessments for cosmetic surgery, through identifying the rate and range of possible outcomes and examining factors associated with such outcomes. The sample consisted of 62 females seeking cosmetic surgery concerning the appearance of either their breasts or their stomachs; 23 sought breast augmentation, 23 sought breast reduction and 18 sought abdominoplasty. Participants were seen for psychological assessment, during which a clinical screening interview was performed and various validated self-report measures completed. Results indicate that women seeking breast augmentation were more likely than women in the other groups to be recommended to receive either psychological treatments prior to surgery or psychological treatments alone. Lower levels of psychological distress were associated with recommendations for surgery.

OBJECTIVE: The authors investigate surgery duration as a determinant of morbidity, with the goal of defining a clinically relevant time for increased risk. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent a broad range of complex plastic surgical procedures (n = 1801 procedures) at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2012. Adjusting for possible confounders, multivariate logistic regression assessed surgery duration as an independent predictor of morbidity. To define a cutoff for increased risk, incidence of complications was compared among quintiles of surgery duration. Stratification by type of surgery controlled for procedural complexity. RESULTS: A total of 1753 cases were included in multivariate analyses with an overall complication rate of 27.8%. Most operations were combined (75.8%), averaging 4.9 concurrent procedures. Each hour increase in surgery duration was associated with a 21% rise in odds of morbidity (P < .0001). Compared with the first quintile of operative time (<2.0 hours), there was no change in complications until after 3.1 hours of surgery (odds ratio, 1.6; P = .017), with progressively greater odds increases of 3.1 times after 4.5 hours (P < .0001) and 4.7 times after 6.8 hours (P < .0001).

However, when its use as a screening test is critically examined, it appears that evidence to support its use is lacking. For example, there is no conclusive evidence at this time to show that using magnetic resonance imaging screening of asymptomatic women leads to a reduction in patient morbidity. Furthermore, based on existing data, it is unclear whether the potential benefits of screening magnetic resonance imaging tests outweigh the risks and potential costs for the patient. In the face of this uncertainty, shared medical decision making can be recommended. For different women, underlying beliefs and values will sway decision making in different directions.

Clinical decision making did not significantly differ by demographics, training, or practice setup. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surgeons still prefer to use standard handheld Doppler for free flap assessment, respondents were significantly more likely to opt for immediate return to the operating room for a concerning tissue oximetry reading than an abnormal Doppler signal.

In an attempt to improve safety, the Department of Health (DoH) and Professor Sir Bruce Keogh published a review in 2013 of the regulation of cosmetic interventions. Proposals included: (1) Banning free consultations; (2) Restricting time-limited promotional deals; (3) Two-stage written pre-operative consent; (4) Consultations with a medical professional rather than a sales 'consultant'. The Cosmetic Surgical Practice Working Party (CSWP) recommended a two week ""cooling off"" period before surgery.

This study explores factors critical to patient medical decision-making for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction among women with early stage, unilateral breast cancer. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used to gain an understanding of patients' choices and experiences. Patients with stage 0 to III unilateral breast cancer who underwent reconstruction were recruited, and semistructured interviews were conducted. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale and the BREAST-Q. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled; 13 (43 percent) underwent unilateral mastectomy and 17 (57 percent) underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Three broad categories emerged from patient interviews: medical decision-making, quality of life after mastectomy, and breast reconstruction expectations. Patients who chose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy made the decision for mastectomy based primarily on worry about recurrence. Quality of life after mastectomy was characterized by relief of worry, especially in patients who chose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [n = 14 (82.4 percent)]. Patients' desires for symmetry, although not the primary reason for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, played a role in supporting decisions made. Levels of worry after treatment were similar in both groups (72.7 percent). Patients with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy had higher mean scores for satisfaction with breast (82.4 versus 70.6) and satisfaction with outcome (89.9 versus 75.2).

We conducted a retrospective study to investigate not only complication and recurrence rates following pressure sore reconstruction but also preoperative risk stratification. METHODS: This study included 181 ulcers underwent flap operations between January 2002 and December 2013 were included in the study. We performed a multivariable logistic regression model, which offers a regression-based method accounting for the within-patient correlation of the success or failure of each flap. RESULTS: The overall complication and recurrence rates for all flaps were 46.4% and 16.0%, respectively, with a mean follow-up period of 55.4 <c2><b1> 38.0 months. No statistically significant differences of complication and recurrence rates were observed among three different reconstruction methods. In subsequent analysis, albumin <e2><89><a4>3.0 g/dl and paraplegia were significantly associated with higher postoperative complication. The anatomic factor, ischial wound location, significantly trended toward the development of ulcer recurrence. In the fasciocutaneous group, paraplegia had significant correlation to higher complication and recurrence rates. In the musculocutaneous flap group, variables had no significant correlation to complication and recurrence rates. In the free-style perforator group, ischial wound location and malnourished status correlated with significantly higher complication rates; ischial wound location also correlated with significantly higher recurrence rate.

Bastidas_2011_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,A single-institution experience of hand surgery litigation in a major replantation center,"Bastidas, Nicholas and Cassidy, Lindsey and Hoffman, Laurel and Sharma, Sheel",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Bellevue Hospital Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in New York and a major referral center for complex hand injuries and amputations. These injuries typically occur at the workplace and are thought to be highly litiginous in nature. This study was conducted to analyze the cases involving hand surgery litigation related to trauma over the last 8 years at this institution. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all claims filed against Bellevue Hospital Medical Center after treatment for a hand injury during 2001 to 2009. Twenty-three patients in total were identified and reviewed for age, mechanism/type of injury, complications, decision to replant, average time after injury to post claim, and whether settlement was obtained. RESULTS: One of 23 patients who filed suit against Bellevue Hospital Medical Center received a successful settlement involving an incident surrounding the loss of a nonreplantable part. Of 168 patients in whom 219 replantations/revascularizations were performed, five patients filed claims, all surrounding a failed attempt. In total, there were seven complications: five failed replants, one failed thenar flap, and one patient who needed a revision completion amputation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients who filed claims did so because of the decision not to replant. Only 2.98 percent (five of 168) of all attempted revascularization/replantation patients filed claims against the authors' institution; all claims were notably dropped. The legal system appears to support physicians and institutions that treat these complex injuries.

Current research shows that the functional outcomes for reconstruction are similar to those for below-knee amputation, but little investigation of the qualitative outcomes of either treatment option has been performed from the patient perspective. This study was designed to perform a qualitative analysis of patient preferences for amputation or reconstruction. METHODS: Twenty patients with type IIIB or IIIC open tibial fractures participated in the study. These patients had undergone either amputation or reconstruction between 1997 and 2007. Semistructured interviews were conducted and qualitative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Interviews highlighted several issues involved with medical decision-making. Participants described not having a role in deciding which medical treatment to choose. Family and spouses played a greater role, often because of patients being medicated when needing to make a treatment choice. Both amputation and reconstruction patients described being satisfied with the outcomes of their surgical treatments, but also expressed second thoughts about their treatment choices. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study emphasize how difficult it is to assign preference to one medical treatment over another. The study reveals how the role of the patient is limited in making a decision about pursuing amputation or reconstruction. Instead, there is a continued need for physicians to discuss treatment options and risks with family members who act on the patient's behalf, and to incorporate the patient's preference in this complex decision.",2010,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181f4449e,126,6,2019-2029,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Choice Behavior and Interview, Psychological and *Decision Support Techniques and Quality of Life/psychology and Patient Participation/psychology and Surgical Flaps and Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*psychology and Amputation/*psychology and Fractures, Open/*psychology/*surgery and Limb Salvage/*psychology and Multiple Trauma/*psychology/*surgery and Tibial Fractures/*psychology/*surgery",NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mar_2011_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Division or department: a microeconomic analysis,"Mar, Philip L. and Yu, Robert A. and Yu, Jack C.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: In this article, the authors present a microeconomic analysis of the effects of the administrative status on plastic surgery units within academic medical centers, comparing the departmental versus subdepartmental status. The objectives are to introduce decision-making tools of microeconomics and use them to explore the potential effects of administrative status on academic plastic surgery services. METHODS: Real financial data over a decade were used to construct total cost (TC), average total cost (ATC), and total revenue (TR) curves. From these, the authors derive the efficiency scale and express the fiscal performance by examining profitability, and the commonly used ATC curve. Mathematical modeling is then used to examine the effects of departmental versus subdepartmental status, assuming that (1) a plastic surgery unit exists in a competitive market; and (2) TR > TC for the plastic surgery unit to self-sustain in the long term. The variables considered are total clinical production (Q), gross collection rates (GCR), personnel cost, and departmental tax. RESULTS: The sustainability (Q against GCR) is a hyperbolic curve with Q * GCR = TC at break-even. The TC/TR = f(TR) curve resembles the ATC curve. Sectional versus departmental status for a plastic surgery service in an academic medical center depends greatly on the shape of their TC/TR = f(TR) curve.

[outcomes article],"Lee, Clara N. and Belkora, Jeff and Chang, Yuchiao and Moy, Beverly and Partridge, Ann and Sepucha, Karen",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Variation in rates of breast reconstruction after mastectomy has raised concerns about the quality of decisions about reconstruction. The authors sought to evaluate patient decision making about reconstruction, using a validated measure of knowledge and preferences related to reconstruction. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of early-stage breast cancer survivors from four university medical centers was conducted. The survey included measures of knowledge about specific reconstruction facts, personal goals and concerns, and involvement in decision making. A multivariable linear regression model of characteristics associated with knowledge and a logistic regression model of factors associated with having reconstruction were developed. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients participated (59 percent response rate). Participants answered 37.9 percent of knowledge questions correctly. Higher education (beta, 15 percent; p = 0.003) and having reconstruction (beta, 21 percent; p < 0.0001) were associated with higher knowledge. The goals ""use your own tissue to make a breast"" (odds ratio, 1.53; 95 percent CI, 1.15, 2.05) and ""wake up after mastectomy with reconstruction underway"" (odds ratio, 1.66; 95 percent CI, 1.30, 2.12) were associated with reconstruction. The goal ""avoid putting foreign material in your body"" was associated with no reconstruction (odds ratio, 0.64; 95 percent CI, 0.48, 0.86). Most patients reported they mainly made the decision or made the decision with the doctor equally (93 percent; 95 percent CI, 85 to 97 percent) and that their degree of involvement was about right (85 percent; 95 percent CI, 75 to 91 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with mastectomy in this study were not well-informed about breast reconstruction. Treatments were associated with patients' goals and concerns, however, and patients were highly involved in their decisions.

Examinees reasonably infer that tested material reflects the Society's vision for the core curriculum in plastic surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of evidence on which credited answers to the examination questions are based. METHODS: Two recent Plastic Surgery In-Service Training Exams (2014 and 2015) were analyzed. Questions were categorized using a taxonomy model. Recommended journal article references for Level III (decision-making) questions were assigned a level of evidence. Exam sections were analyzed for differences in question taxonomy distribution and level of evidence. To look for studies with higher levels of evidence, a PubMed search was conducted for a random sample of 10 questions from each section. RESULTS: One hundred three Level I (25.8 percent), 138 Level II (34.5 percent), and 159 Level III (39.8 percent) questions were analyzed (p < 0.001).

METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2007 to 2012, patients undergoing abdominal contouring procedures were identified and stratified by American Society of Anesthesiologists class. The primary outcome was any complication within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included minor wound, major surgical, and medical complication. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 3637 patients were analyzed; 14.6 percent of patients were class I, 59.1 percent were class II, 23.4 percent were class III, and 2.9 percent were class IV. Overall complication and mortality rates were 12 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. There was a significant trend of increasing odds of any complication with increasing class (class I, OR, 1.0; class II, OR, 1.5; class III, OR, 2.5; class IV, OR, 5.6; p-trend < 0.001). This trend was seen consistently for minor wound complications, medical complications, and major surgical complications (p = 0.007, p = 0.005, and p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The American Society of Anesthesiologists classification system, which is simple and universally applicable, appears to predict significant complications and can be used to rapidly screen patients before abdominal contouring. Furthermore, the authors' results can be used to inform patient-physician discussion about the risks incurred when undergoing these procedures based on their individual class.

The present report uses the case of craniopagus twins AD and TD to examine the bioethical issues faced by a multidisciplinary medical team in planning the separation of craniopagus twins. AD and TD are craniopagus twins conjoined at the head. TD's head is conjoined to the back of AD's head. Neurologically, AD has the dominant cerebral circulation. TD has two normal kidneys, whereas AD has none. AD depends on TD's renal function and, on separation, will require either a kidney transplant or lifelong dialysis. This case report reviews one approach to analyzing and solving complex ethical dilemmas in pediatric plastic surgery. The principles reviewed are (1) autonomy and informed consent, focusing especially on the role of children in the informed consent process; (2) beneficence and nonmaleficence, two intricately intertwined principles because separation could potentially cause irreversible harm to one twin while improving the quality of life for the other (as separation is not a life-saving procedure, is it ethical to perform a procedure with unknown surgical risk to improve children's quality of life?); and (3) justice (is it fair to allocate excessive medical resources for the twins' separation?).

These issues have the potential to affect future training and practice plans. METHODS: A 13-item questionnaire regarding issues influencing career plans was administered to senior plastic and reconstructive surgery trainees attending the 2009 American Society of Plastic Surgery Senior Residents Conference, in Austin, Texas. RESULTS: Of 97 conference attendees, 57 (58.7 percent) completed the survey representing all regions of the United States (33.3 percent of trainees nationwide).

The resulting variation in operative experience among plastic surgery trainees exemplifies the need for educational reform to accommodate change. Although the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated a transition to competency-based training, and state-of-the-art technologies in surgical simulation are being developed to improve operative skills, the construction of a system to teach and assess operative judgment is deficient and should be thoughtfully created and implemented. Established educational methods and curriculums can be used in this effort and include apprenticeship operative teaching, surgical simulation, morbidity and mortality conferences, and resident clinics. The first step in this effort is to require trainees to make decisions, communicating their judgments and recommendations using language that demonstrates clear thinking and thoughtful analysis. For faculty, this means carving out dedicated preoperative teaching time in addition to efficient use of intraoperative time and sharing of postoperative outcomes. For programs, this means developing metrics to evaluate progress and build procedure-specific simulations.

Ten patients (15 percent) presented with bilateral facial paralysis caused by Lyme disease, nine (13 percent) with Mobius syndrome, nine (13 percent) with neurofibromatosis type 2, five (7 percent) with bilateral facial palsy caused by brain tumor, four (6 percent) with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, three (4 percent) with bilateral temporal bone fractures, two (3 percent) with Guillain-Barre syndrome, one (2 percent) with central nervous system lymphoma, one (2 percent) with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and 24 (35 percent) with presumed Bell palsy. Treatment included pharmacologic therapy, physical therapy, chemodenervation, and surgical interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral facial palsy is a rare medical condition, and treatment often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The authors outline diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms of a tertiary care center to provide clinicians with a systematic approach to managing these complicated patients.",2016,10.1097/PRS.0000000000002599,138,4,879-887,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Aged and Follow-Up Studies and Infant, Newborn and Combined Modality Therapy and Clinical Decision-Making and *Facial Paralysis/diagnosis/etiology/therapy",NA,NA,2016/10//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Janis_2008_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Resident selection protocols in plastic surgery: a national survey of plastic surgery program directors,"Janis, Jeffrey E. and Hatef, Daniel A.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: With the transition of many plastic surgery training programs from the traditional to the integrated/coordinated model, critical evaluation of the process by which medical students are selected for residency is needed. To increase the understanding of this process and to improve the manner in which candidates are vetted, a survey study was designed. METHODS: A 29-question online survey was designed to discern desired qualities regarding resident selection, interview processes, resident participation, and program director satisfaction with the current process. This survey was sent to all 49 integrated/coordinated program directors in the United States. RESULTS: Forty-three of 49 program directors (87.8 percent) responded. High-quality letters of recommendation (author and substance) and performance on subinternship rotations and interviews were considered the most important qualities in selecting residents. Candidates' interview performance and rank order list position were considered by many to be indicative of resident quality, but responses varied. Forty-two of 43 program directors reported that their own residents participate in the interview and/or selection process. Overall, only 43.2 percent of respondents found the current process adequate for identifying potential problems. Furthermore, 39.5 percent of programs have dismissed a resident for academic or ethical reasons within the last 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Residency selection is a relatively subjective, unstandardized process. Because medical school performance is not always indicative of ultimate resident quality, it is imperative that integrated/coordinated plastic surgery training programs improve selection protocols to discern who will most likely become a successful resident. A number of program directors are dissatisfied with the process, and better systems for selection would be beneficial.",2008,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31818d20ae,122,6,1929-1939,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"United States and Humans and Data Collection and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Clinical Competence and *School Admission Criteria and Internship and Residency/*standards and Personnel Selection/*methods and Surgery, Plastic/*education/organization & administration",NA,NA,2008/12//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vu_2018_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Development and Internal Validation of the Abdominoplasty Risk Calculator,"Vu, Michael M. and Ellis, Marco F. and Blough, Jordan T. and Gutowski, Karol A. and Kim, John Y. S.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Risk calculators are an emerging tool that provide granular, individualized risk estimation. Presently, there is a paucity of risk calculators specific to plastic surgery. Abdominoplasty is a popular plastic surgery procedure associated with moderate risks of complications, such as surgical-site infection and dehiscence, and would benefit from the ability to provide patients with accurate, personalized risk assessment. METHODS: Abdominoplasties from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2005 to 2014 database were identified by Current Procedural Terminology code. Relevant perioperative variables included age, body mass index, sex, smoking history, diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, pulmonary comorbidities, hypertension, bleeding disorders, and operative duration. Multiple logistic regressions were used to generate 30-day risk models for medical complications, surgical-site infection, wound dehiscence, and reoperation. Internal validation of model performance was conducted using C-statistics, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, and Brier scores. RESULTS: Among the 2499 cases identified, complication rates were as follows: medical complications, 3.8 percent; superficial surgical-site infection, 2.4 percent; deep or organ-space surgical-site infection, 1.6 percent; wound dehiscence, 1.0 percent; and reoperation, 2.0 percent. Risk prediction models were constructed and all demonstrated good predictive performance, with mean predicted risks closely matching observed complication rates. The distributions of predicted risk were wide and contained outliers with very high risk. A user-friendly, open-access online interface for these models is published at AbdominoplastyRisk.org. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed an internally valid risk calculator for which individual patient characteristics can be input to predict 30-day complications after abdominoplasty. Given that estimated risk can vary widely, individualized risk assessment is a way to enhance shared decision-making between surgeon and patient.",2018,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003922,141,1,34e-45e,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Logistic Models and Databases, Factual and Risk Factors and Reproducibility of Results and Aged, 80 and over and Follow-Up Studies and *Decision Support Techniques and *Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control and Abdominoplasty/*adverse effects",NA,NA,2018/01//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
O.Neill_2017_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Predicting Complications in Immediate Alloplastic Breast Reconstruction: How Useful Is the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator?,"O'Neill, Anne C. and Murphy, Blake and Bagher, Shaghayegh and Al Qahtani, Saad and Hofer, Stefan O. P. and Zhong, Toni",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Complications following immediate breast reconstruction can have significant consequences for the delivery of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Identifying patients at higher risk of complications would ensure that immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise oncologic treatment. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator is an online tool in the public domain that offers individualized preoperative risk prediction for a wide range of surgical procedures, including alloplastic breast reconstruction. This study evaluates the usefulness of this tool in patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders at a single institution. METHODS: Details of 278 patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expander placement were entered into the calculator to determine the predicted complication rate. This was compared to the rate of observed complications on chart review. The predictive model was evaluated for calibration and discrimination using the statistical measures used in the original development of the calculator. RESULTS: The predicted rate of complications (5.2 percent) was significantly lower that the observed rate (16.2 percent; p < 0.01). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test confirmed lack of fit of the model. The C statistic was 0.62 and the Brier score was 0.173, indicating that the model had poor predictive power and could not discriminate between those who were at risk for complications and those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program universal Surgical Risk Calculator underestimated the proportion of patients that would develop complications in this cohort. In addition, it was unable to effectively identify individual patients at increased risk, suggesting that this tool would not make a useful contribution to preoperative decision-making in this patient group.",2017,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003051,139,3,532-538,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"United States and Humans and Female and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Time Factors and Societies, Medical and *Mastectomy and *Quality Improvement and Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology and Mammaplasty/*methods and *Tissue Expansion Devices",NA,NA,2017/03//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cavaliere_2008_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,A systematic review of total wrist arthroplasty compared with total wrist arthrodesis for rheumatoid arthritis,"Cavaliere, Christi M. and Chung, Kevin C.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Management of the end-stage rheumatoid wrist is controversial. The most common treatment is total wrist fusion. Total wrist arthroplasty offers a motion-preserving alternative. Comparison of outcomes for total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist fusion is necessary for evidence-based decision making. The purpose of this systematic review was to scientifically evaluate the existing literature for outcomes of both procedures in rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: A MEDLINE database review was performed. Search included ""wrist and arthroplasty,"" ""wrist and arthrodesis,"" and ""wrist and fusion."" Silicone arthroplasty was excluded. Data extraction included demographic information, surgical technique, pain, and active arc of motion. Complications and satisfaction were recorded. RESULTS: Literature review identified 1750 citations that were screened for inclusion criteria. Formal review identified 18 total wrist arthroplasty studies representing approximately 500 procedures. Data from 20 total wrist fusion studies represented over 800 procedures. Comparison of outcomes showed that total wrist fusion provides more reliable relief than total wrist arthroplasty. Complication and revision rates were higher for total wrist arthroplasty. Satisfaction was high in both groups. Postoperative motion was reviewed to evaluate whether arthroplasty provides a functional active arc of motion. Of 14 studies reporting appropriate data, three showed average active arc of motion within the functional range. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, outcomes for total wrist fusion were comparable and possibly better than those for total wrist arthroplasty in rheumatoid patients. In this era of cost-conscious medical care, expensive interventions must demonstrate superior outcomes. Existing data do not support widespread application of total wrist arthroplasty for the rheumatoid arthritis wrist.",2008,10.1097/PRS.0b013e318180ece3,122,3,813-825,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and *Arthroplasty, Replacement and *Arthrodesis and Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*surgery and Wrist Joint/*surgery",NA,NA,2008/09//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lee_2008_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Microvascular free tissue transfer in organ transplantation patients: is it safe?,"Lee, Anh B. and Dupin, Charles L. and Colen, Lawrence and Jones, Neil F. and May, James W. and Chiu, Ernest S.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, organ transplantation has been synonymous with patients with poor prognosis and outcome. Surgeons felt that the risks posed by immunosuppressive drugs outweighed the benefits of non-life-threatening procedures. With the enormous advances in the field of organ transplantation, a growing number of transplant patients present for a variety of surgical procedures. The objective of this report was to study the surgical outcome of organ transplantation patients who required reconstructive surgery using free tissue transfer. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted on organ transplant patients who underwent elective microvascular free flap procedures. Patient chart review included cause of organ failure, medications, reconstruction site, flap choice, days hospitalized, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: Five independent medical centers participated in the study. Nineteen organ transplant patients required free flaps. Free flaps were used to reconstruct a variety of surgical defects, including breast, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. There were no flap losses. Flaps used included musculocutaneous (n = 13), fasciocutaneous (n = 5), and osteocutaneous (n = 1) free flaps. Hospital length of stay ranged from 3 to 17 days. Complications included loss of skin graft, suture line dehiscence, and hematoma formation. Delayed wound healing was observed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the properly selected patient, microvascular free tissue transfer can be performed safely and with acceptable surgical outcome. Contrary to popular belief, delayed wound healing from immunosuppressive agents was uncommon. Free tissue transfer in healthy organ transplant patients can be considered in reconstructive surgery decision making.",2008,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31817123b0,121,6,1986-1992,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Multicenter Studies as Topic and *Organ Transplantation and Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*methods and Surgical Flaps/*blood supply and Microcirculation/physiology and Wound Healing/physiology,NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zhong_2013_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Decision regret following breast reconstruction: the role of self-efficacy and satisfaction with information in the preoperative period,"Zhong, Toni and Hu, Jiayi and Bagher, Shaghayegh and O'Neill, Anne C. and Beber, Brett and Hofer, Stefan O. P. and Metcalfe, Kelly A.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between satisfaction with information and decision regret has not been previously studied in breast reconstruction patients. The objective of this study, therefore, was to assess this relationship and the factors that may influence satisfaction with preoperative information, including self-efficacy (confidence with seeking medical knowledge). METHODS: All patients who underwent breast reconstruction between January of 2009 and March of 2011 were approached to complete the Modified Stanford Self-Efficacy Scale (1 to 10), the satisfaction with information subscale of the BREAST-Q (1 to 100), and the Decision Regret Scale (1 to 100). Two multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the relationship between patient-reported satisfaction with information and decision regret, and to evaluate the relationship among satisfaction with information, self-efficacy level, and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In 100 participants (71 percent response rate), the mean Decision Regret Scale score was 9.3<c2><b1>17.3 of 100, and the majority of patients experienced no regret (60 percent). We found that regret was significantly reduced when patients were more satisfied with the preoperative information that they received from their plastic surgeons (<ce><b2>=0.95; 95 percent CI, 0.93 to 0.96). Furthermore, patients reported higher satisfaction with information when they possessed more self-efficacy irrespective of their sociodemographic characteristics (<ce><b2>=1.06; 95 percent CI, 1.04 to 1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who possess lower levels of self-efficacy are at greater risk for experiencing dissatisfaction with the information that they receive in the preoperative period, and ultimately suffered more regret over their decision to undergo breast reconstruction.

Craft_2011_Plaandrecsur,JOUR,Patient satisfaction in unilateral and bilateral breast reconstruction [outcomes article],"Craft, Randall O. and Colakoglu, Salih and Curtis, Michael S. and Yueh, Janet H. and Lee, Britt S. and Tobias, Adam M. and Lee, Bernard T.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: The goal of reconstruction after mastectomy is to provide a long-term and symmetric reconstruction. Providing symmetry entails different decision making when faced with a unilateral or bilateral reconstruction. In unilateral reconstruction, the goal is to match the contralateral breast; however, in bilateral reconstruction, symmetry between the reconstructed breasts is more important. The purpose of this study was to examine patient satisfaction between unilateral and bilateral reconstruction. METHODS: All women at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center undergoing breast reconstruction between 1999 and 2006 were identified. Patient demographics and complications were collected. A survey was administered examining general and aesthetic satisfaction. Patients with unilateral reconstruction were identified and compared with patients with bilateral reconstruction. Additional analysis was performed based on the type of reconstruction, including autologous, autologous with implant, and tissue expander/implant-based reconstruction. RESULTS: Overall, 702 women underwent 910 breast reconstructions (494 unilateral, 416 bilateral). Patients in the bilateral reconstruction group were more likely to have prophylactic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between unilateral and bilateral reconstruction. Patient satisfaction was highest in unilateral patients with autologous compared with implant reconstruction (general satisfaction, 73.9 versus 40.9 percent, p < 0.0001; aesthetic satisfaction, 72.3 versus 43.2 percent, p < 0.0001). Bilateral reconstruction had similar general and aesthetic satisfaction scores across autologous, autologous with implant, and implant-based reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing unilateral reconstruction have the highest satisfaction with autologous reconstruction. As symmetry between reconstructed breasts is essential for patient satisfaction in bilateral reconstruction, it is important to use the same type of reconstruction, whether autologous or implant-based.",2011,10.1097/PRS.0b013e318208d12a,127,4,1417-1424,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Outcome Assessment, Health Care and *Patient Satisfaction and *Mastectomy and Surgical Flaps and *Mammaplasty/adverse effects/methods/psychology and Breast Implants/adverse effects and Breast Neoplasms/genetics/prevention & control/surgery and Tissue Expansion Devices/adverse effects",NA,NA,2011/04//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: In the present study, 84 patients, having received otoplasty using a suture technique, were asked to answer validated questionnaires (the Glasgow Benefit Inventory and the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory, respectively); Glasgow Benefit Inventory and Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory scores can range from -100 (maximal adverse effect) through 0 (no effect) to 100 (maximal positive effect). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (73.8 percent) returned a valid questionnaire. For the adults' cohort (n=21), the mean total Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was 30.6; 100.0 percent were satisfied with the aesthetic result, and 90.5 percent would again decide in favor of the operation. For the children's cohort (n=41), the mean total Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory score was 24.1; 95.1 percent of the parents and 95.1 percent of the children were satisfied with the aesthetic result; and 97.6 percent of the parents and 92.7 percent of the children would again decide in favor of the operation. The health-related quality of life was elevated in 95.2 percent of the adults and 95.1 percent of the children.

Surgical techniques for genital gender-affirming surgery in transgender men have evolved considerably. The aim of this study was to present an overview of the evolution of genital gender-affirming surgery for transgender men in a single, high-volume center. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of all transgender men who underwent genital gender-affirming surgery from January of 1989 to January of 2018 at their institution. Subject demographics, type of surgery, and surgical techniques were recorded. RESULTS: Over time, four hundred transgender men underwent genital gender-affirming surgery. Metoidioplasty was performed in 222 patients (56 percent) and phalloplasty in 178 patients (44 percent). Before 2010, the majority of patients underwent metoidioplasty, whereas since 2010, phalloplasty has been performed in most patients. Of 400 patients, 332 (83 percent) underwent urethral lengthening. The option to undergo genital surgery without urethral lengthening was offered from 2004. Since then, 68 (34 percent) patients chose to undergo genital gender-affirming surgery without urethral lengthening. The choice of surgical options for genital gender-affirming surgery in transgender men has grown from five in 1989 to 12 techniques currently. The variety and combination of flaps used for phalloplasty has increased over time. Conversely, the use of some flaps has been abandoned, whereas other flaps have reemerged. CONCLUSIONS: Genital gender-affirming surgery has developed over time in line with reconstructive surgical innovations. Despite technical advancements, there is no one ideal technique, and every technique has specific advantages and disadvantages. With the increase in surgical options, shared decision-making and a shift from surgeon-centered toward more patient-centered care are required.",2020,10.1097/PRS.0000000000006385,145,1,153e-161e,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,"Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Netherlands and *Transgender Persons and Urethra/surgery and Counseling/statistics & numerical data/trends and Gender Dysphoria/psychology/*surgery and Genitalia, Female/*surgery and Perioperative Care/statistics & numerical data/*trends and Sex Reassignment Surgery/statistics & numerical data/*trends",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to investigate patient satisfaction and quality of life following autologous reconstruction to determine whether differences exist between unilateral and bilateral reconstructions to better guide clinical decision-making. METHODS: The current study examined prospectively collected BREAST-Q results following abdominal free flap breast reconstruction procedures performed at a tertiary academic medical center from 2009 to 2017. The reconstruction module of the BREAST-Q was used to assess outcomes between laterality groups (unilateral versus bilateral) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and more than 3 years. RESULTS: Overall, 405 patients who underwent autologous breast reconstruction completed the BREAST-Q. Cross-sectional analysis at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years revealed similar satisfaction scores between groups; however, bilateral reconstruction patients demonstrated higher satisfaction scores at more than 3 years (p = 0.04). Bilateral reconstruction patients reported lower scores of abdominal well-being at 1 year, 2 years, and more than 3 years (p = 0.01, p = 0.03, and p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that satisfaction with breasts does not differ with the laterality of the autologous reconstruction up to 3 years postoperatively but may diverge thereafter. Bilateral reconstruction patients, however, have lower satisfaction with the abdominal donor site. These data can be used in preoperative counseling, informed consent, and expectations management in patients considering contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.",2020,10.1097/PRS.0000000000007239,146,5,964-975,eng,1529-4242 0032-1052,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Time Factors and Cohort Studies and Prospective Studies and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *Patient Satisfaction and Breast Neoplasms/*surgery and Mammaplasty/*methods and *Surgical Flaps and Autografts and Rectus Abdominis/transplantation and Transplant Donor Site,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Plast Reconstr Surg,NA,NA,NA,NA
