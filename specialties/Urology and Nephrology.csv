Nephrology,"Incorrect prescription and administration of medications account for a substantial proportion of medical errors in the USA, causing adverse drug events (ADEs) that result in considerable patient morbidity and enormous costs to the health-care system. Patients with chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury often have impaired drug clearance as well as polypharmacy, and are therefore at increased risk of experiencing ADEs. Studies have demonstrated that recognition of these conditions is not uniform among treating physicians, and prescribed drug doses are often incorrect. Early interventions that ensure appropriate drug dosing in this group of patients have shown encouraging results. Both computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support systems have been shown to reduce the rate of ADEs. Nevertheless, these systems have been implemented at surprisingly few institutions. Economic stimulus and health-care reform legislation present a rare opportunity to refine these systems and understand how they could be implemented more widely.

Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, nonbiological factors may have a large role in these observed disparities. Therefore, we sought to measure the relative importance of race compared to health care and social factors on prostate cancer specific mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database we identified 514,878 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 40 years or greater between 2004 and 2012. We also selected a subset of black and white men matched by age, stage and birth year. We stratified patients by age 40 to 54, 55 to 69 and 70 years or older and disease stage, resulting in 18 groups. By applying random forest methods with variable importance measures we analyzed 15 variables and interactions across 4 categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, and health care and social factors) and the relative importance for prostate cancer specific mortality. RESULTS: Tumor characteristics at diagnosis were the most important factors for prostate cancer mortality. Across all groups race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics and only more important than health care and social factors in 2 of the 18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, health care and social factors known to be associated with racial disparities had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages.

Perry",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,"BACKGROUND: Timely prediction of AKI in children can allow for targeted interventions, but the wealth of data in the electronic health record poses unique modeling challenges. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of all children younger than 18 years old who had at least two creatinine values measured during a hospital admission from January 2014 through January 2018. We divided the study population into derivation, and internal and external validation cohorts, and used five feature selection techniques to select 10 of 720 potentially predictive variables from the electronic health records. Model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the validation cohorts. The primary outcome was development of AKI (per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine definition) within a moving 48-hour window. Secondary outcomes included severe AKI (stage 2 or 3), inpatient mortality, and length of stay. RESULTS: Among 8473 encounters studied, AKI occurred in 516 (10.2%), 207 (9%), and 27 (2.5%) encounters in the derivation, and internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The highest-performing model used a machine learning-based genetic algorithm, with an overall receiver operating characteristic curve in the internal validation cohort of 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72 to 0.79] for AKI, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.83) for severe AKI, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.86) for neonatal AKI. To translate this prediction model into a clinical risk-stratification tool, we identified high- and low-risk threshold points.

RESULTS: Three dominant themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of the electronic medical records of 340 cohort members with notes containing hospice mentions: (1) hospice and usual care as antithetical care models: clinicians appeared to perceive a sharp demarcation between services that could be provided under hospice versus usual care and were often uncertain about hospice eligibility criteria. This could shape decision-making about hospice and dialysis and made it hard to individualize care; (2) hospice as a last resort: patients often were referred to hospice late in the course of illness and did not so much choose hospice as accept these services after all treatment options had been exhausted; and (3) care complexity: patients' complex care needs at the time of hospice referral could complicate transitions to hospice, stretch the limits of home hospice, and promote continued reliance on the acute care system.

The clips were ordered in increasing complexity from lower level tasks (catheterization and cystoscopy) to more advanced procedures (laser lithotripsy, and open and laparoscopic prostatectomy and nephrectomy). Performance was transcribed and blindly rated using the previously validated rating scale. Subjects were also asked to self-evaluate their performance using this scale. RESULTS: Overall the rating scale distinguished the training level across knowledge domains (anatomy and management of the current task) and judgment domains (avoiding complications, higher reasoning and immediate surgical planning). The mean score across all training levels was 112 of 200 (range 51 to 161). Scale performance showed a significant correlation with seniority (rho = 0.96, p <0.05). This trend persisted when performance was analyzed separately for knowledge and judgment domain elements (rho = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, each p <0.05). Self-evaluation correlated well with blinded evaluation across all levels of training (rho = 0.87, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The Surgical Decision Making Rating Scale can reliably detect differences in knowledge and surgical judgment among medical students, urology residents and staff urologists. This tool has potential applications for evaluating trainees and determining subjects with proficient decision making abilities. It also shows a significant correlation between self-rated performance and blinded evaluation.",2009,10.1016/j.juro.2009.01.032,181,5,2251-2256,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Probability and Sensitivity and Specificity and Students, Medical and Education, Medical, Undergraduate and Internship and Residency and Education, Medical, Graduate and *Decision Making and Clinical Competence/*standards and Medical Staff, Hospital and Educational Measurement/*methods/standards and Health Care Surveys/*instrumentation and Urologic Surgical Procedures/*education/trends and Urology/*instrumentation/standards/trends",NA,NA,2009/05//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To critically review the comparative effectiveness evidence of PN versus RN; to describe key trade-offs involved in this treatment decision; and to highlight gaps in the current literature. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative critical review of the medical literature was conducted. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patients who undergo PN for an anatomically complex or large mass may be exposed to perioperative and potential oncologic risks that could be avoided if RN were performed, while patients who undergo RN may forgo long-term benefits of renal preservation. Decision-making regarding the optimal treatment with PN or RN among patients with anatomically complex or large renal mass is highly nuanced and must balance the risks and benefits of each approach. Currently, high-quality evidence on comparative effectiveness is sparse. Retrospective comparisons are plagued by selection biases, while the one existing prospective randomized trial, albeit imperfect, suggests that nephron-sparing surgery may not benefit all patients. CONCLUSIONS: For anatomically complex tumors, PN preserves renal parenchyma but may expose patients to higher perioperative risks than RN. The risks and benefits of each surgical approach must be better objectified for identification of patients most suitable for complex PN. A prospective randomized trial is warranted and would help in directing patient counseling.

The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific. Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves, but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and culture.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a multimodal model, incorporating previously identified messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers and traditional risk factors that could be used to identify patients with high-grade PCa (Gleason score <e2><89><a5>7) on prostate biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In two prospective multicenter studies, urine was collected for mRNA profiling after digital rectal examination (DRE) and prior to prostate biopsy. The multimodal risk score was developed on a first cohort (n=519) and subsequently validated clinically in an independent cohort (n=386). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The mRNA levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to model patient risk and combine risk factors. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, and clinical utility was evaluated with a decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels were shown to be good predictors for the detection of high-grade PCa. The multimodal approach reached an overall AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95) in the validation cohort (AUC 0.86 in the training cohort), with the mRNA signature, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, and previous cancer-negative prostate biopsies as the strongest, most significant components, in addition to nonsignificant model contributions of PSA, age, and family history. For another model, which included DRE as an additional risk factor, an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.92) was obtained (AUC 0.90 in the training cohort). Both models were successfully validated, with no significant change in AUC in the validation cohort, and DCA indicated a strong net benefit and the best reduction in unnecessary biopsies compared with other clinical decision-making tools, such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator and the PCA3 assay. CONCLUSIONS: The risk score based on the mRNA liquid biopsy assay combined with traditional clinical risk factors identified men at risk of harboring high-grade PCa and resulted in a better patient risk stratification compared with current methods in clinical practice. Therefore, the risk score could reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study evaluated a novel urine-based assay that could be used as a noninvasive diagnostic aid for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa). When results of this assay are combined with traditional clinical risk factors, risk stratification for high-grade PCa and biopsy decision making are improved.",2016,10.1016/j.eururo.2016.04.012,70,5,740-748,eng,1873-7560 0302-2838,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Risk Factors and Reproducibility of Results and Research Design and Patient Selection and Neoplasm Grading and Risk Assessment/methods and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Prostate/pathology and Medical Overuse/*prevention & control and Urine and Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis and *Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology/therapy/urine and *RNA, Messenger/analysis/urine and Biologic markers and Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics and Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics and Logistic models and Messenger RNA and Prostate neoplasms and PSA and Transcription Factors/*genetics",NA,NA,2016/11//undefined,Eur Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ironically, many who are eligible for transplant do not follow through on the complex workup protocols required to be placed on the transplant waiting list. Here we surveyed vascular access clinic patients at an academic medical center referred for transplant, who did not follow up on the needed workup to be added to the national transplant waiting list. The most frequent responses of 83 patients for not pursuing transplantation were that the patients did not think they would pass the medical tests, they were scared of getting a transplant, and they could not afford the medicine or the transplantation. These impediments may result from unclear provider communication, misinformation received from peers or other sources, misperceptions related to transplant surgery, or limited health literacy/health decision-making capacity.

METHODS: The Prospective Urinary Incontinence Research (PURE) was a 6-mo observational study with 1055 physicians from 15 European countries enrolling 9487 women. QOL was assessed at the enrolment visit using the urinary Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QOL) and the generic EQ-5D. A single-item instrument was used to measure the degree of bother. UI severity was assessed using the Sandvik Index. UI was categorised into stress (SUI), mixed (MUI), and urge (UUI) urinary incontinence by a patient-administered instrument (Stress and Urge Incontinence Questionnaire [S/UIQ]). Multivariate linear (I-QOL, EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale) and logistic (bother, EQ-5D health state index) regressions were performed. RESULTS: Mean total I-QOL scores were significantly and independently associated with UI severity, nocturia, age, UI subtype, number of selected concomitant medical conditions, length of suffering from UI before contacting a doctor, smoking status, ongoing use of UI medication, and country. After adjusting for all the covariates, the total I-QOL scores for SUI, MUI, and UUI were 62.7, 53.8 and 60.1, respectively. As with I-QOL, UI severity was also the most important predictor for bother.

OBJECTIVE: To explore and discuss possible reasons for disagreement in results from SRs/MAs and RCTs and to provide guidance to clinicians and guideline developers for making well-informed treatment decisions and recommendations in the face of conflicting data. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The advantages and limitations of RCTs and SRs/MAs are reviewed. Two practical examples that have a direct bearing on European Association of Urology guidelines on treatment recommendations are discussed in detail to illustrate the points to be considered when conflicts exist between the results of large RCTs and SRs/MAs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: RCTs are the gold standard for providing evidence of the effectiveness of interventions. However, concerns regarding the internal and external validity of an RCT may limit its applicability to clinical practice. SRs/MAs synthesize all evidence related to a given research question, but two urologic examples show that the validity of the results depends on the quality of the individual studies, the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies, and publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Although SRs/MAs can provide a higher level of evidence than RCTs, the quality of the evidence from both RCTs and SRs/MAs should be investigated when their results conflict to determine which source provides the better evidence. Guideline developers should have a well-defined and robust process to assess the evidence from MAs and RCTs when such conflicts exist.

Knoll_2018_Eurourol,JOUR,Key Steps in Conducting Systematic Reviews for Underpinning Clinical Practice Guidelines: Methodology of the European Association of Urology,"Knoll, Thomas and Omar, Muhammad Imran and Maclennan, Steven and Hernandez, Virginia and Canfield, Steven and Yuan, Yuhong and Bruins, Max and Marconi, Lorenzo and Van Poppel, Hein and N'Dow, James and Sylvester, Richard",European urology,"CONTEXT: The findings of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are used for clinical decision making. The European Association of Urology has committed increasing resources into the development of high quality clinical guidelines based on such SRs and MAs. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we have summarised the process of conducting SRs for underpinning clinical practice guidelines under the auspices of the European Association of Urology Guidelines Office. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The process involves explicit methods and the findings should be reproducible. When conducting a SR, the essential first step is to formulate a clear and answerable research question. An extensive literature search lays the foundation for evidence synthesis. Data are extracted independently by two reviewers and any disagreements are resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In SRs, data for particular outcomes in individual randomised controlled trials may be combined statistically in a meta-analysis to increase power when the studies are similar enough. Biases in studies included in a SR/MA can lead to either an over estimation or an under estimation of true intervention effect size, resulting in heterogeneity in outcome between studies. A number of different tools are available such as Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool for randomised controlled trials. In circumstances where there is too much heterogeneity, or when a review has included nonrandomised comparative studies, it is more appropriate to conduct a narrative synthesis. The GRADE tool for assessing quality of evidence strives to be a structured and transparent system, which can be applied to all evidence, regardless of quality. A SR not only identifies, evaluates, and summarises the best available evidence, but also the gaps to be targeted by future studies. CONCLUSIONS: SRs and MAs are integral in developing sound clinical practice guidelines and recommendations. PATIENT SUMMARY: Clinical practice guidelines should be evidence based, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential in their production.

However, despite many known monogenic causes of FSGS, single gene defects explain only 30% of cases. METHODS: To investigate mutations underlying FSGS, we sequenced 662 whole exomes from individuals with sporadic or familial FSGS. After quality control, we analyzed the exome data from 363 unrelated family units with sporadic or familial FSGS and compared this to data from 363 ancestry-matched controls. We used rare variant burden tests to evaluate known disease-associated genes and potential new genes. RESULTS: We validated several FSGS-associated genes that show a marked enrichment of deleterious rare variants among the cases. However, for some genes previously reported as FSGS related, we identified rare variants at similar or higher frequencies in controls. After excluding such genes, 122 of 363 cases (33.6%) had rare variants in known disease-associated genes, but 30 of 363 controls (8.3%) also harbored rare variants that would be classified as ""causal"" if detected in cases; applying American College of Medical Genetics filtering guidelines (to reduce the rate of false-positive claims that a variant is disease related) yielded rates of 24.2% in cases and 5.5% in controls. Highly ranked new genes include SCAF1, SETD2, and LY9. Network analysis showed that top-ranked new genes were located closer than a random set of genes to known FSGS genes. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis validated many known FSGS-causing genes, we detected a nontrivial number of purported ""disease-causing"" variants in controls, implying that filtering is inadequate to allow clinical diagnosis and decision making. Genetic diagnosis in patients with FSGS is complicated by the nontrivial rate of variants in known FSGS genes among people without kidney disease.",2019,10.1681/ASN.2019020152,30,9,1625-1640,eng,1533-3450 1046-6673,"Mutation and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Case-Control Studies and False Positive Reactions and Age of Onset and DNA Mutational Analysis and Genetic Association Studies and Apolipoprotein L1/genetics and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/ethnology/*genetics and human genetics and kidney and Whole Exome Sequencing",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,J Am Soc Nephrol,NA,NA,NA,NA

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was performed from January 1, 2004, to May 3, 2011, using renal cell carcinoma, nephrectomy (Medical Subject Heading [MeSH] major topic), surgical procedures, minimally invasive (MeSH major topic), nephron-sparing surgery, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, surveillance, and watchful waiting. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Initial active surveillance (AS) should be a first treatment option for small renal masses (SRMs) <4 cm in unfit patients or those with limited life expectancy. SRMs that show fast growth or reach 4 cm in diameter while on AS should be considered for treatment. Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the established treatment for T1a tumours (<4 cm) and an emerging standard treatment for T1b tumours (4-7 cm) provided that the operation is technically feasible and the tumour can be completely removed. Radical nephrectomy (RN) should be limited to those cases where the tumour is not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) has benefits over open RN in terms of morbidity and should be the standard of care for T1 and T2 tumours, provided that it is performed in an advanced laparoscopic centre and NSS is not applicable. Open PN, not LRN, should be performed if minimally invasive expertise is not available. At this time, there is insufficient long-term data available to adequately compare ablative techniques with surgical options. Therefore ablative therapies should be reserved for carefully selected high surgical risk patients with SRMs <4 cm. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of treatment for the patient with localised RCC needs to be individualised. Preservation of renal function without compromising the oncologic outcome should be the most important goal in the decision-making process.",2011,10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.040,60,4,662-672,eng,1873-7560 0302-2838,"Humans and Female and Male and Treatment Outcome and Cryosurgery/methods and Carcinoma, Renal Cell/epidemiology/*surgery and Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/*surgery and Laparoscopy/methods and Nephrectomy/methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2011/10//undefined,Eur Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We developed a novel, active participation crowdsourcing method to determine BP-RS (Bladder Permeability Defect Risk Score). It is based on noninvasive urinary cytokines to discriminate patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome who had Hunner lesions from controls and patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome but without Hunner lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a national crowdsourcing study in cooperation with the Interstitial Cystitis Association. Patients answered demographic, symptom severity and urinary frequency questionnaires on a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant website. Urine samples were collected at home, stabilized with a preservative and sent to Beaumont Hospital for analysis. The expression of 3 urinary cytokines was used in a machine learning algorithm to develop BP-RS. RESULTS: The IP4IC study collected a total of 448 urine samples, representing 153 patients (147 females and 6 males) with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, of whom 54 (50 females and 4 males) had Hunner lesions. A total of 159 female and 136 male controls also participated, who were age matched. A defined BP-RS was calculated to predict interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome with Hunner lesions or a bladder permeability defect etiology with 89% validity. CONCLUSIONS: In this novel participation crowdsourcing study we obtained a large number of urine samples from 46 states, which were collected at home, shipped and stored at room temperature. Using a machine learning algorithm we developed BP-RS to quantify the risk of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome with Hunner lesions, which is indicative of a bladder permeability defect etiology. To our knowledge BP-RS is the first validated urine biomarker assay for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and one of the first biomarker assays to be developed using crowdsourcing.",2018,10.1016/j.juro.2017.09.167,199,5,1344-1350,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and crowdsourcing and Machine Learning and Case-Control Studies and Severity of Illness Index and Social Media and Postal Service and Surveys and Questionnaires/statistics & numerical data and Biomedical Research/*methods and Crowdsourcing/*methods and computational biology and Biomarkers/urine and cystitis and Cystitis, Interstitial/complications/*diagnosis/urine and interstitial and Pelvic Pain/*diagnosis/etiology/urine and Specimen Handling/*methods and urinary bladder",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We collected detailed costs within this trial to determine how choice of locking solution would affect overall health care costs, including the cost of locking solutions and all other relevant medical costs over the course of the 6-month trial. Nonparametric bootstrap estimates were used to derive 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and mean cost differences between the treatment groups. The cost of the locking solution was higher in patients receiving rt-PA/heparin, but this was partially offset by lower costs for managing complications. Overall, the difference in unadjusted mean cost for managing patients with rt-PA/heparin versus heparin alone was Can$323 (95% CI, -$935 to $1581; P=0.62). When the costs were extrapolated over a 1-year time horizon using decision analysis, assuming ongoing rt-PA effectiveness, the overall costs of the strategies were similar. This finding was sensitive to plausible variation in the frequency and cost of managing patients with catheter-related bacteremia, and whether the benefit of rt-PA on catheter-related bacteremia was maintained in the long term. In summary, we noted no significant difference in the mean overall cost of an rt-PA/heparin strategy as a locking solution for catheters compared with thrice-weekly heparin.

Ruud and Tillier, Corinne and Horenblas, Simon and Aaronson, Neil K.",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to 1) describe preferred and experienced roles in treatment decision making among patients with localized prostate cancer, 2) identify how often the roles experienced by patients matched their preferred roles and 3) determine whether active involvement in decision making regardless of role preferences or concordance between preferred and experienced roles would be the strongest predictor of more favorable patient reported outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, observational study we obtained serial questionnaire data from 454 patients with newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer (cT1-cT2, or Gleason 7 or less and prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or less). Questionnaires were completed prior to treatment and at the 3, 6 and 12-month posttreatment followups. Clinical data were obtained from the patient medical records. Active involvement and role concordance were operationalized using the CPS (Control Preferences Scale). ANOVA and effect sizes (small and medium Cohen d = 0.2 and 0.5, respectively) were used to compare patient knowledge of prostate cancer, decision conflict, decision regret and overall health related quality of life. RESULTS: Of the patients 393 (87%) reported having been actively involved in treatment decision making. However, 78 patients (17%) indicated having had less or more involvement than preferred. Active involvement was significantly associated with more prostate cancer knowledge (d = 0.30), less decision conflict (d = 0.52) and less decision regret (d = 0.34). Role concordance was also but less strongly associated with less decision conflict (d = 0.41).

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and the most frequent end point of CKD. There is an urgent need for more precise methods to identify patients at risk of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Alterations in microvascular structure and function contribute to the development of hypertension, diabetes, CKD, and their associated cardiovascular disease. Homology between the eye and the kidney suggests that noninvasive imaging of the retinal vessels can detect these microvascular alterations to improve targeting of at-risk patients. Retinal vessel-derived metrics predict incident hypertension, diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease and add to the current renal and cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has transformed retinal imaging by capturing the chorioretinal microcirculation and its dependent tissue with near-histological resolution. In hypertension, diabetes, and CKD, OCT has revealed vessel remodeling and chorioretinal thinning. Clinical and preclinical OCT has linked retinal microvascular pathology to circulating and histological markers of injury in the kidney. The advent of OCT angiography allows contrast-free visualization of intraretinal capillary networks to potentially detect early incipient microvascular disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature yielded 303 studies published from 1996 through 2013. This review informed the majority of the guideline statements from the 2013 guideline. Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions were used for guideline statements lacking sufficient evidence. The guideline was subsequently amended in April 2014 and March 2015. The current 2018 amendment search yielded 770 references with 47 studies eventually providing relevant data. The resulting amendment focuses on the incorporation of information relating to the treatment of patients with non-metastatic CRPC. RESULTS: Guideline statements based on six Index Patients developed to represent the most common scenarios encountered in clinical practice were amended appropriately. The additional literature provided the basis for an update of current supporting text as well as the incorporation of new guideline statements for asymptomatic non-metastatic CRPC. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rapidly evolving nature of this field, this guideline should be used in conjunction with recent systematic literature reviews and an understanding of individual patients' treatment goals.

It has been used to pattern cells; replicate tissues or full organs; create surgical replicas for planning, counseling, and training; and build medical device prototypes and prosthetics, and in numerous other applications. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of 3D printing for surgical planning, training and education, patient counseling, and costs in urology. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: After screening, 4026 publications were identified for detailed review, of which 52 were included in the present systematic review: two papers reported the use of 3D-printing modeling for adrenal cancer, two papers for urethrovesical anastomosis, 24 papers for kidney transplantation and renal cancer, 13 papers for prostate cancer, seven papers for pelvicalyceal system procedures, and three papers for ureteral stents, and three papers reported 3D-printed biological scaffold development.

Use of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) might improve outcomes. We conducted a multicenter, sequential period analysis of 528,108 patients without ESRD before admission, from October of 2012 to September of 2015, to determine whether use of a CDSS reduces hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality for patients with AKI. We compared patients treated 12 months before (181,696) and 24 months after (346,412) implementation of the CDSS. Coprimary outcomes were hospital mortality and length of stay adjusted by demographics and comorbidities. AKI was diagnosed in 64,512 patients (12.2%).

OBJECTIVE: To review, display, and evaluate the current evidence regarding the biologic and analytic approach of urinary prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) in prostate cancer (PCa) detection, staging, and prognosis, and its therapeutic potential. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic and comprehensive Medline search was performed using the Medical Subject Headings search terms PCA3, DD3, UPM3, prostate cancer, cell-lines, prostate tissue, prostate biopsy, detection, diagnosis, radical prostatectomy, staging, grading, progression, and gene therapy. Results were restricted to English-language papers published within the period 1999-2011. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The PCA3 gene is highly overexpressed in specific PCa cell lines and prostatic tumours. In 2006, a simple and robust urine test (Progensa) became commercially available. Despite its costs, prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) is superior to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and percent free PSA in the early detection of PCa. PCA3 improves the diagnostic accuracy of externally validated nomograms among men with an elevated PSA undergoing biopsy. PCA3 independently predicts low-volume disease and pathologically insignificant PCa but is not associated with locally advanced disease and is limited in the prediction of aggressive cancer. Preliminary data demonstrate that combining PCA3 with other new biomarkers further improves diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. Finally, findings of the first PCA3-Gene-ViroTherapy study suggest therapeutic potential by exploiting PCA3 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: PCA3, integrated in novel biopsy nomograms or risk stratification tools, can be used to counsel or confirm biopsy indications. If confirmed in further studies, using PCA3 together with established staging risk factors could assist clinicians in specific pretreatment decision making.

OBJECTIVE: To compare weighted and unweighted Charlson Comorbidity Index scores in predicting long-term, other-cause mortality in men with early-stage PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of 1482 men with early-stage PCa diagnosed in 1998-2004 at two Southern California Veterans Affairs medical centers. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Subhazard ratios and cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality associated with weighted and unweighted Charlson scores, calculated by competing-risks regression accounting for cancer mortality, along with Harrell concordance index (C-index) values. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Weighted and unweighted Charlson scores were identical in 88.6% of subjects (1313 of 1482 men) across all scores and in 91.7% of subjects (1359 of 1482 men) across scores of 0, 1, 2, and <e2><89><a5>3. In competing-risks analysis, hazards of other-cause mortality were similar when comparing weighted and unweighted scores. Men with weighted scores of 1, 2, and <e2><89><a5>3 (vs. 0) had subhazard ratios of 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.2), 4.1 (95% CI, 2.9-5.8), and 8.3 (95% CI, 5.9-11.5), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To bring together a large multidisciplinary group of experts to develop consensus statements on controversial topics in bladder cancer management. DESIGN: A steering committee compiled proposed statements regarding advanced and variant bladder cancer management which were assessed by 113 experts in a Delphi survey. Statements not reaching consensus were reviewed; those prioritised were revised by a panel of 45 experts prior to voting during a consensus conference. SETTING: Online Delphi survey and consensus conference. PARTICIPANTS: The European Association of Urology (EAU), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), experts in bladder cancer management. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statements were ranked by experts according to their level of agreement: 1-3 (disagree), 4-6 (equivocal), and 7-9 (agree). A priori (level 1) consensus was defined as <e2><89><a5>70% agreement and <e2><89><a4>15% disagreement, or vice versa. In the Delphi survey, a second analysis was restricted to stakeholder group(s) considered to have adequate expertise relating to each statement (to achieve level 2 consensus). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 116 statements were included in the Delphi survey. Of these statements, 33 (28%) achieved level 1 consensus and 49 (42%) achieved level 1 or 2 consensus. At the consensus conference, 22 of 27 (81%) statements achieved consensus. These consensus statements provide further guidance across a broad range of topics, including the management of variant histologies, the role/limitations of prognostic biomarkers in clinical decision making, bladder preservation strategies, modern radiotherapy techniques, the management of oligometastatic disease, and the evolving role of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: These consensus statements provide further guidance on controversial topics in advanced and variant bladder cancer management until a time when further evidence is available to guide our approach. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report summarises findings from an international, multistakeholder project organised by the EAU and ESMO. In this project, a steering committee identified areas of bladder cancer management where there is currently no good-quality evidence to guide treatment decisions. From this, they developed a series of proposed statements, 71 of which achieved consensus by a large group of experts in the field of bladder cancer. It is anticipated that these statements will provide further guidance to health care professionals and could help improve patient outcomes until a time when good-quality evidence is available.",2020,10.1016/j.eururo.2019.09.035,77,2,223-250,eng,1873-7560 0302-2838,Diagnosis and Treatment and Humans and International Cooperation and Consensus and Neoplasm Staging and Delphi and Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy and Bladder cancer and Follow-up,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Eur Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kutikov_2011_ThJoofur,JOUR,The gatekeeper disparity--why do some medical schools send more medical students into urology?,"Kutikov, Alexander and Bonslaver, Jason and Casey, Jessica T. and Degrado, Justin and Dusseault, Beau N. and Fox, Janelle A. and Lashley-Rogers, Desri and Richardson, Ingride and Smaldone, Marc C. and Steinberg, Peter L. and Trivedi, Deep B. and Routh, Jonathan C.",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: Urology continues to be a highly desirable specialty despite decreasing exposure of students to urology in American medical schools. We assessed how American medical schools compare to each other in regard to the number of students that each sends into urological training. We evaluated the reasons why some medical schools consistently send more students into urology than others. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained American Urological Association Match data for the 5 match seasons from 2005 to 2009. We then surveyed all successful participants. The survey instrument was designed to determine what aspects of the medical school experience influenced students to specialize in urology. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was then done to assess which factors correlated with more students entering urology from a particular medical school. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2009 a total of 1,149 medical students from 130 medical schools successfully participated in the urology match. Of the 132 allopathic medical schools 128 sent at least 1 student into urology (mean <c2><b1> SD 8.9 <c2><b1> 6.5, median 8). A few medical schools were remarkable outliers, sending significantly more students into urology than other institutions. Multivariate analysis revealed that a number of medical school related variables, including strong mentorship, medical school ranking and medical school size, correlated with more medical students entering urology. CONCLUSIONS: Some medical schools launch more urological careers than others. Although the reasons for these findings are multifactorial, recruitment of urological talent pivots on these realities.",2011,10.1016/j.juro.2010.09.113,185,2,647-652,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"United States and Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Young Adult and Decision Making and Multivariate Analysis and Workforce and Education, Medical, Undergraduate and *Career Choice and Students, Medical/*statistics & numerical data and Urology/*education and Schools, Medical/*trends and Physicians/supply & distribution and Education, Medical, Graduate/statistics & numerical data and Internship and Residency/*organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2011/02//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

The summary presented represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations.

Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.",2020,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.08.030,78,5,731-742,eng,1873-7560 0302-2838,"COVID-19 and Humans and Organizational Innovation and Telemedicine and Mental health and Telemedicine/*methods and Health services accessibility and *Pandemics/prevention & control and Pandemic and Communicable Disease Control/methods and Biomedical research and *Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control and *Delivery of Health Care/ethics/organization & administration/standards/trends and *Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/prevention & control and *Practice Patterns, Physicians'/organization & administration/trends and *Urogenital Neoplasms/psychology/therapy and Mental Health/standards",NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Eur Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gulati_2019_ThJoofur,JOUR,Personalized Risks of Over Diagnosis for Screen Detected Prostate Cancer Incorporating Patient Comorbidities: Estimation and Communication,"Gulati, Roman and Psutka, Sarah P. and Etzioni, Ruth",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: Shared patient-physician decision making regarding the treatment of prostate cancer detected by prostate specific antigen screening involves a complex calculus weighing cancer risk and patient life expectancy. We sought to quantify these competing risks using the probability that the cancer was over diagnosed, ie would not have been clinically diagnosed (diagnosed without screening) during the remaining lifetime of the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an established model of prostate cancer screening and clinical diagnosis we simulated screen detected cases and determined whether a modeled clinical diagnosis would occur before noncancer death. Time of noncancer death was based on comorbidity adjusted population lifetables. Logistic regression models were fitted to the simulated data and used to estimate over diagnosis probabilities given patient age, prostate specific antigen level, Gleason sum and comorbidity category. An online calculator was developed to communicate over diagnosis estimates. Face validity and ease of use were assessed by surveying 32 clinical experts. RESULTS: Estimated probabilities of over diagnosis ranged from 4% to 78% across clinicopathological variables and comorbidity status. When ignoring comorbidity, the estimated probability of over diagnosis in a 70-year-old man with prostate specific antigen 9.4 ng/ml and Gleason 6 was 34%. With severe comorbidities the estimate increased to 51%. Such a personalization may help inform the choice between active surveillance and definitive treatment. Based on responses from 20 of 32 experts we modified the explanation of over diagnosis for the online calculator and the input method for comorbid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of over diagnosis is strongly influenced by comorbidity status in addition to age. Personalized estimates incorporating comorbidity may contribute to shared decision making between patients and providers regarding personalized treatment selection.",2019,10.1097/JU.0000000000000346,202,5,936-943,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Life Expectancy and Aged and Comorbidity and Biopsy and United States/epidemiology and Mass Screening/*methods and Neoplasm Grading and *Early Detection of Cancer and comorbidity and Biomarkers, Tumor/blood and mass screening and Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood and prostatic neoplasms and Survival Rate/trends and life expectancy and Prostate/*pathology and medical overuse and Cause of Death/trends and Medical Overuse/*trends and Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since its inception, it has undergone several modifications triggered by a change in clinical practice and a better understanding of the cancer's histologic spectrum and variants and their prognostic significance. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the implementation and the impact of the Gleason system as a predictive and prognostic tool in all available treatment modalities, and to compare the original and modified Gleason systems in major pathologic and clinical outcome data sets. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive nonsystematic Medline search was performed using multiple Medical Subject Headings such as Gleason, modified, system, outcome, biopsy, prostatectomy, recurrence, prognosis, radiotherapy, and focal therapy, with restriction to the English language and a preference for publications within the last 10 yr. All Gleason grade-related studies in the last 3 yr were reviewed. For studies before this date, we relied on prior culling of the literature for various recent books, chapters, and original articles on this topic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Using the modified grading system resulted in disease upgrading with more cancers assigned a Gleason score <e2><89><a5> 7 than in the past. It also resulted in a more homogeneous Gleason score 6, which has an excellent prognosis when the disease is organ confined. The vast majority of studies using both systems showed that Gleason grading of adenocarcinomas on needle biopsies and radical prostatectomies was strongly associated with pathologic stage, status of surgical margins, metastatic disease, biochemical recurrence, and cancer-specific survival, with the modified system outperforming the original one in some large series. A description of the continuous incorporation of this parameter in the clinical decision making for treating prostate cancer using all currently used treatment modalities is presented, and the findings of studies before and after the inception of the modified grading system, if available, are compared. The proposed contemporary grading prognostic categories are 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9-10. CONCLUSIONS: The Gleason score is one of the most critical predictive factors of prostate cancer regardless of the therapy used. Modernization of the Gleason grading system has resulted in a more accurate grading system for radical prostatectomy (RP) but has complicated the comparison of data before and after the updating. A better prognostication with the updated Gleason grading system for patients treated with modalities other than surgery can only be postulated at this time because there are limited conflicting data on radiation and no studies on other treatment modalities. Its greatest impact is the uniformly excellent prognosis associated with Gleason score 6 in RPs.",2013,10.1016/j.eururo.2012.10.015,63,5,892-901,eng,1873-7560 0302-2838,"Humans and Male and Risk Assessment and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Predictive Value of Tests and Disease-Free Survival and Disease Progression and Patient Selection and Neoplasm Staging and Chemotherapy, Adjuvant and *Decision Support Techniques and Watchful Waiting and Radiotherapy, Adjuvant and Biopsy, Needle and Neoplasm Grading/*methods and *Prostatectomy/methods and Androgen Antagonists/therapeutic use and Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use and Brachytherapy and Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/*therapy",NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,Eur Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Fesperman, Susan F. and Watterson, James D. and Dahm, Philipp",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: Evidence-based decision making seeks to balance potential benefits and harms (adverse effects) of health care interventions for an individual patient. We determined the prevalence and completeness of harm reporting in randomized controlled trials in the urological literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of all randomized controlled trials of therapeutic interventions published in The Journal of Urology, Urology, European Urology and BJU International in 1996 and 2004. Each article was reviewed by 2 independent investigators for 10 harm reporting criteria recommended by the CONSORT group. Discrepancies were settled by discussion and consensus. RESULTS: A total of 152 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 109 (72%) reported adverse event outcomes. The median number of harm reporting criteria satisfied improved marginally from 1996 to 2004 (2.8 to 3.3, p = 0.36). A large proportion of studies failed to address harm in the abstract (55, 36%), introduction (71, 47%) and discussion (52, 34%). Few studies specified which adverse events were evaluated (21, 14%), when harm information was collected (32, 21%) or how the harm was attributed to the intervention (5, 3%). Only 48 (32%) articles provided reasons for patient withdrawal and 1 in 5 (33, 22%) reported the severity of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials published in the urological literature contain significant deficiencies in adverse event reporting. These findings suggest the need for reporting standards for harm in urological journals. Improvements in adverse event reporting would permit a more balanced assessment of interventions and would enhance evidence-based urological practice.",2010,10.1016/j.juro.2010.01.030,183,5,1693-1697,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"Humans and Quality Assurance, Health Care and Evidence-Based Medicine and Decision Making and Bibliometrics and Terminology as Topic and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Iatrogenic Disease and Information Storage and Retrieval/methods and *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and *Postoperative Complications and Medical Records/standards and Research Design/standards and Periodicals as Topic/*standards and *Urologic Surgical Procedures",NA,NA,2010/05//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although some clinical discrepancies may be attributed to genetic risk and/or access to care, explanations for racial discrepancies in decisional regret remain largely speculative. We aim to identify sources of prostate cancer decisional regret with a focus on racial disparities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 1,112 patients with localized prostate cancer treated at the Cleveland Clinic between 2010 and 2016 were matched by race, Gleason score, treatment (external beam radiation, brachytherapy, prostatectomy, active surveillance), prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, age at treatment and time since treatment. All patients received 4 surveys, including the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26, the Decisional Regret Scale, our novel Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire and a modified EPIC demographics form. Descriptive and comparative statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare survey outcomes by race and treatment method. RESULTS: Of 1,048 deliverable surveys 378 (36.07%) were returned. African American men had worse decisional regret than nonAfrican American men even after adjusting for relevant covariates (OR 2.46, p <0.0001). African American men also had higher Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire medical mistrust and masculinity scores, both of which predicted worse decisional regret independent of race (1.415 and 1.350, p=0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: African American men suffer worse decisional regret than nonAfrican American men, which may be partially explained by higher medical mistrust and concerns about masculinity as captured by the Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed long-term HRQOL following various treatments for localized PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of HRQOL up to 10 yr after treatment used a prospectively accrued, nationwide PCa registry that collects longitudinal patient-reported HRQOL. INTERVENTION: Various primary treatments for localized PCa. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The Medical Outcomes Studies 36-item Short Form and the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index characterized physical function, mental health, and sexual, urinary, and bowel function and bother. Repeated measures mixed-model analysis assessed change in HRQOL by treatment over time, and logistic regression was used to measure the likelihood of a clinically significant decline in HRQOL. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 3294 men, 1139 (34%) underwent nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP), 860 (26%) underwent non-NSRP, 684 (21%) underwent brachytherapy, 386 (12%) underwent external beam radiotherapy, 161 (5%) underwent primary androgen deprivation therapy, and 64 (2%) pursued watchful waiting/active surveillance. Median follow-up was 74 mo (interquartile range: 50-102). Most treatments resulted in early declines in HRQOL, with some recovery over the next 1-2 yr and a plateau in scores thereafter. Surgery had the largest impact on sexual function and bother and on urinary function, radiation had the strongest effect on bowel function, and androgen deprivation therapy had the strongest effect on physical function. The main limitation was attrition among the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although most men experience initial declines in HRQOL in the first 2 yr after treatment, there is little change from 3 to 10 yr and most differences between treatments attenuated over time.

O. and Gravas, Stavros",European urology,"CONTEXT: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men and have multifactorial aetiology. OBJECTIVE: To develop European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the assessment of men with non-neurogenic LUTS. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A structured literature search on the assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS was conducted. Articles with the highest available level of evidence were selected. The Delphi technique consensus approach was used to develop the recommendations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: As a routine part of the initial assessment of male LUTS, a medical history must be taken, a validated symptom score questionnaire with quality-of-life question(s) should be completed, a physical examination including digital rectal examination should be performed, urinalysis must be ordered, post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured, and uroflowmetry may be performed. Micturition frequency-volume charts or bladder diaries should be used to assess male LUTS with a prominent storage component or nocturia. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be measured only if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change the management or if PSA can assist in decision-making for patients at risk of symptom progression and complications. Renal function must be assessed if renal impairment is suspected from the history and clinical examination, if the patient has hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS. Uroflowmetry should be performed before any treatment. Imaging of the upper urinary tract in men with LUTS should be performed in patients with large PVR, haematuria, or a history of urolithiasis. Imaging of the prostate should be performed if this assists in choosing the appropriate drug and when considering surgical treatment. Urethrocystoscopy should only be performed in men with LUTS to exclude suspected bladder or urethral pathology and/or before minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment. Pressure-flow studies should be performed only in individual patients for specific indications before surgery or when evaluation of the pathophysiology underlying LUTS is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide evidence-based practical guidance for assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS. An extended version is available online (www.uroweb.org/guidelines). PATIENT SUMMARY: This article presents a short version of European Association of Urology guidelines for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

The summary presented herein represents Part II of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. Please refer to Part I for discussion of specific care options and outcome expectations and management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. Additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 2 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). RESULTS: The AUA (American Urological Association), ASTRO, and SUO (Society of Urologic Oncology) formulated an evidence-based guideline based on a risk stratified clinical framework for the management of localized prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized (1:1), controlled, parallel group, nonblinded trial was performed in 4 regions of the United States. Eligible men had clinically localized prostate cancer and an upcoming consultation, and they spoke and read English or Spanish. Participants answered questionnaires to report decision making stage, personal characteristics, concerns and preferences plus baseline symptoms and decisional conflict. A randomization algorithm allocated participants to receive tailored education and communication coaching, generic teaching sheets and external websites plus a 1-page summary to clinicians (intervention) or the links plus materials provided in clinic (usual care). Conflict outcomes and the number of consultations were measured at 1 month. Univariate and multivariable models were used to analyze outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 392 men were randomized, including 198 to intervention and 194 to usual care, of whom 152 and 153, respectively, returned 1-month outcomes. The mean <c2><b1> SD 1-month decisional conflict scale (score range 0 to 100) was 10.9 <c2><b1> 16.7 for intervention and 9.9 <c2><b1> 18.0 for usual care.

However, its performance in African American men has been unknown. We assessed test performance in a cohort of men with a large African American representation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men referred for prostate biopsy at 8 Veterans Affairs medical centers were prospectively enrolled in the study. All men underwent phlebotomy for 4Kscore test assessment prior to prostate biopsy. The primary outcome was the detection of Grade Group 2 or higher cancer on biopsy. We assessed the discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of 4Kscore to predict Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer and compared it to a base model consisting of age, digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen. Additionally, we compared test performance in African American and nonAfrican American men. RESULTS: Of the 366 enrolled men 205 (56%) were African American and 131 (36%) had Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer. The 4Kscore test showed better discrimination (AUC 0.81 vs 0.74, p <0.01) and higher clinical usefulness on decision curve analysis than the base model. Test prediction closely approximated the observed risk of Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer. There was no difference in test performance in African American and nonAfrican American men (0.80 vs 0.84, p = 0.32), The test outperformed the base model in each group.

Shawn and Bischoff, Carl J. and Algood, Chester B. and Vieweg, Johannes and Dahm, Philipp",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: We determined study characteristics, authorship and institutional origin of studies presented in abstract form at the Southeastern Section of the American Urological Association annual meetings and identified predictors of full text publication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All abstracts of poster and podium presentations from the Southeastern Section of the American Urological Association annual meetings from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed. A standardized evaluation form was developed and tested in 2 subsets of 50 abstracts, and then applied by 2 individual reviewers with specific coding instructions. Predictor variables analyzed included study origin, design, topic, domain, presentation form, number of patients, reporting of statistical analysis and gender. Univariate and multivariate analysis was applied using SPSS version 14.0. RESULTS: A total of 1,195 abstracts were found eligible for review. The mean number of abstracts presented per year was 120 +/- 16 (range 107 to 146). In clinical studies (1,068) approximately three-quarters of the abstracts reported case series (801, 75.0%). Cohort studies accounted for 11.2% of the abstracts and 4.0% were randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews/meta-analyses.

The survey was divided into 4 categories, including 1) demographics, 2) prebiopsy risk assessment, 3) pretreatment risk assessment and 4) risk estimation tool use. RESULTS: A total of 565 members (10%) responded to the online survey, of whom 31% reported using a risk estimation tool in the prebiopsy decision setting. Providers who spent more than 20 minutes counseling patients were more likely to use a risk estimation tool (OR 2.2, p <0.01). After the prostate cancer diagnosis 70% of providers used a risk estimation tools to guide treatment recommendations. The total time spent counseling a patient (greater than 30 minutes) and the number of years in practice (fewer than 10) predicted prostate cancer risk tool use (OR 2.4, p <0.01 and 3.4, p <0.01, respectively).

We seek to identify opportunities for improvement in avoiding surgery for nonmalignant pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MUSIC-KIDNEY started collecting data in 2017. All patients with cT1 renal masses who had partial or radical nephrectomy for nonmalignant pathology were identified. Category for improvement (none-0, minor-1, moderate-2 or major-3) was independently assigned to each case by 5 experienced kidney surgeons. Specific strategies to decrease nonmalignant pathology were identified. RESULTS: Of 1,392 patients with cT1 renal masses 653 underwent surgery and 74 had nonmalignant pathology (11%). Of these, 23 (31%) cases were cT1b. Radical nephrectomy was performed in 17 (22.9%) patients for 5 cT1a and 12 cT1b lesions. Only 6 patients had a biopsy prior to surgery (5 oncocytoma, 1 unclassified renal cell carcinoma). Review identified 25 cases with minor (34%), 26 with moderate (35%) and 10 with major (14%) quality improvement opportunities. Overall 17% of cases had no quality improvement opportunities identified (12 partial nephrectomy, 1 radical nephrectomy). CONCLUSIONS: Review of patients with cT1 renal masses who underwent surgery for nonmalignant pathology revealed a significant number of cases in which this outcome may have been avoided. Approximately half of cases had moderate or major quality improvement opportunities, with radical nephrectomy for nonmalignant pathology being the most common reason. Our data indicate a lowest achievable and acceptable rate of nonmalignant pathology to be 1.9% and 5.4%, respectively. Avoiding interventions for nonmalignant pathology, particularly radical nephrectomy, is an important focus of quality improvement efforts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original systematic review yielded 294 studies published between January 1990 and December 2012. In April 2018, the guideline underwent an amendment and incorporated 155 references that were published from January 1990 through December 2017. Two new key questions were added. One on the use of genomic classifiers and the other on the treatment of oligo-metastases with radiation post-radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: A new statement on the use of hormone therapy with salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy was added and long-term data was used to update an existing statement on adjuvant radiotherapy. The balance of the guideline statements were re-affirmed and references were added to the existing literature base. A discussion on the use of genomic classifiers as a risk stratification tool was added to the future research discussion. No relevant data on oligo-metastases was found. CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy should be offered to patients who have had radical prostatectomy and who are candidates for salvage radiotherapy. The clinician should discuss possible short- and long-term side effects with the patient as well as the potential benefits of preventing recurrence. The decision to use hormone therapy should be made by the patient and a multi-disciplinary team of providers with full consideration of the patient's history, values, preferences, quality of life, and functional status.",2019,10.1097/JU.0000000000000295,202,3,533-538,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,"Humans and Male and Patient Participation and Quality of Life and Prostatectomy and Prostatic Neoplasms/*therapy and Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and radiation and Patient Care Team/standards and prostatic neoplasms and Societies, Medical/*standards and Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control and Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods/*standards and Radiation Oncology/standards and salvage therapy and Salvage Therapy/methods/*standards and Urology/standards",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We identified long-term risks of other cause mortality associated with comorbidities in the Charlson index and applied these to the creation of a prostate cancer specific comorbidity index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sampled 1,598 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 1997 to 2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine the risks of other cause mortality associated with comorbidities and used these hazard ratios to re-weight the Charlson index. We then compared the ability of each index to predict other cause mortality. RESULTS: Cox modeling showed that moderate to severe liver disease, metastatic solid tumor, lymphoma and leukemia carried the highest risk (HR greater than 5) for other cause mortality, followed by moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe renal disease, dementia, hemiplegia and congestive heart failure (HR 2.5 to less than 3.5). The revised and original Charlson indices performed similarly in predicting other cause mortality across all patients (c-index 0.816 vs 0.802). However, in survival analysis our revised index identified 137 men with a greater than 90% probability of other cause mortality within 10 years while the original Charlson identified only 51. In multivariate modeling the odds of 5-year other cause mortality for men with original Charlson scores 1, 2, 3 and 4+ were 2.9, 6.0, 9.2 and 29.8, respectively, compared with 3.9, 6.2, 12.8 and 84.2 for the revised index. CONCLUSIONS: Re-weighting the Charlson index allowed for more accurate identification of men at highest risk for other cause mortality.

However, many documents, such as pathology reports, may be beyond the health literacy of most patients. We compared the effectiveness of bladder biopsy patient centered pathology reports with standard reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local bladder cancer experts reached consensus on the important elements of a bladder biopsy pathology report to inform prognosis and counseling. Patient focus groups identified the patient centered formats and language to convey these elements and constructed a pilot patient centered pathology report. A total of 40 patients undergoing bladder biopsy were block randomized to receive the standard report with or without the patient centered report. We assessed patient self-efficacy, and provider communication and empathy, and tested bladder cancer knowledge at pathology disclosure and 1 month later. We compared study groups with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Experts identified stage, grade and histology as the most important elements of a bladder biopsy pathology report. Patients prioritized 3 themes, including narrative format, tumor stage illustration and risk stratification for recurrence. A total of 39 patients completed initial and followup assessments. Patients with the patient centered pathology report had improved ability to identify cancer stage compared to those with the standard report. Initially 58% of patients with the standard report vs 20% with the patient centered report were unable to describe stage but at followup this incidence was 47% vs 15% (p = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Those with the patient centered report also trended toward improved identification of cancer grade. Provider communication trended toward improvement for the patient centered report. Ratings of patient self-efficacy did not differ by report. CONCLUSIONS: Patient centered pathology reports are associated with greater patient knowledge about the bladder cancer diagnosis. The reports may aid patient-provider communication.

We compared laparoscopic prostatectomy with or without robotic assistance vs open radical prostatectomy in terms of postoperative outcomes and subsequent cancer directed therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a population based cancer registry linked with Medicare claims we identified men 66 years old or older with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2003 to 2005. Outcome measures were general medical/surgical complications and mortality within 90 days after surgery, genitourinary/bowel complications within 365 days, radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy within 365 days and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 5,923 men 18% underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, there were no differences in the rate of general medical/surgical complications (OR 0.93 95% CI 0.77-1.14) or genitourinary/bowel complications (OR 0.96 95% CI 0.76-1.22), or in postoperative radiation and/or androgen deprivation (OR 0.80 95% CI 0.60-1.08). Laparoscopic prostatectomy was associated with a 35% shorter hospital stay (p <0.0001) and a lower bladder neck/urethral obstruction rate (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94). In laparoscopic cases surgeon volume was inversely associated with hospital stay and the odds of any genitourinary/bowel complication.

Scales_2007_ThJoofur,JOUR,Evidence based clinical practice: a primer for urologists,"Scales, Charles D. Jr and Preminger, Glenn M. and Keitz, Sheri A. and Dahm, Philipp",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: Evidence based clinical practice has been defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. It refers to a broad set of principles and methods intended to ensure that medical decisions, guidelines and health policy are based on well designed studies of therapeutic effectiveness and benefit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We review the principles and practice of evidence based clinical practice using examples from the urology literature. We further provide a guide to currently available web based evidence based clinical practice resources and guidelines for urologists. RESULTS: Evidence based clinical practice integrates a hierarchy of evidence and patient values with practitioner judgment to guide decision making for the individual patient. Important steps in the evidence based clinical practice process include the formulation of an answerable question and a systematic search of the literature. In the absence of pre-appraised evidence or disease specific guidelines, the practice of evidence based clinical practice relies heavily on the evaluation of the primary literature by the individual urologist. Depending on the question domain (therapy/prevention, etiology/cause/harm, diagnosis or prognosis) and study design, a given study is critically appraised for validity, impact and applicability. Evidence is then integrated with clinical judgment, and patient circumstances and preferences. Finally, the practice of evidence based clinical practice includes a self-assessment of provider performance. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge, practice and documentation of evidence based clinical practice are of increasing importance to every urologist. Urologists should embrace evidence based clinical practice principles by acquiring the necessary skills to critically appraise the literature for the best evidence applicable to patient care.",2007,10.1016/j.juro.2007.05.020,178,3 Pt 1,775-782,eng,0022-5347,Humans and *Urology and *Evidence-Based Medicine/methods/standards,NA,NA,2007/09//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

M. and Kennedy, Katherine P. and MacDonagh, Ruaraidh P.",The Journal of urology,"PURPOSE: We assessed which clinical parameters consultant urologists use to recommend treatment for early prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 consultant urologists reviewed 70 paper representations of patients with prostate cancer. Each contained 7 commonly available cues, including prostate specific antigen, Gleason grade, rectal examination, magnetic resonance imaging/laparoscopic stage, medical history, patient choice and age, in addition to 2 cues not yet routinely available, that is predicted life expectancy and 10-year survival probability, as calculated using actuarial formulas based on noncancer comorbidity. Consultants indicated how strongly they would recommend radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy with or without hormones, or active surveillance/hormones. Judgment analysis was performed using multiple regression analysis with significance considered at p<or=0.01 to identify which cues consultants had used. RESULTS: Consultants varied in the treatments that they recommended. An average of only 3 of the possible 9 cues was used to formulate decisions. Prostate specific antigen and predicted 10-year survival probability were most commonly used for recommending all 3 treatment options. Patient choice, predicted life expectancy, rectal examination and age were all used infrequently. Consultants were inconsistent in an average of 31.4% of judgments when repeat cases were analyzed with the greatest inconsistency observed when recommending radiotherapy with or without hormones and the least inconsistency when recommending radical prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Consultants were inconsistent in their decisions regarding the management of early prostate cancer and they used only a small number of available clinical parameters.

We retrieved the clinicopathological factors from the medical records including age, body mass index, albumin, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, preoperative radiotherapy/chemotherapy, palpable lymph nodes, previous lymph node biopsy, total number of resected lymph nodes and ratio of positive lymph nodes. The criterion of drain removal was total drain output of 50 ml or less per day for 2 days starting from postoperative day 3. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore the risk factors of drainage duration and variable selection was performed according to Akaike's information criteria. A nomogram was built based on regression coefficients and internally validated with 200 bootstrap resamples. RESULTS: Median postoperative drainage duration was 7 days. The prediction model using pretreatment factors showed a concordance index of 0.55. With the addition of lymph node related variables a second model was constructed which produced a better concordance index (0.65) and good calibration. On multivariate analysis young age, high body mass index, total number of resected lymph nodes and ratio of positive lymph nodes were independent predictors of prolonged lymphatic drainage. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of readily obtained clinicopathological variables we developed a nomogram to predict the duration of lymphatic drainage which, if externally validated, could be helpful for patient consultation, treatment decision making and clinical trial design.",2012,10.1016/j.juro.2011.09.024,187,1,129-133,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Forecasting and Predictive Value of Tests and *Nomograms and Drainage/*methods and Inguinal Canal and Lymph Node Excision/*methods and Penile Neoplasms/*surgery,NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objective was to define the prevalence of financial toxicity among patients with bladder cancer and identify delays in care and its effect on health related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients with bladder cancer in the University of North Carolina Health Registry/Cancer Survivorship Cohort. Financial toxicity was defined as agreement with having ""to pay more for medical care than you can afford."" Health related quality of life was measured using general and cancer specific validated questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test and the Student t-test. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with bladder cancer were evaluated. Median age was 66.9 years, 75% of the patients were male and 89% were white. Of the participants 33 (24%) endorsed financial toxicity. Participants who were younger (p = 0.02), black (p = 0.01), reported less than a college degree (p = 0.01) and had noninvasive disease (p = 0.04) were more likely to report financial toxicity. On multivariable analysis only age was a significant predictor of financial toxicity. Patients who endorsed financial toxicity were more likely to report delaying care (39% vs 23%, p = 0.07) due to the inability to take time off work or afford general expenses. On general health related quality of life questionnaires patients with financial toxicity reported worse physical and mental health (p = 0.03 and <0.01, respectively), and lower cancer specific health related quality of life (p = 0.01), physical well-being (p = 0.01) and functional well-being (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Financial toxicity is a major concern among patients with bladder cancer. Younger patients were more likely to experience financial toxicity. Those who endorsed financial toxicity experienced delays in care and poorer health related quality of life, suggesting that treatment costs should have an important role in medical decision making.",2018,10.1016/j.juro.2017.10.049,199,5,1166-1173,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,Humans and Female and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and health care costs and quality of life and *Quality of Life and surveys and questionnaires and *Cost of Illness and patient outcome assessment and urinary bladder neoplasms and Time-to-Treatment/*economics and Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*economics/therapy,NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also sought to develop a decision-making aid to select patients for evaluation with pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined men with mild hyperprolactinemia (15.1-50.0 ng/ml) who presented with symptoms of hypogonadism and underwent pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. Demographics, laboratory values and clinical data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Selected predictor variables were included in multivariable logistic regression and partitioning models. Cost avoidance analysis was performed on models achieving sensitivities <e2><89><a5>90%. RESULTS: A total of 141 men were included in the study, of whom 40 (28%) displayed abnormalities on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with pituitary abnormalities exhibited higher prolactin (p=0.01), lower testosterone (p=0.0001) and lower luteinizing hormone (p=0.03) levels than those with normal anatomy, as well as higher prolactin-to-testosterone ratios (p <0.0001) and lower luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios (p=0.0001). These serological variables were identified as the best performing predictor variables. The partition incorporating a prolactin-to-testosterone ratio cutoff of 0.10 and prolactin cutoff of 25 ng/ml achieved 90% sensitivity and 48% specificity, and reduced diagnostic expenses by 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogonadal men presenting with mild hyperprolactinemia and pituitary abnormalities declare themselves via endocrine studies routinely ordered to evaluate these conditions. The prolactin-to-testosterone ratio is the best independent predictor of finding a pituitary abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging, although sensitivity improves by referencing additional serological parameters.

We investigated the association between comorbidity burden and higher risk disease among men eligible for active surveillance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base we identified 29,447 cases of low risk (Gleason score 6 or less, cT1/T2a, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) prostate cancer managed with prostatectomy from 2010 to 2011. The primary outcome was pathological upgrading (Gleason score greater than 6) or up staging (T3-T4/N1). The association between Charlson score and upgrading/up staging was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 29,447 men, of which 449 (1.5%) had Charlson scores greater than 1. At prostatectomy 44% of cases were upgraded/up staged. On multivariate analysis Charlson score greater than 1, age 70 years or greater, nonwhite race, higher prostate specific antigen and higher percentage of cores involved with disease were significantly associated with upgrading/up staging. After further adjusting for age, race, prostate specific antigen and core involvement, Charlson score remained a significant predictor of upgrading/up staging for younger white men. Specifically, white men less than 70 years old with Charlson comorbidity index greater than 1 had 1.3-fold higher odds of upgrading/up staging than men with Charlson comorbidity index 1 or less (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67, p=0.029).

Despite its prevalence, considerable debate exists regarding the genetic features, clinical significance, natural history, metastatic potential and optimal management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Young Urologic Oncologists in the Society of Urologic Oncology cooperated in a comprehensive search of the peer reviewed English medical literature on Gleason 6 prostate cancer, specifically focusing on the history of the Gleason scoring system, histological features, clinical characteristics, practice patterns and outcomes. RESULTS: The Gleason scoring system was devised in the early 1960s, widely adopted by 1987 and revised in 2005 with a more restrictive definition of Gleason 6 disease. There is near consensus that Gleason 6 meets pathological definitions of cancer, but controversy about whether it meets commonly accepted molecular and genetic criteria of cancer. Multiple clinical series suggest that the metastatic potential of contemporary Gleason 6 disease is negligible but not zero. Population based studies in the U.S. suggest that more than 90% of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo treatment and are exposed to the risk of morbidity for a cancer unlikely to cause symptoms or decrease life expectancy. Efforts have been proposed to minimize the number of men diagnosed with or treated for Gleason 6 prostate cancer. These include modifications to prostate specific antigen based screening strategies such as targeting high risk populations, decreasing the frequency of screening, recommending screening cessation, incorporating remaining life expectancy estimates, using shared decision making and novel biomarkers, and eliminating prostate specific antigen screening entirely. Large nonrandomized and randomized studies have shown that active surveillance is an effective management strategy for men with Gleason 6 disease. Active surveillance dramatically reduces the number of men undergoing treatment without apparent compromise of cancer related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The definition and clinical relevance of Gleason 6 prostate cancer have changed substantially since its introduction nearly 50 years ago. A high proportion of screen detected cancers are Gleason 6 and the metastatic potential is negligible. Dramatically reducing the diagnosis and treatment of Gleason 6 disease is likely to have a favorable impact on the net benefit of prostate cancer screening.",2015,10.1016/j.juro.2015.01.126,194,3,626-634,eng,1527-3792 0022-5347,Humans and Male and Risk Assessment and Prognosis and Early Detection of Cancer and Watchful Waiting and early detection of cancer and prostatic neoplasms and neoplasm grading and watchful waiting and Neoplasm Grading/standards and prostatectomy and Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy,NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Urol,NA,NA,NA,NA

This may be a reason to discontinue active surveillance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 Dutch patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance in a prospective active surveillance study received questionnaires at study inclusion and 9 months after diagnosis. We assessed changes in scores on decisional conflict with the decisional conflict scale, depression with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, generic anxiety with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, prostate cancer specific anxiety with the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer and the self-estimated risk of progression. We explored scores 9 months after diagnosis vs those at study inclusion for physical health (SF-12 physical component summary), personality (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire), shared decision making, prostate cancer knowledge, demographics, medical parameters and prostate specific antigen doubling time during followup. RESULTS: Questionnaires at study inclusion and 9 months after diagnosis were completed by 129 of 150 (86%) and 108 of 120 participants (90%) a median of 2.4 and 9.2 months after diagnosis, respectively. Anxiety and distress at study inclusion were previously found to be generally favorable. Significant but clinically irrelevant decreases were seen in mean scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (p = 0.016), Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer fear of progression subscale (p = 0.005) and the self-estimated risk of progression (p = 0.049). Anxiety and distress 9 months after diagnosis were mainly predicted by scores at study inclusion. Higher Eysenck Personality Questionnaire neuroticism score and an important role of the physician in the treatment decision had additionally unfavorable effects. Good physical health, palpable disease and older age had favorable effects. No association was seen for prostate specific antigen doubling time.

We compared health related quality of life measures in patients before and after bladder cancer diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in 1,476 patients 65 years old or older with bladder cancer in the SEER-MHOS linkage database between 1998 and 2007 to assess differences in physical and mental component summary scores in 620 and 856 who completed a survey before and after bladder cancer diagnosis, respectively. To determine differences in physical and mental scores in the prediagnosis and post-diagnosis cohorts, we used ANOVA adjusting for baseline covariates. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in physical and mental component summary scores between the prediagnosis and post-diagnosis groups (-2.7, 95% CI -3.8, -1.7 vs -1.4, 95% CI -2.6, -0.3). In patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer the physical and mental score differences were -1.9 (p <0.01) and -1.4 (p = 0.01), respectively. In those with muscle invasive bladder cancer there was a statistically and clinically significant difference in the physical but not the mental score (-5.3, p <0.01 vs -2.7, p = 0.07). This difference in the physical domain persisted up to 10 years after the diagnosis of muscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients with bladder cancer who had 4 or more comorbid medical conditions and 1 or more deficits in daily living activity were most at risk for low physical component summary scores.

We evaluated the impacts of overactive bladder with and without urgency incontinence (overactive bladder wet and overactive bladder dry) on the fall risk in older adults, and investigated the importance of overactive bladder as a predictor of falls by using tree based models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 630 community dwelling, independent older adults 75 years old or older who attended a health checkup in 2017 with a 1-year followup. The associations of overactive bladder dry and overactive bladder wet with a fall history, and future fall risk compared to no overactive bladder were assessed using logistic regression models. The contribution of overactive bladder as a predictor of falls was examined using a random forest and decision tree approach. RESULTS: Of the 577 analyzed participants (median age 79 years), 273 (47%) were men. The prevalence of overactive bladder dry and overactive bladder wet at baseline was 15% and 14%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that both overactive bladder dry and overactive bladder wet were associated with a higher likelihood of prior falls (adjusted ORs vs no overactive bladder 2.03 and 2.21, respectively; 95% CI 1.23-3.37 and 1.29-3.78, respectively). Among the 363 participants without a fall history, the adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of overactive bladder dry and overactive bladder wet for the occurrence of falls during the 1-year followup were 2.74 (1.19-6.29) and 1.35 (0.47-3.87), respectively. The tree based approach used for all participants showed that overactive bladder was an important predictor of falls in adults without a fall history, and the model had 83.6% accuracy and 81.8% AUC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1,201 subjects from a previously described multicenter longitudinal cohort we modeled the EPIC-CP domain scores of each treatment group before treatment, and at short-term and long-term followup. We considered a posttreatment domain score change from pretreatment of 0.5 SD or greater clinically significant and p <e2><89><a4> 0.01 statistically significant. We determined the domain minimally important differences using the pooled 0.5 SD of the 2, 6, 12 and 24-month posttreatment changes from pretreatment values. We then recalibrated an EPIC-CP based nomogram model predicting 2-year post-prostatectomy functional erection from that developed using EPIC-26. RESULTS: For each health related quality of life domain EPIC-CP was sensitive to similar posttreatment health related quality of life changes with time, as was observed using EPIC-26. The EPIC-CP minimally important differences in changes in the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal domains were 1.0, 1.3, 1.2, 1.6 and 1.0, respectively.
