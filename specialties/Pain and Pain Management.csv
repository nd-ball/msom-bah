Sudore_2017_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Defining Advance Care Planning for Adults: A Consensus Definition From a Multidisciplinary Delphi Panel,"Sudore, Rebecca L. and Lum, Hillary D. and You, John J. and Hanson, Laura C. and Meier, Diane E. and Pantilat, Steven Z. and Matlock, Daniel D. and Rietjens, Judith A. C. and Korfage, Ida J. and Ritchie, Christine S. and Kutner, Jean S. and Teno, Joan M. and Thomas, Judy and McMahan, Ryan D. and Heyland, Daren K.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Despite increasing interest in advance care planning (ACP) and previous ACP descriptions, a consensus definition does not yet exist to guide clinical, research, and policy initiatives. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a consensus definition of ACP for adults. METHODS: We convened a Delphi panel of multidisciplinary, international ACP experts consisting of 52 clinicians, researchers, and policy leaders from four countries and a patient/surrogate advisory committee. We conducted 10 rounds using a modified Delphi method and qualitatively analyzed panelists' input. Panelists identified several themes lacking consensus and iteratively discussed and developed a final consensus definition. RESULTS: Panelists identified several tensions concerning ACP concepts such as whether the definition should focus on conversations vs. written advance directives; patients' values vs. treatment preferences; current shared decision making vs. future medical decisions; and who should be included in the process. The panel achieved a final consensus one-sentence definition and accompanying goals statement: ""Advance care planning is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care. The goal of advance care planning is to help ensure that people receive medical care that is consistent with their values, goals and preferences during serious and chronic illness."" The panel also described strategies to best support adults in ACP.

Hanson_2019_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Triggered Palliative Care for Late-Stage Dementia: A Pilot Randomized Trial,"Hanson, Laura C. and Kistler, Christine E. and Lavin, Kyle and Gabriel, Stacey L. and Ernecoff, Natalie C. and Lin, Feng-Chang and Sachs, Greg A. and Mitchell, Susan L.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Persons with late-stage dementia have limited access to palliative care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test dementia-specific specialty palliative care triggered by hospitalization. METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 62 dyads of persons with late-stage dementia and family decision-makers on admission to hospital. Intervention dyads received dementia-specific specialty palliative care consultation plus postacute transitional care. Control dyads received usual care and educational information. The primary outcome was 60-day hospital or emergency department visits. Secondary patient- and family-centered outcomes were patient comfort, family distress, palliative care domains addressed in the treatment plan, and access to hospice or community-based palliative care. Secondary decision-making outcomes were discussion of prognosis, goals of care, completion of Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), and treatment decisions. RESULTS: Of 137 eligible dyads, 62 (45%) were enrolled. The intervention proved feasible, with protocol completion ranging from 77% (family two-week call) to 93% (initial consultation). Hospital and emergency department visits did not differ (intervention vs. control, 0.68 vs. 0.53 transfers per 60 days, P = 0.415). Intervention patients had more palliative care domains addressed and were more likely to receive hospice (25% vs. 3%, P < 0.019). Intervention families were more likely to discuss prognosis (90% vs. 3%, P < 0.001) and goals of care (90% vs. 25%, P < 0.001) and to have a MOST at 60-day follow-up (79% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). More intervention families made decisions to avoid rehospitalization (13% vs. 0%, P = 0.033).

Understanding which characteristics predict clinically important outcomes can help prioritize attention to scalable measure development. OBJECTIVES: To understand whether audibly recognizable expressions of distressing emotion during palliative care serious illness conversations are associated with ratings of patient experience or six-month enrollment in hospice. METHODS: We audiorecorded initial palliative care consultations involving 231 hospitalized people with advanced cancer at two large academic medical centers. We coded conversations for expressions of fear, anger, and sadness. We examined the distribution of these expressions and their association with pre/post ratings of feeling heard and understood and six-month hospice enrollment after the consultation. RESULTS: Nearly six in 10 conversations included at least one audible expression of distressing emotion (59%; 137 of 231). Among conversations with such an expression, fear was the most prevalent (72%; 98 of 137) followed by sadness (50%; 69 of 137) and anger (45%; 62 of 137). Anger expression was associated with more disease-focused end-of-life treatment preferences, pre/post consultation improvement in feeling heard and understood and lower six-month hospice enrollment. Fear was strongly associated with preconsultation patient ratings of shorter survival expectations. Sadness did not exhibit strong association with patient descriptors or outcomes. CONCLUSION: Fear, anger, and sadness are commonly expressed in hospital-based palliative care consultations with people who have advanced cancer. Anger is an epidemiologically useful predictor of important clinical outcomes.",2021,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.017,61,2,246-253.e1,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Emotions and Communication and Humans and decision making and emotion and Fear and Anger and *Palliative Care and palliative care and *Sadness and fear and sadness and serious illness conversations,NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Taghavi_2021_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Workforce Planning for Community-Based Palliative Care Specialist Teams Using Operations Research,"Taghavi, Majid and Johnston, Grace and Urquhart, Robin and Henderson, David and Tschupruk, Cheryl and Tupala, Beth",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Many countries have aging populations. Thus, the need for palliative care will increase. However, the methods to estimate optimal staffing for specialist palliative care teams are rudimentary as yet. OBJECTIVES: To develop a population-need workforce planning model for community-based palliative care specialist teams and to apply the model to forecast the staff needed to care for all patients with terminal illness, organ failure, and frailty during the next 20 years, with and without the expansion of primary palliative care. METHODS: We used operations research (linear programming) to model the problem. We used the framework of the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians and the Nova Scotia palliative care strategy to apply the model. RESULTS: To meet the palliative care needs for persons dying across Nova Scotia in 2019, the model generated an estimate of 70.8 nurses, 23.6 physicians, and 11.9 social workers, a total of 106.3 staff. Thereby, the model indicated that a 64% increase in specialist palliative care staff was needed immediately, and a further 13.1% increase would be needed during the next 20 years. Trained primary palliative care providers currently meet 3.7% of need, and with their expansion are expected to meet 20.3% by 2038. CONCLUSION: Historical, current, and projected data can be used with operations research to forecast staffing levels for specialist palliative care teams under various scenarios.

Waldrop_2020_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Managing Death in the Field: Prehospital End-of-Life Care,"Waldrop, Deborah P. and Waldrop, Michael R. and McGinley, Jacqueline M. and Crowley, Charlotte R. and Clemency, Brian",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Historically, the focus of prehospital care has been life-saving treatment. In the absence of a nonhospital do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, prehospital providers have been compelled to begin and continue resuscitation unless or until it was certain that the situation was futile; they have faced conflict when caregivers objected. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to explore prehospital providers' perspectives on how legally binding documents (nonhospital DNR order/medical orders for life-sustaining treatment) informed end-of-life decision making and care. METHODS: This exploratory study used mixed methods in a sequential nondominant two-stage convergent quantitative and qualitative design. Phase I involved the collection of survey data. Phase II involved in-person semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 239 participants, and 50 follow-up interviews were conducted. Survey data suggested that 73.7% felt confident when there was a DNR order and they did not initiate resuscitation, and 58.2% felt confident working through family disagreement when cardiopulmonary resuscitation was requested but there was a DNR; 66.1% felt confident explaining the dying process when death was imminent, and 55.7% felt comfortable telling a family that a patient was dying. Four themes emerged: changing standards of care; eliminating false hope; transitioning care from patient to family; and transferring care after death. CONCLUSION: Prehospital providers provide support and care when they tell families that someone has died. Being able to comfort and be present with acute grief on scene is an important and evolving role for prehospital providers who manage death in the field.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.004,60,4,709-716.e2,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Decision Making and decision making and *Emergency Medical Services and *Terminal Care and Resuscitation Orders and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Prehospital end-of-life care and termination of resuscitation,NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bruinsma_2012_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,The experiences of relatives with the practice of palliative sedation: a systematic review,"Bruinsma, Sophie M. and Rietjens, Judith A. C. and Seymour, Jane E. and Anquinet, Livia and van der Heide, Agnes",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Guidelines about palliative sedation typically include recommendations to protect the well-being of relatives. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the experiences of relatives with the practice of palliative sedation. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for empirical studies on relatives' experiences with palliative sedation. We investigated relatives' involvement in the decision-making and sedation processes, whether they received adequate information and support, and relatives' emotions. RESULTS: Of the 564 studies identified, 39 were included. The studies (30 quantitative, six qualitative, and three mixed methods) were conducted in 16 countries; three studies were based on relatives' reports, 26 on physicians' and nurses' proxy reports, seven on medical records, and three combined different sources. The 39 studies yielded a combined total of 8791 respondents or studied cases. Caregivers involved relatives in the decision making in 69%-100% of all cases (19 quantitative studies), and in 60%-100% of all cases, relatives were reported to have received adequate information (five quantitative studies). Only two quantitative studies reported on relatives' involvement in the provision of sedation. Despite the fact that the majority of relatives were reported to be comfortable with the use of palliative sedation (seven quantitative studies, four qualitative studies), several studies found that relatives were distressed by the use of sedation (five quantitative studies, five qualitative studies). No studies reported specifically about the support provided to the relatives. CONCLUSION: Relatives' experiences with palliative sedation are mainly studied from the perspective of proxies, mostly professional caregivers.

Bickel_2020_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,An Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness,"Bickel, Kathleen E. and Levy, Cari and MacPhee, Edward R. and Brenner, Keri and Temel, Jennifer S. and Arch, Joanna J. and Greer, Joseph A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that palliative care improves the quality of life of individuals with serious medical illness. Research also suggests that in patients with advanced cancer, palliative care's focus on symptom management, coping with illness, goals of care, and treatment decisions may be associated with improved patient quality of life in part by increasing patients' use of active (vs. passive) and approach-oriented (vs. avoidant) coping strategies. However, without a framework outlining the process that individuals with serious medical illness and their loved ones undergo, it is challenging to discern exactly where, how, and why palliative care may affect the serious medical illness experience. To address this gap, we propose a clinically applicable framework, derived from existing theory and research in the social and behavioral sciences. This framework, called the Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness, describes how patients and their loved ones cognitively and emotionally process the various events that may occur as they navigate serious medical illness and the end of life. The framework also describes how individuals and their loved ones use that event processing to determine next steps, while considering the impact of their surrounding external environment, their individual social roles, and their connections on this decision making.

Cleeland_2010_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Assessing the Symptoms of Cancer Using Patient-Reported Outcomes (ASCPRO): searching for standards,"Cleeland, Charles S. and Sloan, Jeff A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2006 draft guidance on ""Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims"" has engendered wide discussion about patient-reported outcome (PRO) domains that should be endpoints in clinical trials. Reducing the severity and impact of symptoms is a natural intervention endpoint for cancer, a condition associated with considerable symptom burden. Because symptoms are best described by patients who have them, including PROs as measures of treatment effectiveness or the differences among treatments provides essential information about the efficacy and toxicity of a treatment and its effects on function. The FDA guidance provides a framework for addressing such issues as clinical significance, study design, and statistical methods as they relate to applications for labeling claims; however, no set of recommended approaches for assessing specific symptoms by patient report in clinical trials exists, other than for pain. Accordingly, an interdisciplinary workgroup, Assessing the Symptoms of Cancer using Patient-Reported Outcomes (ASCPRO), has been formed to generate evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of patient-reported cancer-related symptoms and the use of that information to facilitate clinical research and decision making. ASCPRO is among the first working groups to focus primarily on nonpain symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, depression, cognitive impairment, and shortness of breath. ASCPRO members are stakeholders in optimal symptom assessment, including patient advocates, academics, clinicians, those who pay for symptom control and monitor quality of care, and those who produce products that palliate cancer-related symptoms but that may also engender treatment-related symptoms.",2010,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.05.025,39,6,1077-1085,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,United States and Humans and Treatment Outcome and Terminology as Topic and Quality of Life and Cost of Illness and Guidelines as Topic and United States Food and Drug Administration and Endpoint Determination and *Patients and Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards and Neoplasms/*diagnosis/psychology,NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jimenez_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Overview of Systematic Reviews of Advance Care Planning: Summary of Evidence and Global Lessons,"Jimenez, Geronimo and Tan, Woan Shin and Virk, Amrit K. and Low, Chan Kee and Car, Josip and Ho, Andy Hau Yan",Journal of pain and symptom management,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) involves important decision making about future medical needs. The high-volume and disparate nature of ACP research makes it difficult to grasp the evidence and derive clear policy lessons for policymakers and clinicians. AIM: The aim of this study was to synthesize ACP research evidence and identify relevant contextual elements, program features, implementation principles, and impacted outcomes to inform policy and practice. DESIGN: An overview of systematic reviews using the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions was performed. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Reviews) tool. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, Global Health, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for ACP-related research from inception of each database to April 2017. Searches were supplemented with gray literature and manual searches. Eighty systematic reviews, covering over 1660 original articles, were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Legislations, institutional policies, and cultural factors influence ACP development. Positive perceptions toward ACP do not necessarily translate into more end-of-life conversations. Many factors related to patients' and providers' attitudes, and perceptions toward life and mortality influence ACP implementation, decision making, and completion. Limited, low-quality evidence points to several ACP benefits, such as improved end-of-life communication, documentation of care preferences, dying in preferred place, and health care savings. Recurring features that make ACP programs effective include repeated and interactive discussion sessions, decision aids, and interventions targeting multiple stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence highlights several elements that influence the ACP process and provides a variety of features that could support successful, effective, and sustainable ACP implementation. However, this evidence is compartmentalized and limited. Further studies evaluating ACP as a unified program and assessing the impact of ACP for different populations, settings, and contexts are needed to develop programs that are able to unleash ACP's full potential.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.05.016,56,3,436-459.e25,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Internationality and *Advance Care Planning and Systematic Reviews as Topic and palliative care and Advance care planning and end-of-life care and overview and Palliative Care/methods and systematic reviews and Terminal Care/methods,NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Brown_2019_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Pediatric Perioperative DNR Orders: A Case Series in a Children's Hospital,"Brown, Sydney E. S. and Antiel, Ryan M. and Blinman, Thane A. and Shaw, Susanna and Neuman, Mark D. and Feudtner, Chris",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are common among children receiving palliative care, who may nevertheless benefit from surgery and other procedures. Although anesthesia, surgery, and pediatric guidelines recommend systematic reconsideration of DNR orders in the perioperative period, data regarding how clinicians evaluate and manage DNR orders in the perioperative period are limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate perioperative management of DNR orders at a tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records for all children with DNR orders in place within 30 days of surgery at a tertiary care pediatric hospital from February 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017. Using standardized case report forms, we abstracted the following from physician notes: 1) patient/family wishes with respect to the DNR, 2) whether preoperative DNR orders were continued, modified, or suspended during the perioperative period, and 3) whether life-threatening events occurred in the perioperative period. Based on data from these reports, we created a process flow diagram regarding DNR order decision-making in the perioperative period. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients aged six days to 17 years had a DNR order in place within 30 days of 29 procedures. No documented systematic reconsideration took place for 41% of procedures. DNR orders were modified for two (7%) procedures and suspended for 15 (51%). Three children (13%) suffered life-threatening events. We identified four time points in the perioperative period where systematic reconsideration should be documented in the medical record, and identified recommended personnel involved and important discussion points at each time point.

However, little research has explored the patient perspective of decision making and advanced care planning during an emergency surgery episode. OBJECTIVES: We sought to better understand older patients' lived experience making decisions to undergo emergency general surgery (EGS) and perceptions of perioperative advance care planning (ACP). METHODS: Adults aged 65 and older who underwent one of seven common EGS procedures with lengths of stay more than five days at three Boston-area hospitals were included. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted three months postdischarge. Transcripts were reviewed and coded independently by surgeons and palliative care physicians to identify themes. RESULTS: About 31 patients were interviewed. Patients viewed the decision for surgery as a choice of life over death and valued prolonging life. They felt there was no choice but to proceed with surgery but reported that participation in decision making was limited because of severe symptoms, time constraints, and confused thinking. Despite recently surviving a life-threatening illness, patients had not reconsidered their wishes for the future and preferred to avoid future ACP. CONCLUSION: Older patients who survived a life-threatening illness and EGS report receiving goal-concordant care in the moment that relieved symptoms and prolonged life but had not considered future care.

Median age at the time of hospitalization was three months, and the median duration of hospitalization was 23 days; 8% of patients had two to five hospitalizations in which they received vasopressors. There were 176 total patients who died while receiving vasopressors; most (93%) died during their first hospitalization. The most common diagnosis was sepsis (34%), followed by congenital heart disease (17%). Dopamine was the most commonly prescribed first-line vasopressor (70%), and hydrocortisone was the most commonly prescribed second-line vasopressor (49%) for all pediatric patients. The incidence of mortality rose sequentially with escalating vasopressor support, increasing from under 10% with the first vasopressor to 48% at the maximum number of agents. The odds of death almost doubled with the addition of each new vasopressor. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of vasopressor therapy for pediatric patients, regardless of diagnosis, is associated with in-hospital mortality; vasopressor escalation should trigger intensive palliative care supports.",2021,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.09.016,61,4,763-769,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Child and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Hospital Mortality and decision making and pediatrics and Counseling and *Intensive Care Units and *Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use and hospital mortality and hydrocortisone and Vasopressors,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dzotsenidze_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Impact of Ambiguous and Restrictive Regulations on Opioid-Prescribing Practice in Georgia,"Dzotsenidze, Pati and Lekashvili, Tamar and Chikhladze, Nino and Jorbenadze, Maka and Abesadze, Ioseb and Kordzaia, Dimitri",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Chronic pain management with opioids in incurable patients remains a challenge of modern medicine regardless of the evidence-based effectiveness of opioids and recommendations of authorities such as the World Health Organization and International Narcotics Control Board. Many countries, including Georgia, maintain overly restrictive regulations that contribute to inadequate pain management. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to pain management in Georgia caused by legislation, administrative issues, and physicians' lack of knowledge and understanding of legislative aspects governing opioid use, and their impact on opioid-prescribing practice. METHODS: We conducted a survey among 550 primary health care physicians. In total, 302 physicians completed the questionnaire. Overall, 289 questionnaires were analyzed statistically with SPSS version 20 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). RESULTS: We found that 38% of the physicians avoid prescribing opioids and only one-third of the physicians make an independent decision to treat the patients with opioids. About one-third of the physicians know the updated liberalized legislation and even fewer follow it. Those who apply more liberal legislation and have better medical practice are investigated three to five times more by legal authorities for prescribing morphine to incurable patients than those who do not. CONCLUSION: Ambiguous legislation negatively influences opioid-prescribing practice. Most of the physicians believe that the legislation is restrictive. Physicians who have better medical and legal knowledge and understanding are controlled and investigated more because of their opioid-prescribing practice. Physicians who are concerned that they might be investigated are less inclined to prescribe opioids or use liberalized regulations.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.03.018,56,1,63-71,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Primary Health Care and Aged and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Legislation and Aged, 80 and over and Physicians, Primary Care and Georgia and Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use and Clinical Decision-Making and physicians and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*legislation & jurisprudence and Drug and Narcotic Control/*legislation & jurisprudence and Georgia (Republic) and investigation and opioid prescribing and Pain/drug therapy and restriction",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data are lacking on the long-term prognosis after surviving mechanical ventilation to inform shared decision making in serious illness conversations. OBJECTIVES: Describe the long-term prognosis of older adults who survive emergency mechanical ventilation to inform shared decision making. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from a single-center intensive care unit in an academic, urban, and tertiary care medical center. We included adults aged 75 years and older consecutively admitted with mechanical ventilation between 2008 and 2012 in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring of Intensive Care III database. We excluded patients who were electively admitted. Our primary outcome was the long-term prognosis after leaving the hospital stratified by discharge location. Our secondary outcome was the frequency of documented serious illness conversations within 48 hours of hospitalization recommended by the National Quality Forum. RESULTS: We identified 415 patients (454 hospital admissions) consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit. The median age was 82.6 years, 54.0% were female, 78.2% were white, non-Hispanic, and in-hospital mortality rate was 36.6%. Among the survivors, the median survival after hospital discharge was 163.5 days (interquartile range 37.5-476.8). Only 49.1% of patients had documented serious illness conversations within 48 hours of hospitalization. About 63.4% of patients (59 of 93) who were discharged to long-term acute care hospitals died by six months.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between dimensions of religion and spirituality and medical treatment decisions made by surrogates. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled patient/surrogate dyads from three hospitals in one metropolitan area. Eligible patients were 65 years or older and admitted to the medicine or medical intensive care services. Baseline surveys between hospital days 2 and 10 assessed seven dimensions of religion and spirituality. Chart reviews of the electronic medical record and regional health information exchange six months after enrollment identified the use of life-sustaining treatments and hospice for patients who died. RESULTS: There were 291 patient/surrogate dyads. When adjusting for other religious dimensions, demographic, and illness factors, only surrogates' belief in miracles was significantly associated with a lower surrogate preference for do-not-resuscitate status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.39; 95% CI 0.19, 0.78). Among patients who died, higher surrogate intrinsic religiosity was associated with lower patient receipt of life-sustaining treatments within the last 30 days (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45, 0.97). Belief in miracles (aOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10, 0.96) and higher intrinsic religiosity (aOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.53, 0.93) were associated with lower hospice utilization. CONCLUSION: Few religious variables are associated with end-of-life preferences or treatment. Belief in miracles and intrinsic religiosity may affect treatment and should be identified and explored with surrogates by trained chaplains or other clinicians with appropriate training.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.09.006,59,2,261-269,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Death and decision making and religion and Religion and *Decision Making and *Hospice Care and end of life and proxy and Spirituality and surrogate,NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) has been used to improve clinical skills among resident physicians and may provide a novel way to improve hospitalists' CSD skills. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to develop and evaluate a CSD SBML intervention for hospitalists. METHODS: Twenty hospitalists were randomized to control vs. a CSD SBML intervention. Hospitalists conducted a baseline standardized patient encounter (pretest) that was scored using a 19-item CSD checklist and controls completed a repeat standardized patient encounter six months later (post-test). Intervention group hospitalists received at least one two-hour training session featuring deliberate practice and feedback and were expected to meet a minimum passing score (MPS) on the post-test of 84% set by an expert panel. RESULTS: Only two of the 20 hospitalists met the MPS at pretest. Seventy percentage of intervention hospitalists achieved the MPS after a single training session. Post-test median checklist scores were higher for intervention hospitalists compared with controls (16.5 vs. 12.0, P = 0.0001). Intervention hospitalists were significantly more likely to ask about previous experiences with end-of-life decision making (70% vs. 20%, P = 0.03), explore values/goals (100% vs. 50%, P = 0.01), ask permission to make a recommendation regarding code status (60% vs. 0%, P = 0.003), and align recommendations with patient values/goals (90% vs. 40%, P = 0.02) than controls.

Ideally, this occurs when patients are clinically stable, and with opportunities for iteration as the clinical situation unfolds. OBJECTIVES: Testing feasibility and acceptability in busy outpatient oncology clinics of a novel program of systematic, oncology nurse-led values discussions with all new cancer patients. METHODS: Within an institutional initiative integrating primary and specialist palliative care from diagnosis for all cancer patients, oncology nurses were trained to use specific questions and an empathic communication framework to discuss health-related values during outpatient clinic visits. Nurses summarized discussions on a template for patient verification, oncologist review, and electronic medical record documentation. Summaries were reviewed with the patient at least quarterly. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated in three clinics for patients with hematologic or gastrointestinal malignancies. RESULTS: Oncology nurses conducted 177 total discussions with 67 newly diagnosed cancer patients (17 with hematologic and 50 with gastrointestinal malignancies) over two years. No patient declined participation. Discussions averaged eight minutes, and all patients verified values summaries. Clinic patient volume was maintained. Of 31 patients surveyed, 30 (97%) reported feeling comfortable with the process, considered it helpful, and would recommend it to others. Clinicians strongly endorsed the values discussion process. CONCLUSION: Nurse-led discussions of patient values soon after diagnosis are feasible and acceptable in busy oncology clinics.

OBJECTIVES: To describe and identify factors associated with level of care preferences among proxies of nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: NH residents with advanced dementia and their proxies (N = 402 dyads) were recruited from 62 Boston-area facilities as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial. At baseline, all proxies were asked to select which level of care they felt the resident should receive: intensive, basic, or comfort care. Multivariable logistic regression identified resident and proxy factors associated with a preference for comfort care (vs. basic or intensive medical care). RESULTS: Proxy level of care preferences were: comfort, 62.2%; basic, 31.1%; and intensive medical care, 6.5%. In multivariable analyses, proxy perception that the resident had less than six months to live was most strongly associated with a preference for comfort-focused care (adjusted odds ratio 12.25, 95% CI 4.04-37.08). Additional factors significantly associated with a preference for comfort care included older resident age, worse resident cognitive impairment, and the proxy having been asked about goals of care preferences by a NH health care provider (adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.07, 2.74). CONCLUSION: Most proxies select comfort as the preferred level of care for NH residents with advanced dementia.

There have been very few comparative trials in this area, and consequently there is very little clinical evidence upon which therapy can be rationally based. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the discussion and decision-making process that was undertaken by the Clinical Protocol Subcommittee during the development of a proposed clinical trial of best medical care versus surgical or endoscopic treatment for MBO. The development of the proposed clinical trials followed an orderly process. The first step taken was a discussion of a specific definition for MBO. Once agreed upon, this definition helped identify inclusion and exclusion criteria for the proposed trial. This was followed by an extensive literature review, which helped define both surgical and endoscopic approaches to MBO as well as what constituted best medical care. An extensive discussion was then undertaken concerning the best outcome measure of success for medical, surgical, and endoscopic interventions. All of the above steps culminated in two proposed protocols, one for MBO of the small intestine distal to the ligament of Treitz and a second for colonic obstructions. The small intestinal trial is designed to compare surgical intervention versus best medical care, whereas the colonic trial seeks to compare surgery with endoscopically-placed intraluminal stents coupled with best medical care.",2007,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.04.011,34,1 Suppl,59-S49,eng,0885-3924,Humans and Algorithms and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods and Palliative Care/*methods and Intestinal Neoplasms/complications/*therapy and Intestinal Obstruction/etiology/*therapy,NA,NA,2007/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a paucity of literature on these issues in Pakistani dialysis patients, who differ from Western patients in culture, religion, and available health care services. OBJECTIVES: To study informed dialysis decision-making and EoL attitudes and beliefs in Pakistani patients receiving dialysis. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to collect 522 surveys (90% response rate) from patients in seven different dialysis units in Pakistan. We used an existing dialysis survey tool, translated into Urdu, and backtranslated to English. A facilitator distributed the survey, explained questions, and orally administered it to patients unable to read. RESULTS: Less than one-fourth of the respondents (23%) felt informed about their medical condition, and 45% were hopeful that their condition would improve in the future. More than half (54%) wished to know their prognosis, and 80% reported having no prognostic discussion. Almost 63% deemed EoL planning important, but only 5% recalled discussing EoL decisions with a doctor during the last 12 months. Nearly 62% of the patients regretted their decision to start dialysis. Patients' self-reported knowledge of hospice (5%) and palliative care (7.9%) services was very limited, yet 46% preferred a treatment plan focused on comfort and symptom management rather than life extension. CONCLUSION: Pakistani patients reported a need for better informed dialysis decision making and EoL care and better access to palliative care services. These findings underscore the need for palliative care training of Pakistani physicians and in other developing countries to help address communication and EoL needs of their dialysis patients.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.009,60,2,336-345,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Decision Making and Canada and shared decision making and *Terminal Care and *Renal Dialysis and end-of-life care and dialysis decision making and ESKD and Pakistan and Palliative care in Pakistan,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

We created the Web-based application, PalliCOVID (https://pallicovid.app/), in April 2020 to provide all clinicians with convenient access to palliative care resources and support. PalliCOVID features evidence-based clinical guidelines, educational content, and institutional protocols related to palliative care for COVID-19 patients. It is a publicly available resource accessible from any mobile device or desktop computer that provides clinicians with access to palliative care guidance across a variety of care settings, including the emergency department, hospital ward, intensive care unit, and primary care practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate usage patterns of PalliCOVID to understand user behavior in relation to this palliative care content platform during the period of the local peak of COVID-19 infection in Massachusetts. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed deidentified usage data collected by Google Analytics from the first day of PalliCOVID's launch on April 7, 2020, until May 1, 2020, the time period that encompassed the local peak of the COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. User access data were collected and summarized by using Google Analytics software that had been integrated into the PalliCOVID Web application. RESULTS: A total of 2042 users accessed PalliCOVID and viewed 4637 pages from April 7 to May 1, 2020. Users spent an average of 2 minutes and 6 seconds per session. Eighty-one percent of users were first-time visitors, while the remaining 19% were return visitors. Most users accessed PalliCOVID from the United States (87%), with a large proportion of users coming from Boston and the surrounding cities (32% of overall users). CONCLUSIONS: PalliCOVID is one example of a scalable digital health solution that can bring palliative care resources to frontline clinicians. Analysis of PalliCOVID usage patterns has the potential to inform the improvement of the platform to better meet the needs of its user base and guide future dissemination strategies. The quantitative data presented here, although informative about user behavior, should be supplemented with future qualitative research to further define the impact of this tool and extend our ability to deliver clinical care that is compassionate, rational, and well-aligned with patients' values and goals.",2020,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.07.016,60,4,e20-e27,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and Humans and mobile health and Pandemics and *Internet and coronavirus and *Telemedicine and *Information Dissemination and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology and *Betacoronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic and *Palliative Care and digital health and palliative care and Google Analytics and progressive web application",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Riva_2011_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,The influence of anchoring on pain judgment,"Riva, Paolo and Rusconi, Patrice and Montali, Lorenzo and Cherubini, Paolo",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Research on decision making suggests that a wide range of spontaneous processes may influence medical judgment. OBJECTIVES: We considered an easily accessible strategy, anchoring and insufficient adjustment, which might contribute to health care professionals' miscalibration of patients' pain. METHODS: A sample (n=423) of physicians, nurses, medical students, and nursing students participated in a computerized task that showed 16 vignettes featuring fictitious patients reporting headache. In the experimental condition, participants were asked to evaluate the severity of the patient's pain before and after knowing the patient's rating. In the control condition, participants were shown all information about the patient at the same time and were required to make judgments in a single stage. RESULTS: When participants could express an initial impression before knowing the patient's rating, they fully anchored to their initial impressions in almost half of the responses. Moreover, even among those who revised their initial impression, the extent of the revision was often insufficient. Greater anchoring was associated with patients' ratings that were higher than the participants' initial impression. Finally, we provided evidence that anchoring increased pain miscalibration. We discuss our findings in terms of their contribution to the understanding of the cognitive processes involved in pain assessment. CONCLUSION: When estimating patients' pain intensity, observers are driven by anchoring, a rule of thumb that might have pernicious consequences in terms of unwarranted overreliance on initial impressions and insufficient revision in light of relevant disconfirming evidence.

Smith_2016_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Hearing Loss in Hospice and Palliative Care: A National Survey of Providers,"Smith, Alexander K. and Ritchie, Christine S. and Wallhagen, Margaret L.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Age-related hearing loss can impair patient-provider communication about symptom management, goals of care, and end-of-life decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether hospice and palliative care providers screen for or received training about hearing loss, believe it impacts patient care, and use strategies to optimize communication. METHODS: This was a national survey of hospice and palliative care providers conducted via email and social media. Survey questions were pilot tested with multidisciplinary providers in San Francisco. RESULTS: Of 510 responses (55% age 50+ years, 65% female, 64% in practice 5+ years, 57% practiced hospital-based palliative care, 45% hospice), 315 were physicians, 50 nurses, 48 nurse practitioners, 58 social workers, and 39 chaplains. Ninety-one percent reported that hearing loss has some or great impact on the quality of care for older adults. Eighty-eight percent recalled a situation where hearing loss created a communication problem with a patient and 56% a communication problem with a caregiver. Eighty-seven percent of physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners reported not screening for hearing loss. Although 61% felt comfortable with their communication skills for patients with hearing loss, only 21% reported having received formal training in its management, 31% were unfamiliar with resources for patients with hearing loss, and 38% had never heard of a pocket talker amplification device.

Religious and cultural beliefs predominantly influence patients' lives, especially during the dying process. Therefore, palliative care clinicians should have at least a basic understanding of major world religions. Islam is a major world religion with 1.7 billion followers. At our institution, a needs assessment showed a lack of knowledge with Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES: To improve knowledge of clinically relevant Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. METHODS: After consultation with a Muslim chaplain, we identified key topics and created a 10-question pretest. The pretest was administered, followed by a one-hour educational intervention with a Muslim chaplain. Next, a post-test (identical to the pretest) was administered. RESULTS: Eleven palliative care clinicians participated in this study. The average score on the pretest was 6.0 <c2><b1> 1.2 (mean + SD) (maximum 10). After the educational intervention, the average score improved to 9.6 <c2><b1> 0.7 (95% CI 2.7-4.4; P < 0.001). Qualitative feedback was positive as participants reported a better understanding of how Islam influences patients' end-of-life decisions. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, a one-hour educational intervention improved knowledge of Islamic teachings regarding end-of-life care. We present a framework for this intervention, which can be easily replicated. We also provide key teaching points on Islam and end-of-life care. Additional research is necessary to determine the clinical effects of this intervention over time and in practice.

Nelson_2015_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Parents' Experiences of Pediatric Palliative Transports: A Qualitative Case Series,"Nelson, Harriett and Mott, Sandra and Kleinman, Monica E. and Goldstein, Richard D.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Pediatric palliative transports, the practice of transporting critically ill children home for end-of-life care including extubation, are an option for children requiring high levels of medical support at end of life. Little is known about the experience from the perspective of the children and families. OBJECTIVES: To understand parents' perspectives on the experience of pediatric palliative transports. METHODS: Open-ended interviews were conducted using a qualitative descriptive design. Each parent was asked to reflect on the process of bringing their child home to die. Conventional content analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Nine parents participated. The decision to transport the child home was a process motivated by promises to the child or a conviction that it was the right thing to do. The parents were gratified by the attention to safety and detail involved, but the actual transport home was stressful to them. The arrival home was typically recounted as a celebration. Being home provided time with the child in the context of their family and contributed to their lives. Memories of the experience brought comfort and a sense of fulfillment.

Identifying, clarifying, and prioritizing patients' goals are conceptually fundamental to the process of patient-centeredness and are the main reasons for PC referral. However, very little is empirically known about the content or process of goal expression in the natural setting of PC. OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency, types, and determinants of goal expression in PC consultations. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional direct observational study of 72 audiorecorded PC consultations with hospitalized patients (and families) referred for PC goals of care clarification or end-of-life decision making. We coded digital audio files using reliable methods and linked conversation codes to clinical record and brief clinician interview data. RESULTS: Goal expressions occurred frequently in PC consultations and addressed both length-of-life and quality-of-life domains.

Although symptoms are critically important to quality of life and often herald clinical status changes, computational methods to assess the trajectory of symptoms over time are woefully underdeveloped. OBJECTIVES: To create machine learning algorithms capable of extracting patient-reported symptoms from free-text electronic health record notes. METHODS: The data set included 103,564 sentences obtained from the electronic clinical notes of 2695 breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy at two academic cancer centers between May 1996 and May 2015. We manually annotated 10,000 sentences and trained a conditional random field model to predict words indicating an active symptom (positive label), absence of a symptom (negative label), or no symptom at all (neutral label). Sentences labeled by human coder were divided into training, validation, and test data sets. Final model performance was determined on 20% test data unused in model development or tuning. RESULTS: The final model achieved precision of 0.82, 0.86, and 0.99 and recall of 0.56, 0.69, and 1.00 for positive, negative, and neutral symptom labels, respectively. The most common positive symptoms were pain, fatigue, and nausea. Machine-based labeling of 103,564 sentences took two minutes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a nationally representative survey of clergy beliefs and practices. METHODS: A mailed survey to a nationally representative sample of clergy completed in March 2015 with 1005 of 1665 responding (60% response rate). The primary predictor variable was clergy religious values about end-of-life medical decisions, which measured belief in miracles, the sanctity of life, trust in divine control, and redemptive suffering. Outcome variables included clergy-congregant end-of-life medical conversations and congregant receipt of hospice and intensive care unit (ICU) care in the final week of life. RESULTS: Most U.S. clergy are Christian (98%) and affirm religious values despite a congregant's terminal diagnosis. Endorsement included God performing a miracle (86%), pursuing treatment because of the sanctity of life (54%), postponement of medical decisions because God is in control (28%), and enduring painful treatment because of redemptive suffering (27%). Life-prolonging religious values in end-of-life medical decisions were associated with fewer clergy-congregant conversations about considering hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.58; 95% CI 0.42-0.80), P < 0.0001), stopping treatment (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.84, P = 0.003), and forgoing future treatment (AOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.71, P < 0.001) but not associated with congregant receipt of hospice or ICU care. Clergy with lower medical knowledge were less likely to have certain end-of-life conversations. The absence of a clergy-congregant hospice discussion was associated with less hospice (AOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29-0.66, P < 0.001) and more ICU care (AOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14-2.50, P < 0.01) in the final week of life.

Less is known about the role of worry in decision making regarding future care. OBJECTIVES: To explore relationships between patients' worry about dying and their illness understanding, treatment preferences, and advance care planning (ACP). METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a primary palliative care intervention trial. All participants had metastatic solid tumors. Using patients' response to I worry about dying from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Palliative Care survey instrument, univariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations with illness understanding, treatment preferences, and ACP. RESULTS: Of 672 patients, 47% reported worrying about dying not at all, whereas 9.7% worried quite a bit or very much. In regression analysis, compared with patients who reported not worrying about dying, those who reported high levels of worry were more likely to describe themselves as terminally ill (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.10-3.54; P = 0.021) and prefer life-extending therapy over symptom-focused care (AOR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.30-5.22; P = 0.007). They were less likely to have completed an advance directive (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.25-0.94; P = 0.032). The same relationships were seen using patients' response to I feel scared about my future from the Herth Hope Index. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced cancer who worry about dying are more likely to identify as terminally ill and desire life-extending treatment and are less likely to engage in ACP.

These patients are often observed to repeatedly contract aspiration pneumonia, resulting in prolonged hospital stays. To help prevent aspiration pneumonia, enteral nutrition is often provided. Although this method helps avoid pneumonia, patients need to give up eating by mouth. Because oral intake of food is closely related to patient quality of life, abandoning eating results in a strong internal conflict. This report describes the case of a cancer patient who experienced repeated aspiration pneumonias after neck surgery. The patient required enteral nutrition to avoid repeated bouts of pneumonia.

The ADs alone may be insufficient to prepare diverse patients and surrogates for complex medical decisions. OBJECTIVES: To understand what steps best prepare patients and surrogates for decision making. METHODS: We conducted 13 English/Spanish focus groups with participants from a Veterans Affairs and county hospital and the community. Seven groups included patients (n=38), aged <e2><89><a5>65 years, who reported making serious medical decisions. Six separate groups included surrogates (n=31), aged <e2><89><a5>18 years, who made decisions for others. Semistructured focus groups asked what activities best prepared the participants for decision making. Two investigators independently coded data and performed thematic content analysis. Disputes were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: The mean<c2><b1>SD patient age was 78<c2><b1>8 years, and 61% were nonwhite. The mean<c2><b1>SD surrogate age was 57<c2><b1>10 years, and 91% were nonwhite. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching themes about how to best prepare for decision making: 1) identify values based on past experiences and quality of life, 2) choose surrogates wisely and verify that they understand their role, 3) decide whether to grant leeway in surrogate decision making, and 4) inform other family and friends of one's wishes to prevent conflict. CONCLUSION: Beyond ADs, patients and surrogates recommend several additional steps to prepare for medical decision making including using past experiences to identify values, verifying that the surrogate understands their role, deciding whether to grant surrogates leeway, and informing other family and friends of one's wishes.

OBJECTIVES: This article reports on a process of adapting research evidence for use in a clinical decision support system that provided individualized symptom management recommendations to clinicians at the point of care. METHODS: Using a modified ADAPTE process, panels of local experts adapted national guidelines and integrated research evidence to create computable algorithms with explicit recommendations for management of the most common symptoms (pain, fatigue, dyspnea, depression, and anxiety) associated with lung cancer. RESULTS: Small multidisciplinary groups and a consensus panel, using a nominal group technique, modified and subsequently approved computable algorithms for fatigue, dyspnea, moderate pain, severe pain, depression, and anxiety. The approved algorithms represented the consensus of multidisciplinary clinicians on pharmacological and behavioral interventions tailored to the patient's age, comorbidities, laboratory values, current medications, and patient-reported symptom severity. Algorithms also were reconciled with one another to enable simultaneous management of several symptoms. CONCLUSION: A modified ADAPTE process and nominal group technique enabled the development and approval of locally adapted computable algorithms for individualized symptom management in patients with lung cancer.

Investigators identified and reconciled their interpretations by returning to the transcripts to assure that conclusions reflected participants' sentiments. RESULTS: Five themes pertaining to religious beliefs and practices emerged. Two themes were related to decision making: their faith-based beliefs and the meaning that emerges from these beliefs; two described how their coping is impacted: the participants' religious practices and their perceived support from the church community; and one described the participants' spiritual distress.

The optimal processes constituting effective management of symptom clusters remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the attitudes and strategies of clinicians in managing multiple co-occurring symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.

Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and adapted grounded theory. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty in decision making (inadequacy of scientific evidence, relying on experiential knowledge, and pressure to optimize care); attunement to patient and family (sensitivity to multiple cues, prioritizing individual preferences, addressing psychosocial and physical interactions, and opening Pandora's box); deciphering cause to guide intervention (disaggregating symptoms and interactions, flexibility in assessment, and curtailing investigative intrusiveness); balancing complexities in medical management (trading off side effects, minimizing mismatched goals, and urgency in resolving severe symptoms); fostering hope and empowerment (allaying fear of the unknown, encouraging meaning making, championing patient empowerment, and truth telling); and depending on multidisciplinary expertise (maximizing knowledge exchange, sharing management responsibility, contending with hierarchical tensions, and isolation and discontinuity of care).

Symptom burden may help to predict response, but this information is buried in free-text clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) may identify symptoms recorded in the electronic health record and thereby enable this information to inform clinical decisions about the appropriateness of CRT. OBJECTIVES: To develop, train, and test a deep NLP model that identifies documented symptoms in patients with CHF receiving CRT. METHODS: We identified a random sample of clinical notes from a cohort of patients with CHF who later received CRT. Investigators labeled documented symptoms as present, absent, and context dependent (pathologic depending on the clinical situation). The algorithm was trained on 80% and fine-tuned parameters on 10% of the notes. We tested the model on the remaining 10%. We compared the model's performance to investigators' annotations using accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score (a combined measure of precision and recall). RESULTS: Investigators annotated 154 notes (352,157 words) and identified 1340 present, 1300 absent, and 221 context-dependent symptoms. In the test set of 15 notes (35,467 words), the model's accuracy was 99.4% and recall was 66.8%. Precision was 77.6%, and overall F1 score was 71.8. F1 scores for present (70.8) and absent (74.7) symptoms were higher than that for context-dependent symptoms (48.3).

METHODS: One hundred thirty-four (n=134) chronic pain patients were asked to monitor their pain, mood, activity interference, medication use, and pain location on either a paper or electronic diary immediately before each monthly clinic visit for 10 months. Patients and their treating physicians in the electronic diary group (n=67) were able to observe changes in their ratings whereas patients using the paper diaries (n=67) had no feedback about their data entry. RESULTS: Most participants believed that completing pain diaries was beneficial; yet, only 23% of patients in the experimental condition felt that the data from the electronic diaries improved their care and less than 15% believed that their doctor made a change in their treatment based on the summary diary information. CONCLUSION: In general, treating physicians were positive about the use of electronic diaries, although they admitted that they did not regularly incorporate the summary data in their treatment decision making because either they forgot or they were too busy.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the association between patients' use of life-sustaining procedures at the end of life and depressive symptoms in their surviving spouses. METHODS: We used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal survey of U.S. residents, linked to Medicare claims data. We included married Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who died between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1258) and their surviving spouses. The use of life-sustaining procedures (i.e., intubation/mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube insertion, enteral/parenteral nutrition, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in the last month of life was measured via claims data. Using propensity score matching, we compared change in depressive symptoms of surviving spouses. RESULTS: Eighteen percent of decedents underwent one or more life-sustaining procedures in the last month of life. Those whose spouses underwent life-sustaining procedures had a 0.32-point increase in depressive symptoms after death (scale range = 0-8) and a greater likelihood of clinically significant depression (odds ratio = 1.51) compared with a matched sample of spouses of those who did not have procedures (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Surviving spouses of those who undergo intensive life-sustaining procedures at the end of life experience a greater magnitude of increase in depressive symptoms than those whose spouses do not undergo such procedures.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine how patient age, patient disposition, and physician religiousness affect physician recommendations in the context of advanced illness. METHODS: A survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of U.S. physicians, which included three vignettes depicting advanced illness scenarios: 1) cancer, 2) heart failure, and 3) dementia with acute infection. One vignette included experimental variables to test how patient age and patient disposition affected physician recommendations. After each vignette, physicians indicated their likelihood to recommend disease-directed medical care vs. hospice care. RESULTS: Among eligible physicians (n = 1878), 62% (n = 1156) responded. Patient age and stated patient disposition toward treatment did not significantly affect physician recommendations. Compared with religious physicians, physicians who reported that religious importance was ""not applicable"" were less likely to recommend chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66) and more likely to recommend hospice (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15-3.16) for a patient with cancer. Compared with physicians who ever attended religious services, physicians who never attended were less likely to recommend left ventricular assist device placement for a patient with congestive heart failure (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92). In addition, Asian ethnicity was independently associated with recommending chemotherapy (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.61) and being less likely to recommend hospice (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.91) for the patient with cancer; and it was associated with recommending antibiotics for the patient with dementia and pneumonia (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08-2.50).

Porter Jr and Teno, Joan M. and Widera, Eric",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Overuse or misuse of tests and treatments exposes patients to potential harm. The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely(R) campaign is a multiyear effort to encourage physician leadership in reducing harmful or inappropriate resource utilization. Via the campaign, medical societies are asked to identify five tests or procedures commonly used in their field, the routine use of which in specific clinical scenarios should be questioned by both physicians and patients based on the evidence that the test or procedure is ineffective or even harmful. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) was invited, and it agreed to participate in the campaign. The AAHPM Choosing Wisely Task Force, with input from the AAHPM membership, developed the following five recommendations: 1) Don't recommend percutaneous feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia; instead, offer oral-assisted feeding; 2) Don't delay palliative care for a patient with serious illness who has physical, psychological, social, or spiritual distress because they are pursuing disease-directed treatment; 3) Don't leave an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator activated when it is inconsistent with the patient/family goals of care; 4) Don't recommend more than a single fraction of palliative radiation for an uncomplicated painful bone metastasis; and 5) Don't use topical lorazepam (Ativan(R)), diphenhydramine (Benadryl(R)), and haloperidol (Haldol(R)) (ABH) gel for nausea.

OBJECTIVES: To explore emotion using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and a self-report questionnaire to better understand the relationship between these two measures of emotion in a pediatric care context. METHODS: Sixty-nine parents of 47 children who were participants in the Decision Making in Pediatric Palliative Care Study at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia took part in this study. Parents completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and a semistructured interview about their children and experience with medical decision making. The transcribed interviews were analyzed with the LIWC program, which yields scores for positive and negative emotional expression. The association between LIWC and PANAS scores was evaluated using multivariate linear regression to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: Parents who used more positive words when speaking about the illnesses of their children and the experience of medical decision making were more likely to report lower levels of positive affect on the PANAS: increase in the standard deviation of positive emotional expression was associated with an unadjusted 7.4% decrease in the self-reported positive affect (P = 0.015) and an adjusted 7.0% decrease in the self-reported positive affect (P = 0.057) after modeling for potential confounders. Increase in the standard deviation of negative emotional expression was associated with an adjusted 9.4% increase in the self-reported negative affect (P = 0.036).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a short-term prognostic prediction method that included such objective factors as medical history, vital signs, and blood tests for use with patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Medical records gathered at the admission of patients with advanced cancer to the hospice palliative care unit at a tertiary hospital in Taiwan were reviewed retrospectively. The records included demographics, history of cancer treatments, performance status, vital signs, and biological parameters, Multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used for model development. RESULTS: The Objective Palliative Prognostic Score was determined by using six objective predictors identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictors include heart rate >120/min, white blood cells >11,000/mm(3), platelets <130,000/mm(3), serum creatinine level >1.3 mg/dL, serum potassium level >5 mg/dL, and no history of chemotherapy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve used to predict seven-day survival was 82.0% (95% confidence interval 75.2%-88.8%). If any three predictors of the six were reached, death within seven days was predicted with 68.8% sensitivity, 86.0% specificity, 55.9% positive predictive value, and 91.4% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The Objective Palliative Prognostic Score consists of six objective predictors for the estimation of seven-day survival among patients with advanced cancer and showed a relatively high accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe experiences and challenges faced by pediatric oncologists and intensivists and how the oncologist-intensivist relationship impacts communication and initiation of goals of care discussions (GCDs). METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 10 physicians, including pediatric oncology and intensive care attendings and fellows. RESULTS: We identified key themes (three barriers and four facilitators) to having GCDs with families of oncology patients who have received intensive care. Barriers included challenges to communication within teams because of hierarchy and between teams due to incomplete sharing of information and confusion about who should initiate GCDs; provider experiences of internal conflict about how to engage parents in decision-making and about the ""right thing to do"" for patients; and lack of education and training in communication. Facilitators included team preparation for family meetings; skills for partnering with families; the presence of palliative care specialists; and informal education in communication and willingness for further training in communication. Notably, the education theme was identified as both a barrier and resource. CONCLUSION: We identified barriers to communication with families both within and between teams and for individual physicians.

We describe a case in which the medical team and a patient and family are considering a second palliative biliary stent despite the patient's limited life expectancy. We review available evidence to inform the decision, focusing on the specific question of whether the benefits of palliative biliary stents in patients with advanced cancer outweigh the risks. We then apply the evidence to the issue of how the primary and/or palliative care team and the interventionist communicate with patients and their families about the risks and benefits of palliative procedures. Review of the evidence found several prospective case series without control groups that measured patient-centered outcomes. Studies had high attrition rates, results for improvements in symptoms and quality of life were mixed, and rates of complications and short-term mortality were high. In conclusion, the limited evidence does not support that the benefits of palliative biliary stents in this population outweigh the risks.

There are no guidelines for selecting patients whose survival and quality of life may be enhanced by such treatments or for communication with patients and caregivers about possible treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe caregivers' perspectives on decision making for the use of intensive treatments for patients with advanced CF lung disease. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 caregivers of 36 patients who died of CF about treatment preference discussions and solicited recommendations for improving discussions. RESULTS: Twenty (56%) patients received intensive treatments during the last week of life. Twenty-two (61%) caregivers reported ever having discussed intensive treatment preferences with a physician, and 17 (77%) of these discussions were initiated during an acute illness. Only 14 (39%) of all patients participated. Caregivers expressed less certainty about consistency of treatments with patient preferences when patients did not participate. Twenty-nine (81%) caregivers endorsed first discussing treatment preferences during a period of medical stability.

Advance care planning (ACP) can help to make this vulnerable period better for patients, caregivers, and providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether older age predicted the presence of certain forms of retrievable ACP documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) in a large sample of hospice-referred patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical-record data on 3595 patients referred to hospice between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. EHR documentation of an ACP note in the problem list, presence of a scanned advance directive, and the presence of a verified do-not-resuscitate order were the outcome measures. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of age, education, race, gender, cancer diagnosis, dementia diagnosis, palliative encounter, and death on the outcome variables. RESULTS: Our results suggest that when we control for prognosis, patients over age 70 years may experience gaps in ACP communication. We found that as patients age, the odds of having documentation of a conversation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; P < 0.001) or scanned advance directive decreased (OR = 0.63; P < 0.001), while the odds of having a verified do-not-resuscitate order increased (OR = 1.42; P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of advance directives and proxy opinions on doctors' decisions. METHODS: We mailed to all the generalists and internists in French-speaking Switzerland (N = 1962) three vignettes describing difficult decisions involving incapacitated patients. In each case, the advance directive requested that further care be withheld. One vignette tested the impact of a written advance directive vs. a proxy. Another compared the impact of a handwritten directive vs. a formalized document. The third vignette compared the impact of a family member vs. a doctor as a proxy. Each vignette was prepared in three or four versions, including a control version in which no directive or proxy was present. Vignettes were randomly allocated to respondents. We used logistic regression to predict the decision to forgo a medical intervention. RESULTS: Compared with the control condition, the odds of forgoing a medical intervention were increased by the written advance directive (odds ratio [OR] 7.3; P < 0.001), the proxy (OR 7.9; P < 0.001), and the combination of the two (OR 35.7; P < 0.001). The handwritten directive had the same impact (OR 13.3) as the formalized directive (OR 13.8). The effect of proxy opinion was slightly stronger when provided by a doctor (OR 11.3) rather than by family (OR 7.8).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand Australian general practitioner (GP) clinical decision making relating to a patient's ""need for ACP"" and the likelihood of initiating ACP. METHODS: An experimental vignette study pseudorandomly manipulated factors thought to influence decision making regarding ACP. Patient-level factors included gender, age, type of disease, medical severity, openness to ACP, doctor-patient relationship, and family support. An accompanying demographic survey assessed health professional-level factors, including gender, years of experience, place of training, place of practice, caseload of patients with ACP, direct personal experience in ACP, and self-reported attitudes toward ACP. Seventy GPs were recruited, and each completed six unique vignettes, providing ratings of patient need for ACP, importance of initiating ACP in the coming months, and likelihood of initiating ACP at the next consultation. RESULTS: Older patients, with malignant or cardiovascular disease, severe clinical presentations, good doctor-patient relationship, female gender, and poor family support were more likely to receive prompt ACP. Positive GP attitudes toward ACP were associated with greater likelihood of initiating ACP promptly. CONCLUSION: Patients with presentations suggesting higher mortality risk were identified as being in need of ACP; however, the likelihood of initiating ACP was sensitive to GP attitudes and psychosocial aspects of the doctor-patient interaction.

Randall and Engelberg, Ruth A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer often face complex, preference-sensitive decisions. How clinicians and patients engage in shared decision-making during goals-of-care discussions is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore decision-making by patients and clinicians during inpatient goals-of-care discussions. METHODS: This is a qualitative study of audio-recorded goals-of-care discussions between hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and their clinicians. Grounded theory was used to analyze transcripts. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in goals-of-care discussions with 51 unique clinicians. Nearly half of patients (n = 30) were female and their mean age was 60.1 years (SD = 12.7). A palliative care attending or fellow was present in 58 of the 62 discussions. Decisions centered on three topics: 1) disease-modifying treatments; 2) hospice; and 3) code status. Clinicians' approach to decision-making included the following stages: ""information exchange,"" ""deliberation,"" ""making a patient-centered recommendation,"" and ""wrap-up: decisional status."" Successful completion of each stage varied by the type of decision. When discussing code status, clinicians missed opportunities to engage patients in information exchange and to wrap up decisional status. By contrast, clinicians discussing disease-modifying treatments and hospice failed to integrate patient preferences. Clinicians also missed opportunities to make patient-centered recommendations when discussing treatment decisions. CONCLUSION: Clinicians missed opportunities to facilitate shared decision-making regarding goals of care, and these missed opportunities differed by type of decision being discussed. Opportunities for clinician communication training include engagement in collaborative deliberation with patients and making patient-centered recommendations in situations of high medical uncertainty.",2019,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.05.002,58,2,216-223,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Decision-making and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Qualitative Research and cancer and *Decision Making and *Hospitalization and *Patient Care Planning and palliative care and *Neoplasms,NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Fu, Chin-Hua",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: A better time-to-death (TTD) prediction can facilitate decision-making processes related to plans for providing effective end-of-life care for patients in hospice wards. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of cardiovascular autonomic functions with TTD in patients with terminal hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted with 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma recruited from the hospice ward of a regional hospital in Chiayi county, Taiwan. Serum creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum albumin were measured on the admission day. Cardiovascular autonomic functions were evaluated by frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) on admission. RESULTS: TTD was significantly associated with total spectrum power (TP) (r=0.55, P=0.001) and high frequency (HF power) (r=0.44, P=0.010) of HRV measurement. The accuracy of within-one-week TTD prediction was 67% for TP and HF power. The accuracy of within-two-week TTD prediction was 82% for TP and 73% for HF. In addition, TTD of the patients was also significantly associated with serum creatinine (r=-0.42, P=0.015), serum albumin (r=-0.46, P=0.007), and BUN (r=-0.44, P=0.010).

OBJECTIVES: In a mixed-method prospective cohort of parental dyads of children with serious illness, to describe the major problems and hopes perceived for their child, examine the degree of concordance between parents, and assess whether prevalence and concordance change over time. METHODS: Eighty-four parents (42 dyads) of seriously ill children reported the major problems and hopes for their children at baseline. Thirty-two parents (16 dyads) answered the same questions at 24 months. Problems and hopes were classified into nine domains. Observed concordance was calculated between parents on each domain. Data for parents of 11 children who died are reported separately. RESULTS: The most common major problem and hope domains at baseline were physical body, quality of life, future health and well-being, and medical care. Parental dyads demonstrated a moderately high percentage of concordance (69%) regarding reported problem domains and a slightly lower percentage of concordance on hopes (61%), with higher concordance for more common domains. Domain prevalence and concordance changed considerably at 24 months. Parents of children who later died showed markedly different patterns of domain prevalence and more extreme patterns of concordance.

Yet, no study to date has examined whether end-of-life practices are associated with measures of religiosity and spirituality. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between general measures of patient religiosity and spirituality and patients' preferences for care at the end of life. METHODS: We examined data from the University of Chicago Hospitalist Study, which gathers sociodemographic and clinical information from all consenting general internal medicine patients at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Primary outcomes were whether the patient had an advance directive, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, a durable power of attorney for health care, and an informally designated decision maker. Primary predictors were religious attendance, intrinsic religiosity, and self-rated spirituality. RESULTS: The sample population (n=8308) was predominantly African American (73%) and female (60%). In this population, 1.5% had advance directives and 10.4% had DNR orders. Half (51%) of the patients had specified a decision maker. White patients were more likely than African American patients to have an advance directive (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-4.0) and a DNR order (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.9). Patients reporting high intrinsic religiosity were more likely to have specified a decision maker than those reporting low intrinsic religiosity (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.6). The same was true for those with high compared with low spirituality (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.5). Religious characteristics were not significantly associated with having an advance directive or DNR order.

S. and Zenoni, Maria A. and Kerns, Robert D. and Pearlman, Robert A. and Asch, Steven M. and Becker, William C. and Lorenz, Karl A.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Signature informed consent (SIC) is a part of a Veterans Health Administration ethics initiative for patient education and shared decision making with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). Historically, patients with cancer-related pain receiving LTOT are exempt from this process. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to understand patients' and providers' perspectives on using SIC for LTOT in patients with cancer-related pain. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 20 opioid prescribers and 20 patients who were prescribed opioids at two large academically affiliated Veterans Health Administration Medical Centers. We used a combination of deductive and inductive approaches in content analysis to produce emergent themes. RESULTS: Potential advantages of SIC are that it can clarify and help patients comprehend LTOT risks and benefits, provide clear upfront boundaries and expectations, and involve the patient in shared decision making. Potential disadvantages of SIC include time delay to treatment, discouragement from recommended opioid use, and impaired trust in the patient-provider relationship. Providers and patients have misconceptions about the definition of SIC. Providers and patients question if SIC for LTOT is really informed consent. Providers and patients advocate for strategies to improve comprehension of SIC content. Providers had divergent perspectives on exemptions from SIC. Oncologists want SIC for LTOT to be tailored for patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: Provider and patient interviews highlight various aspects about the advantages and disadvantages of requiring SIC for LTOT in cancer-related pain.

Maciejewski_2013_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Emotional numbness modifies the effect of end-of-life discussions on end-of-life care,"Maciejewski, Paul K. and Prigerson, Holly G.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Overall, end-of-life (EOL) discussions are unrelated to psychological distress and associated with lower rates of aggressive care near death. Nevertheless, patients who report that they feel emotionally numb about their illness might encounter difficulties cognitively processing an EOL discussion. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that emotional numbness would modify the effect of EOL discussions on the receipt of less aggressive EOL care. METHODS: Data were derived from structured interviews with 290 participants in the federally-funded Coping with Cancer Study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with advanced cancer followed-up till their death. Patients' reports of EOL discussions with their physician and emotional numbness were assessed at a median of 4.6 months before their death. Information about aggressive EOL care (i.e., ventilation, resuscitation in the last week of life, death in the intensive care unit) was obtained from postmortem caregiver interviews and medical charts. Main and interactive effects of EOL discussions and emotional numbness on aggressive EOL care, adjusting for potential confounds, were evaluated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The likelihood of aggressive EOL care associated with having EOL discussions increased by a factor of nine (adjusted odds ratio=9.02, 95% CI 1.37, 59.6, P=0.022) for every unit increase in a patient's emotional numbness score. CONCLUSION: Emotional numbness diminishes a patient's capacity to benefit from EOL discussions.

While these children often receive palliative care services, little is known about parental preparedness for their child's end of life (EOL). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate aspects important to preparedness at EOL among bereaved parents of children with CCCs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, parents of children who received care at Boston Children's Hospital and died between 2006 and 2015 completed 21 open-response items querying communication, decision-making, and EOL experiences as part of the Survey of Caring for Children with CCCs. Additional demographic data were extracted from the child's medical record. An iterative multistage thematic analysis of responses was utilized to identify key contexts, conditions, and themes pertaining to preparedness. RESULTS: One hundred ten of 114 parents responded to open-ended items; 63% (n = 69) had children with congenital or central nervous system progressive primary conditions for a median of 7.5 years (IQR 0.8-18.1) before death. Seventy-one percent (n = 78/110) had palliative care involvement and 65% (n = 69/106) completed advance care planning. Parents described preparedness as a complex concept that extended beyond ""readiness"" for their child's death. Three domains emerged that contributed to parents' lack of preparedness: 1) chronic illness experiences; 2) pretense of preparedness; and 3) circumstances and emotions surrounding their child's death. CONCLUSIONS: Most bereaved parents of children with CCCs described feeling unprepared for their child's EOL, despite palliative care and advance care planning, suggesting preparedness is a nuanced concept beyond ""readiness.""

RESULTS: Participants (n = 68) were primarily Caucasian (94%), females (68%), with mean age of 51.3 years (SD 0.7). Seventeen games were analyzed. Four primary themes emerged during game conversations: 1) the importance of people, relationships, and the roles played during end-of-life decision making, 2) values, beliefs, and preferences related to end-of-life care and the dying period, 3) considerations about preparing for the aftermath of one's death, and 4) the relevance of stories or experiences for informing one's own end-of-life preferences.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore EPs' attitudes about intubating critically ill, terminal cancer patients. METHODS: Fifty EPs at three emergency departments (one university based, one community, and one Health Maintenance Organization) in Southern California participated in an anonymous survey that presented a hypothetical case of an end-stage lung cancer patient in pending respiratory failure. Fourteen questions along a five-point Likert scale asked EPs about prognosis and factors that influence their decision to intubate or not. RESULTS: A convenience sampling of 50 EPs yielded a 100% survey response rate. Ninety-four percent believed intubation would not provide an overall survival benefit. If the family insisted, 26% would intubate the patient even with a do-not-intubate (DNI) status. Ninety-four percent would postpone intubation if palliative consultation were available in the ED. Sixty-eight percent believed that a discussion about goals of care was more time consuming than intubation. Only 16% believed they had sufficient training in palliative care. Although 29% who felt they had inadequate palliative care training would intubate the patient with a DNI, only 13% of EPs with self-perceived adequate palliative care training would intubate that patient. CONCLUSION: EPs vary in their attitudes about intubating dying cancer patients when families demanded it, even when they believed it was nonbeneficial and against the patient's wishes.

Hebert_2009_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Preparing family caregivers for death and bereavement. Insights from caregivers of terminally ill patients,"Hebert, Randy S. and Schulz, Richard and Copeland, Valire C. and Arnold, Robert M.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"Many family caregivers are unprepared for the death of their loved one and may suffer from worse mental health as a result. We therefore sought to determine the factors that family caregivers believe are important to preparing for death and bereavement. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with 33 family caregivers (bereaved or current) of terminally ill patients. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Life experiences such as the duration of caregiving/illness, advance care planning, previous experiences with caregiving or death, and medical sophistication all impacted preparedness, or the degree to which a caregiver is ready for the death and bereavement. Regardless of life experiences, however, all caregivers reported medical, practical, psychosocial, and religious/spiritual uncertainty. Because uncertainty was multidimensional, caregivers often needed more than prognostic information in order to prepare. Communication was the primary mechanism used to manage uncertainty. Good communication included clear, reliable information, combined with relationship-centered care from health care providers. Finally, preparedness had cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. To prepare, some caregivers needed information tailored to their uncertainty (cognitive), others needed to ""mentally"" or ""emotionally"" prepare (affective), and still others had important tasks to complete (behavioral). In order to better prepare family caregivers for the death of a loved one, health care providers must develop a trusting relationship with caregivers, provide them with reliable information tailored to their uncertainty, and allow time for caregivers to process the information and complete important tasks.",2009,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.12.010,37,1,12-3,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pennsylvania and Interviews as Topic and Aged, 80 and over and *Artificial Intelligence and Caregivers/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology and Terminally Ill/*psychology and *Attitude to Death and Spirituality and Palliative Care/*psychology and *Bereavement",NA,NA,2009/01//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

LIS patients may live for years with preserved quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function, but with severe disability. However, medical providers and family often underestimate the patient's QoL, and choose less aggressive care. Prompt assessment of decisionality in LIS patients is challenging, but it must be done to allow these patients to participate in their care. We present the case of a 54-year-old man with LIS. The medical team recommended comfort measures, but the family advocated involving the patient in goals of care discussions.

Malia_2011_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,What influences patients' decisions on artificial hydration at the end of life? A Q-methodology study,"Malia, Catherine and Bennett, Michael I.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Artificial hydration (AH) is used to palliate patients with reduced fluid intake at the end of life but is a controversial practice. Patients' involvement in decision making varies, and little is known about patients' understanding of the benefits and burdens of AH. OBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that patients consider most important when making decisions regarding AH at the end of life. METHODS: Interview study using Q-sort methodology conducted with 20 patients with advanced diseases recruited from inpatient and outpatient palliative care services. RESULTS: Several domains appear to influence a decision about AH: the patient's understanding of AH, their philosophical position on end-of-life care, the process of discussion, and who makes the final decision. Patients generally based their decision on whether AH would improve quality of life, although prolonging life was important for some. Hydration was not considered a burden, and many would want a trial of AH in the event that they could no longer drink. Patients wanted to be guided by medical opinion, although some wanted to make the decision on their own. All patients welcomed the opportunity to discuss AH. CONCLUSION: Patients view AH as an important issue and are keen to be involved in decision making.

Current understanding of people who would be involved in advance care planning (ACP) is crucial to disseminate it systematically. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate awareness and attitudes toward ACP in South Korea. METHODS: A multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted, a survey regarding ACP among four groups that would have different positions and experiences: 1001 cancer patients, 1006 family caregivers, 928 physicians, and 1241 members of the general public. RESULTS: A total of 15% of the general population, 33% of the patients and caregivers, and 61% of the physicians had knowledge of advance directives. More than 64% of the general population, above 72% of the patients and caregivers, and 97% of the physicians were willing to do so when the disease status was aggravated or terminal. The possibility for changing the plan, uncertainty as to whether directives would actually be followed, and psychological discomfort were common reasons for not wanting to engage in ACP. Routine recommendations for a specific medical condition, heightened accessibility, and health insurance support were common factors that could help facilitate ACP. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that strategies for promoting ACP should reflect different perspectives among the general public, patients, family caregivers, and physicians.

Green_2015_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,Advance Care Planning Does Not Adversely Affect Hope or Anxiety Among Patients With Advanced Cancer,"Green, Michael J. and Schubart, Jane R. and Whitehead, Megan M. and Farace, Elana and Lehman, Erik and Levi, Benjamin H.",Journal of pain and symptom management,"CONTEXT: Many physicians avoid advance care planning (ACP) discussions because they worry such conversations will lead to psychological distress. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether engaging in ACP using online planning tools adversely affects hope, hopelessness, or anxiety among patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer and an estimated survival of two years or less (Intervention group) and a Control group were recruited at a tertiary care academic medical center (2007-2012) to engage in ACP using an online decision aid (""Making Your Wishes Known""). Pre/post and between-group comparisons were made, including hope (Herth Hope Index), hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale), and anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included ACP knowledge, self-determination, and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 200 individuals completed the study. After engaging in ACP, there was no decline in hope or increase in hopelessness in either the Control or Intervention group. Anxiety was likewise unchanged in the Control group but decreased slightly in the Intervention group. Knowledge of ACP (% correct answers) increased in both the groups, but more so in the Intervention group (13% increase vs. 4%; P<0.01). Self-determination increased slightly in both groups, and satisfaction with the ACP process was greater (P<0.01) in the Intervention than Control group.

Waldrop_2018_Joofpaansyma,JOUR,"The Nexus Between the Documentation of End-of-Life Wishes and Awareness of Dying: A Model for Research, Education and Care","Waldrop, Deborah P. and McGinley, Jacqueline M. and Clemency, Brian",Journal of pain and symptom management,"The convergence of medical treatment that can extend life with written medical orders that make it possible to refuse such treatment brings the differential dynamics of contemporary end-of-life decision making into sharp focus. Communication between families and clinicians can be confusing, uncertain, and pressured when death is imminent. These situations create distress that ultimately influences the end-of-life experience for people who are dying and those who care for them. This article presents the analysis of the decisional dynamics that emerge from the intersection of the patient-family-provider awareness that death is near with the presence or absence of documentation of expressed wishes for end-of-life care. A heuristic analysis was conducted with data from three studies about urgent decision making at the end of life. Original study data included 395 surveys, in-depth interviews with 91 prehospital (paramedics and emergency medical technicians), and content analysis of 100 Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment forms that led to the development of an overarching conceptual model of decision making. Four decisional contexts emerged from the intersection of awareness of dying and documentation of wishes: 1) Aware Documented, 2) Aware Undocumented, 3) Unaware Documented, and 4) Unaware Undocumented. This generalizable model, which is agnostic of setting, can help clinicians more astutely recognize the clinical situation when death is imminent, assess patients and caregivers, and intervene to help focus conversation and direct decision making. The model can also inform research, education, and care for people in some of the most vulnerable moments of life.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.09.010,55,2,522-529,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and conceptual model and Stress, Psychological and Interviews as Topic and Models, Psychological and Heuristics and *Decision Making and *Documentation and *Awareness and Family/psychology and *Death and Caregivers/psychology and *Advance Directives/psychology and *Terminal Care/psychology and Emergency Medical Technicians/psychology and End-of-life decision making and existential crisis and Existentialism",NA,NA,2018/02//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of FAmily-CEntered (FACE) ACP in increasing ACP and advance directive documentation in the medical record. METHODS: Longitudinal, two-arm, randomized controlled trial with intent-to-treat design recruited from five hospital-based outpatient HIV clinics in Washington, DC. Adults living with HIV and their surrogate decision-makers (N = 233 dyads) were randomized to either an intensive facilitated two-session FACE ACP (Next Steps: Respecting Choices goals of care conversation and Five Wishes advance directive) or healthy living control (conversations about developmental/relationship history and nutrition). RESULTS: Patients (n = 223) mean age: 51 years, 56% male, 86% African-American. One hundred ninety-nine dyads participated in the intervention. At baseline, only 13% of patients had an advance directive. Three months after intervention, this increased to 59% for the FACE ACP group versus 17% in the control group (P < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that family factors might influence clinician decision making in these circumstances. METHODS: We presented vignettes concerning difficult EOL decision making, randomized for religious objection to therapy withdrawal and perceived level of family involvement, to clinicians working in three Children's Hospital intensive care units. Additionally, attitudes about EOL care were assessed. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four respondents completed the questionnaire, for an overall response rate of 54%. Respondents receiving the ""involved family"" vignette were more likely to agree to continue medical care indefinitely (P<0.0005). Respondents were marginally more likely to pursue a court-appointed guardian for those patients whose families had nonreligious objections to withdrawal (P=0.05). Respondents who thought that a fear of being sued affected decisions were less likely to pursue unilateral withdrawal (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI=0.6-0.9). Those who felt personal distress as a result of difficult EOL decision making, thought they often provided ""futile"" care, or those who felt EOL care was effectively addressed at the institution were less likely to want to defer to the parents' wishes (range of odds ratios 0.7-1). CONCLUSION: In this randomized vignette study, we have shown that family factors, particularly how involved a family seems to be in a child's life, affect what clinicians think is ethically appropriate in challenging EOL cases. Knowledge of how a family's degree of involvement may affect clinicians should be helpful to the clinical ethics consultants and offer some degree of insight to the clinicians themselves.",2013,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.005,45,5,832-840,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude to Health and Religion and *Decision Making and United States/epidemiology and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/*statistics & numerical data and Terminal Care/*statistics & numerical data and *Family Characteristics and Advance Care Planning/*statistics & numerical data and Legal Guardians/statistics & numerical data and Pediatrics/*statistics & numerical data and Terminally Ill/statistics & numerical data and Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between depression and health care utilization at EOL among older adults (ages >=67) diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 2009 to 2011. METHODS: Using the SEER-Medicare database, we fit multivariable logistic regression models to explore the association of depression with duration of hospice stay plus high-intensity care, for example inpatient admissions, in-hospital death, emergency department visits, and chemotherapy at EOL. We used a regression model to evaluate hospice enrollment, accounting for the competing risk of death. RESULTS: Among 13,827 subjects, pre-cancer depression was associated with hospice enrollment (sub-hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.28), 90 + hospice days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.58), and lower odds of most utilization; we found no association with EOL chemotherapy. Diagnosis-time depression was associated with hospice enrollment (SHR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29) but not high-intensity utilization. Post-diagnosis depression was associated with lower hospice enrollment (SHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.85) and higher odds of ICU admission (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37). CONCLUSION: EOL healthcare utilization varied by timing of depression diagnosis. Those with pre-cancer depression had lower odds of high-intensity healthcare, were more likely to utilize hospice, and have longer hospice stays. Regular depression screening and treatment may help patients optimize decision-making for EOL care.

Surgical patients are persistently less likely to receive palliative care than their medical counterparts for reasons that are not clear. OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize surgeon-specific determinants of palliative care in seriously ill and dying patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature focused on surgery and palliative care within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid Medline databases from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2016 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative studies with primary data evaluating surgeons' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors or experiences in care for seriously ill and dying patients were selected for full review by at least two study team members based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted based on a predetermined instrument and compared across studies using thematic analysis in a meta-synthesis of qualitative and quantitative findings. RESULTS: A total of 2589 abstracts were identified and screened, and 35 articles (26 quantitative and nine qualitative) fulfilled criteria for full review. Among these, 17 articles explored practice and attitudes of surgeons regarding palliative and end-of-life care, 11 articles assessed training in palliative care, five characterized surgical decision making, one described behaviors of surgeons caring for seriously ill and dying patients, and one explicitly identified barriers to use of palliative care. Four major themes across studies affected receipt of palliative care for surgical patients: 1) surgeons' experience and knowledge, 2) surgeons' attitudes, 3) surgeons' preferences and decision making for treatment, and 4) perceived barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Among the articles reviewed, surgeons overall demonstrated insight into the benefits of palliative care but reported limited knowledge and comfort as well as a multitude of challenges to introducing palliative care to their patients. These findings indicate a need for wider implementation of strategies that allow optimal integration of palliative care with surgical decision making.",2018,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.11.031,55,4,1196-1215.e5,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,United States and Humans and Palliative care and surgery and mixed methods and systematic review and *Palliative Care/methods/psychology and *Surgeons and meta-synthesis and surgeon,NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied end-of-life decision-making practices for cancer patients who died in each of these settings and assessed the impact of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP), a template for care in the dying phase. Physicians and relatives of 311 deceased cancer patients completed questionnaires. The LCP was introduced halfway through the study period. During the last three months of life, patients who died in hospital received anticancer therapy and medication to relieve symptoms more often than those in both other settings. During the last three days of life, patients who died in the hospital or nursing home received more medication than those who died at home. The LCP reduced the extent to which physicians used medication that might have hastened death. Relatives of patients who died in the hospital tended to be least positive about the patient's and their own participation in the decision making. We conclude that cancer patients who die in the hospital are more intensively treated during the last phase of life than those who die elsewhere.

More difficult still are the decisions regarding what interventions are and are not indicated during these trying times. Occasionally, families of children who are nearing the end of life disagree with the assessment of the medical team regarding these interventions. In rare cases, the medical team can be moved to enact a do not attempt resuscitation order against the wishes of the patient's parents. This article presents one such illustrative case and discusses the ethical issues relevant to such challenging clinical scenarios. The authors posit that such a unilateral do not attempt resuscitation order is only appropriate in very limited circumstances in pediatric care. Instead, focus should be placed on open discussion between parents and members of the clinical team, shared decision making, and maintenance of the clinician-parent relationship while simultaneously supporting members of the clinical team who express discomfort with parental decisions.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to identify support network factors that affect the likelihood of naming a decision-maker and of talking to family/friends and doctors about ACP among vulnerable PLHIV. METHODS: PLHIV were recruited from a large urban HIV clinic. A social support network inventory was used to calculate number of persons available for various types of support. Characteristics of network members were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between social network factors and ACP discussion, adjusting for age, sex, education, and total number of network members. RESULTS: The sample (N = 370) was mostly African American (95%), male (56%), and 48% had less than a high school education. Almost half the sample (48%) had talked to their family/friends or doctor about ACP, and 34% had named a medical decision-maker. Adjusted analysis revealed that talking about ACP with family/friends was associated with female sex and a larger closer support network who provided health information and physical assistance. Talking to doctors about ACP was associated with larger support networks who provided physical assistance but lower numbers from whom emotional support was received.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify available patient decision aids (PtDAs) relating information about hospice care and compare that information with the informational needs expressed by real-world health care consumers. METHODS: First, the research team conducted an environmental scan of available PtDAs that included hospice as a treatment option and met six basic criteria defined by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. Second, laypersons conducted an organic Web search for information regarding hospice, followed by a semi-structured interview eliciting perceptions of the available information. The setting was the University of Colorado Health Care System. Participants included 20 laypersons aged 18 years or older. RESULTS: The environmental scan identified 7PtDAs that included hospice. No PtDAs were designed primarily around hospice; rather, hospice was referenced under the umbrella of another treatment option. The layperson search identified information distinct from the scan; no participant accessed any of the above 7PtDAs. Many participants found the available online material confusing and biased, while failing to provide clear information on cost and lacking desired patient and caregiver testimonials.

Advance practice providers such as physician assistants (PAs) are increasingly providing care in the hospital setting and are often called to communicate with patients and families. A first step to improving PA communication is to better understand PAs' current experiences in their daily practices. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore roles PAs serve in communicating with terminally ill patients/families; PAs' attitudes and opinions about communication roles; and perceived barriers and facilitators of communication with patients/families in the hospital setting. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with PAs practicing on adult medical services at three acute care hospitals of an academic medical center in Bronx, New York. An open-ended question guide was used. An inductive thematic analysis strategy was used to examine the data from transcribed audiotapes of focus group sessions to identify emergent concepts and themes. RESULTS: The overarching theme that emerged was being stuck in the middle. PAs experienced ambiguity around their roles and responsibilities in communications between the medical team as well as patients and families; gaps in knowledge and skills; and organizational or structural deficits in the patient care systems that placed them in uncomfortable situations. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at improving PA communication with terminally ill patients and their families should target institutional structures, systems, and culture around roles and responsibilities in addition to skill and knowledge gaps to be most effective.",2017,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.03.011,54,1,27-34,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Patient Care Team and Decision Making and Palliative care and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and health communication and *Professional-Patient Relations and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Health Communication and *Family/psychology and *Terminally Ill/psychology and hospital medicine and Physician Assistants/*psychology and Professional Role/psychology,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three hundred and seventy-four consecutive patients with terminal cancers admitted to a palliative care unit were enrolled. Two instruments, the good-death scale and the audit scale for good-death services, were used in the study. Mean age of the 374 patients was 65.45 +/- 14.77 years. The total good-death score in the home-death group (n=307) was significantly higher than that in the hospital-death group (n=67), both at the time of admission (t= -5.741, P<0.001) and prior to death (t= -3.027, P<0.01). However, the score of item ""degree of physical comfort"" assessed prior to death in the home-death group was lower than that in the hospital-death group (P=0.185). As to the audit scale for good-death services, each subscale score and total scores in the home-death group were significantly higher than that in the hospital-death group, with the exception of the subscale ""continuity of social support"" (4.72 vs. 4.61, P=0.132). Bereavement support (odds ratio=1.01, 95% confidence interval=0.62-1.39; multiple regression), alleviation of anxiety (0.81, 0.46-1.15), decision-making participation (0.61, 0.26-0.95), fulfillment of last wish (0.45, 0.08-0.82), and survival time (0.00, 0.00-0.01) were independent correlates of the good-death score (35.8% of explained variance). However, the place of death was not in the model. The study conclusively suggests the necessity for palliative home care to strengthen the competence of physical care. Moreover, earlier incorporation of palliative care into anticancer therapies can lead to better death preparation and good-death services, and thus be helpful to achieve a good death.",2007,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.01.004,34,5,497-504,eng,0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude and Data Interpretation, Statistical and Taiwan and *Attitude to Death and Neoplasms/*psychology and Terminal Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand the relationships among these care processes, we analyzed baseline interview data from veterans enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a palliative care intervention. Participants were 400 inpatient veterans admitted with a physician-estimated risk of one-year mortality more than 25%; 260 (65%) had cancer as the primary diagnosis. Patients who believed that they had a life-limiting illness (89% of sample) reported that their provider had communicated this to them more frequently than those who did not share that belief (78% vs. 22%, P<0.001). Over half (53%) of the participants reported discussing their care preferences with their providers and 66% reported such discussions with their family; 35% had a living will. In multivariate analysis, greater functional impairment was associated with patients having discussed their care preferences with providers (P<0.05), whereas patient understanding of prognosis (P<0.05), better quality of life (P<0.01), and not being African American (P<0.05) were associated with patients having discussed their care preferences with family; higher education (P<0.001), and not being African American (P<0.01) were associated with having a living will. Patients with poor understanding of prognosis are less likely to discuss care preferences with family members, suggesting the importance of provider communication with patients regarding prognosis.

Decision control preferences (DCPs) may profoundly affect advance care planning (ACP) and communication. OBJECTIVES: To determine the DCPs of diverse, older adults and whether DCPs are associated with participant characteristics, ACP, and communication satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 146 participants were recruited from clinics and senior centers in San Francisco. We assessed DCPs using the control preferences scale: doctor makes all decisions (low), shares with doctor (medium), makes own decisions (high). We assessed associations between DCPs and demographics; prior advance directives; ability to make in-the-moment goals of care decisions; self-efficacy, readiness, and prior asked questions; and satisfaction with patient-doctor communication (on a five-point Likert scale), using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean age was 71 <c2><b1> 10 years, 53% were non-white, 47% completed an advance directive, and 70% made goals of care decisions. Of the sample, 18% had low DCPs, 33% medium, and 49% high.

CONCLUSION: Nearly one-fifth of diverse, older adults want doctors to make their medical decisions. Older age and lower readiness to ask questions were the only demographic variables significantly associated with low DCPs.

We previously developed and validated the values questions for Person-Centered Oncologic Care and Choices (P-COCC), a novel ACP intervention combining a patient values interview with an informational care goals video. OBJECTIVES: To pilot-study acceptability and, using randomization, explore potential utility of P-COCC. METHODS: Eligibility included patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer cared for at a comprehensive cancer center. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to P-COCC vs. video alone vs. usual care, respectively. Validated assessments of well-being and decisional conflict were completed. Participants in the P-COCC arm also completed three Likert scales (was the intervention helpful, comfortable, and recommended to others); a positive score of at least 1 of 3 indicated acceptability. RESULTS: Patients were screened from 9/2014 to 11/2016; 151 were consented and randomized, 99 whom completed study measures (most common attrition reason: disease progression or death). The primary aim was met: Among 33 participants, P-COCC was acceptable to 32 (97%, 95% CI: 0.84-0.99, P < 0.001). Mean distress scores (0-10) increased (0.43) in the P-COCC arm but decreased in the video-alone (-0.04) and usual-care (-0.21) arms (P = 0.03 and 0.04, P-COCC vs. video-alone and usual-care arms, respectively). There were no significant pre-post change scores on other measures of well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress) or intergroup differences in decisional conflict.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the attitudes and perceptions of patients with life-limiting illnesses, informal caregivers, doctors, nurses, and medical social workers regarding ACP in a multicultural family centric community. METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study, using focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. We used purposive sampling techniques to recruit 61 adults (15 doctors, 13 nurses, 5 medical social workers, 15 patients, and 13 caregivers) from multiple health care settings across the country. RESULTS: The participants are genuinely anxious about the implementation of ACP. They had positive and negative expectations of ACP. Many were confused about the legal framework for health care decision-making and expected ACP to be of limited value because family members, rather than the patient, were usually the key decision makers. CONCLUSION: A nuanced approach to ACP that considers the family network is required in multicultural family centric communities.

There have been few nationwide studies of ACP, especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ACP in two European countries and identify the associated factors. METHODS: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken in 2007 via representative nationwide Sentinel Networks of general practitioners (GPs) in Belgium and The Netherlands using similar standardized procedures. All GPs reported on each non-suddenly deceased patient in their practice. Our main outcome measure was whether or not ACP, that is, an agreement for medical treatment and/or medical decisions in the last phase of life in the case of the patient losing competence, was present. RESULTS: Among 1072 non-sudden deaths, ACP was done with 34% of patients and most often related to the forgoing of potential life-prolonging treatments in general (24%). In 8% of cases, ACP was made in consultation with the patient and in writing. In 23% of cases, care was planned with the patient's family only. Multivariate analysis revealed that ACP was more often made with patients if they were capable of decision making during the last three days of life (odds ratio [OR] 3.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-6.1), received treatment aimed at palliation in the last week (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.6-4.2), had contact with a GP in the last week (OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.7-4.1), died of cancer (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1-2.0), or died at home (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.5-3.0).

Prior research has demonstrated high surrogate stress, and that despite standards promoting substituted judgment, most patients do not want their surrogates to make pure substituted judgments for them. It is not known how best to help loved ones fulfill the surrogate role. OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of an intervention to help surrogate decision makers. METHODS: One hundred sixty-six patients (41% with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 59% with gastrointestinal cancers) and their surrogates at two university medical centers were randomized to an intensive nurse-directed discussion of the end-of-life decision control preferences of the patient (TAILORED) or a discussion of nutrition (CONTROL); 163 completed baseline interviews and underwent the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve patients died during follow-up and 137 dyads completed the study. Post-intervention, using all available data, TAILORED patients and surrogates became more likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making, that is, a balance of their own wishes and what the surrogate thinks best (adjusted odds compared with baseline for patients = 1.78, P = 0.04; adjusted odds for surrogates = 2.05, P = 0.03). CONTROL patients became 40% less likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making (P = 0.08), and CONTROL surrogates did not change significantly from baseline (adjusted odds = 1.44, P = 0.28).

How this affects doctors' decision making is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the influence of contradictory instructions on doctors' decisions. METHODS: All the generalists and internists in French-speaking Switzerland were mailed the questionnaire. Respondents (43.5%) evaluated three vignettes that described medical decisions for incapacitated patients. Each vignette was produced in four versions: one with an advance directive, one with a proxy opinion, one with both, and one with neither (control). In the first vignette, the directive and proxy agreed on the recommendation to forgo a medical intervention; in the second, the advance directive opposed, but the proxy favored the intervention; and in the third, the roles were reversed. Each doctor received one version of each vignette, attributed at random. The outcome variables were the doctor's decision to forgo the medical intervention and the rating of the decision as difficult. RESULTS: Written advance directives and proxy opinions significantly influenced doctors' decision making. When both were available and concordant, they reinforced each other (odds ratio [OR] of forgoing intervention 35.7, P < 0.001 compared with no instruction). When the directive and proxy disagreed, the resulting effect was to forgo the intervention (ORs 2.1 and 2.2 for the two discordant vignettes, both P < 0.001). Discordance between instructions was associated with increased odds of doctors rating the decision as difficult (both ORs 2.0, P <e2><89><a4> 0.001).

Despite the prohibition, some physicians say they have used drugs to intentionally end a patient's life. OBJECTIVES: To provide some empirical grounding for the ongoing debate. METHODS: Using data from the End-of-Life in France survey (a representative sample of 15,000 deaths that occurred in December 2009, questionnaires completed anonymously by the physicians who had certified the deaths), we selected all the cases where the physician had used one or more drugs to intentionally end a patient's life and compared the decisions and decision-making process with the conditions imposed by the French law for decisions to withhold or withdraw life-supporting treatments and by the Belgian law on euthanasia. RESULTS: Of the 36 cases analyzed, four situations seemed to be deliberate acts after explicit requests from the patients, and only two seemed to fulfill the eligibility and due care conditions of the Belgian euthanasia law. Decisions made without any discussion with patients were quite common, and we observed inadequate labeling, frequent signs of ambivalence (artificial feeding and hydration not withdrawn, types of drug used), and little interprofessional consultation. Where the patient had requested euthanasia, the emotional burden on the physician was heavy. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the pressing need for a clarification of the concepts involved among health professionals, patients, and society at large, and better training and support for physicians.",2015,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.02.021,50,2,208-215,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and End of life and Decision Making and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and France and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data and *Euthanasia, Active/methods/psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Physicians/psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Suicide, Assisted/psychology/statistics & numerical data and physician-assisted deaths",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to clarify the level of the family's achievement of maintaining hope and preparing for death and the professional's behavior related to their evaluations. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymous, nationwide survey was conducted involving 663 bereaved families of cancer patients who had been admitted to 100 palliative care units throughout Japan. RESULTS: A total of 454 family members returned the questionnaire (effective response rate, 68%). Overall, 73% of families reported that they could both maintain hope and prepare for the patient's death. The independent determinants of the family's agreement in reference to the professional's behavior are pacing the explanation with the family's preparation; coordinating patient and family discussions about priorities while the patient was in better condition; willingness to discuss alternative medicine; maximizing efforts to maintain the patient's physical strength (e.g., meals, rehabilitation); discussing specific, achievable goals; and not saying ""I can no longer do anything for the patient."" CONCLUSION: About 20% of family members reported that they could neither ""maintain hope nor prepare for death."" A recommended care strategy for medical professionals could include 1) discussing achievable goals and preparing for the future and pacing explanation with the family's preparation, 2) willingness to discuss alternative medicine, 3) maximizing efforts to maintain the patient's physical strength, and 4) avoid saying they could do nothing further for the patient.",2013,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.014,45,5,848-858,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Decision Making and Prevalence and Adaptation, Psychological and Survival Rate and Japan/epidemiology and Family/*psychology and *Attitude to Death and *Bereavement and Terminal Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Hope and Neoplasms/mortality/nursing/*psychology and Nurses/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Physicians/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2013/05//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To operationalize this paradigm, we created an easy-to-use ACP website (prepareforyourcare.org) based on a theoretical framework of behavior change and pilot-tested its efficacy to engage older adults in ACP. METHODS: At baseline and 1 week after viewing the PREPARE website, we assessed behavior change in ACP by using a validated survey that includes Process Measures (knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and readiness, 5-point Likert scales) and Action Measures (yes/no whether an ACP behavior was completed). We also assigned participants into behavior change stages (i.e., precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance) and determined the percentage of participants who moved from precontemplation at baseline to higher stages at 1 week. We also assessed PREPARE ease-of-use (10-point scale, 10 being the easiest). Changes were assessed with Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 68.4 years (SD 6.6), and 65% were nonwhite. Behavior Change Process Measures average Likert scores increased from 3.1 (0.9) to 3.7 (0.7), P < 0.001. Action Measures did not change significantly. However, precontemplation significantly decreased for most actions (e.g., talking to doctor about desired medical care, 61% to 35%, P < 0.003), with a mean decrease of 21% (range, 16%-33%). PREPARE was rated a nine of ten (<c2><b1>1.9) for ease-of-use. CONCLUSION: A new, patient-centered ACP website that focuses on preparing patients for communication and decision making significantly improves engagement in the process of ACP and behavior change.

Respect for patient autonomy requires physicians to involve their patients in this decision making. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the involvement of advanced lung cancer patients and their families in ELD making and compare their actual involvement with their previously stated preferences for involvement. METHODS: Patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer were recruited by physicians in 13 hospitals and regularly interviewed between diagnosis and death. When the patient died, the specialist and general practitioner were asked to fill in a questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients who died within 18 months of diagnosis were studied. An ELD was made in 52 cases (61%). According to the treating physician, half of the competent patients were not involved in the ELD making, one-quarter shared the decision with the physician, and one-quarter made the decision themselves. In the incompetent patients, family was involved in half of cases. Half of the competent patients were involved less than they had previously preferred, and 7% were more involved. Almost all of the incompetent patients had previously stated that they wanted their family involved in case of incompetence, but half did not achieve this. CONCLUSION: In half of the cases, advanced lung cancer patients-or their families in cases of incompetence-were not involved in ELD making, despite the wishes of most of them.

How prehospital providers (paramedics and emergency medical technicians) manage emergency calls near death influences how and where people will die, if their end-of-life choices are upheld and how appropriately health care resources are used. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe how prehospital providers assess and manage end-of-life emergency calls. METHODS: In-depth and in-person interviews were conducted with 43 prehospital providers. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and entered into ATLAS.ti for data management and coding. Qualitative data analysis involved systematic and axial coding to identify and describe emergent themes. RESULTS: Four themes illustrate the nature and dynamics of emergency end-of-life calls: 1) multifocal assessment (e.g., of the patient, family, and environment), 2) family responses (e.g., emotional, behavioral), 3) conflicts (e.g., missing do-not-resuscitate order, patient-family conflicts), and 4) management of the dying process (e.g., family witnessed resuscitation or asking family to leave, decisions about hospital transport). After a rapid comprehensive multifocal assessment, family responses and the existence of conflicts mediate decision making about possible interventions. CONCLUSION: The importance of managing symptom crises and stress responses that accompany the dying process is particularly germane to quality care at life's end. The results suggest the importance of increasing prehospital providers' abilities to uphold advance directives and patients' end-of-life wishes while managing family emotions near death.",2015,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.03.001,50,3,328-334,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Death and Stress, Psychological and Environment and Interviews as Topic and emergency medical services and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Autonomy and Emergency Medical Services/*methods and Family/psychology and advance care planning and terminal care and End-of-life decision making and Conflict, Psychological and emergency medical technicians and Emergency Medical Technicians/*psychology and Resuscitation Orders/psychology and Terminal Care/*methods/*psychology",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and to palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients who may have limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits. We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform decision making of patients and families in collaboration with their health care practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions.",2012,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.05.002,44,2,301-306,eng,1873-6513 0885-3924,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Male and Aged and Patient Satisfaction and Quality of Life and Catheterization and Palliative Care/*methods and *Drainage/adverse effects and Adenocarcinoma/complications/surgery and Dyspnea/etiology/therapy and Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/surgery and Pleural Effusion, Malignant/etiology/psychology/*therapy",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,J Pain Symptom Manage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Often, palliative care teams are tasked with weaving through opinions, emotions, and goals in search for an amenable solution. Occasionally, these situations get challenging. We present the case of an elderly Chinese Singaporean with metastatic cancer, whose family and physicians had conflicting goals of care. The former was adamant on treating the patient's disease with an untested drug, whereas the latter aimed to treat his symptoms with more conventional medication. Drug-drug interactions prevented treatment with both. Beginning with a discussion of the patient's best interest, we delve into the Singaporean context to show how culture affects medical decision making. Confucianism and filial piety are the values on which this family's workings were based. In an analysis of what this entails, we attempt to explain the significant and assertive family involvement in the decision-making process and their insistence on using novel medications, having exhausted conventional interventions. Within this mix were Western influences, too. Through the Internet, family members have become more informed and empowered in decision making, wresting the traditional paternalistic role of physicians in favor of ""patient autonomy.""

Two cohorts were compared: CH patients (with <e2><89><a5>2 CH claims) were propensity score matched with 4 non-headache controls, all with continuous enrollment for 12 months before and after the date of first CH claim or matched period among controls. RESULTS: CH patients (N = 7589) were mainly male (57.4%) and 35-64 years old (73.2%), with significantly more claims for comorbid conditions vs controls (N = 30,341), including depressive disorders (19.8% vs 10.0%), sleep disturbances (19.7% vs 9.1%), anxiety disorders (19.2% vs 8.7%), and tobacco use disorders (12.8% vs 5.3%), with 2.5 times greater odds of suicidal ideation (all P < .0001).

BACKGROUND: Patients with migraine can be treated with acute and prophylactic therapies. Current treatment options for migraine prophylaxis are associated with poor tolerability and low adherence and persistence. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan((R)) Research Databases to identify adults in the United States with a migraine diagnosis who initiated migraine prophylactic medication (index event) between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011. Prescribed prophylactic medications evaluated included topiramate, beta-blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. Patients were required to have 12 months of pre- and post-index continuous enrollment. Patient characteristics, migraine-specific prescribed prophylactic treatment patterns (including gaps in therapy, treatment switches, and additions of index medications), and prescribed acute medication utilization were assessed. RESULTS: The study population comprised 107,122 patients, with 52,275 (49%) initiating topiramate, 22,658 (21%) initiating beta-blockers, and 32,189 (30%) initiating tricyclic antidepressants. Mean (SD) age was 41 (12) years and 83% were female. Persistence with migraine prophylactic medication was low; 81% of patients had gaps of >90 days in their migraine prophylaxis in the first year. The gap in therapy occurred early in treatment (mean, 95 days), and only 10% of patients restarted prophylactic therapy within that year. Switching from index medication to another prophylactic medication or adding prophylaxis was uncommon (13% and 5%, respectively). One year after initiating prophylaxis, 65% of patients were not receiving any prophylactic therapies. Most patients initiating migraine prophylaxis also utilized acute treatments (81%); opioid use was more frequent than triptan use (53% vs 48%) and was common (40%) among patients without other chronic pain conditions (eg, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and lower back pain).

Organization of such treatment programs has never been described before. With this paper we aim to describe the implementation and feasibility of an accelerated cross-speciality management program, to describe the collaboration between the involved specialties and to report the patient flow during the first 2 years after implementation. Finally, we aim to stimulate discussions about optimal management of TN. METHODS: Based on collaboration between neurologists, neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons a standardized program for TN was implemented in May 2012 at the Danish Headache Center (DHC). First out-patient visit and subsequent 3.0 Tesla MRI scan was booked in an accelerated manner. The MRI scan was performed according to a special TN protocol developed for this program. Patients initially referred to neurosurgery were re-directed to DHC for pre-surgical evaluation of diagnosis and optimization of medical treatment. Follow-up was 2 years with fixed visits where medical treatment and indication for neurosurgery was continuously evaluated. Scientific data was collected in a structured and prospective manner. RESULTS: From May 2012 to April 2014, 130 patients entered the accelerated program. Waiting time for the first out-patient visit was 42 days. Ninety-four percent of the patients had a MRI performed according to the special protocol after a mean of 37 days. Within 2 years follow-up 35% of the patients were referred to neurosurgery after a median time of 65 days. Five scientific papers describing demographics, clinical characteristics and neuroanatomical abnormalities were published. CONCLUSION: The described cross-speciality management program proved to be feasible and to have acceptable waiting times for referral and highly specialized work-up of TN patients in a public tertiary referral centre for headache and facial pain.

In this manuscript, we outline ARMR research methods and report baseline data describing an initial cohort of ARMR participants. METHODS: Adults with any International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) diagnosis were prospectively enrolled from one of the 8 participating headache specialty centers. At baseline, ARMR participants complete web-based questionnaires, clinicians enter the participant's ICHD diagnoses, an optional blood specimen is collected, and neuroimaging data are uploaded to the ARMR neuroimaging repository. Participants maintain the ARMR daily headache diary longitudinally and follow-up questionnaires are completed by participants every 3 months. EHR data are integrated into the ARMR database from a subset of ARMR sites. Herein, we describe the ARMR methodology and report the summary data from ARMR participants who had, from February 2016 to May 2019, completed at least 1 baseline questionnaire from which data are reported in this manuscript. Descriptive statistics are used to provide an overview of patient's sociodemographics, headache diagnoses, headache characteristics, most bothersome symptoms other than headache, headache-related disability, comorbidities, and treatments. RESULTS: Data were available from 996 ARMR participants, enrolled from Mayo Clinic Arizona, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, University of Utah, University of Colorado, Thomas Jefferson University, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Georgetown University Medical Center, and DENT Neurological Institute. Among ARMR participants, 86.7% (n = 864) were female and the mean age at the time of enrollment was 48.6 years (<c2><b1>13.9; range 18-84). The most common provider-reported diagnosis was chronic migraine (n = 622), followed by migraine without aura (n = 327), migraine with aura (n = 196), and medication overuse headache (n = 65). Average headache frequency was 19.1 <c2><b1> 9.2 days per month (n = 751), with 68% reporting at least 15 headache days per month. Sensitivity to light was the most frequent (n = 222) most bothersome symptom overall, other than headache, but when present, cognitive dysfunction was most frequently (n = 157) the most bothersome symptom other than headache. Average migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) score was 52 <c2><b1> 49 (n = 760), (very severe headache-related disability); however, 17% of the ARMR population had MIDAS scores suggesting ""no"" or ""mild"" disability. The most common non-headache health issues were allergies (n = 364), back pain (n = 296), neck pain (n = 296), depression (n = 292), and anxiety (n = 278). Nearly 85% (n = 695) of patients were using preventive medications and 24.7% were using non-medication preventive therapy (eg, vitamins and neuromodulation). The most common preventive medication classes were neurotoxins, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, vitamins/supplements, and anticalcitonin gene-related peptide ligand or receptor-targeted monoclonal antibodies. Nearly 90% (n = 734) of ARMR participants was taking medications to treat migraine attacks, with the most common classes being triptans, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiemetics, acetaminophen, and combination analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: ARMR is a source of real-world patient data, biospecimens, and brain neuroimaging data that provides comprehensive insight into patients with migraine and other headache types being seen in headache specialty clinics in the United States. ARMR data will allow for longitudinal and advanced analytics that are expected to lead to a better characterization of patient heterogeneity, healthcare resource utilization, identification of endophenotypes, factors that predict treatment outcomes and clinical course, and ultimately advance the field toward precision headache medicine.",2020,10.1111/head.13688,60,2,337-347,eng,1526-4610 0017-8748,"precision medicine and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Aged, 80 and over and Self Report and Severity of Illness Index and Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data and registry and real world evidence and headache and migraine and Registries/*statistics & numerical data and *Headache Disorders, Secondary/complications/physiopathology/therapy and *Migraine with Aura/complications/physiopathology/therapy and *Migraine without Aura/complications/physiopathology/therapy and Biological Specimen Banks/statistics & numerical data and biorepository and Cognitive Dysfunction/etiology/physiopathology and Neuroimaging/statistics & numerical data and Photophobia/etiology/physiopathology",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Headache,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To assess the congruence between patient expectations and actual practice regarding education and decision making at the time a triptan is prescribed. METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional survey was performed by headache fellow members of the American Headache Society Headache Fellows Research Consortium at their respective tertiary care headache clinics. Migraine patients who were new patients to the headache clinic and who were current triptan users (use within prior 3 months and for <e2><89><a5>1 year) or past triptan users (no use within 6 months; prior use within 2 years) completed questionnaires that assessed the education they received and their role in decision making at the time a triptan was first prescribed as well as their desire for education and participation in decision making when a triptan is prescribed. RESULTS: Consistent with patient preference, most participants received the majority of their education about the triptan from the prescriber's office (70.2%). In descending rank order, participants most desired to be informed about how to decide if a triptan should be taken, when during the course of migraine a triptan should be taken, possible side effects, cost, and how to obtain refills. Regarding side effects, most participants preferred to receive education about the most common side effects of a triptan rather than addressing all possible side effects. Regarding triptan dosing, participants desired to be informed in descending order of importance about taking other medications with triptans, how many doses can be taken for each migraine, how many doses can be taken each week/month, what to do if the triptan does not work, and the triptan mechanism of action. The vast majority of participants (92%) preferred that the decision to prescribe a triptan be a joint decision between the patient and the provider. In actual practice, participants were not as involved in decision making as they would like to be, with patients reporting that the prescriber was the sole decision maker 55.1% of the time. Participants had confidence in their providers (87.7%) and generally felt they did a good job educating them about the triptan (71.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, it is clear that patients prefer the shared model approach to medical decision making in regards to the prescription of triptans. The majority of patients received education that was generally consistent with their desires. Patients preferred that the prescribing provider be the primary source of information. The most desired educational topics included when/if a triptan should be taken, the number of times a triptan can be taken for a single migraine, co-administration with other acute medications, and the most common side effects.

However, the rate of diagnosis for headache disorders is extremely low, possibly due to the relative complexity of headache subtypes and diagnostic criteria. The use of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) seems to be a better choice to solve this problem. METHODS: We developed a headache CDSS based on ICHD-3 beta and validated it in a prospective study that included 543 headache patients from the International Headache Center at the Chinese PLA General hospital, Beijing, China. RESULTS: We found that the CDSS correctly recognized 159/160 (99.4%) of migraine without aura, 36/36 (100%) of migraine with aura, 20/21 (95.2%) of chronic migraine, and 37/59 (62.7%) of probable migraine. This system also correctly identified 157/180 (87.2%) of patients with tension-type headache (TTH), of which infrequent episodic TTH was diagnosed in 12/13 (92.3%), frequent episodic TTH was diagnosed in 99/101 (98.0%), chronic TTH in 18/20 (90.0%), and probable TTH in 28/46 (60.9%). The correct diagnostic rates of cluster headache and new daily persistent headache (NDPH) were 90.0% and 100%, respectively. In addition, the system recognized 32/32 (100%) of patients with medication overuse headache. CONCLUSIONS: With high diagnostic accuracy for most of the primary and some types of secondary headaches, this system can be expected to help general practitioners at primary hospitals improve diagnostic accuracy and thereby reduce the burden of headache in China.",2014,10.1186/1129-2377-15-40,15,1,40,eng,1129-2377 1129-2369,"Humans and Chronic Disease and Prospective Studies and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards and International Classification of Diseases/*standards and Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards and Asians/ethnology and China/ethnology and Headache Disorders, Primary/*diagnosis/*ethnology",NA,NA,2014/06/16/,J Headache Pain,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yin_2015_Thjoofheanpa,JOUR,A clinical decision support system for the diagnosis of probable migraine and probable tension-type headache based on case-based reasoning,"Yin, Ziming and Dong, Zhao and Lu, Xudong and Yu, Shengyuan and Chen, Xiaoyan and Duan, Huilong",The journal of headache and pain,"BACKGROUND: The overlap between probable migraine (PM) and probable tension-type headache (PTTH) often confuses physicians in clinical practice. Although clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been proven to be helpful in the diagnosis of primary headaches, the existing guideline-based headache disorder CDSSs do not perform adequately due to this overlapping issue. Thus, in this study, a CDSS based on case-based reasoning (CBR) was developed in order to solve this problem. METHODS: First, a case library consisting of 676 clinical cases, 56.95% of which had been diagnosed with PM and 43.05% of which had been diagnosed with PTTH, was constructed, screened by a three-member panel, and weighted by engineers. Next, the resulting case library was used to diagnose current cases based on their similarities to the previous cases. The test dataset was composed of an additional 222 historical cases, 76.1% of which had been diagnosed with PM and 23.9% of which had been diagnosed with PTTH. The cases that comprised the case library as well as the test dataset were actual clinical cases obtained from the International Headache Center in Chinese PLA General Hospital. RESULTS: The results indicated that the PM and PTTH recall rates were equal to 97.02% and 77.78%, which were 34.31% and 16.91% higher than that of the guideline-based CDSS, respectively. Furthermore, the PM and PTTH precision rates were equal to 93.14% and 89.36%, which were7.09% and 15.68% higher than that of the guideline-based CDSS, respectively. Comparing CBR CDSS and guideline-based CDSS, the p-value of PM diagnoses was equal to 0.019, while that of PTTH diagnoses was equal to 0.002, which indicated that there was a significant difference between the two approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results indicated that the CBR CDSS developed in this study diagnosed PM and PTTH with a high degree of accuracy and performed better than the guideline-based CDSS. This system could be used as a diagnostic tool to assist general practitioners in distinguishing PM from PTTH.",2015,10.1186/s10194-015-0512-x,16,NA,29,eng,1129-2377 1129-2369,"Humans and Diagnosis, Differential and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and Migraine Disorders/*diagnosis and Tension-Type Headache/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2015/04/01/,J Headache Pain,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quality follow-up registries may provide the necessary clinical data; however, their design is not focused on a specific research aim, which poses challenges on the data analysis strategy. Here, machine-learning was used to identify early parameters that provide information about a future development of persistent pain in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data of 288 patients were queried from a registry based on the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of RA. Unsupervised data analyses identified the following 3 distinct patient subgroups: low-, median-, and high-persistent pain intensity. Next, supervised machine-learning, implemented as random forests followed by computed ABC analysis-based item categorization, was used to select predictive parameters among 21 different demographic, patient-rated, and objective clinical factors. The selected parameters were used to train machine-learned algorithms to assign patients pain-related subgroups (1000 random resamplings, 2/3 training, and 1/3 test data). Algorithms trained with 3-month data of the patient global assessment and health assessment questionnaire provided pain group assignment at a balanced accuracy of 70%. When restricting the predictors to objective clinical parameters of disease severity, swollen joint count and tender joint count acquired at 3 months provided a balanced accuracy of RA of 59%.

Few research studies have examined pain assessment biases in an experimental setting. This study employs innovative virtual human technology to achieve greater experimental control. A lens model design was used to capture decision-making policies at the idiographic and nomothetic level. Seventy-five undergraduates viewed virtual humans (VH) that varied in sex, race, age, and pain expression. Participants provided computerized ratings with Visual Analogue Scales on the VH's pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, negative mood, coping, and need for medical treatment. Idiographic analyses revealed that individuals used pain expression most frequently as a significant cue. Nomothetic analyses showed that higher pain expression VH and female VH were viewed as having higher pain intensity, higher pain unpleasantness, greater negative mood, worse coping, and a greater need to seek medical treatment than lower pain expression VH and male VH, respectively. Older VH were viewed as having worse coping and a greater need to seek medical treatment than younger VH.

Diagnostic criteria for CM remain controversial, and this could lead to undertreatment of CM. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical profiles of CM and to field test the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3<ce><b2> criteria (ICHD-3<ce><b2>) and Expert Opinion criteria (EO) for CM application. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of CrH patients in our headache clinic during the period. Eligible patients were selected from CrH population based on Silberstein and Lipton criteria (S-L) for CM, and meanwhile fulfilled with migraine days at least 8 days/month. Then we evaluated the characteristics of clinic profiles and outcomes between patients diagnosed CM using ICHD-3<ce><b2> and EO criteria. Field tested the CM criteria Of ICHD-3<ce><b2> and EO. RESULTS: In a total of 710 CrH patients , 261 (36.8 %) were recruited with CM based on both S-L criteria and fulfilled at least 8 migraine days/month. Be understandable, all the 261 patients met the EO criteria, and only 185 (70.9 %) met ICHD-3<ce><b2> for CM. For the 76 patients who met EO but not ICHD-3<ce><b2>, 70 had atypical migraine attacks (probable migraine, PM), and another 6 had typical migraine attacks but less than a total history of 5 attacks. Although 173 (66.3 %) were concurrent with medication overuse, just one patient overused triptans and none used ergot agents. Clinical features were not significantly different between the ICHD-3<ce><b2> and EO criteria groups (P > 0.05), and neither were outcomes of prophylaxis (P = 0.966). Total migraine prophylaxis effectiveness was 73 %. CONCLUSION: Migraine-specific analgesics are rarely used in China, permitting patients with PM to avail themselves of ""migraine days"" is a reasonable accommodation for this difficult condition. In our hands, use of the new EO criteria for diagnosis of CM increases the sensitivity and maintains the specificity of decision making, and therefore should be adopted in CM management practice.",2016,10.1186/s10194-016-0678-x,17,1,85,eng,1129-2377 1129-2369,"China and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Chronic Disease and Chronic disease and Aged, 80 and over and Expert Testimony and Headache Disorders, Secondary/chemically induced/*classification and International classification of diseases and International Classification of Diseases/*classification and Migraine Disorders/*classification/drug therapy and Migraine disorders/classifications and Migraine disorders/diagnosis",NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,J Headache Pain,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although many studies have reported no significant differences between primary headache patients and the general population in terms of abnormal neuroimaging findings, others have shown that neuroimaging may be employed to rule out secondary causes of headache that could impact morbidity and mortality. This issue remains under debate. Thus, the present study compared the neuroimaging findings of headache patients and healthy controls. Methods - This study recruited 1070 healthy controls and 1070 primary headache patients from the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The primary headache patients were diagnosed by computerized clinical decision support systems, and re-diagnosed by a specialist. All participants were assessed with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The neuroimaging findings were classified as significant abnormalities, non-significant abnormalities, or normal. Results - All the significant abnormalities were found using MRI scans. Significant abnormalities were identified in 4 primary headache patients (0.58%) and 5 healthy controls (0.73%); the rate of significant abnormalities was not significant different between both groups (P > .05).

Sufficient controlled studies regarding the need for individual parts of the integrative care approach are missing as yet. Recommendations are therefore at least partly based on personal experiences. It seems to be unambiguous that patients should be referred to a specialized headache center offering such a program instead of being sent sequentially to various medical specialists. The extent and kind of required therapy (e.g. personal consultation versus group sessions) is not known yet. All patients should learn relaxation training, although it is unclear yet which training is the best for which patient.

The proposed tracker is intended for use in non-interventional research to evaluate disease burden in episodic migraine and chronic migraine patients as assessed by demographic and clinical characteristics and health resource utilization in an integrated delivery network setting. The proposed tracker is not intended for commercial purposes. BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Studies of patient-clinician interactions suggest that effective medical communication may help address these issues. METHODS: Four migraine practice leaders, an epidemiologist with extensive migraine experience, and a measurement expert took part in a modified Delphi panel process to identify data elements that could be collected from people with migraine through a smartphone-based migraine tracker. Importantly, the proposed tracker would not be intended to replace the patient-clinician encounter but to support the encounter through enabling the patient to document migraine symptoms and experiences in a timely and accurate manner for sharing with a clinician as part of a broader face-to-face discussion. The panel reviewed questions derived from the existing migraine diaries in the public domain, those used in clinical trials, and patient-centric surveys assessing the impact of migraine on physical function and other related concepts. Key considerations included identification of the most clinically useful data elements for a shared communication tool for people with migraine under the care of a clinician. The panel also identified numerous functionality requirements for such a tool and provided recommendations on the most effective way to present results to a clinician. RESULTS: The expert panel opined that people with migraine may value the ability to capture a relatively broad range of information for their own migraine-tracking purposes, while clinicians will likely find greater value in a small set of data relevant to the management of migraine. The panel identified the 3 most essential concepts in categories of data for a clinician, for which they coined the term ""The 3 Fs"": Frequency of days with headache; Frequency of acute medication usage; and Functional impairment. Information on the frequency of days with headache was felt to combine with the information on the frequency of acute medication usage to provide essential insights into current migraine management strategy and its outcomes, and to assist considerations of preventive measures. Functional impairment was treated as an effective surrogate for headache severity and was assessed based on the following: degree of difficulty in performing activities of daily living, impact on absenteeism (taking leave from work or cancelling/avoiding other activities) and presenteeism (performing work or other daily activities, with reduced productivity/capability), and amount of rest required as a result of a migraine attack. The modified Delphi panel process resulted in the selection of 13 questions in 8 categories to elicit sufficient and meaningful data comprising headache occurrence, symptoms, daily/preventive and as-needed/acute medication usage, triggers, ability to concentrate, and functional impairment. The panel also agreed that the tracker should generate 2 distinct reports: one for people with migraine that would include a wider range of data about symptoms and perceived triggers, and a targeted report for the clinician that would place prime emphasis on the 3 Fs for aggregating the results of each headache occurrence and the trend over time. CONCLUSIONS: A system that easily captures critical data elements about migraine, with specific feedback displays for patients to share with clinicians during live discussions, may offer some benefit to people with migraine and their clinicians by facilitating more objective communication and optimizing management. The tracker's output may enable people with migraine to track a wide range of data for their own purposes, allowing them to better understand their condition, while a synthesized view of the selected data may support more informed clinical decision-making for the clinician and individualized, evidence-based discussion with the patient. As a result, this shared decision-making tool may enable patients to more accurately convey essential migraine information during live patient-clinician discussions to drive improved management and patient outcomes.",2018,10.1111/head.13426,58,9,1358-1372,eng,1526-4610 0017-8748,Humans and Telemedicine and Medical Records and Disease Management and Delphi Technique and smartphone and *Patient Reported Outcome Measures and *Mobile Applications and *Smartphone and Health Communication/*methods and app and medical communication and headache and migraine and Migraine Disorders/epidemiology/*therapy and patient-reported outcome (PRO),NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,Headache,NA,NA,NA,NA
Burch_2021_Head,JOUR,"The prevalence and impact of migraine and severe headache in the United States: Updated age, sex, and socioeconomic-specific estimates from government health surveys","Burch, Rebecca and Rizzoli, Paul and Loder, Elizabeth",Headache,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate, up-to-date estimates of the burden of migraine and severe headache are important for evidence-based decision-making about workforce needs and the distribution of health resources. We used data from US government health surveys to report the prevalence, trends, and impact of this condition by age, sex, and poverty status. METHODS: We identified the most recent, publicly available summary statistics from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. We extracted and compiled relevant information from each study, with an emphasis on sex, age, and economic-related statistics. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of migraine and severe headache in the United States has remained stable over many years. In 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence was 15.9% across all adults. The sex ratio also remains stable, with 21% of women and 10.7% of men affected. Migraine continues to be an important public health problem, accounting for roughly 4 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2016, when headache was the fifth most common reason for an ED visit overall and the third most common reason for ED visits in females 15-64. Migraine also accounted for over 4.3 million office visits. Many adults with migraine or severe headaches are disadvantaged. In 2018, for example, roughly 40% of US adults with migraine were unemployed, and a similar proportion were classified as poor or ""near poor."" Roughly one in five had no health insurance and about a third had a high school education or less. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine and severe headaches are a serious public health issue in the United States, with the highest impact in women of childbearing age and those of lower socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic disadvantages also are highly prevalent among those with headaches. The economic consequences of the current coronavirus pandemic are likely to exacerbate all of these inequities. Increased attention to this high impact chronic pain condition, and improved funding for treatment provision and research, are warranted to reduce the future burden of disease.",2021,10.1111/head.14024,61,1,60-68,eng,1526-4610 0017-8748,SARS-CoV-2 and epidemiology and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Health Surveys and determinants of health and Health Care Surveys and Prevalence and United States/epidemiology and *Health Status Disparities and socioeconomic and COVID-19/*complications and headache and migraine and prevalence and *Cost of Illness and Headache/epidemiology and Migraine Disorders/*epidemiology,NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Headache,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: For many decades, behavioral treatment of headaches has been evaluated via participants completing paper diaries recording their headaches and associated phenomena. There is some limited evidence supporting the reliability and validity of paper diaries, and criticisms have been offered such as the large amount of effort involved for both participants and researchers. This study evaluates a new e-diary that will operate on virtually any device that can connect to the internet, and yields 5 of the recommended outcome measures. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-one participants (146 females, 35 males) were allocated to 2 groups, e-diaries vs paper diaries, via a disproportionate stratified allocation process. The e-diary group included 4 subgroups based on the technology available to the participant, and the paper diary group included 2 subgroups, one parallel to the e-dairies (short paper), and one representative of traditional paper diaries (long paper). The study commenced with individuals who had self-identified as headache and migraine sufferers attending a screening session that included headache diagnosis. Participants who met selection criteria then completed the Headache Disability Inventory and a measure of quality of life (SF-36) to assess the convergent validity of the diaries, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales to assess the discriminant validity of the diaries. They also completed a Measure of Acceptance Questionnaire. Participants then completed the headache diaries over the next 30 days. Finally, participants completed for a second time the questionnaires completed previously. RESULTS: The 5 outcome measures - headache frequency, peak intensity, average intensity, duration, and medication usage - were found to have strong test-retest reliability (r, 0.68-0.79), for all 3 types of diary. These 5 measures for the e-diaries were shown to have good convergent validity via comparison with scores on the Headache Disability Inventory (r, 0.46-0.55) and SF-36 (r, -0.35 to -0.49), and divergent validity via comparison with scores on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (r, 0.10-0.25). The long-paper diaries had significantly higher missing data scores (M = 15.20, SD = 14.84) and more errors in data completion (M = 5.47, SD = 3.28) than the e-diaries and short-paper diaries (P < .05). In addition, the long-paper diaries were evaluated by the participants as more burdensome and significantly less easy to use than the e-diaries and short-paper diaries.

Spatz_2007_Pain,JOUR,Decision analysis of medical and surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia: how patient evaluations of benefits and risks affect the utility of treatment decisions,"Spatz, A. L. and Zakrzewska, J. M. and Kay, E. J.",Pain,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare form of neuropathic facial pain characterised by severe, paroxysmal pains in the face. Little is known about the decision process in treatment of TN, and management with anti-epileptic drugs or surgical procedures carries risks of side effects, recurrence and complications. One hundred fifty-six previously diagnosed TN patients completed an adapted time-trade-off utility measurement questionnaire to ascertain how they valued the potential outcomes from various surgical and medical treatments. The decision analysis revealed that microvascular decompression surgery (MVD) offered the best chance of improved quality of life or highest maximum expected utility (MEU). MVD (MEU=16.08 out of a possible 20) was closely followed by balloon compression (MEU=15.97), percutaneous glycerol rhizolysis (MEU=15.61) and then radiofrequency thermocoagulation (MEU=14.93). Medication offered the least optimal chance of improved quality of life (MEU=14.61). The difference between the highest (MVD) and lowest scoring treatments (medication) was 7.3% (1.46/20). These results were sensitive to some utility values, meaning the preferred treatment is changed by the values patients assign to outcomes. As surgical techniques narrowly offer the highest chance of maximising patient quality of life, all patients with TN should consider surgery. However, surgery is not right for everyone, and patients should be informed about their full range of choices. Treatment decisions must take place after careful consideration of the values patients place on benefits and risks of treatment.",2007,10.1016/j.pain.2007.02.009,131,3,302-310,eng,1872-6623 0304-3959,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and *Quality of Life and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods and *Patient Satisfaction and Risk Assessment/*methods and Neurosurgical Procedures and Trigeminal Neuralgia/*diagnosis/*therapy",NA,NA,2007/10//undefined,Pain,NA,NA,NA,NA

This prospective, international, multicenter study slightly modified and further evaluated the validity of the CRPS Severity Score (CSS), a continuous index of CRPS severity. Using a prospective design, medical evaluations were conducted in 156 patients with CRPS to compare changes over time in CSS scores between patients initiating a new treatment program and patients on stable treatment regimens. New vs stable categorizations were supported by greater changes in pain and function in the former. Results indicated that CSS values in the stable CRPS treatment group exhibited much less change over time relative to the new treatment group, with intraclass correlations nearly twice as large in the former. A calculated smallest real difference value revealed that a change in the CSS of <e2><89><a5>4.9 scale points would indicate real differences in CRPS symptomatology (with 95% confidence). Across groups, larger changes in CRPS features on the CSS over time were associated in the expected direction with greater changes in pain intensity, fatigue, social functioning, ability to engage in physical roles, and general well-being. The overall pattern of findings further supports the validity of the CSS as a measure of CRPS severity and suggests it may prove useful in clinical monitoring and outcomes research.",2017,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000927,158,8,1430-1436,eng,1872-6623 0304-3959,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Severity of Illness Index and Diagnosis, Differential and Pain Measurement/methods and Complex Regional Pain Syndromes/*diagnosis/*physiopathology and Pain/*physiopathology",NA,NA,2017/08//undefined,Pain,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study evaluated the validity and potential utility of a continuous type score to index severity of CRPS. Psychometric and medical evaluations were conducted in 114 CRPS patients and 41 non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients. Based on the presence/absence of 17 clinically-assessed signs and symptoms of CRPS, an overall CRPS Severity Score (CSS) was derived. The CSS discriminated well between CRPS and non-CRPS patients (p<.001), and displayed strong associations with dichotomous CRPS diagnoses using both IASP diagnostic criteria (Eta=0.69) and proposed revised criteria (Eta=0.77-0.88). Higher CSS was associated with significantly higher clinical pain intensity, distress, and functional impairments, as well as greater bilateral temperature asymmetry and thermal perception abnormalities (p's<.05). In an archival prospective dataset, increases in anxiety and depression from pre-surgical baseline to 4 weeks post-knee arthroplasty were found to predict significantly higher CSS at 6- and 12-month follow-up (p's<.05).

BACKGROUND: Several novel medications that target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway are approved to treat people with migraine. Given that the CGRP pathway also plays a role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, determining the baseline rates of vascular events among people with migraine will help inform the safety of these novel medications. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients 18- to 64-year-old patients with migraine were identified from the MarketScan((R)) database (January 2013-December 2017) and were categorized into 4 vascular risk categories: migraine with aura; and high, medium, and low vascular risk. Event rates (per 1000 person-years [PY]) for 19 vascular events were estimated overall, by risk category, and by baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Among 1,195,696 patients with migraine, 4.8% (57,853/1,195,696) had migraine with aura, and 2.8% (33,949/1,195,696), 15.5% (184,782/1,195,696), and 77.9% (931,059/1,195,696) were at high, medium, and low risk of vascular events, respectively. Rates of ischemic stroke (per 1000 PY) were 5.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0, 5.2) overall, 8.6 (95% CI: 8.1, 9.1) for patients with migraine aura, 47.2 (95% CI: 45.3, 49.0) in the high-risk group, 9.4 (95% CI: 9.1, 9.7) in the medium-risk group, and 2.9 (95% CI: 2.9, 3.0) in the low-risk group. Rates of acute myocardial infarction (per 1000 PY) were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.8, 1.9) overall, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7, 2.2) for patients with migraine aura, 14.0 (95% CI: 13.0, 14.9) in the high-risk group, 3.9 (95% CI: 3.7, 4.1) in the medium-risk group, and 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.1) in the low-risk group. High-risk patients had the highest rates of each of 19 evaluated vascular events, and rates were higher for men, older age groups, and those with higher comorbidity scores, medication usage, and medical utilization.

We aimed to determine the associations between chronic pain and a brain aging biomarker in persons aged 60 to 83 years old. Participants of the Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain and Mobility Across the Lifespan (NEPAL) study (N = 47) completed demographic, psychological, and pain assessments followed by a quantitative sensory testing battery and a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We estimated a brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) that has been previously reported to predict overall mortality risk (brain-PAD, calculated as brain-predicted age minus chronological age), using an established machine-learning model. Analyses of covariances and Pearson/Spearman correlations were used to determine associations of brain-PAD with pain, somatosensory function, and psychological function. Individuals with chronic pain (n = 33) had ""older"" brains for their age compared with those without (n = 14; F[1,41] = 4.9; P = 0.033). Greater average worst pain intensity was associated with an ""older"" brain (r = 0.464; P = 0.011). Among participants with chronic pain, those who reported having pain treatments during the past 3 months had ""younger"" brains compared with those who did not (F[1,27] = 12.3; P = 0.002). An ""older"" brain was significantly associated with decreased vibratory (r = 0.323; P = 0.033) and thermal (r = 0.345; P = 0.023) detection, deficient endogenous pain inhibition (F[1,25] = 4.6; P = 0.044), lower positive affect (r = -0.474; P = 0.005), a less agreeable (r = -0.439; P = 0.020), and less emotionally stable personality (r = -0.387; P = 0.042).
