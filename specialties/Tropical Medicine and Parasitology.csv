Zhang_2020_BMJglohea,JOUR,Reduction in healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,"Zhang, Yi-Na and Chen, Yun and Wang, Ying and Li, Fan and Pender, Michelle and Wang, Na and Yan, Fei and Ying, Xiao-Hua and Tang, Sheng-Lan and Fu, Chao-Wei",BMJ global health,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a healthcare crisis in China and continues to wreak havoc across the world. This paper evaluated COVID-19's impact on national and regional healthcare service utilisation and expenditure in China. METHODS: Using a big data approach, we collected data from 300 million bank card transactions to measure individual healthcare expenditure and utilisation in mainland China. Since the outbreak coincided with the 2020 Chinese Spring Festival holiday, a difference-in-difference (DID) method was employed to compare changes in healthcare utilisation before, during and after the Spring Festival in 2020 and 2019. We also tracked healthcare utilisation before, during and after the outbreak. RESULTS: Healthcare utilisation declined overall, especially during the post-festival period in 2020. Total healthcare expenditure and utilisation declined by 37.8% and 40.8%, respectively, while per capita expenditure increased by 3.3%. In a subgroup analysis, we found that the outbreak had a greater impact on healthcare utilisation in cities at higher risk of COVID-19, with stricter lockdown measures and those located in the western region. The DID results suggest that, compared with low-risk cities, the pandemic induced a 14.8%, 26.4% and 27.5% reduction in total healthcare expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, and in cities located in Hubei province during the post-festival period in 2020 relative to 2019, an 8.6%, 15.9% and 24.4% reduction in utilisation services; and a 7.3% and 18.4% reduction in per capita expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, respectively. By the last week of April 2020, as the outbreak came under control, healthcare utilisation gradually recovered, but only to 79.9%-89.3% of its pre-outbreak levels. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly negative effect on healthcare utilisation in China, evident by a dramatic decline in healthcare expenditure. While the utilisation level has gradually increased post-outbreak, it has yet to return to normal levels.",2020,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003421,5,11,NA,eng,2059-7908,"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and Humans and diseases and public health and health services research and Pandemics and health economics and injuries and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology and *Health Services Accessibility and Betacoronavirus and China/epidemiology and Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data and disorders and infections and other study design",NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wahl_2018_BMJglohea,JOUR,Artificial intelligence (AI) and global health: how can AI contribute to health in resource-poor settings?,"Wahl, Brian and Cossy-Gantner, Aline and Germann, Stefan and Schwalbe, Nina R.",BMJ global health,"The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last 60 years. While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the provision of healthcare services in resource-poor settings. Many health system hurdles in such settings could be overcome with the use of AI and other complementary emerging technologies. Further research and investments in the development of AI tools tailored to resource-poor settings will accelerate realising of the full potential of AI for improving global health.",2018,10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000798,3,4,e000798,eng,2059-7908,artificial intelligence and low- and middle-income countries and primary health,NA,NA,2018///,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
O.Reilly.Shah_2017_BMJglohea,JOUR,Assessing the global reach and value of a provider-facing healthcare app using large-scale analytics,"O'Reilly-Shah, Vikas and Easton, George and Gillespie, Scott",BMJ global health,"BACKGROUND: The rapid global adoption of mobile health (mHealth) smartphone apps by healthcare providers presents challenges and opportunities in medicine. Challenges include ensuring the delivery of high-quality, up-to-date and optimised information. Opportunities include the ability to study global practice patterns, access to medical and surgical care and continuing medical education needs. METHODS: We studied users of a free anaesthesia calculator app used worldwide. We combined traditional app analytics with in-app surveys to collect user demographics and feedback. RESULTS: 31 173 subjects participated. Users were from 206 countries and represented a spectrum of healthcare provider roles. Low-income country users had greater rates of app use (p<0.001) and ascribed greater importance of the app to their practice (p<0.001). Physicians from low-income countries were more likely to adopt the app (p<0.001). The app was used primarily for paediatric patients. The app was used around the clock, peaking during times typical for first start cases. CONCLUSIONS: This mHealth app is a valuable decision support tool for global healthcare providers, particularly those in more resource-limited settings and with less training. App adoption and use may provide a mechanism for measuring longitudinal changes in access to surgical care and engaging providers in resource-limited settings. In-app surveys and app analytics provide a window into healthcare provider behaviour at a breadth and level of detail previously impossible to achieve. Given the potentially immense value of crowdsourced information, healthcare providers should be encouraged to participate in these types of studies.",2017,10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000299,2,3,e000299,eng,2059-7908,analytics and mHealth and global health and anesthesiology and practice patterns,NA,NA,2017///,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Munar_2019_BMJglohea,JOUR,Evidence gap map of performance measurement and management in primary healthcare systems in low-income and middle-income countries,"Munar, Wolfgang and Snilstveit, Birte and Aranda, Ligia Esther and Biswas, Nilakshi and Baffour, Theresa and Stevenson, Jenniffer",BMJ global health,"INTRODUCTION: We mapped available evidence on performance measurement and management (PMM) strategies in primary healthcare (PHC) systems of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Widely used, their effectiveness remains inconclusive. This evidence gap map characterises existing research and evidence gaps. METHODS: Systematic mapping of performance measurement and management research in LMICs from 2000 to mid-2018; literature searches of seven academic databases and institutional repositories of impact evaluations and systematic reviews. Using a combination of manual screening and machine learning, four reviewers appraised 38 088 titles and abstracts, and extracted metadata from 137 impact evaluations and 18 systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria. The resulting visual representation of the evidence base was uploaded to a web-based platform. RESULTS: Since 2000, the number of studies has increased; the first systematic reviews were completed in 2010. Two-thirds of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Randomised controlled trials were the most frequently used study design. The evidence is concentrated in two types of PMM strategies: implementation strategies (in-service training, continuing education, supervision) and performance-based financing. Major gaps exist in accountability arrangements particularly the use of audit and feedback. The least studied types of outcomes were unintended effects, harm and social equity. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is clustered around interventions that are unlikely to achieve transformational change in health outcomes. The gaps identified suggest that routinely used PMM strategies are implemented without sufficient knowledge of their effects. Future efforts at redesigning PHC systems need to be informed by evidence on the most effective approaches for using PMM strategies.",2019,10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001451,4,Suppl 8,e001451,eng,2059-7908,primary health care and evidence gap maps and health systems and policy research and performance measurement and management,NA,NA,2019///,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we describe how integrating data collection optimisation, traditional analytics and causal artificial intelligence/machine learning (ML) can be used in a use case for increasing hospital deliveries of newborns in Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS: Using a systematic behavioural framework we designed a large-scale survey on perceptual, interpersonal and structural drivers of women's behaviour around childbirth (n=5613). Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with institutional delivery (ID). Causal ML determined the cause-and-effect ordering of these factors. Variance decomposition was used to parse sources of variation in delivery location, and a supervised learning algorithm was used to distinguish population subgroups. RESULTS: Among the factors found associated with ID, the causal model showed that having a delivery plan (OR=6.1, 95% CI 6.0 to 6.3), believing the hospital is safer than home (OR=5.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 5.6) and awareness of financial incentives were direct causes of ID (OR=3.4, 95% CI 3.3 to 3.5). Distance to the hospital, borrowing delivery money and the primary decision-maker were not causal. Individual-level factors contributed 69% of variance in delivery location. The segmentation analysis showed four distinct subgroups differentiated by ID risk perception, parity and planning. CONCLUSION: These findings generate a holistic picture of the drivers and barriers to ID in Uttar Pradesh and suggest distinct intervention points for different women. This demonstrates data optimised to identify key behavioural drivers, coupled with traditional and ML analytics, can help design a PxPH approach that maximise the impact of limited resources.",2020,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002340,5,10,NA,eng,2059-7908,"Humans and Female and Machine Learning and Pregnancy and health services research and Artificial Intelligence and India and Infant, Newborn and *Public Health and *Delivery, Obstetric and child health and cross-sectional survey and maternal health and mathematical modelling",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The implementation of innovative digital technologies within available care centres could potentially improve patient care as well as healthcare worker safety and effectiveness. METHODS: We developed a Modular Wireless Patient Monitoring System (MWPMS) and conducted a proof of concept study in an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Makeni, Sierra Leone. The system was built around a wireless, multiparametric 'band-aid' patch sensor for continuous vital sign monitoring and transmission, plus sophisticated data analytics. Results were used to develop personalised analytics to support automated alerting of early changes in patient status. RESULTS: During the 3-week study period, all eligible patients (n=26) admitted to the ETC were enrolled in the study, generating a total of 1838 hours of continuous vital sign data (mean of 67.8 hours/patient), including heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, respiratory rate, pulse transit time (inversely related to blood pressure), uncalibrated skin temperature and posture. All patients tolerated the patch sensor without problems. Manually determined and automated vital signs were well correlated. Algorithm-generated Multivariate Change Index, pulse transit time and arrhythmia burden demonstrated encouraging preliminary findings of important physiological changes, as did ECG waveform changes. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof of concept study, we were able to demonstrate that a portable, deployable system for continuous vital sign monitoring via a wireless, wearable sensor supported by a sophisticated, personalised analytics platform can provide high-acuity monitoring with a continuous, objective measure of physiological status of all patients that is achievable in virtually any healthcare setting, anywhere in the world.",2016,10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000070,1,1,e000070,eng,2059-7908,NA,NA,NA,2016///,BMJ Glob Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The persistence and sometimes emergence of new pathogens allows for the occurrence of coinfections and comorbidities due to both infectious and noninfectious diseases. There is therefore a need to rethink and restructure African health systems to successfully address this transition. The historical focus of more health resources on infectious diseases requires revision. We hypothesise that the growing burden of noninfectious diseases may be linked directly and indirectly to or further exacerbated by the existence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other infectious diseases within the population. Herein, we discuss the health burden of coinfections and comorbidities and the challenges to implementing effective and sustainable healthcare in Africa. We also discuss how existing NTD and infectious disease intervention programs in Africa can be leveraged for noninfectious disease intervention. Furthermore, we explore the potential for new technologies-including artificial intelligence and multiplex approaches-for diagnosis and management of chronic diseases for improved health provision in Africa.",2018,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006711,12,9,e0006711,eng,1935-2735 1935-2727,Humans and Comorbidity and Incidence and Coinfection/*epidemiology and Africa/epidemiology and Communicable Disease Control/methods and Communicable Diseases/*complications/*epidemiology and Medical Countermeasures and Neglected Diseases/epidemiology and Noncommunicable Diseases/*epidemiology,NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is one of the neglected tropical diseases identified by the World Health Organization for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Maps displaying disease distribution are helpful tools to identify high-risk areas and target scarce control resources. METHODS: We used pre-intervention site-level occurrence data from 1192 survey sites collected during extensive mapping surveys by the Nigeria Ministry of Health. Using an ensemble of machine learning modelling algorithms (generalised boosted models and random forest), we mapped the ecological niche of LF at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). By overlaying gridded estimates of population density, we estimated the human population living in LF risk areas on a 100 * 100 m scale. RESULTS: Our maps demonstrate that there is a heterogeneous distribution of LF risk areas across Nigeria, with large portions of northern Nigeria having more environmentally suitable conditions for the occurrence of LF. Here we estimated that approximately 110 million individuals live in areas at risk of LF transmission.

Traditional patient safety practices of emergency medical teams (EMTs) in disaster zones were not well understood. Improving the quality of healthcare in disaster zones has gained importance within global health policy. Ascertaining patient safety practices of EMTs in disaster zones may identify areas of practice that can be improved. METHODS: A systematic search of OvidSP, Embase and Medline databases; key journals of interest; key grey literature texts; the databases of the WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross; and Google Scholar was performed. Descriptive studies, case reports, case series, prospective trials and opinion pieces were included with no limitation on date or language of publication. RESULTS: There were 9685 records, evenly distributed between the peer-reviewed and grey literature. Of these, 30 studies and 9 grey literature texts met the inclusion criteria and underwent qualitative synthesis. From these articles, 302 patient safety statements were extracted. Thematic analysis categorised these statements into 84 themes (total frequency 632). The most frequent themes were limb injury (9%), medical records (5.4%), surgery decision-making (4.6%), medicines safety (4.4%) and protocol (4.4%). CONCLUSION: Patient safety practices of EMTs in disaster zones are weighted toward acute clinical care, particularly surgery. The management of non-communicable disease is under-represented. There is widespread recognition of the need to improve medical record-keeping. High-quality data and institutional level patient safety practices are lacking.

L. and Beeson, Erynn A. and Zane, Hannah K. and Peterson, Jaime W. and Sullivan, Peter D.",BMJ global health,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, requiring mask reuse or improvisation. We provide a review of medical-grade facial protection (surgical masks, N95 respirators and face shields) for healthcare workers, the safety and efficacy of decontamination methods, and the utility of alternative strategies in emergency shortages or resource-scarce settings. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of PubMed and grey literature related to facial protection and potential adaptation strategies in the setting of PPE shortages (January 2000 to March 2020). Limitations included few COVID-19-specific studies and exclusion of non-English language articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence based on relevant healthcare settings to increase practical utility in decision-making. RESULTS: We retrieved 5462 peer-reviewed articles and 41 grey literature records. In total, we included 67 records which met inclusion criteria. Compared with surgical masks, N95 respirators perform better in laboratory testing, may provide superior protection in inpatient settings and perform equivalently in outpatient settings. Surgical mask and N95 respirator conservation strategies include extended use, reuse or decontamination, but these strategies may result in inferior protection. Limited evidence suggests that reused and improvised masks should be used when medical-grade protection is unavailable. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to critical shortages of medical-grade PPE. Alternative forms of facial protection offer inferior protection. More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection.

Accurate and timely forecasts of dengue incidence in China are still lacking. We aimed to use the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model of dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Weekly dengue cases, Baidu search queries and climate factors (mean temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) during 2011-2014 in Guangdong were gathered. A dengue search index was constructed for developing the predictive models in combination with climate factors. The observed year and week were also included in the models to control for the long-term trend and seasonality. Several machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, step-down linear regression model, gradient boosted regression tree algorithm (GBM), negative binomial regression model (NBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression model and generalized additive model (GAM), were used as candidate models to predict dengue incidence. Performance and goodness of fit of the models were assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-squared measures. The residuals of the models were examined using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function analyses to check the validity of the models. The models were further validated using dengue surveillance data from five other provinces. The epidemics during the last 12 weeks and the peak of the 2014 large outbreak were accurately forecasted by the SVR model selected by a cross-validation technique. Moreover, the SVR model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of dengue and forecasting the outbreaks in other areas in China. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed SVR model achieved a superior performance in comparison with other forecasting techniques assessed in this study.

This study aims to review the published literature on CEA in mainland China and describe its characteristics and evolution. We provide recommendations on the future direction of CEA as a methodology and as a tool to support healthcare decision-making in China. METHODS: English-language cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) publications relating to mainland China were reviewed using the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry through 2017. Study features were summarised using descriptive statistics. Changes in study methodology over time were analysed by trend test, and study characteristics influencing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost-per-QALY studies were investigated using logistic regression. RESULTS: 170 studies were identified reporting CEA for mainland China (cost/QALY=125, cost/DALY=45) since 1998. The number and quality of studies has increased over the past two decades, with significantly more cost-per-QALY studies compared with cost-per-DALY studies (p<0.0001) and more studies with authors affiliated with Chinese institutions (p=0.0002). The average quality score was 5.04 out of 7 for cost-per-QALY and 4.70 for cost-per-DALY studies based on Registry reviewers' subjective assessment of overall quality (methods, assumptions and reporting practices). The median ICER reported for interventions for oncology patients was higher (US$26 694 per QALY) than the median ICER reported for all interventions (US$11 503 per QALY). Oncology interventions were associated with the likelihood of reporting higher ICERs than the median ICER (p=0.003).

Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942 cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60% <c2><b1> 0.03%, 85.87% <c2><b1> 0.54%, 83.75% <c2><b1> 0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period. Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [<e2><89><a4> 3.2 (x103/<ce><bc>L)], fever (<e2><89><a5>38<c2><b0>C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x103/<ce><bc>L)], and elderly (<e2><89><a5> 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96-6.76], 3.17 [95%CI: 2.74-3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44-3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50-2.10], respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can facilitate medical and public health efforts to minimize the health threat of dengue epidemics.

Despite many large national and international epidemics, the landscape epidemiology of RVF remains obscure, particularly with respect to the ecological roles of wildlife reservoirs and surface water features. The current investigation modeled RVF risk throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula as a function of a suite of biotic and abiotic landscape features using machine learning methods. Intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density were associated with increased landscape suitability to RVF outbreaks.

Leading UK and global strategy papers to fight AMR recognise its social and behavioural dimensions, but current policy responses to improve the popular use of antimicrobials (eg, antibiotics) are limited to education and awareness-raising campaigns. In response to conceptual, methodological and empirical weaknesses of this approach, we study people's antibiotic-related health behaviour through three research questions.RQ1: What are the manifestations and determinants of problematic antibiotic use in patients' healthcare-seeking pathways?RQ2: Will people's exposure to antibiotic awareness activities entail changed behaviours that diffuse or dissipate within a network of competing healthcare practices?RQ3: Which proxy indicators facilitate the detection of problematic antibiotic behaviours across and within communities? METHODS: We apply an interdisciplinary analytical framework that draws on the public health, medical anthropology, sociology and development economics literature. Our research involves social surveys of treatment-seeking behaviour among rural dwellers in northern Thailand (Chiang Rai) and southern Lao PDR (Salavan). We sample approximately 4800 adults to produce district-level representative and social network data.

Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections could be predicted using subject intake data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two prediction models were developed using data from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a high burden of arboviral infections. Data were obtained from subjects who presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection (November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-used only demographic and symptom data. The second prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)-incorporated laboratory data. These models were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94. A sensitivity analysis revealed that SISA and SISAL are not directly comparable to one another. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both SISA and SISAL were able to predict arbovirus hospitalization with a high degree of accuracy in our dataset.

Quantification of benefit for travellers from the United Kingdom (UK) was modelled to assist clinical and public health decision making. METHODS: The model was constructed utilising: World Tourism Organization data showing total number of arrivals from the UK in countries with moderate or high malaria risk; data from a retrospective UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) drug utilisation study; additional information on chemoprophylaxis, case fatality and tolerability were derived from the travel medicine literature. Chemoprophylaxis with the following agents was considered: atovaquone-proguanil (AP), chloroquine with and without proguanil (C <c2><b1> P), doxycycline (Dx), mefloquine (Mq). The model was validated for the most recent year with temporally matched datasets for UK travel destinations and imported malaria (2007) against UK Health Protection Agency data on imported malaria. RESULTS: The median (mean) duration of chemoprophylaxis for each agent in weeks (CPRD) was: AP 3.3 (3.5), C <c2><b1> P 9 (12.1), Dx 8 (10.3), Mq 9 (12.3): the maximum duration of use of all regimens was 52 weeks. The model correctly predicted falciparum malaria deaths and gave a robust estimate of total cases--model: 5 deaths from 1118 cases; UK Health Protection Agency: 5 deaths from 1153 cases. The number needed to take chemoprophylaxis (NNP) to prevent a case of malaria considered against the 'background' reported incidence in non-users of chemoprophylaxis deemed in need of chemoprophylaxis was: C <c2><b1> P 272, Dx 269, Mq 260, AP 252; the NNP to prevent a UK traveller malaria death was: C <c2><b1> P 62613, Dx 61923, Mq 59973, AP 58059; increasing the 'background' rate by 50% yielded NNPs of: C <c2><b1> P 176, Dx 175, Mq 171, AP 168. The impact of substituting atovaquone-proguanil for all mefloquine usage resulted in a 2.3% decrease in estimated infections. The number of travellers experiencing moderate adverse events (AE) or those requiring medical attention or drug withdrawal per case prevented is as follows: C <c2><b1> P 170, Mq 146, Dx 114, AP 103. CONCLUSIONS: The model correctly predicted the number of malaria deaths, providing a robust and reliable estimate of the number of imported malaria cases in the UK, and giving a measure of benefit derived from chemoprophylaxis use against the likely adverse events generated. Overall numbers needed to prevent a malaria infection are comparable among the four options and are sensitive to changes in the background infection rates.

Its application to zoonotic diseases is recommended, but few coherent frameworks exist that combine approaches from multiple disciplines. Rabies requires an interdisciplinary approach for effective and efficient management. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A framework is proposed to assess the value of rabies interventions holistically. The economic assessment compares additional monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of an intervention taking into account epidemiological, animal welfare, societal impact and cost data. It is complemented by an ethical assessment. The framework is applied to Colombo City, Sri Lanka, where modified dog rabies intervention measures were implemented in 2007. The two options included for analysis were the control measures in place until 2006 (""baseline scenario"") and the new comprehensive intervention measures (""intervention"") for a four-year duration. Differences in control cost; monetary human health costs after exposure; Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to human rabies deaths and the psychological burden following a bite; negative impact on animal welfare; epidemiological indicators; social acceptance of dogs; and ethical considerations were estimated using a mixed method approach including primary and secondary data. Over the four years analysed, the intervention cost US $1.03 million more than the baseline scenario in 2011 prices (adjusted for inflation) and caused a reduction in dog rabies cases; 738 DALYs averted; an increase in acceptability among non-dog owners; a perception of positive changes in society including a decrease in the number of roaming dogs; and a net reduction in the impact on animal welfare from intermediate-high to low-intermediate.

Data from the scientific literature gathered in the country from 1948 to 2016 were collected and analyzed. Overall 51 culicid species comprising 17 Anopheles spp., 14 Aedes spp., 18 Culex spp. and two Mansonia spp. have been described in Mauritania among which Anopheles arabiensis, Aedes vexans, Culex poicilipes and Culex antennatus are of epidemiological significance. Anopheles arabiensis is widely distributed throughout the country and its geographic distribution has increased northwards in recent years, shifting its northern limit form 17<c2><b0>32'N in the 1960s to 18<c2><b0>47'N today. Its presence in the central region of Tagant highlights the great ecological plasticity of the species. Conversely, the distribution of Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and Anopheles melas has shrunk compared to that of the 1960s. Anopheles rhodesiensis and An. d'thali are mainly confined in the mountainous areas (alt. 200-700 m), whereas Anopheles pharoensis is widely distributed in the Senegal River basin.

METHODS: Geo-referenced parasitological data obtained from a 2010/2011 national survey indicating a confirmed presence or absence of STH among school children aged 10-15 years was used to calibrate ten species distribution models (SDMs). The performance of SDMs calibrated with a set of environmental and edaphic variables was compared to that of SDMs calibrated with environmental variables only. Model performance was evaluated using the true skill statistic and receiver operating characteristic curve.

A. and Garcia, Raul Marcel Gonzalez and Fraga, Lucia Alves de Oliveira",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of Mycobacterium leprae is a key strategy for disrupting the transmission chain of leprosy and preventing the potential onset of physical disabilities. Clinical diagnosis is essential, but some of the presented symptoms may go unnoticed, even by specialists. In areas of greater endemicity, serological and molecular tests have been performed and analyzed separately for the follow-up of household contacts, who are at high risk of developing the disease. The accuracy of these tests is still debated, and it is necessary to make them more reliable, especially for the identification of cases of leprosy between contacts. We proposed an integrated analysis of molecular and serological methods using artificial intelligence by the random forest (RF) algorithm to better diagnose and predict new cases of leprosy. METHODS: The study was developed in Governador Valadares, Brazil, a hyperendemic region for leprosy. A longitudinal study was performed, including new cases diagnosed in 2011 and their respective household contacts, who were followed in 2011, 2012, and 2016. All contacts were diligently evaluated by clinicians from Reference Center for Endemic Diseases (CREDEN-PES) before being classified as asymptomatic. Samples of slit skin smears (SSS) from the earlobe of the patients and household contacts were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA, and peripheral blood samples were collected for ELISA assays to detect LID-1 and ND-O-LID. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of the tests revealed sensitivity for anti-LID-1 (63.2%), anti-ND-O-LID (57.9%), qPCR SSS (36.8%), and smear microscopy (30.2%). However, the use of RF allowed for an expressive increase in sensitivity in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (90.5%) and especially paucibacillary leprosy (70.6%).

O. and Gurley, Emily S. and Han, Barbara A.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"The 2018 outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India, highlights the need for global surveillance of henipaviruses in bats, which are the reservoir hosts for this and other viruses. Nipah virus, an emerging paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus, causes severe disease and stuttering chains of transmission in humans and is considered a potential pandemic threat. In May 2018, an outbreak of Nipah virus began in Kerala, > 1800 km from the sites of previous outbreaks in eastern India in 2001 and 2007. Twenty-three people were infected and 21 people died (16 deaths and 18 cases were laboratory confirmed). Initial surveillance focused on insectivorous bats (Megaderma spasma), whereas follow-up surveys within Kerala found evidence of Nipah virus in fruit bats (Pteropus medius). P. medius is the confirmed host in Bangladesh and is now a confirmed host in India. However, other bat species may also serve as reservoir hosts of henipaviruses. To inform surveillance of Nipah virus in bats, we reviewed and analyzed the published records of Nipah virus surveillance globally. We applied a trait-based machine learning approach to a subset of species that occur in Asia, Australia, and Oceana. In addition to seven species in Kerala that were previously identified as Nipah virus seropositive, we identified at least four bat species that, on the basis of trait similarity with known Nipah virus-seropositive species, have a relatively high likelihood of exposure to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses in India. These machine-learning approaches provide the first step in the sequence of studies required to assess the risk of Nipah virus spillover in India. Nipah virus surveillance not only within Kerala but also elsewhere in India would benefit from a research pipeline that included surveys of known and predicted reservoirs for serological evidence of past infection with Nipah virus (or cross reacting henipaviruses). Serosurveys should then be followed by longitudinal spatial and temporal studies to detect shedding and isolate virus from species with evidence of infection. Ecological studies will then be required to understand the dynamics governing prevalence and shedding in bats and the contacts that could pose a risk to public health.",2019,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007393,13,6,e0007393,eng,1935-2735 1935-2727,"Humans and Risk Assessment and Animals and *Epidemiological Monitoring and Communicable Disease Control/*organization & administration and India/epidemiology and Seroepidemiologic Studies and Zoonoses/*epidemiology/transmission and *Disease Transmission, Infectious and Chiroptera/*virology and Disease Reservoirs/virology and Henipavirus Infections/*epidemiology/transmission/veterinary and Nipah Virus/*growth & development/immunology/isolation & purification",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA

S. and Drake, John M.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Ebola and other filoviruses pose significant public health and conservation threats by causing high mortality in primates, including humans. Preventing future outbreaks of ebolavirus depends on identifying wildlife reservoirs, but extraordinarily high biodiversity of potential hosts in temporally dynamic environments of equatorial Africa contributes to sporadic, unpredictable outbreaks that have hampered efforts to identify wild reservoirs for nearly 40 years. Using a machine learning algorithm, generalized boosted regression, we characterize potential filovirus-positive bat species with estimated 87% accuracy. Our model produces two specific outputs with immediate utility for guiding filovirus surveillance in the wild. First, we report a profile of intrinsic traits that discriminates hosts from non-hosts, providing a biological caricature of a filovirus-positive bat species.

Delayed hospital admission of leptospirosis patients is associated with increased mortality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During a concurrent dengue/leptospirosis epidemic in Puerto Rico in 2010, suspected dengue patients that tested dengue-negative were tested for leptospirosis. Fatal and non-fatal hospitalized leptospirosis patients were matched 1:1-3 by age. Records from all medical visits were evaluated for factors associated with fatal outcome. Among 175 leptospirosis patients identified (4.7 per 100,000 residents), 26 (15%) were fatal. Most patients were older males and had illness onset during the rainy season. Fatal case patients first sought medical care earlier than non-fatal control patients (2.5 vs. 5 days post-illness onset [DPO], p < 0.01), but less frequently first sought care at a hospital (52.4% vs. 92.2%, p < 0.01). Although fatal cases were more often diagnosed with leptospirosis at first medical visit (43.9% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.01), they were admitted to the hospital no earlier than non-fatal controls (4.5 vs. 6 DPO, p = 0.31).

Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global ""One Health"" initiative, predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on narrow ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory, co-production approach to address this disconnect between science, policy and implementation, by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors, to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014-2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors, including forest cover and loss, host densities and public health access, in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga, Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics, livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014-2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an ""ecotonal"" disease, landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019, indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use, and public health interventions.

Fundamental to these decisions is quantifying the potential economic burden of Zika under different scenarios. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: To inform such decision making, our team developed a computational model to forecast the potential economic burden of Zika across six states in the US (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) which are at greatest risk of Zika emergence, under a wide range of attack rates, scenarios and circumstances. In order to accommodate a wide range of possibilities, different scenarios explored the effects of varying the attack rate from 0.01% to 10%. Across the six states, an attack rate of 0.01% is estimated to cost $183.4 million to society ($117.1 million in direct medical costs and $66.3 million in productivity losses), 0.025% would result in $198.6 million ($119.4 million and $79.2 million), 0.10% would result in $274.6 million ($130.8 million and $143.8 million) and 1% would result in $1.2 billion ($268.0 million and $919.2 million). CONCLUSIONS: Our model and study show how direct medical costs, Medicaid costs, productivity losses, and total costs to society may vary with different attack rates across the six states and the circumstances at which they may exceed certain thresholds (e.g., Zika prevention and control funding allocations that are being debated by the US government).

W. and Gitonga, Caroline W. and Hay, Simon I. and Brooker, Simon",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of control of parasitic diseases requires accurate, contemporary maps that provide intervention recommendations at policy-relevant spatial scales. To guide control of soil transmitted helminths (STHs), maps are required of the combined prevalence of infection, indicating where this prevalence exceeds an intervention threshold of 20%. Here we present a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of STHs, using the example of Kenya in 2009. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Observed prevalence data for hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were assembled for 106,370 individuals from 945 cross-sectional surveys undertaken between 1974 and 2009. Ecological and climatic covariates were extracted from high-resolution satellite data and matched to survey locations. Bayesian space-time geostatistical models were developed for each species, and were used to interpolate the probability that infection prevalence exceeded the 20% threshold across the country for both 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence using the law of total probability and incorporating a correction factor to adjust for associations between species. Population census data were combined with risk models and projected to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. In most areas for 2009, there was high certainty that endemicity was below the 20% threshold, with areas of endemicity <e2><89><a5> 20% located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. Comparison of the predicted distributions for 1989 and 2009 show how observed STH prevalence has gradually decreased over time. The model estimated that a total of 2.8 million school-age children live in districts which warrant mass treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian space-time geostatistical models can be used to reliably estimate the combined observed prevalence of STH and suggest that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and warrant mass treatment.

These indices may be useful for forecasting disease outbreaks in an area. However, use of the values of these indices as alarm signals is rarely considered in control programmes. Therefore, the current study aims to propose threshold values for vector indices based on an empirical modeling approach for the Kandy District of Sri Lanka. METHODS: Monthly vector indices, viz PI, BI and CI, for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, of four selected dengue high risk Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in the Kandy District from January 2010 to August 2017, were used in the study. Gumbel frequency analysis was used to calculate the exceedance probability of quantitative values for each individual larval index within the relevant MOH area, individually and to set up the threshold values for the entomological management of dengue vectors. RESULTS: Among the study MOH areas, Akurana indicated a relatively high density of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, while Gangawata Korale MOH area had the lowest. Based on Ae. aegypti, threshold values were defined for Kandy as low risk (BI(agp) > 1.77), risk (BI(agp) > 3.23), moderate risk (BI(agp) > 4.47) and high risk (BI(agp) > 6.23). In addition, PI > 6.75 was defined as low risk, while PI > 9.43 and PI>12.82 were defined as moderate and high risk, respectively as an average. CONCLUSIONS: Threshold values recommended for Ae. aegypti (primary vector for dengue) along with cut-off values for PI (for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus), could be suggested as indicators for decision making in vector control efforts.

Due to the substantial resources required for traditional, manual snail-searching in the field, and potential risk of miss-classification of potential snail habitats by remote sensing, more convenient and precise methods are urgently needed. Snail data (N = 15,000) from two types of snail habitats (lake/marshland and hilly areas) in Anhui Province, a typical endemic area for schistosomiasis, were collected together with 36 environmental variables covering the whole province. Twelve different models were built and evaluated with indices, such as area under the curve (AUC), Kappa, percent correctly classified (PCC), sensitivity and specificity. We found the presence-absence models performing better than those based on presence-only. However, those derived from machine-learning, especially the random forest (RF) approach were preferable with all indices above 0.90. Distance to nearest river was found to be the most important variable for the lake/marshlands, while the climatic variables were more important for the hilly endemic areas. The predicted high-risk areas for potential snail habitats of the lake/marshland type exist mainly along the Yangtze River, while those of the hilly type are dispersed in the areas south of the Yangtze River.

Findings from an 8-country survey of policymakers and opinion leaders","Douglas, Don L. and DeRoeck, Denise A. and Mahoney, Richard T. and Wichmann, Ole",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: A face-to-face survey of 158 policymakers and other influential professionals was conducted in eight dengue-endemic countries in Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam) and Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua) to provide an indication of the potential demand for dengue vaccination in endemic countries, and to anticipate their research and other requirements in order to make decisions about the introduction of dengue vaccines. The study took place in anticipation of the licensure of the first dengue vaccine in the next several years. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted on an individual or small group basis with government health officials, research scientists, medical association officers, vaccine producers, local-level health authorities, and others considered to have a role in influencing decisions about dengue control and vaccines. Most informants across countries considered dengue a priority disease and expressed interest in the public sector use of dengue vaccines, with a major driver being the political pressure from the public and the medical community to control the disease. There was interest in a vaccine that protects children as young as possible and that can fit into existing childhood immunization schedules. Dengue vaccination in most countries surveyed will likely be targeted to high-risk areas and begin with routine immunization of infants and young children, followed by catch-up campaigns for older age groups, as funding permits. Key data requirements for decision-making were additional local dengue surveillance data, vaccine cost-effectiveness estimates, post-marketing safety surveillance data and, in some countries vaccine safety and immunogenicity data in the local population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The lookout for the public sector use of dengue vaccines in the eight countries appears quite favorable.

Whether multiplicity of infection (MOI) dynamic from individual infections could be a reliable malaria metric in high transmission settings with marked variation in seasons of malaria transmission has been poorly assessed. This study aimed at investigating factors driving Plasmodium falciparum MOI and genetic diversity in a hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso. METHODS: Blood samples collected from a pharmacovigilance trial were used for polymerase chain reaction genotyping of the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2. MOI was defined as the number of distinct parasite genotypes co-existing within a particular infection. Monthly rainfall data were obtained from satellite data of the Global Precipitation Measurement Database while monthly malaria incidence aggregated data were extracted from District Health Information Software 2 medical data of the Center-West health regional direction. RESULTS: In the study area, infected people harboured an average of 2.732 (<c2><b1> 0.056) different parasite genotypes. A significant correlation between the monthly MOI and the monthly malaria incidence was observed, suggesting that MOI could be a good predictor of transmission intensity. A strong effect of season on MOI was observed, with infected patients harbouring higher number of parasite genotypes during the rainy season as compared to the dry season. There was a negative relationship between MOI and host age. In addition, MOI decreased with increasing parasite densities, suggesting that there was a within-host competition among co-infecting genetically distinct P. falciparum variants. Each allelic family of the msp1 and msp2 genes was present all year round with no significant monthly fluctuation. CONCLUSIONS: In high malaria endemic settings with marked variation in seasons of malaria transmission, MOI represents an appropriate malaria metric which provides useful information about the longitudinal changes in malaria transmission in a given area. Besides transmission season, patient age and parasite density are important factors to consider for better understanding of variations in MOI. All allelic families of msp1 and msp2 genes were found in both dry and rainy season.

Together with the separate mapping of S. mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths, the national control programme was able to plan the MDA strategies according to the World Health Organization guidelines for preventive chemotherapy for these diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 52 sites/schools were selected according to prior knowledge of S. haematobium endemicity taking into account a good spatial coverage within each district, and a total of 2293 children aged 9-14 years were examined. Spatial analysis showed that S. haematobium is heterogeneously distributed in the country with significant spatial clustering in the central and eastern regions of the country, most prevalent in Bo (24.6% and 8.79 eggs/10 ml), Koinadugu (20.4% and 3.53 eggs/10 ml) and Kono (25.3% and 7.91 eggs/10 ml) districts. By combining this map with the previously reported maps on intestinal schistosomiasis using a simple probabilistic model, the combined schistosomiasis prevalence map highlights the presence of high-risk communities in an extensive area in the northeastern half of the country. By further combining the hookworm prevalence map, the at-risk population of school-age children requiring integrated schistosomiasis/soil-transmitted helminth treatment regimens according to the coendemicity was estimated.

Conventionally, regression and time series models are used to forecast dengue incidence, using dengue surveillance (e.g., case counts) and weather data. However, these models may be limited in terms of model assumptions and the number of predictors that can be included. Machine learning (ML) methods are designed to work with a large number of predictors and thus offer an appealing alternative. Here, we compared the performance of ML algorithms with that of regression models in predicting dengue cases and outbreaks from 4 to up to 12 weeks in advance. Many countries lack sufficient health surveillance infrastructure, as such we evaluated the contribution of dengue surveillance and weather data on the predictive power of these models. METHODS: We developed ML, regression, and time series models to forecast weekly dengue case counts and outbreaks in Iquitos, Peru; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Singapore from 1990-2016. Forecasts were generated using available weekly dengue surveillance, and weather data. We evaluated the agreement between model forecasts and actual dengue observations using Mean Absolute Error and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: For near term predictions of weekly case counts and when using surveillance data, ML models had 21% and 33% less error than regression and time series models respectively. However, using weather data only, ML models did not demonstrate a practical advantage. When forecasting weekly dengue outbreaks 12 weeks in advance, ML models achieved a maximum MCC of 0.61. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified 2 scenarios when ML models are advantageous over regression model: 1) predicting dengue weekly case counts 4 weeks ahead when dengue surveillance data are available and 2) predicting weekly dengue outbreaks 12 weeks ahead when dengue surveillance data are unavailable.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case-control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or ""seasons,"" which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier ""winter"" months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to ""monsoon,"" ""rainy,"" or ""summer"" seasons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites. Instead, our study indicates the necessity of local data to characterizing the epidemiology of diarrheal disease.

Their impact could be mitigated through earlier diagnosis and treatment at biomedical facilities; however, it is estimated that a large percentage of Ugandans (70-80%) seek traditional healers for their first line of medical care. This study sought to characterize individual and structural influences on health care-seeking behaviors for febrile children. Minimally structured, qualitative interviews were conducted for 34 caregivers of children presenting to biomedical and traditional healer sites, respectively. We identified six themes that shape the pathway of care for febrile children: 1) peer recommendations, 2) trust in biomedicine, 3) trust in traditional medicine, 4) mistrust in providers and therapies, 5) economic resources and access to health care, and 6) perceptions of child health. Biomedical providers are preferred by those who value laboratory testing and formal medical training, whereas traditional healer preference is heavily influenced by convenience, peer recommendations, and firm beliefs in traditional causes of illness.

Vidal_2020_PLoSnegltropdise,JOUR,Chikungunya outbreak (2015) in the Colombian Caribbean: Latent classes and gender differences in virus infection,"Vidal, Oscar M. and Acosta-Reyes, Jorge and Padilla, Jesus and Navarro-Lechuga, Edgar and Bravo, Elsa and Viasus, Diego and Arcos-Burgos, Mauricio and Velez, Jorge I.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is part of a group of emergent diseases, including arbovirus, constituting an increasing public health problem in tropical areas worldwide. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic ""extreme"" phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex ""extreme"" phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results have shown prediction models achieving up to 92% accuracy overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster.",2020,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008281,14,6,e0008281,eng,1935-2735 1935-2727,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Logistic Models and Sex Distribution and Animals and Aged, 80 and over and Age Distribution and Disease Outbreaks and Latent Class Analysis and Caribbean Region and Colombia/epidemiology and Chikungunya Fever/*epidemiology and Chikungunya virus/*isolation & purification and RNA, Viral/blood",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA
He_2018_PLoSnegltropdise,JOUR,Spatiotemporal variation of the association between climate dynamics and HFRS outbreaks in Eastern China during 2005-2016 and its geographic determinants,"He, Junyu and Christakos, George and Wu, Jiaping and Cazelles, Bernard and Qian, Quan and Mu, Di and Wang, Yong and Yin, Wenwu and Zhang, Wenyi",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-associated zoonosis caused by hantavirus. The HFRS was initially detected in northeast China in 1931, and since 1955 it has been detected in many regions of the country. Global climate dynamics influences HFRS spread in a complex nonlinear way. The quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the ""HFRS infections-global climate dynamics"" association at a large geographical scale and during a long time period is still lacking. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This work is the first study of a recently completed dataset of monthly HFRS cases in Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. A methodological synthesis that involves a time-frequency technique, a composite space-time model, hotspot analysis, and machine learning is implemented in the study of (a) the association between HFRS incidence spread and climate dynamics and (b) the geographic factors impacting this association over Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. The results showed that by assimilating core and city-specific knowledge bases the synthesis was able to depict quantitatively the space-time variation of periodic climate-HFRS associations at a large geographic scale and to assess numerically the strength of this association in the area and period of interest. It was found that the HFRS infections in Eastern China has a strong association with global climate dynamics, in particular, the 12, 18 and 36 mos periods were detected as the three main synchronous periods of climate dynamics and HFRS distribution. For the 36 mos period (which is the period with the strongest association), the space-time correlation pattern of the association strength indicated strong temporal but rather weak spatial dependencies. The generated space-time maps of association strength and association hotspots provided a clear picture of the geographic variation of the association strength that often-exhibited cluster characteristics (e.g., the south part of the study area displays a strong climate-HFRS association with non-point effects, whereas the middle-north part displays a weak climate-HFRS association). Another finding of this work is the upward climate-HFRS coherency trend for the past few years (2013-2015) indicating that the climate impacts on HFRS were becoming increasingly sensitive with time. Lastly, another finding of this work is that geographic factors affect the climate-HFRS association in an interrelated manner through local climate or by means of HFRS infections. In particular, location (latitude, distance to coastline and longitude), grassland and woodland are the geographic factors exerting the most noticeable effects on the climate-HFRS association (e.g., low latitude has a strong effect, whereas distance to coastline has a wave-like effect). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed synthetic quantitative approach revealed important aspects of the spatiotemporal variation of the climate-HFRS association in Eastern China during a long time period, and identified the geographic factors having a major impact on this association. Both findings could improve public health policy in an HFRS-torn country like China. Furthermore, the synthetic approach developed in this work can be used to map the space-time variation of different climate-disease associations in other parts of China and the World.",2018,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006554,12,6,e0006554,eng,1935-2735 1935-2727,Public Health and Humans and Geography and Animals and Incidence and Seasons and Spatio-Temporal Analysis and China/epidemiology and *Disease Outbreaks and *Climate and Hantaan virus/isolation & purification and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome/*epidemiology/transmission/virology and Zoonoses,NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA
Harrison_2017_PLoSnegltropdise,JOUR,Preclinical antivenom-efficacy testing reveals potentially disturbing deficiencies of snakebite treatment capability in East Africa,"Harrison, Robert A. and Oluoch, George O. and Ainsworth, Stuart and Alsolaiss, Jaffer and Bolton, Fiona and Arias, Ana-Silvia and Gutierrez, Jose-Maria and Rowley, Paul and Kalya, Stephen and Ozwara, Hastings and Casewell, Nicholas R.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: Antivenom is the treatment of choice for snakebite, which annually kills an estimated 32,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa and leaves approximately 100,000 survivors with permanent physical disabilities that exert a considerable socioeconomic burden. Over the past two decades, the high costs of the most polyspecifically-effective antivenoms have sequentially reduced demand, commercial manufacturing incentives and production volumes that have combined to create a continent-wide vacuum of effective snakebite therapy. This was quickly filled with new, less expensive antivenoms, many of which are of untested efficacy. Some of these successfully marketed antivenoms for Africa are inappropriately manufactured with venoms from non-African snakes and are dangerously ineffective. The uncertain efficacy of available antivenoms exacerbates the complexity of designing intervention measures to reduce the burden of snakebite in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to preclinically determine the ability of antivenoms available in Kenya to neutralise the lethal effects of venoms from the most medically important snakes in East Africa. METHODS: We collected venom samples from the most medically important snakes in East Africa and determined their toxicity in a mouse model. Using a 'gold standard' comparison protocol, we preclinically tested the comparative venom-neutralising efficacy of four antivenoms available in Kenya with two antivenoms of clinically-proven efficacy. To explain the variant efficacies of these antivenoms we tested the IgG-venom binding characteristics of each antivenom using in vitro IgG titre, avidity and venom-protein specificity assays. We also measured the IgG concentration of each antivenom. FINDINGS: None of the six antivenoms are preclinically effective, at the doses tested, against all of the most medically important snakes of the region. The very limited snake polyspecific efficacy of two locally available antivenoms is of concern. In vitro assays of the abilities of 'test' antivenom IgGs to bind venom proteins were not substantially different from that of the 'gold standard' antivenoms. The least effective antivenoms had the lowest IgG content/vial. CONCLUSIONS: Manufacture-stated preclinical efficacy statements guide decision making by physicians and antivenom purchasers in sub-Saharan Africa. This is because of the lack of both clinical data on the efficacy of most of the many antivenoms used to treat patients and independent preclinical assessment. Our preclinical efficacy assessment of antivenoms available in Kenya identifies important limitations for two of the most commonly-used antivenoms, and that no antivenom is preclinically effective against all the regionally important snakes. The potential implication to snakebite treatment is of serious concern in Kenya and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, and underscores the dilemma physicians face, the need for clinical data on antivenom efficacy and the medical and societal value of establishing independent preclinical antivenom-efficacy testing facilities throughout the continent.",2017,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005969,11,10,e0005969,eng,1935-2735 1935-2727,"Humans and Animals and Kenya and Mice and Protein Binding and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical and Africa, Eastern and Antivenins/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use and Immunoglobulin G/analysis/metabolism and Lethal Dose 50 and Snake Bites/*therapy and Snake Venoms/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/immunology/toxicity and Snakes",NA,NA,2017/10//undefined,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA

We performed a descriptive study of health, health knowledge and practice, and healthcare access of 13 remote communities of the Manati and Amazon Rivers in northeastern Peru. Eighty-five adults attending a medical boat service were interviewed to collect data on socioeconomic position, health, diagnosed illnesses, pain, healthcare access, and traditional versus modern medicine use. In this setting, poverty and gender inequality were prevalent, and healthcare access was limited by long distances to the health post and long waiting times. There was a high burden of reported pain (mainly head and musculoskeletal) and chronic non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension (19%). Nearly all participants felt that they did not completely understand their diagnosed illnesses and wanted to know more. Participants preferred modern over traditional medicine, predominantly because of mistrust or lack of belief in traditional medicine. Our findings provide novel evidence concerning transitional health beliefs, hidden pain, and chronic non-communicable disease prevalence in marginalized communities of the Peruvian Amazon.

It has health, socio-economic and psychological detrimental effects on patients and families. It is with this in mind, we set out to determine the predictors of post-operative recurrence in mycetoma. The study included 1013 patients with Madurella mycetomatis causing eumycetoma who underwent surgical excision at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Khartoum, Sudan in the period 1991-2015. The clinical records of these patients were reviewed and relevant information was collected using a pre-designed data collection sheet. The study showed, 276 patients (27.2%) of the studied population developed post-operative recurrence, 217 were males (78.6%) and 59 were females (21.4%). Their age ranged between 5 to 70 years with a mean of 32 years. The disease duration at presentation ranged between 2 months and 17 years. The majority of the patients 118 (42.8%) had mycetoma of 1 year duration. In this study, students were the most affected; 105 (38%) followed by workers 70 (25.4%), then farmers 48(17.3%). The majority of the patients were from the Central Sudan 207 (75%), Western Sudan 53 (19.2%) while 11 patients (4%) were from the Northern part. Past history of surgical intervention performed elsewhere was reported in 196 patients (71.1%). Family history of mycetoma was reported in 50 patients (18.1%). The foot was the most affected site, 245 (88.7%), followed by the hand seen in 19 (6.8%) patients and 44 (4.5%) had different sites involvement. Most of the patients 258 (93.5%) had wide local surgical excisions while 18 had major amputation. The model predicted that the certain groups have a high risk of recurrence, and these include patients with disease duration greater than 10 years and extra-pedal mycetoma. Patients with disease duration between [5-10] years, with pedal mycetoma, who had previous surgery, with positive family history and underwent wide local surgical excision. Patients with disease duration [5-10] years, with pedal mycetoma, had previous surgery, with no family history but presented with a disease size (> 10 cm), were non- farmers and underwent wide local surgical excision. Other groups are patients with disease duration (<e2><89><a4>5 years), with pedal mycetoma, age <59 years, living in the Western /Eastern / Southern regions of the Sudan and with positive family history and had wide local surgical excision. Also included patients with disease duration (<e2><89><a4>5 years), with pedal mycetoma, aged <59 years, living in the northern or central region, with no family history but presented with a disease size >10 cm, working as farmers or students and underwent wide local surgical excision. In conclusion, these groups of patients need special care to reduce the incidence of post-operative recurrence with its morbidity and detrimental consequences.
