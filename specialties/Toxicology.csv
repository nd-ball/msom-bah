The Ko-CHENS consists of 5000 Core and 65,000 Main Cohorts. The children in the Core Cohort are followed up at 6 months, every year before their admission into the elementary school, and every 3 years from the first year after this admission. The children in the Cohort will be followed up through the data links (Statistics Korea, National Health Insurance Service [NHIS], and Ministry of Education). The individual biospecimens will be analyzed for 19 substances. The long-term-storage biological samples will be used for the further substance analysis. The Ko-CHENS will investigate whether the environmental variables including the perinatal outdoor and indoor factors and the greenness contribute causally to the health outcomes in the children and adolescents. In addition to the individual surveys, the assessments of the outdoor exposures and health outcomes will use the national air-quality monitoring data and claim data of the NHIS, respectively. The two big-data forms of the Ko-CHENS are as follows: The Ko-CHENS data that can be linked with the nationally registered NHIS health-related database, including the medical utilization and the periodic health screening, and the birth/mortality database in the Statistics; the other is the Big-CHENS dataset that is based on the NHIS mother delivery code, for which the follow-up of almost 97% of the total birth population is expected. The Ko-CHENS is a very cost-effective study that fully exploits the existing national big-data systems with the data linkage.",2019,10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.009,172,NA,358-366,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,"Children and Humans and Female and Adolescent and Child and Databases, Factual and Cohort Studies and Prospective Studies and Pregnancy and Environment and Registries and Republic of Korea and *Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data and *Environmental Health/statistics & numerical data and *Health/statistics & numerical data and Birth cohort and Cohort profile and Ko-CHENS",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Halgamuge_2019_Envirese,JOUR,Lessons learned from the application of machine learning to studies on plant response to radio-frequency,"Halgamuge, Malka N. and Davis, Devra",Environmental research,"This paper applies Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to peer-reviewed publications in order to discern whether there are consistent biological impacts of exposure to non-thermal low power radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). Expanding on previous analysis that identified sensitive plant species, we extracted data from 45 articles published between 1996 and 2016 that included 169 experimental case studies of plant response to RF-EMF. Raw-data from these case studies included six different attributes: frequency, specific absorption rate (SAR), power flux density, electric field strength, exposure time and plant type (species). This dataset has been tested with two different classification algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest (RF). The outputs are estimated using k-fold cross-validation method to identify and compare classifier mean accuracy and computation time. We also developed an optimization technique to distinguish the trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation time based on the classification algorithm. Our analysis illustrates kNN (91.17%) and RF (89.41%) perform similarly in terms of mean accuracy, nonetheless, kNN takes less computation time (3.38<e2><80><af>s) to train a model compared to RF (248.12<e2><80><af>s). Very strong correlations were observed between SAR and frequency, and SAR with power flux density and electric field strength. Despite the low sample size (169 reported experimental case studies), that limits statistical power, nevertheless, this analysis indicates that ML algorithms applied to bioelectromagnetics literature predict impacts of key plant health parameters from specific RF-EMF exposures. This paper addresses both questions of the methodological importance and relative value of different methods of ML and the specific finding of impacts of RF-EMF on specific measures of plant growth and health. Recognizing the importance of standardizing nomenclature for EMF-RF, we conclude that Machine Learning provides innovative and efficient RF-EMF exposure prediction tools, and we propose future applications in occupational and environmental epidemiology and public health.",2019,10.1016/j.envres.2019.108634,178,NA,108634,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Machine learning and Humans and Forecasting and *Machine Learning and *Environmental Exposure and *Radio Waves and Electromagnetic Fields and Plant and Radio-frequency and RF-EMF,NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kim_2016_Envihealpers,JOUR,Mechanism Profiling of Hepatotoxicity Caused by Oxidative Stress Using Antioxidant Response Element Reporter Gene Assay Models and Big Data,"Kim, Marlene Thai and Huang, Ruili and Sedykh, Alexander and Wang, Wenyi and Xia, Menghang and Zhu, Hao",Environmental health perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity accounts for a substantial number of drugs being withdrawn from the market. Using traditional animal models to detect hepatotoxicity is expensive and time-consuming. Alternative in vitro methods, in particular cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) studies, have provided the research community with a large amount of data from toxicity assays. Among the various assays used to screen potential toxicants is the antioxidant response element beta lactamase reporter gene assay (ARE-bla), which identifies chemicals that have the potential to induce oxidative stress and was used to test > 10,000 compounds from the Tox21 program. OBJECTIVE: The ARE-bla computational model and HTS data from a big data source (PubChem) were used to profile environmental and pharmaceutical compounds with hepatotoxicity data. METHODS: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed based on ARE-bla data. The models predicted the potential oxidative stress response for known liver toxicants when no ARE-bla data were available. Liver toxicants were used as probe compounds to search PubChem Bioassay and generate a response profile, which contained thousands of bioassays (> 10 million data points). By ranking the in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs), the most relevant bioassay(s) related to hepatotoxicity were identified. RESULTS: The liver toxicants profile contained the ARE-bla and relevant PubChem assays. Potential toxicophores for well-known toxicants were created by identifying chemical features that existed only in compounds with high IVIVCs. CONCLUSION: Profiling chemical IVIVCs created an opportunity to fully explore the source-to-outcome continuum of modern experimental toxicology using cheminformatics approaches and big data sources.

Requia_2019_Envirese,JOUR,"Evaluation of predictive capabilities of ordinary geostatistical interpolation, hybrid interpolation, and machine learning methods for estimating PM(2.5) constituents over space","Requia, Weeberb J. and Coull, Brent A. and Koutrakis, Petros",Environmental research,"Numerous modeling approaches to estimate concentrations of PM(2.5) components have been developed to derive better exposures for health studies, including geostatistical interpolation approaches, land use regression models and, models based on remote sensing technology. Recently, there have been some efforts to develop models based on machine learning algorithms. Each one of these exposure assessment methods has inherent uncertainties resulting in varying levels of exposure misclassification. To date, only a few studies have attempted to systematically compare exposure estimates from different PM(2.5) constituent models. Our research addresses this gap, by comparing the predictive capabilities of ordinary geostatistical interpolation (Ordinary Kriging - OK), hybrid interpolation (combination of Empirical Bayesian Kriging and land use regression), and machine learning techniques (forest-based regression) for estimating PM(2.5) constituents in Eastern Massachusetts in the United States. We compared the estimates of 10 ambient PM(2.5) components, which included Al, Cu, Fe, K, Ni, Pb, S, Ti, V, and Zn. The OK model performed poorest for all PM(2.5) components, with an R(2) under 0.30. The hybrid model presented a slight improvement, especially for Cu and Fe, for which the R(2) value increased to 0.62 and 0.59, respectively. These elements presented the highest R(2) value from the hybrid model. The forest model presented the best performance, with R(2) values higher than 0.7 for most of the particle components, including Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Ti, and V. Same as observed with the hybrid model, the forest model for Cu and Fe explained the highest concentration variance, with a R(2) value equal to 0.88 and 0.92, respectively. The forest model for K, S, and Zn performed poorest with an R(2) value of 0.54, 0.37, and 0.44, respectively. The results presented here can be useful for the environmental health community to more accurately estimate PM(2.5) constituents over space.",2019,10.1016/j.envres.2019.05.025,175,NA,421-433,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Machine learning and United States and Machine Learning and Air pollution and Massachusetts and Bayes Theorem and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Air Pollution/*statistics & numerical data and Particulate Matter/*analysis and *Air Pollutants and Geostatistical interpolation and PM(2.5) components,NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Oskar_2021_Envirese,JOUR,Identifying environmental exposure profiles associated with timing of menarche: A two-step machine learning approach to examine multiple environmental exposures,"Oskar, Sabine and Wolff, Mary S. and Teitelbaum, Susan L. and Stingone, Jeanette A.",Environmental research,"BACKGROUND: Variation in the timing of menarche has been linked with adverse health outcomes in later life. There is evidence that exposure to hormonally active agents (or endocrine disrupting chemicals; EDCs) during childhood may play a role in accelerating or delaying menarche. The goal of this study was to generate hypotheses on the relationship between exposure to multiple EDCs and timing of menarche by applying a two-stage machine learning approach. METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 2005-2008. Data were analyzed for 229 female participants 12-16 years of age who had blood and urine biomarker measures of 41 environmental exposures, all with >70% above limit of detection, in seven classes of chemicals. We modeled risk for earlier menarche (<12 years of age vs older) with exposure biomarkers. We applied a two-stage approach consisting of a random forest (RF) to identify important exposure combinations associated with timing of menarche followed by multivariable modified Poisson regression to quantify associations between exposure profiles (""combinations"") and timing of menarche. RESULTS: RF identified urinary concentrations of monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) as the most important feature in partitioning girls into homogenous subgroups followed by bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). In this first stage, we identified 11 distinct exposure biomarker profiles, containing five different classes of EDCs associated with earlier menarche. MEHP appeared in all 11 exposure biomarker profiles and phenols appeared in five. Using these profiles in the second-stage of analysis, we found a relationship between lower MEHP and earlier menarche (MEHP <e2><89><a4> 2.36 ng/mL vs >2.36 ng/mL: adjusted PR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.80). Combinations of lower MEHP with benzophenone-3, 2,4-DCP, and BPA had similar associations with earlier menarche, though slightly weaker in those smaller subgroups. For girls not having lower MEHP, exposure profiles included other biomarkers (BPA, enterodiol, monobenzyl phthalate, triclosan, and 1-hydroxypyrene); these showed largely null associations in the second-stage analysis. Adjustment for covariates did not materially change the estimates or CIs of these models. We observed weak or null effect estimates for some exposure biomarker profiles and relevant profiles consisted of no more than two EDCs, possibly due to small sample sizes in subgroups. CONCLUSION: A two-stage approach incorporating machine learning was able to identify interpretable combinations of biomarkers in relation to timing of menarche; these should be further explored in prospective studies. Machine learning methods can serve as a valuable tool to identify patterns within data and generate hypotheses that can be investigated within future, targeted analyses.",2021,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110524,195,NA,110524,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Machine learning and Humans and Female and Child and Machine Learning and Prospective Studies and Nutrition Surveys and Environmental Exposure and *Environmental Pollutants and Environmental exposures and *Phthalic Acids and Menarche and Mixtures and Multiple exposures,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Finnis_2017_Envirese,JOUR,"Spatiotemporal patterns of paralytic shellfish toxins and their relationships with environmental variables in British Columbia, Canada from 2002 to 2012","Finnis, Stephen and Krstic, Nikolas and McIntyre, Lorraine and Nelson, Trisalyn A. and Henderson, Sarah B.",Environmental research,"BACKGROUND: Harmful algal blooms produce paralytic shellfish toxins that accumulate in the tissues of filter feeding shellfish. Ingestion of these toxic shellfish can cause a serious and potentially fatal condition known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The coast of British Columbia is routinely monitored for shellfish toxicity, and this study uses data from the monitoring program to identify spatiotemporal patterns in shellfish toxicity events and their relationships with environmental variables. METHODS: The dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium produces the most potent paralytic shellfish toxin, saxitoxin (STX). Data on all STX measurements were obtained from 49 different shellfish monitoring sites along the coast of British Columbia for 2002-2012, and monthly toxicity events were identified. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis to group sites that had events in similar areas with similar timing. Machine learning techniques were used to model the complex relationships between toxicity events and environmental variables in each group. RESULTS: The Strait of Georgia and the west coast of Vancouver Island had unique toxicity regimes. Out of the seven environmental variables used, toxicity in each cluster could be described by multivariable models including monthly sea surface temperature, air temperature, sea surface salinity, freshwater discharge, upwelling, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sea surface salinity and freshwater discharge variables produced the strongest univariate models for both geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Applying these methods in coastal regions could allow for the prediction of shellfish toxicity events by environmental conditions. This has the potential to optimize biotoxin monitoring, improve public health surveillance, and engage the shellfish industry in helping to reduce the risk of PSP.",2017,10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.012,156,NA,190-200,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Machine learning and Public health and Machine Learning and Animals and British Columbia and Cluster Analysis and *Environment and *Harmful Algal Bloom and *Shellfish and Biotoxin monitoring and Dinoflagellida/*physiology and Paralytic shellfish poisoning and Saxitoxin/*analysis and Seawater/*analysis and Spatiotemporal pattern analysis,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Labib_2020_Envirese,JOUR,Spatial dimensions of the influence of urban green-blue spaces on human health: A systematic review,"Labib, S. M. and Lindley, Sarah and Huck, Jonny J.",Environmental research,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing volume of literature investigating the links between urban environments and human health, much of which involves spatial conceptualisations and research designs involving various aspects of geographical information science. Despite intensifying research interest, there has been little systematic investigation of pragmatic methodological concerns, such as how studies are realised in terms of the types of data that are gathered and the analytical techniques that are applied, both of which have the potential to impact results. The aim of this systematic review is, therefore, to understand how spatial scale, datasets, methods, and analytics are currently applied in studies investigating the relationship between green and blue spaces and human health in urban areas. METHOD: We systematically reviewed 93 articles following PRISMA protocol, extracted information regarding different spatial dimensions, and synthesised them in relation to various health indicators. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found a preponderance of the use of neighbourhood-scale in these studies, and a majority of the studies utilised land-use and vegetation indices gleaned from moderate resolution satellite imagery. We also observed the frequent adoption of fixed spatial units for measuring exposure to green and blue spaces based on physical proximity, typically ranging between 30 and 5000<e2><80><af>m. The conceptual frameworks of the studies (e.g., the focus on physical vs. mental health or the definition of exposure to green space) were found to have an influence on the strength of association between exposure and health outcomes. Additionally, the strength and significance of associations also varied by study design, something which has not been considered systematically. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our findings, we propose a set of recommendations for standardised protocols and methods for the evaluation of the impact of green-blue spaces on health. Our analysis suggests that future studies should consider conducting analyses at finer spatial scales and employing multiple exposure assessment methods to achieve a comprehensive and comparable evaluation of the association between greenspace and health along multiple pathways.",2020,10.1016/j.envres.2019.108869,180,NA,108869,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Health and Exposure and Epidemiology and Humans and GIS and Urban Health and *Mental Health and *Residence Characteristics and Cities and *Environment and Blue space and Greenspace,NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hao_2019_Ecoandenvsaf,JOUR,Prediction on the mutagenicity of nitroaromatic compounds using quantum chemistry descriptors based QSAR and machine learning derived classification methods,"Hao, Yuxing and Sun, Guohui and Fan, Tengjiao and Sun, Xiaodong and Liu, Yongdong and Zhang, Na and Zhao, Lijiao and Zhong, Rugang and Peng, Yongzhen",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are an important type of environmental organic pollutants. However, it is lack of sufficient information relating to their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment due to the limited resources. Thus, using in silico technologies to assess their potential hazardous effects is urgent and promising. In this study, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and classification models were constructed using a set of NACs based on their mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain. For QSAR studies, DRAGON descriptors together with quantum chemistry descriptors were calculated for characterizing the detailed molecular information. Based on genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses, we screened descriptors and developed QSAR models. For classification studies, seven machine learning methods along with six molecular fingerprints were applied to develop qualitative classification models. The goodness of fitting, reliability, robustness and predictive performance of all developed models were measured by rigorous statistical validation criteria, then the best QSAR and classification models were chosen. Moreover, the QSAR models with quantum chemistry descriptors were compared to that without quantum chemistry descriptors and previously reported models. Notably, we also obtained some specific molecular properties or privileged substructures responsible for the high mutagenicity of NACs. Overall, the developed QSAR and classification models can be utilized as potential tools for rapidly predicting the mutagenicity of new or untested NACs for environmental hazard assessment and regulatory purposes, and may provide insights into the in vivo toxicity mechanisms of NACs and related compounds.",2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109822,186,NA,109822,eng,1090-2414 0147-6513,"Algorithms and Machine Learning and Classification and Reproducibility of Results and Computer Simulation and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship and QSAR and *Environmental Pollutants/chemistry/toxicity and *Hydrocarbons, Aromatic/chemistry/toxicity and *Mutagens/chemistry/toxicity and *Nitro Compounds/chemistry/toxicity and Hazard assessment and Mutagenicity and Nitroaromatic compounds and Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics and Toxicity mechanism",NA,NA,2019/12/30/,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mitigation hinges on understanding which sources are contributing to its toxicity. Black Carbon (BC), an indicator of particles generated from traffic sources, has been associated with a number of health effects however due to its high spatial variability, its concentration is difficult to estimate. We previously fit a model estimating BC concentrations in the greater Boston area; however this model was built using limited monitoring data and could not capture the complex spatio-temporal patterns of ambient BC. In order to improve our predictive ability, we obtained more data for a total of 24,301 measurements from 368 monitors over a 12 year period in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. We also used Nu-Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) - a machine learning technique which incorporates nonlinear terms and higher order interactions, with appropriate regularization of parameter estimates. We then used a generalized additive model to refit the residuals from the nu-SVR and added the residual predictions to our earlier estimates. Both spatial and temporal predictors were included in the model which allowed us to capture the change in spatial patterns of BC over time. The 10 fold cross validated (CV) R(2) of the model was good in both cold (10-fold CV R(2) = 0.87) and warm seasons (CV R(2) = 0.79).

However, few studies have examined the long-term health effects of these pollutants owing in part to a need for exposure surfaces that can be applied in large population-based studies. To address this need, we developed a land use regression model for UFPs in Montreal, Canada using mobile monitoring data collected from 414 road segments during the summer and winter months between 2011 and 2012. Two different approaches were examined for model development including standard multivariable linear regression and a machine learning approach (kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS)) that learns the functional form of covariate impacts on ambient UFP concentrations from the data. The final models included parameters for population density, ambient temperature and wind speed, land use parameters (park space and open space), length of local roads and rail, and estimated annual average NOx emissions from traffic. The final multivariable linear regression model explained 62% of the spatial variation in ambient UFP concentrations whereas the KRLS model explained 79% of the variance. The KRLS model performed slightly better than the linear regression model when evaluated using an external dataset (R(2)=0.58 vs. 0.55) or a cross-validation procedure (R(2)=0.67 vs. 0.60). In general, our findings suggest that the KRLS approach may offer modest improvements in predictive performance compared to standard multivariable linear regression models used to estimate spatial variations in ambient UFPs.

This challenge of information retrieval can be characterized in terms of ""semantic"" and ""conceptual"" factors that render chemical assessments vulnerable to the streetlight effect. OBJECTIVES: This commentary presents how controlled vocabularies, thesauruses, and ontologies contribute to overcoming the streetlight effect in information retrieval, making up the key components of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) that enable more systematic access to assessment-relevant information than is currently achievable. The concept of Adverse Outcome Pathways is used to illustrate what a general KOS for use in chemical assessment could look like. DISCUSSION: Ontologies are an underexploited element of effective knowledge organization in the environmental health sciences. Agreeing on and implementing ontologies in chemical assessment is a complex but tractable process with four fundamental steps. Successful implementation of ontologies would not only make currently fragmented information about health risks from chemical exposures vastly more accessible, it could ultimately enable computational methods for chemical assessment that can take advantage of the full richness of data described in natural language in primary studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6994.",2020,10.1289/EHP6994,128,12,125001,eng,1552-9924 0091-6765,Humans and Artificial Intelligence and *Environmental Health and *Environmental Pollutants and Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Environ Health Perspect,NA,NA,NA,NA

Maternal smoking may induce such long-term effects through persistent changes in the DNA methylome, which therefore hold the potential to be used as a biomarker of this early life exposure. With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier (""Reese Score"") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.",2020,10.1289/EHP6076,128,9,97003,eng,1552-9924 0091-6765,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Pregnancy and *Machine Learning and Biomarkers/blood and Smoking/*epidemiology and Finland/epidemiology and *DNA Methylation and Maternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data and Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Environ Health Perspect,NA,NA,NA,NA
Luo_2020_Envirese,JOUR,Metal mixtures and kidney function: An application of machine learning to NHANES data,"Luo, Juhua and Hendryx, Michael",Environmental research,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to heavy metals may increase risk of kidney disease, but most studies have examined individual metals or two-way interactions. There is increasing recognition of the importance of studying exposure to metal mixtures and health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We used Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to examine associations between a mixture of four heavy metals and indicators of kidney function. METHODS: We used NHANES 2015-16 data on 1435 adults aged 40 and over to study cross-sectional associations between blood levels of four heavy metals (Co, Cr, Hg and Pb) and kidney function. Kidney function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and by albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), measured continuously and dichotomized into indicators of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and albuminuria, respectively. BKMR tested for non-linearity in the exposure-specific responses to evaluate dose-response relationships between mixtures and outcomes and possible interaction effects among exposures. Interactions among continuous outcomes were identified using the NLinteraction package in R. RESULTS: A higher metals mixture was significantly associated with all four measures of kidney function in dose-response patterns. Pb had the strongest association with eGFR, albuminuria and ACR, and the second strongest association with CKD. We also observed an interaction between Pb and Co for eGFR and an interaction between Pb and Cd for ACR. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to a co-occurring heavy metals mixture was associated with indicators of poor kidney function. Within this mixture, Pb, Co and Cd considered singly and jointly made the greatest contributions to the observed effects. Future prospective study is needed to confirm the association between metal mixtures and kidney function.",2020,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110126,191,NA,110126,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Cross-Sectional Studies and Machine Learning and Prospective Studies and Bayes Theorem and *Kidney and *Nutrition Surveys,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, in this study, a new indoor air quality (IAQ) index is proposed based on toxicity assessment by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The new indices called comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CIAT) and cumulative comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CCIAT) suggests the new standards based on toxicity assessment of PM(2.5).

In this paper, the sources of cadmium (Cd) and their effects on Cd accumulation in soil and rice grown on urban farmland in Changzhutan were investigated. Among the main Cd sources (irrigation water, commercial fertilizer, and atmospheric deposition), the input flux of atmospheric deposition accounted for 76.36%-98.25% of total input flux, significantly higher than the input fluxes of irrigation water and commercial fertilizer. Manure fertilizer was also an important source of Cd in livestock breeding areas. The accumulation behaviors of Cd in soils and plants presented significant spatial variation among the study areas. Higher Cd input flux from atmospheric deposition resulted in higher Cd bioavailability in soil and more Cd accumulation in rice, and the newly deposited Cd contributed 7.35-41.23% in rice tissues. The use of manure fertilizer increased the soil pH and amount of available Cd in soil, as well as the accumulation of Cd in rice roots. Based on sequential extraction, acid-extractable Cd accounted for approximately 52.54%-61.88% of total Cd in atmospherically deposited particles in the study area, resulting in a high proportion of acid-extractable Cd in soil.

Wang_2019_Envirese,JOUR,Urban greenery and mental wellbeing in adults: Cross-sectional mediation analyses on multiple pathways across different greenery measures,"Wang, Ruoyu and Helbich, Marco and Yao, Yao and Zhang, Jinbao and Liu, Penghua and Yuan, Yuan and Liu, Ye",Environmental research,"BACKGROUND: Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how greenery in the vicinity of people's homes enhances their mental health and wellbeing. Mediation studies, however, focus on a limited number of mechanisms and rely on remotely sensed greenery measures, which do not accurately capture how neighborhood greenery is perceived on the ground. OBJECTIVE: To examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect people's mental wellbeing; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred. METHODS: We used a population sample of 1029 adult residents of the metropolis of Guangzhou, China, from 2016. Mental wellbeing was quantified by the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Two objective greenery measures were extracted at the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a convolutional neural network, and 2) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Single and multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted. RESULTS: Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for 22% of the association. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and satellite-derived greenery seem to be both directly correlated and indirectly mediated. Our findings signify that both greenery measures capture different aspects of natural environments and may contribute to people's wellbeing by means of different mechanisms.",2019,10.1016/j.envres.2019.108535,176,NA,108535,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,China and Humans and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Deep learning and Mediation and Air Pollution and Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data and *Residence Characteristics and Environment Design and Green space and Mental wellbeing and Street view data,NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to identify and apportion multi-source and multi-phase Cd pollution from natural and anthropogenic inputs using ensemble models that include random forest (RF) in agricultural soils on Karst areas. The contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to Cd accumulation were quantitatively assessed using the RF machine learning method. The results revealed that the main influencing factors were pH, organic carbon (C(org)), and elevation. Moreover, the interaction effects of pH and C(org) on distance and elevation were also quantified and visualised. It is observed that pH and C(org) had stronger effects on soil Cd concentration than that of distance when pH > 7.02 and C(org) > 1.53. In other words, higher Cd content in the soil along roadways may be caused by the interaction of distance, pH and C(org), with pH and C(org) playing the dominant role in our case. Moreover, the maximum contribution of a single factor, elevation, to Cd concentration was about 0.13 mg/kg, and its interactions reached 1.082 mg/kg and 0.83 mg/kg, respectively, when combined with pH and C(org) at 194.0 m. However, with increasing elevation, pH and C(org) gradually took over the leading roles.

Y. and Chin, Christopher Kuan Yew and Lo, Andrew and Kong, Waiming and Ng, Lee Ching and Cook, Alex R.",Environmental health perspectives,"BACKGROUND: With its tropical rainforest climate, rapid urbanization, and changing demography and ecology, Singapore experiences endemic dengue; the last large outbreak in 2013 culminated in 22,170 cases. In the absence of a vaccine on the market, vector control is the key approach for prevention. OBJECTIVES: We sought to forecast the evolution of dengue epidemics in Singapore to provide early warning of outbreaks and to facilitate the public health response to moderate an impending outbreak. METHODS: We developed a set of statistical models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods to forecast the weekly incidence of dengue notifications over a 3-month time horizon. This forecasting tool used a variety of data streams and was updated weekly, including recent case data, meteorological data, vector surveillance data, and population-based national statistics. The forecasting methodology was compared with alternative approaches that have been proposed to model dengue case data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average and step-down linear regression) by fielding them on the 2013 dengue epidemic, the largest on record in Singapore. RESULTS: Operationally useful forecasts were obtained at a 3-month lag using the LASSO-derived models. Based on the mean average percentage error, the LASSO approach provided more accurate forecasts than the other methods we assessed. We demonstrate its utility in Singapore's dengue control program by providing a forecast of the 2013 outbreak for advance preparation of outbreak response. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical models built using machine learning methods such as LASSO have the potential to markedly improve forecasting techniques for recurrent infectious disease outbreaks such as dengue.

Finally, we describe a case study in Sweden that illustrates the critical role of communication to engage stakeholders and promote action. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental releases of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria can in many cases be reduced at little or no cost.

METHODS: We examined the relationship of social and physical environmental attributes of the school environment (within school and neighborhood) and childhood obesity in California with machine learning (Random Forest) and multilevel methods. We used data compiled from the California Department of Education, the U.S. Geological Survey, ESRI's Business Analyst, the U.S. Census, and other public sources for ecologic level variables for various years and assessed their relative importance to obesity as determined from the statewide Physical Fitness Test 2003 through 2007 for grades 5, 7, and 9 (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>5,265,265). RESULTS: In addition to individual-level race and gender, the following within and school neighborhood variables ranked as the most important model contributors based on the Random Forest analysis and were included in multilevel regressions clustered on the county. Violent crime, English learners, socioeconomic disadvantage, fewer physical education (PE) and fully credentialed teachers, and diversity index were positively associated with obesity while academic performance index, PE participation, mean educational attainment and per capita income were negatively associated with obesity. The most highly ranked built or physical environment variables were distance to the nearest highway and greenness, which were 10th and 11th most important, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Many states in the U.S. do not have school-based surveillance programs that collect body mass index data. System-level determinants of obesity can be important for tracking and intervention. The results of these analyses suggest that the school social environment factors may be especially important. Disadvantaged and low academic performing schools have a higher risk for obesity.

Blum_2020_Envihealpers,JOUR,Challenges Raised by Mediation Analysis in a High-Dimension Setting,"Blum, Michael G. B. and Valeri, Linda and Francois, Olivier and Cadiou, Solene and Siroux, Valerie and Lepeule, Johanna and Slama, Remy",Environmental health perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Mediation analysis is used in epidemiology to identify pathways through which exposures influence health. The advent of high-throughput (omics) technologies gives opportunities to perform mediation analysis with a high-dimension pool of covariates. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to highlight some biostatistical issues of this expanding field of high-dimension mediation. DISCUSSION: The mediation techniques used for a single mediator cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to high-dimension mediation. Causal knowledge on the relation between covariates is required for mediation analysis, and it is expected to be more limited as dimension and system complexity increase. The methods developed in high dimension can be distinguished according to whether mediators are considered separately or as a whole. Methods considering each potential mediator separately do not allow efficient identification of the indirect effects when mutual influences exist among the mediators, which is expected for many biological (e.g., epigenetic) parameters. In this context, methods considering all potential mediators simultaneously, based, for example, on data reduction techniques, are more adapted to the causal inference framework. Their cost is a possible lack of ability to single out the causal mediators. Moreover, the ability of the mediators to predict the outcome can be overestimated, in particular because many machine-learning algorithms are optimized to increase predictive ability rather than their aptitude to make causal inference. Given the lack of overarching validated framework and the generally complex causal structure of high-dimension data, analysis of high-dimension mediation currently requires great caution and effort to incorporate a priori biological knowledge. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6240.",2020,10.1289/EHP6240,128,5,55001,eng,1552-9924 0091-6765,"Humans and Models, Statistical and *Mediation Analysis",NA,NA,2020/05//undefined,Environ Health Perspect,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gu_2020_Envirese,JOUR,Source identification of phosphorus in the river-lake interconnected system using microbial community fingerprints,"Gu, Jinfei and Zhang, Wenlong and Li, Yi and Niu, Lihua and Wang, Longfei and Zhang, Huanjun",Environmental research,"Phosphorus, one of the primary limiting factors for eutrophication, plays a crucial role in the ecology health of aquatic ecosystems. However, understanding phosphorus bioavailability and source contributions in contaminated lake sediments which could help develop effective eutrophication management plans is limited largely due to the lack of appropriate methods in large catchments with a complex arrangement of sources. Based on the significant relationships between sediment, phosphorus and microbial community, source-specific microbial community fingerprints formed by machine-learning classification SourceTracker might shed light on determining dominant phosphorus sources in the river-lake systems in the era of high-throughput sequencing. This study was conducted in Dongting Lake that suffered accelerated eutrophication due to considerable phosphorus input from the inflow-rivers. The results of phosphorus fractionation according to the Standards, Measurements and Testing harmonized procedure indicated that sediments in the central lake had a higher concentration of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (Mann-Whitney U test), which deserves greater attention on the risk of phosphorus release. The significant relationships between phosphorus fractionations, sediment and bacterial community were established with the spearman correlation and network analysis. SourceTracker analysis indicated that the major inflow-rivers of phosphorus sources to Dongting Lake were the Songzi, Miluo, and Xinqiang Rivers.

However, chemicals distribute unevenly among different biological media; thus, each medium provides incomplete information about body burden. We propose that machine learning and statistical approaches can create integrated exposure estimates from multiple biomarker matrices that better represent the overall body burden, which we term multi-media biomarkers (MMBs). We measured lead (Pb) in blood, urine, hair and nails from 251 Italian adolescents aged 11-14 years from the Public Health Impact of Metals Exposure (PHIME) cohort. We derived aggregated MMBs from the four biomarkers and then tested their association with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) IQ scores. We used three approaches to derive the Pb MMB: one supervised learning technique, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), and two unsupervised learning techniques, independent component analysis (ICA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Overall, the Pb MMB derived using WQS was most consistently associated with IQ scores and was the only method to be statistically significant for Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Total IQ. A one standard deviation increase in the WQS MMB was associated with lower Verbal IQ (<ce><b2> [95% CI] = -2.2 points [-3.7, -0.6]), Performance IQ (-1.9 points [-3.5, -0.4]) and Total IQ (-2.1 points [-3.8, -0.5]). Blood Pb was negatively associated with only Verbal IQ, with a one standard deviation increase in blood Pb being associated with a -1.7 point (95% CI: [-3.3, -0.1]) decrease in Verbal IQ. Increases of one standard deviation in the ICA MMB were associated with lower Verbal IQ (-1.7 points [-3.3, -0.1]) and lower Total IQ (-1.7 points [-3.3, -0.1]). Similarly, an increase of one standard deviation in the NMF MMB was associated with lower Verbal IQ (-1.8 points [-3.4, -0.2]) and lower Total IQ (-1.8 points [-3.4, -0.2]). Weights highlighting the contributions of each medium to the MMB revealed that blood Pb was the largest contributor to most MMBs, although the weights varied from more than 80% for the ICA and NMF MMBs to between 30% and 54% for the WQS-derived MMBs. Our results suggest that MMBs better reflect the total body burden of a chemical that may be acting on target organs than individual biomarkers. Estimating MMBs improved our ability to estimate the full impact of Pb on IQ. Compared with individual Pb biomarkers, including blood, a Pb MMB derived using WQS was more strongly associated with IQ scores. MMBs may increase statistical power when the choice of exposure medium is unclear or when the sample size is small. Future work will need to validate these methods in other cohorts and for other chemicals.",2020,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109148,183,NA,109148,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Italy and Intelligence Tests and *Machine Learning and Neurodevelopment and *Biomarkers and *Body Burden and *Lead/toxicity and Exposure assessment and Lead and Wechsler Scales,NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

We then used Poisson generalized estimating equations to calculate the effect of exposure to 24-hour average PM2.5 on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations and ED visits. We further assessed effect modification by sex, age, and area-level socioeconomic status (SES). We observed a linear increase in risk for asthma hospitalizations (RR=1.07, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.10) per 5<c2><b5>g/m(3) increase) and asthma ED visits (RR=1.06, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.07) per 5<c2><b5>g/m(3) increase) with increasing PM2.5 during the wildfires. ED visits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with PM2.5 during the fires (RR=1.02 (95% CI=(1.01, 1.04) per 5<c2><b5>g/m(3) increase) and this effect was significantly different from that found before the fires but not after. We did not find consistent effects of wildfire smoke on other health outcomes. The effect of PM2.5 during the wildfire period was more pronounced in women compared to men and in adults, ages 20-64, compared to children and adults 65 or older. We also found some effect modification by area-level median income for respiratory ED visits during the wildfires, with the highest effects observed in the ZIP codes with the lowest median income. Using a novel spatiotemporal exposure model, we found some evidence of differential susceptibility to exposure to wildfire smoke.",2016,10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.012,150,NA,227-235,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,"Asthma and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Aged and Time Factors and Models, Theoretical and Risk Factors and Air pollution and Aged, 80 and over and Infant, Newborn and Poisson Distribution and Vulnerable populations and Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data and Disasters and California/epidemiology and *Fires and *Environmental Exposure and Particle Size and *Smoke and Air Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity and Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology and Climate change and Particulate Matter/analysis/*toxicity and Respiratory Tract Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology and Wildland fires",NA,NA,2016/10//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kelly_2021_Envirese,JOUR,Examining PM(2.5) concentrations and exposure using multiple models,"Kelly, James T. and Jang, Carey and Timin, Brian and Di, Qian and Schwartz, Joel and Liu, Yang and van Donkelaar, Aaron and Martin, Randall V. and Berrocal, Veronica and Bell, Michelle L.",Environmental research,"Epidemiologic studies have found associations between fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) exposure and adverse health effects using exposure models that incorporate monitoring data and other relevant information. Here, we use nine PM(2.5) concentration models (i.e., exposure models) that span a wide range of methods to investigate i) PM(2.5) concentrations in 2011, ii) potential changes in PM(2.5) concentrations between 2011 and 2028 due to on-the-books regulations, and iii) PM(2.5) exposure for the U.S. population and four racial/ethnic groups. The exposure models included two geophysical chemical transport models (CTMs), two interpolation methods, a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth-based method, a Bayesian statistical regression model, and three data-rich machine learning methods. We focused on annual predictions that were regridded to 12-km resolution over the conterminous U.S., but also considered 1-km predictions in sensitivity analyses. The exposure models predicted broadly consistent PM(2.5) concentrations, with relatively high concentrations on average over the eastern U.S. and greater variability in the western U.S. However, differences in national concentration distributions (median standard deviation: 1.00 <ce><bc>g m(-3)) and spatial distributions over urban areas were evident. Further exploration of these differences and their implications for specific applications would be valuable. PM(2.5) concentrations were estimated to decrease by about 1 <ce><bc>g m(-3) on average due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028, with decreases of more than 3 <ce><bc>g m(-3) in areas with relatively high 2011 concentrations that were projected to experience relatively large emission reductions. Agreement among models was closer for population-weighted than uniformly weighted averages across the domain. About 50% of the population was estimated to experience PM(2.5) concentrations less than 10 <ce><bc>g m(-3) in 2011 and PM(2.5) improvements of about 2 <ce><bc>g m(-3) due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028. Two inequality metrics were used to characterize differences in exposure among the four racial/ethnic groups. The metrics generally yielded consistent information and suggest that the modeled emission reductions between 2011 and 2028 would reduce absolute exposure inequality on average.",2021,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110432,196,NA,110432,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,"Models, Statistical and Bayes Theorem and Environmental Monitoring and Particulate Matter/analysis and *Air Pollutants/analysis and *Air Pollution/analysis and Aerosols/analysis and Air quality modeling and Ensemble modeling and Exposure inequality and PM(2.5)",NA,NA,2021/05//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to explore the association among rural Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 8033 participants (18-79 years) derived from the Henan Rural Cohort Study (n = 39,259) were included in this cross-sectional study. Exposure to air pollutants was estimated using machine learning algorithms with satellite remote sensing, land use information, and meteorological data [including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <e2><89><a4>1.0 <ce><bc>m (PM(1)), <e2><89><a4>2.5 <ce><bc>m (PM(2.5)), and <e2><89><a4>10 <ce><bc>m (PM(10)), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2))]. The bone mineral density of each individual was measured by using ultrasonic bone density apparatus and osteoporosis was defined based on the T-score <e2><89><a4> -2.5. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of air pollution and osteoporosis prevalence. RESULTS: We observed that per 1 <ce><bc>g/m(3) increase in PM(1), PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2) were associated with a 14.9%, 14.6%, 7.3%, and 16.5% elevated risk of osteoporosis. Compared with individuals in the first quartile, individuals in the fourth quartile had higher odds ratio (OR) of osteoporosis (P-trend < 0.001), the ORs (95% confidence interval) were 2.08 (1.72, 2.50) for PM(1), 2.28 (1.90, 2.74) for PM(2.5), 1.93 (1.60, 2.32) for PM(10), and 2.02 (1.68, 2.41) for NO(2). It was estimated that 20.29%-24.36% of osteoporosis cases could be attributable to air pollution in the rural population from China. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to air pollutants were positively associated with high-risk of osteoporosis, indicated that improving air quality may be beneficial to improve rural residents health.",2020,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109264,183,NA,109264,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,Humans and Osteoporosis and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Cohort Studies and Prevalence and Environmental Exposure and Rural population and China/epidemiology and *Rural Population and *Air Pollution and Particulate Matter and *Air Pollutants/toxicity and *Osteoporosis/epidemiology and Air pollutants and Nitrogen Dioxide and Particulate matter and PM(1),NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
Deo_2017_Envirese,JOUR,Very short-term reactive forecasting of the solar ultraviolet index using an extreme learning machine integrated with the solar zenith angle,"Deo, Ravinesh C. and Downs, Nathan and Parisi, Alfio V. and Adamowski, Jan F. and Quilty, John M.",Environmental research,"Exposure to erythemally-effective solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that contributes to malignant keratinocyte cancers and associated health-risk is best mitigated through innovative decision-support systems, with global solar UV index (UVI) forecast necessary to inform real-time sun-protection behaviour recommendations. It follows that the UVI forecasting models are useful tools for such decision-making. In this study, a model for computationally-efficient data-driven forecasting of diffuse and global very short-term reactive (VSTR) (10-min lead-time) UVI, enhanced by drawing on the solar zenith angle (<ce><b8>(s)) data, was developed using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. An ELM algorithm typically serves to address complex and ill-defined forecasting problems. UV spectroradiometer situated in Toowoomba, Australia measured daily cycles (0500-1700h) of UVI over the austral summer period. After trialling activations functions based on sine, hard limit, logarithmic and tangent sigmoid and triangular and radial basis networks for best results, an optimal ELM architecture utilising logarithmic sigmoid equation in hidden layer, with lagged combinations of <ce><b8>(s) as the predictor data was developed. ELM's performance was evaluated using statistical metrics: correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E(NS)), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) between observed and forecasted UVI. Using these metrics, the ELM model's performance was compared to that of existing methods: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 Model Tree, and a semi-empirical (Pro6UV) clear sky model. Based on RMSE and MAE values, the ELM model (0.255, 0.346, respectively) outperformed the MARS (0.310, 0.438) and M5 Model Tree (0.346, 0.466) models. Concurring with these metrics, the Willmott's Index for the ELM, MARS and M5 Model Tree models were 0.966, 0.942 and 0.934, respectively. About 57% of the ELM model's absolute errors were small in magnitude (<c2><b1>0.25), whereas the MARS and M5 Model Tree models generated 53% and 48% of such errors, respectively, indicating the latter models' errors to be distributed in larger magnitude error range. In terms of peak global UVI forecasting, with half the level of error, the ELM model outperformed MARS and M5 Model Tree. A comparison of the magnitude of hourly-cumulated errors of 10-min lead time forecasts for diffuse and global UVI highlighted ELM model's greater accuracy compared to MARS, M5 Model Tree or Pro6UV models. This confirmed the versatility of an ELM model drawing on <ce><b8>(s)data for VSTR forecasting of UVI at near real-time horizon. When applied to the goal of enhancing expert systems, ELM-based accurate forecasts capable of reacting quickly to measured conditions can enhance real-time exposure advice for the public, mitigating the potential for solar UV-exposure-related disease.",2017,10.1016/j.envres.2017.01.035,155,NA,141-166,eng,1096-0953 0013-9351,"Reproducibility of Results and *Machine Learning and *Models, Theoretical and *Forecasting and Queensland and *Ultraviolet Rays and Extreme learning machine and M5 Model Tree and Multivariate adaptive regression splines and Real-time solar forecasting and Solar ultraviolet index (UVI) and Sunlight",NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,Environ Res,NA,NA,NA,NA
