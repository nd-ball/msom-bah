Vaishya_2020_D.ms,JOUR,Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for COVID-19 pandemic,"Vaishya, Raju and Javaid, Mohd and Khan, Ibrahim Haleem and Haleem, Abid",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthcare delivery requires the support of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Machine Learning to fight and look ahead against the new diseases. We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics. METHODS: The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease. RESULTS: We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.

Loke_2020_Do.m,JOUR,Propensity score methods in real-world epidemiology: A practical guide for first-time users,"Loke, Yoon Kong and Mattishent, Katharina","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Real-world epidemiology gives us the unique opportunity to observe large numbers of people, and the actions and events that characterize their encounters with healthcare providers. However, the heterogeneity and sheer diversity of the population and healthcare systems makes it impossible for researchers to compare ""like with like"" when attempting to draw causal inferences about interventions and outcomes. The critical issue in epidemiological datasets relates to high risk of bias due to confounders that stem from baseline differences between groups. Propensity score (PS) techniques are statistical approaches that have been used to tackle potential imbalance in the comparison groups. The PS is the estimated probability (based on measured baseline covariates) that the patient receives a particular intervention. Patients that share similar PS will most likely have the same distributions of underlying covariates included in the PS. Implementation of PS methods may achieve better balance of covariates, but there is no consensus on the best way of capturing all relevant confounders for incorporation into the PS model. Should covariates be selected by clinical or epidemiological experts, or would data-driven algorithms (machine learning) offer more efficient and reliable methods of estimating PS and controlling for confounding? The PS can be incorporated into the analysis in different ways, each with its own strengths and limitations, and researchers must choose the best fit for their study objectives. PS methods are particularly advantageous in situations where there are large numbers of measured covariates but relatively few outcome events captured in healthcare administrative databases.",2020,10.1111/dom.13926,22 Suppl 3,NA,13-20,eng,1463-1326 1462-8902,"Humans and Causality and Bias and *Algorithms and Propensity Score and *Models, Statistical and pharmaco-epidemiology",NA,NA,2020/04//undefined,Diabetes Obes Metab,NA,NA,NA,NA

We searched the MEDLINE database from January 1990 to October 2008. According to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group (EPOC) criteria, (cluster-)randomized control studies and controlled before-and-after studies were selected and reviewed. Identified interventions were classified according to a modified EPOC intervention taxonomy. We included 68 studies. Forty-five studies evaluated the effect of any intervention on HbA1c. Seventeen studies presented a significant improvement in HbA1c. Nine out of 27 studies evaluating CVRFs [cholesterol, blood pressure (BP)] and HbA1c showed a significant improvement in at least two of these factors. Audit and feedback on performance, clinical decision support systems, multi-professional teams and patient education seemed to be successful strategies. The increasing evidence regarding the treatment of persons with chronic illnesses, summarized in the Chronic Care Model (CCM), is not reflected in most recent studies about diabetes treatment in PC.

METHODS: Data were accessed from 4050 general practices (50% of total) covering 1.6 million patients with T2DM in the UK National Diabetes Audit 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015. This audit reported characteristics, services and outcomes in the T2DM population, including percentage of patients who had total glycaemic control (TGC), defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <e2><89><a4>7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and the percentage who were at higher glycaemic risk (HGR), defined as HbA1c >10% (86 mmol/mol); the respective figures were 67.2% and 6.2%. The medication data were examined in terms of annual defined daily doses (DDDs). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify associations between DDD and patient and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Over the period 2012/2013 to 2015/2016, patient numbers grew 4% annually and annual medication expenditure by 8%, but glycaemic control outcomes did not improve. The main findings were that practices with better outcomes: had a higher percentage of patients aged >65 years; provided more effective diabetes services (including case identification, care checks, patient education, percentage of patients with blood pressure and cholesterol under control and more patients with type 1 diabetes achieving target HbA1c levels); spent less overall on prescribing per patient with T2DM; and on average, prescribed fewer sulphonylureas, less insulin (for patients with T2DM), fewer glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, more metformin, more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and more blood glucose monitoring strips. Ethnicity and social disadvantage and levels of thiazolidinedione (glitazone) prescribing had no significant impact on outcomes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor use was too low for an effect to be observed in the period examined. CONCLUSIONS: If all practices brought their service and medication to the level of the top decile practices, they could achieve 74.7% compared with the median of 67.3% of patients achieving TGC, showing an increase of 213 000 in patients achieving TGC, while reducing the number at HGR to 3.8% compared with 6.1%, benefiting 62 000 patients.

Wang_2018_TlD.e,JOUR,Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes,"Wang, Dong D. and Hu, Frank B.",The lancet. Diabetes & endocrinology,"Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.",2018,10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30037-8,6,5,416-426,eng,2213-8595 2213-8587,"Humans and Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Metabolomics and Precision Medicine/*methods/trends and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diet therapy/genetics/metabolism and Nutrigenomics and Nutrition Therapy/*methods/trends",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,NA,NA,NA,NA

This term refers to very large data sets that can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and associations. In medicine-including diabetes care and research-big data come from three main sources: electronic medical records (EMRs), surveys and registries, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These systems have evolved in different ways, each with strengths and limitations. EMRs continuously accumulate information about patients and make it readily accessible but are limited by missing data or data that are not quality assured. Because EMRs vary in structure and management, comparisons of data between health systems may be difficult. Registries and surveys provide data that are consistently collected and representative of broad populations but are limited in scope and may be updated only intermittently. RCT databases excel in the specificity, completeness, and accuracy of their data, but rarely include a fully representative sample of the general population. Also, they are costly to build and seldom maintained after a trial's end.

Diabetes & endocrinology,"BACKGROUND: The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial investigated whether long-term cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality could be reduced through a weight loss intervention among people with type 2 diabetes. Despite finding no significant reduction in cardiovascular events on average, it is possible that some subpopulations might have derived benefit. In this post-hoc analysis, we test the hypothesis that the overall neutral average treatment effect in the trial masked important heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) from intensive weight loss interventions. METHODS: We used causal forest modelling, which identifies HTEs, using a random half of the trial data (the training set). We applied Cox proportional hazards models to test the potential HTEs on the remaining half of the data (the testing set). The analysis was deemed exempt from review by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board, Protocol ID# AAAO3003. FINDINGS: Between Aug 22, 2001, and April 30, 2004, 5145 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the Look AHEAD randomised controlled trial, of whom 4901 were included in the The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Repository and included in our analyses: 2450 for model development and 2451 in the testing dataset. Baseline HbA(1c) and self-reported general health distinguished participants who differentially benefited from the intervention. Cox models for the primary composite cardiovascular outcome revealed a number needed to treat of 28<c2><b7>9 to prevent 1 event over 9<c2><b7>6 years among participants with HbA(1c) 6<c2><b7>8% or higher, or both HbA(1c) less than 6<c2><b7>8% and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) general health score of 48 or more (2101 [86%] of 2451 participants in the testing dataset; 167 [16%] of 1046 primary outcome events for intervention vs 205 [19%] of 1055 for control, absolute risk reduction of 3<c2><b7>46%, 95% CI 0<c2><b7>21-6<c2><b7>73%, p=0<c2><b7>038) By contrast, participants with HbA(1c) less than 6<c2><b7>8% and baseline SF-36 general health score of less than 48 (350 [14%] of 2451 participants in the testing data; 27 [16%] of 171 primary outcome events for intervention vs 15 [8%] of 179 primary outcome events for control) had an absolute risk increase of the primary outcome of 7<c2><b7>41% (0<c2><b7>60 to 14<c2><b7>22, p=0<c2><b7>003). INTERPRETATION: Look AHEAD participants with moderately or poorly controlled diabetes (HbA(1c) 6<c2><b7>8% or higher) and subjects with well controlled diabetes (HbA(1c) less than 6<c2><b7>8%) and good self-reported health (85% of the overall study population) averted cardiovascular events from a behavioural intervention aimed at weight loss. However, 15% of participants with well controlled diabetes and poor self-reported general health experienced negative effects that rendered the overall study outcome neutral.

However, there have been instances when the infected person forgets his/her contact-persons and does not have their contact details. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities and challenges of integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: The study applied literature search from Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE and WHO COVID-19 reports and guidelines analyzed. RESULTS: While the integration of technology-based contact tracing applications to combat COVID-19 and break transmission chains promise to yield better results, these technologies face challenges such as technical limitations, dealing with asymptomatic individuals, lack of supporting ICT infrastructure and electronic health policy, socio-economic inequalities, deactivation of mobile devices' WIFI, GPS services, interoperability and standardization issues, security risks, privacy issues, political and structural responses, ethical and legal risks, consent and voluntariness, abuse of contact tracing apps, and discrimination. CONCLUSION: Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus.

Hamish B.",The lancet. Diabetes & endocrinology,"Preservation of gonadal function is an important priority for the long-term health of cancer survivors of both sexes and all ages at treatment. Loss of opportunity for fertility is a prime concern in both male and female cancer survivors, but endocrine effects of gonadal damage are likewise central to long-term health and wellbeing. Some fertility preservation techniques, such as semen and embryo cryopreservation, are established and successful in adults, and development of oocyte vitrification has greatly improved the potential to cryopreserve unfertilised oocytes. Despite being recommended for all pubertal male patients, sperm banking is not universally practised in paediatric oncology centres, and very few adolescent-friendly facilities exist. All approaches to fertility preservation have specific challenges in children and teenagers, including ethical, practical, and scientific issues. For young women, cryopreservation of ovarian cortical tissue with later replacement has resulted in at least 40 livebirths, but is still regarded as experimental in most countries. For prepubertal boys, testicular biopsy cryopreservation is offered in some centres, but how that tissue might be used in the future is unclear, and so far no evidence suggests that fertility can be restored. For both sexes, these approaches involve an invasive procedure and have an uncertain risk of tissue contamination in haematological and other malignancies. Decision making for all these approaches needs assessment of the individual's risk of fertility loss, and is made at a time of emotional distress.

Diabetes & endocrinology,"BACKGROUND: In view of substantial mis-estimation of risks of diabetes complications using existing equations, we sought to develop updated Risk Equations for Complications Of type 2 Diabetes (RECODe). METHODS: To develop and validate these risk equations, we used data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study (ACCORD, n=9635; 2001-09) and validated the equations for microvascular events using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS, n=1018; 1996-2001), and for cardiovascular events using data from the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD, n=4760; 2001-12). Microvascular outcomes were nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular outcomes were myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. We also included all-cause mortality as an outcome. We used a cross-validating machine learning method to select predictor variables from demographic characteristics, clinical variables, comorbidities, medications, and biomarkers into Cox proportional hazards models for each outcome. The new equations were compared to older risk equations by assessing model discrimination, calibration, and the net reclassification index. FINDINGS: All equations had moderate internal and external discrimination (C-statistics 0<c2><b7>55-0<c2><b7>84 internally, 0<c2><b7>57-0<c2><b7>79 externally) and high internal and external calibration (slopes 0<c2><b7>71-1<c2><b7>31 between observed and estimated risk).

Sr",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify peer-reviewed medical literature on the use of telemedicine in patients with Types I or II DM in the United States, assess its impact on self-management processes and clinical outcomes of care, and to delineate research gaps. METHODS: We utilized a structured scoping review protocol to conduct this research. We searched the published medical literature utilizing two databases, PubMed and CINHAL, and we included all original research articles published prior to July 20th, 2018. Using a 4-step systematic approach, we identified, reviewed, extracted and summarized data from all relevant studies. RESULTS: We identified 47 articles overall. Telemedicine impact was reported as positive in articles addressing the following components of patient self-management: adherence to blood glucose monitoring, day-to-day decision-making related to self-care, and adherence with medications. The most commonly reported clinical outcome was HbA1c level. Few or no studies evaluated impact on long term clinical outcomes such as blindness, amputation, cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, or mortality. DISCUSSION: This scoping review provides important information about studies conducted in the United States evaluating the impact of telemedicine on patient self-management and on clinical outcomes in patients with DM. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that telemedicine has a positive impact on self-management processes and on HbA1c levels. However, future evaluative reviews are necessary to confirm and quantitate the impact of telemedicine on self-management processes and primary studies are necessary to evaluate its impact on long term clinical outcomes.",2019,10.1016/j.dsx.2019.02.014,13,2,1353-1357,eng,1878-0334 1871-4021,"Humans and Patient Compliance and Telemedicine and Diabetes mellitus and Prognosis and Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring and Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods and Telemedicine/*methods and e-Health and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*therapy and Self-Management/*methods and Blood Glucose/analysis and Outcome assessment (health care) and Telehealth and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*therapy",NA,NA,2019/04//Mar undefined,Diabetes Metab Syndr,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four years of data were extracted from a hospital electronic health record system. This included laboratory and point-of-care blood glucose (BG) values to identify biochemical and clinically significant hypoglycemic episodes (BG <e2><89><a4>3.9 and <e2><89><a4>2.9 mmol/L, respectively). We used patient demographics, administered medications, vital signs, laboratory results, and procedures performed during the hospital stays to inform the model. Two iterations of the data set included the doses of insulin administered and the past history of inpatient hypoglycemia. Eighteen different prediction models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) through a 10-fold cross validation. RESULTS: We analyzed data obtained from 17,658 inpatients with diabetes who underwent 32,758 admissions between July 2014 and August 2018. The predictive factors from the logistic regression model included people undergoing procedures, weight, type of diabetes, oxygen saturation level, use of medications (insulin, sulfonylurea, and metformin), and albumin levels. The machine learning model with the best performance was the XGBoost model (AUROC 0.96). This outperformed the logistic regression model, which had an AUROC of 0.75 for the estimation of the risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced machine learning models are superior to logistic regression models in predicting the risk of hypoglycemia in inpatients with diabetes.

Till now there are no vaccines and explicit medicines available for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, therefore the initiatives like public health and social measures are helpful in limiting the quantity of contaminations and saving lives. Keeping this in view, an attempt has been made in the present work to identify the barriers which hinder the implementation of these public health and social measures METHODS: The barriers to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19 are identified using systematic literature review and these barriers are then categorized using Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. RESULTS: Results reveal that among ten identified barriers, Lack of resources for implementing public health and social measures is found to be the most influential barrier to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19.

W. and So, Wing-Yee and Lo, Su-Vui",Diabetes care,"In 1995, the Hong Kong Diabetes Register (HKDR) was established by a doctor-nurse team at a university-affiliated, publicly funded, hospital-based diabetes center using a structured protocol for gathering data to stratify risk, triage care, empower patients, and individualize treatment. This research-driven quality improvement program has motivated the introduction of a territory-wide diabetes risk assessment and management program provided by 18 hospital-based diabetes centers since 2000. By linking the data-rich HKDR to the territory-wide electronic medical record, risk equations were developed and validated to predict clinical outcomes. In 2007, the HKDR protocol was digitalized to establish the web-based Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program complete with risk levels and algorithms for issuance of personalized reports to reduce clinical inertia and empower self-management. Through this technologically assisted, integrated diabetes care program, we have generated big data to track secular trends, identify unmet needs, and verify interventions in a naturalistic environment. In 2009, the JADE Program was adapted to form the Risk Assessment and Management Program for Diabetes Mellitus (RAMP-DM) in the publicly funded primary care clinics, which reduced all major events by 30-60% in patients without complications. Meanwhile, a JADE-assisted assessment and empowerment program provided by a university-affiliated, self-funded, nurse-coordinated diabetes center, aimed at complementing medical care in the community, also reduced all major events by 30-50% in patients with different risk levels.

With a parallel-group randomised controlled trial (RCT), we compared RYGB vs an intensive lifestyle and medical intervention (ILMI) for type 2 diabetes, including among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2). METHODS: By use of a shared decision-making recruitment strategy targeting the entire at-risk population within an integrated community healthcare system, we screened 1,808 adults meeting inclusion criteria (age 25-64, with type 2 diabetes and a BMI 30-45 kg/m(2)). Of these, 43 were allocated via concealed, computer-generated random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to RYGB or ILMI. The latter involved <e2><89><a5>45 min of aerobic exercise 5 days per week, a dietitian-directed weight- and glucose-lowering diet, and optimal diabetes medical treatment for 1 year. Although treatment allocation could not be blinded, outcomes were determined by a blinded adjudicator. The primary outcome was diabetes remission at 1 year (HbA1c <6.0% [<42.1 mmol/mol], off all diabetes medicines). RESULTS: Twenty-three volunteers were assigned to RYGB and 20 to ILMI. Of these, 11 withdrew before receiving any intervention. Hence 15 in the RYGB group and 17 in the IMLI group were analysed throughout 1 year. The groups were equivalent regarding all baseline characteristics, except that the RYGB cohort had a longer diabetes duration (11.4 <c2><b1> 4.8 vs 6.8 <c2><b1> 5.2 years, p = 0.009). Weight loss at 1 year was 25.8 <c2><b1> 14.5% vs 6.4 <c2><b1> 5.8% after RYGB vs ILMI, respectively (p < 0.001). The ILMI exercise programme yielded a 22 <c2><b1> 11% increase in [Formula: see text] (p<0.0001), whereas [Formula: see text] after RYGB was unchanged. Diabetes remission at 1 year was 60.0% with RYGB vs 5.9% with ILMI (p = 0.002). The HbA1c decline over 1 year was only modestly more after RYGB than ILMI: from 7.7 <c2><b1> 1.0% (60.7 mmol/mol) to 6.4 <c2><b1> 1.6% (46.4 mmol/mol) vs 7.3 <c2><b1> 0.9% (56.3 mmol/mol) to 6.9 <c2><b1> 1.3% (51.9 mmol/mol), respectively (p = 0.04); however, this drop occurred with significantly fewer or no diabetes medications after RYGB. No life-threatening complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with the most rigorous ILMI yet tested against surgery in a randomised trial, RYGB yielded greater type 2 diabetes remission in mild-to-moderately obese patients recruited from a well-informed, population-based sample.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data come from PETALS, a prospectively followed pregnancy cohort (n = 2,246, 79% minorities) receiving care at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. A Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess exercise. Glucose testing results for screening and diagnostic tests were obtained from electronic health records. Inverse probability of treatment weighting and targeted maximum likelihood with data-adaptive estimation (machine learning) of propensity scores and outcome regressions were used to obtain causal risk differences adjusted for potential confounders, including prepregnancy BMI, exercise before pregnancy, and gestational weight gain. Exercise was dichotomized at 1) the cohort's 75th percentile for moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise (<e2><89><a5>13.2 MET-h per week or <e2><89><a5>264 min per week of moderate exercise), 2) current recommendations (<e2><89><a5>7.5 MET-h per week or <e2><89><a5>150 min per week of moderate exercise), and 3) any vigorous exercise.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study, 288 clinicians (39.6% family practice physicians, 37.9% general internal medicine physicians, and 22.6% nurse practitioners) were randomized to structured SMBG alone (STG; n = 72); structured SMBG with DST (DST; n = 72); structured SMBG with an educational DVD (DVD; n = 72); and structured SMBG with DST and the educational DVD (DST+DVD; n = 72). Clinicians analyzed 30 patient cases (type 2 diabetes), identified the primary abnormality, and selected the most appropriate therapy. RESULTS: A total of 222 clinicians completed all 30 patient cases with no major protocol deviations. Significantly more DST, DVD, and DST+DVD clinicians correctly identified the glycemic abnormality and selected the most appropriate therapeutic option compared with STG clinicians: 49, 51, and 55%, respectively, vs. 33% (all P < 0.0001) with no significant differences among DST, DVD, and DST+DVD clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Use of structured SMBG, combined with the DST, the educational DVD, or both, enhances clinicians' ability to correctly identify significant glycemic patterns and make appropriate therapeutic decisions to address those patterns. Structured testing interventions using either the educational DVD or the DST are equally effective in improving data interpretation and utilization. The DST provides a viable alternative when comprehensive education is not feasible, and it may be integrated into medical practices with minimal training.",2012,10.2337/dc11-1351,35,4,693-698,eng,1935-5548 0149-5992,"Automation and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Calibration and *Algorithms and Clinical Competence and *Decision Support Techniques and *Data Interpretation, Statistical and Blood Glucose/analysis and Decision Making/physiology and Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring/instrumentation/methods/statistics & numerical data and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards/statistics & numerical data and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/diagnosis/therapy",NA,NA,2012/04//undefined,Diabetes Care,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bertsimas_2017_Diabcare,JOUR,Personalized diabetes management using electronic medical records,"Bertsimas, Dimitris and Kallus, Nathan and Weinstein, Alexander M and Zhuo, Ying Daisy",Diabetes care,"Objective: Current clinical guidelines for managing type 2 diabetes do not differentiate based on patient-specific factors. We present a data-driven algorithm for personalized diabetes management that improves health outcomes relative to the standard of care. Research design and methods: We modeled outcomes under 13 pharmacological therapies based on electronic medical records from 1999 to 2014 for 10,806 patients with type 2 diabetes from Boston Medical Center. For each patient visit, we analyzed the range of outcomes under alternative care using a k-nearest neighbor approach. The neighbors were chosen to maximize similarity on individual patient characteristics and medical history that were most predictive of health outcomes. The recommendation algorithm prescribes the regimen with best predicted outcome if the expected improvement from switching regimens exceeds a threshold. We evaluated the effect of recommendations on matched patient outcomes from unseen data. Results: Among the 48,140 patient visits in the test set, the algorithm's recommendation mirrored the observed standard of care in 68.2% of visits. For patient visits in which the algorithmic recommendation differed from the standard of care, the mean posttreatment glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under the algorithm was lower than standard of care by 0.44 <c2><b1> 0.03% (4.8 <c2><b1> 0.3 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001), from 8.37% under the standard of care to 7.93% under our algorithm (68.0 to 63.2 mmol/mol). Conclusions: A personalized approach to diabetes management yielded substantial improvements in HbA1c outcomes relative to the standard of care. Our prototyped dashboard visualizing the recommendation algorithm can be used by providers to inform diabetes care and improve outcomes.",2017,NA,40,2,210-217,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017///,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
