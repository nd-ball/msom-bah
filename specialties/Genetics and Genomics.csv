Boolchandani_2019_NatureviGene,JOUR,Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance,"Boolchandani, Manish and D'Souza, Alaric W. and Dantas, Gautam",Nature reviews. Genetics,"Antimicrobial resistance extracts high morbidity, mortality and economic costs yearly by rendering bacteria immune to antibiotics. Identifying and understanding antimicrobial resistance are imperative for clinical practice to treat resistant infections and for public health efforts to limit the spread of resistance. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing are expanding our abilities to detect and study antimicrobial resistance. This Review provides a detailed overview of antimicrobial resistance identification and characterization methods, from traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to recent deep-learning methods. We focus on sequencing-based resistance discovery and discuss tools and databases used in antimicrobial resistance studies.",2019,10.1038/s41576-019-0108-4,20,6,356-370,eng,1471-0064 1471-0056,"Humans and Machine Learning and Base Sequence and Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology and Metagenomics and *Genome, Bacterial and Bacteria/classification/*drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification and Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/microbiology and Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/instrumentation/*methods and Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods/*statistics & numerical data and Whole Genome Sequencing/instrumentation/*methods",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Nat Rev Genet,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, the genetic diversity in these cohorts presents new challenges for analysis and interpretation. We consider the utility of race and/or ethnicity categories in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of multi-ethnic cohorts. We demonstrate that race/ethnicity information enhances the ability to understand population-specific genetic architecture. To address the practical issue that self-identified racial/ethnic information may be incomplete, we propose a machine learning algorithm that produces a surrogate variable, termed HARE.

TTNtv are also encountered in <e2><88><bc>1% of the general population, where they may be silent, perhaps reflecting allelic factors. To better understand TTNtv, we integrated TTN allelic series, cardiac imaging and genomic data in humans and studied rat models with disparate TTNtv. In patients with DCM, TTNtv throughout titin were significantly associated with DCM. Ribosomal profiling in rat showed the translational footprint of premature stop codons in Ttn, TTNtv-position-independent nonsense-mediated degradation of the mutant allele and a signature of perturbed cardiac metabolism. Heart physiology in rats with TTNtv was unremarkable at baseline but became impaired during cardiac stress. In healthy humans, machine-learning-based analysis of high-resolution cardiac imaging showed TTNtv to be associated with eccentric cardiac remodeling. These data show that TTNtv have molecular and physiological effects on the heart across species, with a continuum of expressivity in health and disease.",2017,10.1038/ng.3719,49,1,46-53,eng,1546-1718 1061-4036,"Humans and Male and Case-Control Studies and Cohort Studies and Animals and Rats and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*genetics/pathology and Connectin/*genetics and Genetic Variation/*genetics and Heart/*physiology",NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,Nat Genet,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wan_2017_Amjoofhuge,JOUR,Expanding Access to Large-Scale Genomic Data While Promoting Privacy: A Game Theoretic Approach,"Wan, Zhiyu and Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy and Xia, Weiyi and Clayton, Ellen Wright and Kantarcioglu, Murat and Malin, Bradley",American journal of human genetics,"Emerging scientific endeavors are creating big data repositories of data from millions of individuals. Sharing data in a privacy-respecting manner could lead to important discoveries, but high-profile demonstrations show that links between de-identified genomic data and named persons can sometimes be reestablished. Such re-identification attacks have focused on worst-case scenarios and spurred the adoption of data-sharing practices that unnecessarily impede research. To mitigate concerns, organizations have traditionally relied upon legal deterrents, like data use agreements, and are considering suppressing or adding noise to genomic variants. In this report, we use a game theoretic lens to develop more effective, quantifiable protections for genomic data sharing. This is a fundamentally different approach because it accounts for adversarial behavior and capabilities and tailors protections to anticipated recipients with reasonable resources, not adversaries with unlimited means. We demonstrate this approach via a new public resource with genomic summary data from over 8,000 individuals-the Sequence and Phenotype Integration Exchange (SPHINX)-and show that risks can be balanced against utility more effectively than with traditional approaches. We further show the generalizability of this framework by applying it to other genomic data collection and sharing endeavors. Recognizing that such models are dependent on a variety of parameters, we perform extensive sensitivity analyses to show that our findings are robust to their fluctuations.",2017,10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.12.002,100,2,316-322,eng,1537-6605 0002-9297,"Humans and Electronic Health Records and game theory and Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide and *Genomics and *Information Dissemination and *Models, Theoretical and genetic algorithm and *Databases, Genetic and adversarial modeling and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network and Genetic Privacy/*legislation & jurisprudence and genomic data privacy and genomic data sharing policy and re-identification risk and sensitivity analysis and Sequence and Phenotype Integration Exchange and summary statistics",NA,NA,2017/02/02/,Am J Hum Genet,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fah",American journal of human genetics,"Meiotic nondisjunction and resulting aneuploidy can lead to severe health consequences in humans. Aneuploidy rescue can restore euploidy but may result in uniparental disomy (UPD), the inheritance of both homologs of a chromosome from one parent with no representative copy from the other. Current understanding of UPD is limited to <e2><88><bc>3,300 case subjects for which UPD was associated with clinical presentation due to imprinting disorders or recessive diseases. Thus, the prevalence of UPD and its phenotypic consequences in the general population are unknown. We searched for instances of UPD across 4,400,363 consented research participants from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and 431,094 UK Biobank participants. Using computationally detected DNA segments identical-by-descent (IBD) and runs of homozygosity (ROH), we identified 675 instances of UPD across both databases. We estimate that UPD is twice as common as previously thought, and we present a machine-learning framework to detect UPD using ROH.
