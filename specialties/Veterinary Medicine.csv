Big data analytics are used to understand health risks and minimize the impact of adverse animal health issues through identifying high-risk populations, combining data or processes acting at multiple scales through epidemiological modeling approaches, and harnessing high velocity data to monitor animal health trends and detect emerging health threats. The advent of big data requires the incorporation of new skills into veterinary epidemiology training, including, for example, machine learning and coding, to prepare a new generation of scientists and practitioners to engage with big data. Establishing pipelines to analyze big data in near real-time is the next step for progressing from simply having ""big data"" to create ""smart data,"" with the objective of improving understanding of health risks, effectiveness of management and policy decisions, and ultimately preventing or at least minimizing the impact of adverse animal health issues.",2017,10.3389/fvets.2017.00110,4,NA,110,eng,2297-1769,machine learning and big data and surveillance and animal movement and modeling and simulation,NA,NA,2017///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA
Walsh_2019_Traandemedis,JOUR,Artificial intelligence and avian influenza: Using machine learning to enhance active surveillance for avian influenza viruses,"Walsh, Daniel P. and Ma, Ting Fung and Ip, Hon S. and Zhu, Jun",Transboundary and emerging diseases,"Influenza A viruses are one of the most significant viral groups globally with substantial impacts on human, domestic animal and wildlife health. Wild birds are the natural reservoirs for these viruses, and active surveillance within wild bird populations provides critical information about viral evolution forming the basis of risk assessments and countermeasure development. Unfortunately, active surveillance programs are often resource-intensive, and thus, enhancing programs for increased efficiency is paramount. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence applications, provides statistical learning procedures that can be used to gain novel insights into disease surveillance systems. We use a form of machine learning, gradient boosted trees, to estimate the probability of isolating avian influenza viruses (AIV) from wild bird samples collected during surveillance for AIVs from 2006 to 2011 in the United States. We examined several predictive features including age, sex, bird type, geographic location and matrix gene rRT-PCR results. Our final model had high predictive power and only included geographic location and rRT-PCR results as important predictors. The highest predicted viral isolation probability was for samples collected from the north-central states and the south-eastern region of Alaska. Lower rRT-PCR Ct-values are associated with increased likelihood of AIV isolation, and the model estimated 16% probability of isolating AIV from samples declared negative (i.e., <e2><89><a5>35 Ct-value) using the rRT-PCR screening test and standard protocols. Our model can be used to prioritize previously collected samples for isolation and rapidly evaluate AIV surveillance designs to maximize the probability of viral isolation given limited resources and laboratory capacity.",2019,10.1111/tbed.13318,66,6,2537-2545,eng,1865-1682 1865-1674,"machine learning and artificial intelligence and Animals and Artificial Intelligence and surveillance and Population Surveillance and United States/epidemiology and *Machine Learning and Animals, Wild/*virology and Birds/*virology and Disease Reservoirs and influenza A and Influenza in Birds/*epidemiology/transmission and Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary and virus isolation and waterfowl",NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,Transbound Emerg Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cockburn_2020_A.aoajfM,JOUR,Review: Application and Prospective Discussion of Machine Learning for the Management of Dairy Farms,"Cockburn, Marianne",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,"Dairy farmers use herd management systems, behavioral sensors, feeding lists, breeding schedules, and health records to document herd characteristics. Consequently, large amounts of dairy data are becoming available. However, a lack of data integration makes it difficult for farmers to analyze the data on their dairy farm, which indicates that these data are currently not being used to their full potential. Hence, multiple issues in dairy farming such as low longevity, poor performance, and health issues remain. We aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) methods can solve some of these existing issues in dairy farming. This review summarizes peer-reviewed ML papers published in the dairy sector between 2015 and 2020. Ultimately, 97 papers from the subdomains of management, physiology, reproduction, behavior analysis, and feeding were considered in this review. The results confirm that ML algorithms have become common tools in most areas of dairy research, particularly to predict data. Despite the quantity of research available, most tested algorithms have not performed sufficiently for a reliable implementation in practice. This may be due to poor training data. The availability of data resources from multiple farms covering longer periods would be useful to improve prediction accuracies. In conclusion, ML is a promising tool in dairy research, which could be used to develop and improve decision support for farmers. As the cow is a multifactorial system, ML algorithms could analyze integrated data sources that describe and ultimately allow managing cows according to all relevant influencing factors. However, both the integration of multiple data sources and the obtainability of public data currently remain challenging.",2020,10.3390/ani10091690,10,9,NA,eng,2076-2615,data analysis and data integration and big data and sensor and cluster and smart farming,NA,NA,2020/09/18/,Animals (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA
McCue_2017_Frinvesc,JOUR,The Scope of Big Data in One Medicine: Unprecedented Opportunities and Challenges,"McCue, Molly E. and McCoy, Annette M.",Frontiers in veterinary science,"Advances in high-throughput molecular biology and electronic health records (EHR), coupled with increasing computer capabilities have resulted in an increased interest in the use of big data in health care. Big data require collection and analysis of data at an unprecedented scale and represents a paradigm shift in health care, offering (1) the capacity to generate new knowledge more quickly than traditional scientific approaches; (2) unbiased collection and analysis of data; and (3) a holistic understanding of biology and pathophysiology. Big data promises more personalized and precision medicine for patients with improved accuracy and earlier diagnosis, and therapy tailored to an individual's unique combination of genes, environmental risk, and precise disease phenotype. This promise comes from data collected from numerous sources, ranging from molecules to cells, to tissues, to individuals and populations-and the integration of these data into networks that improve understanding of heath and disease. Big data-driven science should play a role in propelling comparative medicine and ""one medicine"" (i.e., the shared physiology, pathophysiology, and disease risk factors across species) forward. Merging of data from EHR across institutions will give access to patient data on a scale previously unimaginable, allowing for precise phenotype definition and objective evaluation of risk factors and response to therapy. High-throughput molecular data will give insight into previously unexplored molecular pathophysiology and disease etiology. Investigation and integration of big data from a variety of sources will result in stronger parallels drawn at the molecular level between human and animal disease, allow for predictive modeling of infectious disease and identification of key areas of intervention, and facilitate step-changes in our understanding of disease that can make a substantial impact on animal and human health.

With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection-related independent variables to predict early containment.

This algorithm was used in experimental trials in order to assess African swine fever (ASF) infection course in Eurasian wild boar. Overall, the outcomes showed negative correlation between motion reduction and fever caused by ASF infection. In addition, infected animals computed significant lower movements compared to uninfected animals. The obtained results suggest that a motion monitoring system based on artificial vision may be used in indoors to trigger suspicions of fever.

This study built several machine learning models to discriminate human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model can predict the human-infecting viruses with an accuracy of over 90%. The performance of this KNN model built on the short contigs (<e2><89><a5>1 kb) is comparable to those built on the viral genomes.

The remaining unseen EHRs were used to evaluate the model performance. RESULTS: The final model was a recurrent neural network (RNN) with 4 features (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine specific gravity, and age). When predicting CKD near the point of diagnosis, the model displayed a sensitivity of 90.7% and a specificity of 98.9%. Model sensitivity decreased when predicting the risk of CKD with a longer horizon, having 63.0% sensitivity 1 year before diagnosis and 44.2% 2 years before diagnosis, but with specificity remaining around 99%.

It is an endemic disease in many developing countries including Pakistan. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular detection of bovine brucellosis and to assess the association of potential risk factors with test results. A total of 176 milk and 402 serum samples were collected from cattle and buffaloes in three districts of upper Punjab, Pakistan. Milk samples were investigated using milk ring test (MRT), while sera were tested by Rose-Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA). Real-time PCR was used for detection of Brucella DNA in investigated samples. Anti-Brucella antibodies were detected in 37 (21.02%) bovine milk samples using MRT and in 66 (16.4%) and 71 (17.7%) bovine sera using RBPT and i-ELISA, respectively. Real-time PCR detected Brucella DNA in 31 (7.71%) from a total of 402 bovine sera and identified as Brucella abortus.

This focus group study of veterinarians (n = 32) examined the impact of these improvements and the potential challenges they introduce in small animal practice. It shows that while advanced diagnostics and therapies deliver benefits in patient care, they also add complexities to decision-making. Although the veterinarians participating in the study were aware of their duty to act in the best interests of the animal, their decisions were highly dependent on factors such as the client's financial background and the emotional bond between client and animal, as well as the veterinarian's place of work, and level and field of specialization, and certain economic aspects of the practice. The overall conclusion is that small animal veterinarians are increasingly torn between serving the best interests of the animal, medical feasibility and contextual factors related to the client, the veterinarian, and professional colleagues. Further, the findings suggest that services are not only oriented towards the provision of medical care in a strict medical sense.

While legally classified as property, some argue that animals are in a similar position to children; treatment decisions are made by their owners, posing a legal challenge only if the proposed treatment has the potential to cause harm or unnecessary suffering, as defined by animal protection legislation. This paper formulates the approach to a 'best interests' calculation, utilising the factors included in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and relying on exchange of information between the human parties involved. Although this form of decision-making must primarily protect the animal from unnecessary suffering, it recognises that the information provided by the owner is critical in articulating the animal's non-medical interests, and hence in formulating what is in the animal's best overall welfare interests. While statute law does not mandate consideration of 'best interests' for animals, this approach might reasonably be expected as a professional imperative for veterinary surgeons.

This creates new opportunities to study livestock behavior in commercial settings, but also new methodological challenges. Densely sampled behavioral data from large heterogeneous groups can contain a range of complex patterns and stochastic structures that may be difficult to visualize using conventional exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal of this research was to assess the efficacy of unsupervised machine learning tools in recovering complex behavioral patterns from such datasets to better inform subsequent statistical modeling. This methodological case study was carried out using records on milking order, or the sequence in which cows arrange themselves as they enter the milking parlor. Data was collected over a 6-month period from a closed group of 200 mixed-parity Holstein cattle on an organic dairy. Cows at the front and rear of the queue proved more consistent in their entry position than animals at the center of the queue, a systematic pattern of heterogeneity more clearly visualized using entropy estimates, a scale and distribution-free alternative to variance robust to outliers. Dimension reduction techniques were then used to visualize relationships between cows. No evidence of social cohesion was recovered, but Diffusion Map embeddings proved more adept than PCA at revealing the underlying linear geometry of this data. Median parlor entry positions from the pre- and post-pasture subperiods were highly correlated (R = 0.91), suggesting a surprising degree of temporal stationarity. Data Mechanics visualizations, however, revealed heterogeneous non-stationary among subgroups of animals in the center of the group and herd-level temporal outliers. A repeated measures model recovered inconsistent evidence of a relationships between entry position and cow attributes. Mutual conditional entropy tests, a permutation-based approach to assessing bivariate correlations robust to non-independence, confirmed a significant but non-linear association with peak milk yield, but revealed the age effect to be potentially confounded by health status. Finally, queueing records were related back to behaviors recorded via ear tag accelerometers using linear models and mutual conditional entropy tests.

There have been several recent initiatives to capture these data from electronic medical records for use in national surveillance systems and clinical research. In response, an approach to surveillance has been evolving that leverages existing computerized veterinary practice management systems to capture animal health data recorded by veterinarians. Work in the United Kingdom within the VetCompass program utilizes routinely recorded clinical data with the addition of further standardized fields. The current study describes a prototype system that was developed based on this approach. In a 4-week pilot study in New Zealand, clinical data on presentation reasons and diagnoses from a total of 344 patient consults were extracted from two veterinary clinics into a dedicated database and analyzed at the population level. New Zealand companion animal and equine veterinary practitioners were engaged to test the feasibility of this national practice-based health information and data system. Strategies to ensure continued engagement and submission of quality data by participating veterinarians were identified, as were important considerations for transitioning the pilot program to a sustainable large-scale and multi-species surveillance system that has the capacity to securely manage big data. The results further emphasized the need for a high degree of usability and smart interface design to make such a system work effectively in practice. The geospatial integration of data from multiple clinical practices into a common operating picture can be used to establish the baseline incidence of disease in New Zealand companion animal and equine populations, detect unusual trends that may indicate an emerging disease threat or welfare issue, improve the management of endemic and exotic infectious diseases, and support research activities.

It is caused by protozoa of the genus Eimeria, which cause concrete economic losses due to malabsorption, bad feed conversion rate, reduced weight gain, and increased mortality. The greatest damage is registered in commercial poultry farms because birds are reared together in large numbers and high densities. Unfortunately, these enteric pathologies are not preventable, and their diagnosis is only available when the disease is full-blown. For these reasons, the preventive use of anticoccidials-some of these with antimicrobial action-is a common practice in intensive farming, and this type of management leads to the release of drugs in the environment which contributes to the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Due to the high relevance of this issue, the early detection of any health problem is of great importance to improve animal welfare in intensive farming. Three prototypes, previously calibrated and adjusted, were developed and tested in three different experimental poultry farms in order to evaluate whether the system was able to identify the coccidia infection in intensive poultry farms early. For this purpose, a data-driven machine learning algorithm was built, and specific critical values of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found to be associated with abnormal levels of oocystis count at an early stage of the disease. This result supports the feasibility of building an automatic data-driven machine learning algorithm for an early warning of coccidiosis.",2020,10.3390/ani10040747,10,4,NA,eng,2076-2615,coccidiosis and data-driven machine learning algorithm and early warning system and Poultry and VOCs,NA,NA,2020/04/24/,Animals (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA

Appropriate diagnostic work-up could optimize treatment and reduce the risk of inappropriate use of antibiotics. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate the impact of diagnostic work-up on decision to treat (DTT) and choice of antibiotic treatment (COT) for dogs presenting with clinical signs of urinary tract disease. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty-one dogs presenting to 52 Danish veterinary practices. METHODS: Prospective, observational study. Clinical signs, diagnostic work-up, and prescriptions were recorded. Urine samples were submitted to a reference laboratory for quantitative bacterial culture (QBC) and susceptibility testing. The laboratory results were used as reference for assessing the appropriateness of DTT and COT. RESULTS: In the majority of dogs, veterinarians performed dipstick (99%), microscopic examination of urine (80%) and bacterial culture (56%). Fifty-one percent of dogs had urinary tract infection (UTI) based on reference QBC. Appropriate DTT was made for 62% of the dogs, while 36% were over-prescribed and 2% under-prescribed. Inappropriate use of second-line agents was found in 57% of the UTI cases. Performing microscopy-but not culture-significantly impacted DTT (P = 0.039) while no difference was seen in COT (P = 0.67). The accuracy of in-house microscopy and culture were 64.5 and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Over-prescription of antibiotics was common among dogs with suspected UTI, regardless of the diagnostic work-up performed.

Kueper_2020_Frinvesc,JOUR,Partners in Sickness and in Health? Relationship-Centered Veterinary Care and Self-Educated Pet Owners in Germany: A Structural Equation Model,"Kueper, Alina M. and Merle, Roswitha",Frontiers in veterinary science,"In recent years, the web has become a widely used source for health information. Pet owners seem to respond to the supply of medical information on the Internet by increasing their self-education. However, after more than a decade of the digital revolution, little is known about the Internet's impact on the veterinarian-pet owner relationship. Recent research has raised concerns regarding the increase in self-education among pet owners. However, reasons suggest that the Internet might be a valuable source of pet-owner education for veterinarians. In particular, relationship-centered approaches of care might benefit from the information provided. Our study aimed to determine the perception of German veterinarians with regard to pet owners' self-education on different aspects of veterinary care. An online survey was conducted for German veterinarians from November 2016 to June 2017. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Within the structural equation model, we evaluated how the veterinarians' attitude toward relationship-centered care might affect the evaluation of pet owners' self-education. A total of 585 valid questionnaires were completed. The majority of veterinarians (83.6%) welcomed the principles of shared decision-making. Practically, all veterinarians reported a noticeable increase in pet owners' self-education within the last few years. Perceptions on self-education's impacts on veterinary practice varied among the participants. A beneficial impact of self-education was reported regarding the general quality of veterinary care and quality of follow-up care. Most concerns were related to a negative impact on the veterinarian-pet owner relationship and the pet owners' demands on the veterinarians' work after self-education. Moreover, many participants were afraid that unfiltered information may unsettle pet owners and, therefore, advised them against self-education. The structural equation model confirmed the hypothesis that a veterinarian's positive attitude toward shared decision-making, empathic behavior, and his/her evaluation of self-education were associated. Therefore, we concluded that while there are beneficial potentials, there seem to be barriers that prevent the effective use of the Internet as a supportive medium in veterinary care. Further research and training are needed to enable the use of the Internet as an ancillary medium.",2020,10.3389/fvets.2020.605631,7,NA,605631,eng,2297-1769,structural equation modeling and empathy and shared decision making and partnership building and relationship-centered care and veterinary medicine and veterinary- pet owner communication,NA,NA,2020///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has infected about 3 million people worldwide and killed more than 200,000, most being the elderly or people with potential chronic diseases or in immunosuppressive states. According to big data analysis, there are many proteins homologous to or interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which, therefore, may not be the only receptor for the novel coronavirus; other receptors may also exist in host cells of different species. These potential receptors may also play an important role in the infection process of the novel coronavirus. The current study aimed to discover such key proteins or receptors and analyze the susceptibility of different animals to the novel coronavirus, in order to reveal the transmission process of the virus in cross-species infection. We analyzed the proteins coded by the ACE2 gene in different mammalian species and predicted their correlation and homology with the human ACE2 receptor. The major finding of our predictive analysis suggested ACE2 gene-encoded proteins to be highly homologous across mammals. Based on their high homology, their possibility of binding the spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is quite high and species such as Felis catus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus etc. may be potential susceptible hosts; special monitoring is particularly required for livestock that are in close contact with humans.

However, it is critical and challenging to maintain the health and welfare of the increasing population of dairy cattle, especially the dairy calf (up to 20% mortality in China). Animal behaviors reflect considerable information and are used to estimate animal health and welfare. In recent years, machine vision-based methods have been applied to monitor animal behaviors worldwide. Collected image or video information containing animal behaviors can be analyzed with computer languages to estimate animal welfare or health indicators. In this proposed study, a new deep learning method (i.e., an integration of background-subtraction and inter-frame difference) was developed for automatically recognizing dairy calf scene-interactive behaviors (e.g., entering or leaving the resting area, and stationary and turning behaviors in the inlet and outlet area of the resting area) based on computer vision-based technology. Results show that the recognition success rates for the calf's science-interactive behaviors of pen entering, pen leaving, staying (standing or laying static behavior), and turning were 94.38%, 92.86%, 96.85%, and 93.51%, respectively. The recognition success rates for feeding and drinking were 79.69% and 81.73%, respectively.

Protocols and indicators, such as those provided by Welfare Quality, mean that animal welfare can nowadays be regularly measured and surveyed at the farm level. However, the digital revolution in agriculture opens possibilities to quantify animal welfare using multiple sensors and data analytics. This allows daily monitoring of animal welfare at the group and individual animal level, for example, by measuring changes in behaviour patterns or physiological parameters. The present paper explores the potential for developing innovations in digital technologies to improve the management of animal welfare at the farm, during transport or at slaughter. We conclude that the innovations in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) offer significant opportunities for a more holistic, evidence-based approach to the monitoring and surveillance of farmed animal welfare. To date, the emphasis in much PLF technologies has been on animal health and productivity. This paper argues that this emphasis should not come to define welfare. What is now needed is a coming together of industry, scientists, food chain actors, policy-makers and NGOs to develop and use the promise of PLF for the creative and effective improvement of farmed animal welfare.",2020,10.3390/ani10101779,10,10,NA,eng,2076-2615,animal welfare and precision livestock farming and welfare assurance and welfare management and welfare monitoring,NA,NA,2020/10/01/,Animals (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To build a sensitive and specific model for early prediction of CKD in cats using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques applied to routine health screening data. ANIMALS: Data from 218 healthy cats <e2><89><a5>7 years of age screened at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) were used for model building. Performance was tested using data from 3546 cats in the Banfield Pet Hospital records and an additional 60 RCV cats-all initially without a CKD diagnosis. METHODS: Artificial neural network (ANN) modeling used a multilayer feed-forward neural network incorporating a back-propagation algorithm. Clinical variables from single cat visits were selected using factorial discriminant analysis. Independent submodels were built for different prediction time frames. Two decision threshold strategies were investigated. RESULTS: Input variables retained were plasma creatinine and blood urea concentrations, and urine specific gravity. For prediction of CKD within 12 months, the model had accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 88%, 87%, 70%, 53%, and 92%, respectively. An alternative decision threshold increased specificity and PPV to 98% and 87%, but decreased sensitivity and NPV to 42% and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A model was generated that identified cats in the general population <e2><89><a5>7 years of age that are at risk of developing CKD within 12 months.

The virus infects goats, sheep and some wild relatives of small domestic ruminants, such as antelopes. PPR is listed by the World Organization for Animal Health as an animal disease that must be reported promptly. In this paper, PPR outbreak data combined with WorldClim database meteorological data were used to build a PPR prediction model. Using feature selection methods, eight sets of features were selected: bio3, bio10, bio15, bio18, prec7, prec8, prec12, and alt for modeling. Then different machine learning algorithms were used to build models, among which the random forest (RF) algorithm was found to have the best modeling effect. The ACC value of prediction accuracy for the model on the training set can reach 99.10%, while the ACC on the test sets was 99.10%. Therefore, RF algorithms and eight features were finally selected to build the model in order to build the online prediction system. In addition, we adopt single-factor modeling and correlation analysis of modeling variables to explore the impact of each variable on modeling results. It was found that bio18 (the warmest quarterly precipitation), prec7 (the precipitation in July), and prec8 (the precipitation in August) contributed significantly to the model, and the outbreak of the epidemic may have an important relationship with precipitation.

Kuper_2019_Frinvesc,JOUR,Being Nice Is Not Enough-Exploring Relationship-Centered Veterinary Care With Structural Equation Modeling. A Quantitative Study on German Pet Owners' Perception,"Kuper, Alina M. and Merle, Roswitha",Frontiers in veterinary science,"During the last years, the philosophy of relationship-centered care gained increasing attention in veterinary medicine. Relationship-centered care is based on a joint venture between pet owner and veterinarians and therefore offers the opportunity to satisfy the pet owners' need for participation in medical decision-making and to provide the best care for the patient. Although research on relationship-centered care in the veterinary consultation is still limited, the available findings suggest that the characteristics of relationship-centered care reflect the pet owners' expectations on satisfactory veterinary care. In this study a quantitative survey was conducted among German pet owners that collected information regarding their perception of the veterinarians' communication during the last appointments. Questionnaires were available online and paper-based. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using SAS. First aim of the study was to explore structural equation modeling (SEM) as an opportunity to evaluate quantitative data in the field of research on relationship-centered care. Further, SEM was used to evaluate associations between the implementation of different characteristics of relationship-centered care in the veterinary practice (empathic communication, partnership-building) and latent outcome variables regarding the pet owners (pet owners' need for further information, consultation of competing health care providers). N = 1,270 valid questionnaires were completed. Participants owned small companion animals (55.6%), horses (7.6%), or both (36.9%) within the last 2 years. Results of SEM suggest that partnership-centered and empathic communication decreased the pet owners' needs for further information (e.g., from online sources) and their need to consult alternative health providers (e.g., homeopaths). Especially addressing the pet owners' worries and fears, discussing pros and cons of diagnostic and therapeutic options as well as providing the required amount of information were shown to be large influence factors within the model. Therefore, veterinarians are recommended to implement the concept of partnership-centered care in their daily practice, for it may increase pet owners' loyalty and satisfaction. Results may motivate future research in this field. Further development of the proposed model assumptions may enable valuable progress in the field of quantitative research on relationship-centered care.",2019,10.3389/fvets.2019.00056,6,NA,56,eng,2297-1769,structural equation modeling and empathy and shared decision making and partnership building and relationship-centered care and veterinary medicine and veterinary-pet owner-communication,NA,NA,2019///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA

Euthanasia is economic when it is the consequence of the pet owner's inability to afford essential treatment while a viable medical alternative to euthanasia exists. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is an acute life-threatening emergency condition of dogs; if left untreated, rapid death is highly likely. Surgical treatment leads to survival of around 80-90% of dogs; however, such treatment is costly. Therefore, pre-surgical euthanasia may be largely economically motivated. Having pet insurance, a financial instrument to reduce the burden of unforeseen veterinary medical costs on pet owners, would be expected to abolish the risk for pre-surgical economic euthanasia. We therefore aimed to determine whether pet insurance attenuates the risk of pre-surgical economic euthanasia in dogs with GDV. Non-referred dogs (n = 260) with GDV and known insurance status seen at 24 emergency clinics over a 2-year period were included. Relevant data (e.g., insurance status, age, comorbidities, outcome) were retrospectively extracted from a pet insurer's claim records (insured animals) or from electronic medical records of participating hospitals (non-insured animals). Forty-one percent of dogs (106 of 260 dogs) did not survive to hospital discharge; 82 (77%) of non-survivors died before surgery, all through euthanasia. The pre-surgical euthanasia rate was 10% in insured and 37% in non-insured dogs (p < 0.001). When adjusted for the effect of age, deposit size, comorbidities, and blood lactate concentration, the absence of insurance increased the odds of pre-surgical euthanasia by a factor of 7.4 (95% CI 2.0 to 37; p = 0.002). Of dogs undergoing surgery, 86% survived to hospital discharge. Overall, 80% of insured animals and 53% of non-insured animals survived to hospital discharge (p < 0.001). Thus, insurance was associated with a marked decrease in risk of pre-surgical euthanasia indicating that the cause of pre-surgical euthanasia of dogs with GDV is predominantly economic in nature. The rate of pre-surgical euthanasia in dogs with GDV may emerge as a suitable marker to quantify economic decision making of pet owners and to measure the impact of financial interventions aimed at mitigating economic duress associated with cost of veterinary emergency care.",2020,10.3389/fvets.2020.590615,7,NA,590615,eng,2297-1769,insurance and euthanasia and veterinary and bloat and dog and economic and gastric dilatation-volvulus,NA,NA,2020///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA

M.",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) is an important consideration in healthcare decision-making for pets with cancer. To determine the effect of disease and treatment on pet QOL, this important variable should be objectively measured as an outcome in veterinary cancer studies. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and methodology of QOL measurement in a sample of recently published reports of prospective studies evaluating cancer treatments in client-owned dogs and cats; to characterize reporting of QOL outcomes and to identify article characteristics associated with QOL measurement. METHODS: English-language reports of prospective studies of cancer treatments in dogs and cats published from 2008 to 2013 were identified using medical research databases combined with a hand-searching strategy. Data pertaining to general article characteristics and QOL measurement were abstracted and summarized. RESULTS: Reports of 144 eligible studies were identified. QOL was measured in 16 (11.1%) studies, with 8 (5.6%) reporting the results. All studies that measured QOL reported using unvalidated instruments, or did not report how QOL was assessed. Only 1 study provided sufficient information for QOL measurements to be replicated. Recently published articles (2011-2013) were significantly more likely to report measuring QOL, compared with earlier articles. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life of pets undergoing cancer treatment is largely unreported and cannot be meaningfully compared across treatments or disease states using the existing literature.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the timing, frequency, and risk factors for early seizure recurrence (ESR) among dogs admitted to the hospital for seizure evaluation and to facilitate rapid decision making about whether dogs should be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) or day ward. ANIMALS: Nine-hundred twenty-two dogs referred for seizure investigation; 214 patients were included. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records between 2000 and 2017 were reviewed to determine risk factors for ESR. Findings were compared among dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), structural epilepsy (StE) and reactive seizures (RS), as well as in all selected cases together. RESULTS: Fifty percent of dogs had a seizure while hospitalized. In the group 53.1 and 52.2% in the StE group, whereas in the RS 40.44% had ESR. The average time to ESR was 7 hours. In IE group, abnormal postictal neurological examination with prosencephalon signs predicted ESR. In StE group, a single generalized or focal seizure 72 hours before hospital admission and abnormal neurologic examination predicted ESR. In the RS group, ERS was predicted by long-term antiepileptic monotheraphy.

To evaluate BCS, the traditional methods rely on veterinary experts or skilled staff to look at a cow and touch it. These methods have low efficiency especially on large-scale farms. Computer vision methods are widely used but there are some improvements to increase BCS accuracy. In this study, a low cost BCS evaluation method based on deep learning and machine vision is proposed. Firstly, the back-view images of the cows are captured by network cameras, resulting in 8972 images that constituted the sample data set. The camera is a common 2D camera, which is cheaper and easier to install compared with 3D cameras. Secondly, the key body parts such as tails, pins and rump in the images were labeled manually, the Sing Shot multi-box Detector (SSD) method was used to detect the tail and evaluate the BCS. Inspired by DenseNet and Inception-v4, a new SSD was introduced by changing the network connection method of the original SSD.

Fernandes_2020_Frinvesc,JOUR,Image Analysis and Computer Vision Applications in Animal Sciences: An Overview,"Fernandes, Arthur Francisco Araujo and Dorea, Joao Ricardo Reboucas and Rosa, Guilherme Jordao de Magalhaes",Frontiers in veterinary science,"Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, and Digital Image Analysis can be viewed as an amalgam of terms that very often are used to describe similar processes. Most of this confusion arises because these are interconnected fields that emerged with the development of digital image acquisition. Thus, there is a need to understand the connection between these fields, how a digital image is formed, and the differences regarding the many sensors available, each best suited for different applications. From the advent of the charge-coupled devices demarking the birth of digital imaging, the field has advanced quite fast. Sensors have evolved from grayscale to color with increasingly higher resolution and better performance. Also, many other sensors have appeared, such as infrared cameras, stereo imaging, time of flight sensors, satellite, and hyperspectral imaging. There are also images generated by other signals, such as sound (ultrasound scanners and sonars) and radiation (standard x-ray and computed tomography), which are widely used to produce medical images. In animal and veterinary sciences, these sensors have been used in many applications, mostly under experimental conditions and with just some applications yet developed on commercial farms. Such applications can range from the assessment of beef cuts composition to live animal identification, tracking, behavior monitoring, and measurement of phenotypes of interest, such as body weight, condition score, and gait. Computer vision systems (CVS) have the potential to be used in precision livestock farming and high-throughput phenotyping applications. We believe that the constant measurement of traits through CVS can reduce management costs and optimize decision-making in livestock operations, in addition to opening new possibilities in selective breeding. Applications of CSV are currently a growing research area and there are already commercial products available. However, there are still challenges that demand research for the successful development of autonomous solutions capable of delivering critical information. This review intends to present significant developments that have been made in CVS applications in animal and veterinary sciences and to highlight areas in which further research is still needed before full deployment of CVS in breeding programs and commercial farms.",2020,10.3389/fvets.2020.551269,7,NA,551269,eng,2297-1769,automation and computer vision and phenotyping and imaging and sensors and high-throughput phenotyping and precision livestock and livestock,NA,NA,2020///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tidholm_2019_Joofveinme,JOUR,Comparison between real-time 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional biplane echocardiographic assessment of left atrial volumes in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease,"Tidholm, Anna and Bodegard-Westling, Anna and Hoglund, Katja and Haggstrom, Jens and Ljungvall, Ingrid",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of left atrial (LA) size is important in medical decision making and prognostication in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Real-time 3-dimensional (RT3DE) and 2-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) methods may be used to assess LA size. OBJECTIVES: To compare measured LA volumes obtained by RT3DE with those calculated by biplane Simpson's modified method of discs (SMOD) and the area-length method (ALM) using the same RT3DE acquisition with the same timing. ANIMALS: One hundred twenty-one privately owned dogs with naturally occurring MMVD. METHODS: Prospective observational study comparing LA volumes indexed to body weight using RT3DE and 2DE-based biplane SMOD and ALM. Agreement between methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Estimations of LA volume using SMOD or ALM did not show good agreement with RT3DE-derived measurements. Absolute differences between methods increased with increasing LA volume, but SMOD underestimated whereas ALM overestimated calculated volumes compared to RT3DE-derived measurements. The difference in LA volume between RT3DE and the biplane methods showed a systematic underestimation of 7% for SMOD and a systematic overestimation of 24% for ALM. Comparison of LA volumes obtained by SMOD and ALM did not show good agreement. The ALM yielded 30% larger LA volumes compared to SMOD. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In comparison with RT3DE, SMOD systematically underestimated whereas ALM systematically overestimated LA volumes in dogs with MMVD. Because the systematic difference between RT3DE and SMOD was only 7%, SMOD might be considered the method of choice.",2019,10.1111/jvim.15408,33,2,455-461,eng,1939-1676 0891-6640,Female and Male and Animals and Organ Size and Dogs and area-length method and canine and Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology and Echocardiography/methods/*veterinary and Heart Atria/diagnostic imaging and mitral regurgitation and Mitral Valve Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/*veterinary and Simpson's modified method of discs,NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,J Vet Intern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies have proposed that temperature and precipitation are the main variables that limit the geographical distribution of ticks. The analysis of environmental constraints with ecological niche modeling (ENM) techniques can improve our ability to identify suitable areas for emergence events. Algorithms used in this study showed different distributional patterns for each tick genera; the environmental suitability for Amblyomma includes warm and humid localities below 1000 m above the sea level, while Ixodes is mainly associated with ecosystems with high vegetation cover. Dermacentor and Rhipicephalus genus presented wider distribution patterns; the first includes species that are well adapted to resist desiccation, whereas the latter includes generalist species that are mostly associated with domestic hosts in Mexico. Ecological niche models have proven to be useful in estimating the geographic distribution of many taxa of ticks. Despite our limited knowledge of tick's diversity, ENM can improve our understanding of the dynamics of vector-borne diseases and can assist public health decision-making processes.",2020,10.3390/ani10040649,10,4,NA,eng,2076-2615,Amblyomma and Dermacentor and ecological niche modelling and Ixodes and Rhipicephalus,NA,NA,2020/04/09/,Animals (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA

T. and Kent, M. S.",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist describing risk factors for death, and long-term outcomes in dogs with esophageal foreign body (EFB) obstruction. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate short- and long-term outcomes, and analyze risk factors for death in dogs with EFB obstruction. We hypothesized duration of entrapment and treatment type would affect outcome. ANIMALS: A total of 222 dogs were treated for EFB obstruction at an emergency and referral hospital between March 1998 and March 2017. METHODS: Medical records for dogs with EFB were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Foreign material most frequently was osseous (180/222 [81%]), with distal esophagus the most common location (110/222 [49.5%]). Duration of clinical signs was not associated with risk of death (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.17; P = 0.2). Entrapment was treated by endoscopy (204/222 [91.8%]), surgery after endoscopic attempt (13/222 [5.9%]), and repeat endoscopy after surgery was recommended but declined (5/222 [2.3%]). In-hospital case fatality rate was 11/222 (5%). Risk of death was significantly higher with surgery (OR = 20.1, 95% CI 3.59-112.44; P = 0.001), and 5/5 (100%) of dogs died if undergoing endoscopy after surgery was recommended but declined. Increasing numbers of postprocedural complications (OR = 3.44, CI 2.01-5.91; P < 0.001), esophageal perforation (OR = 65.47, CI 4.27-1004.15; P = 0.003), and postprocedure esophageal hemorrhage (OR = 11.81, CI 1.19-116.77; P = 0.04) increased in-hospital risk of death. Esophageal strictures were reported in 4/189 (2.1%) of survivors available for follow-up.

Crosby_2019_Frinvesc,JOUR,Factors Associated With Survival and Return to Function Following Synovial Infections in Horses,"Crosby, Danielle E. and Labens, Raphael and Hughes, Kristopher J. and Nielsen, Sharon and Hilbert, Bryan J.",Frontiers in veterinary science,"Synovial infections (SI) are common in horses of all ages and can be associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Identifying factors influencing survival and return to function may be useful for management of affected individuals and determination of prognosis. The objectives of this study were to identify factors associated with survival and return to function of horses and foals with SI presented to an equine hospital. This study is a retrospective case series. Data were collected from medical records of all horses with SI that were presented to a single equine hospital between April 1st, 2008 and May 1st, 2017. Long-term follow up was obtained by a semi-structured telephone questionnaire of clinical outcomes and analysis of online race records. Univariate models were created using generalized linear and linear mixed models to assess factors associated with outcomes. Multivariable models were created using generalized linear and linear mixed models to determine factors significantly associated with outcomes. Of 186 horses presented with SI, 161/186 (86.6%) were treated and 145/161 (90.1%) survived to discharge. The majority of joints were treated with synovial lavage (93.8%). One hundred and twenty horses were included in the return to function analysis and 79 (65%) returned to function. Increasing number of days of treatment with systemic antimicrobials was associated with increased likelihood of survival for each horse (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27, P = 0.025) and when considering each individual synovial structure (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.17, P = 0.004). Horses treated with doxycycline were less likely to return to function (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.8, P = 0.031). The overall rate of survival of horses treated with SI is good. The likelihood of return to function is lower than for survival. The findings of this study, combined with relevant antimicrobial stewardship practices, can be used as a part of evidence-based decision-making when veterinarians are treating horses with SI.",2019,10.3389/fvets.2019.00367,6,NA,367,eng,2297-1769,outcome and prognosis and horse and joint and synovial structure,NA,NA,2019///,Front Vet Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA
Salau_2020_A.aoajfM,JOUR,Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN Applied to Loose-Housed Dairy Cows in a Multi-Camera Setting,"Salau, Jennifer and Krieter, Joachim",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,"With increasing herd sizes came an enhanced requirement for automated systems to support the farmers in the monitoring of the health and welfare status of their livestock. Cattle are a highly sociable species, and the herd structure has important impact on the animal welfare. As the behaviour of the animals and their social interactions can be influenced by the presence of a human observer, a camera based system that automatically detects the animals would be beneficial to analyse dairy cattle herd activity. In the present study, eight surveillance cameras were mounted above the barn area of a group of thirty-six lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows at the Chamber of Agriculture in Futterkamp in Northern Germany. With Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art model of convolutional neural networks was trained to determine pixel level segmentation masks for the cows in the video material. The model was pre-trained on the Microsoft common objects in the context data set, and transfer learning was carried out on annotated image material from the recordings as training data set. In addition, the relationship between the size of the used training data set and the performance on the model after transfer learning was analysed. The trained model achieved averaged precision (Intersection over union, IOU = 0.5) 91% and 85% for the detection of bounding boxes and segmentation masks of the cows, respectively, thereby laying a solid technical basis for an automated analysis of herd activity and the use of resources in loose-housing.",2020,10.3390/ani10122402,10,12,NA,eng,2076-2615,machine learning and object recognition and dairy cattle and Mask-R-convolutional neural networks and multi-camera video surveillance,NA,NA,2020/12/15/,Animals (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA
Sun_2020_A.aoajfM,JOUR,The Dynamic Changes of Gut Microbiota during the Perinatal Period in Sows,"Sun, Lan and Zhang, Yu and Chen, Wei and Lan, Tian and Wang, Yan and Wu, Yinbao and Liao, Xindi and Mi, Jiandui",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,"The gut microbiota in sows is important for the health of the host, and potential benefits may also be transferred to piglets during pregnancy. Therefore, systematic studies investigating the changes in the gut microbiota of sows are needed to elucidate the microbial compositions and functions. This study was conducted at 12 time points to investigate the temporal variations in gut microbiota on Days 27, 46, 64, 81, 100, and 113 during gestation (G) and Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 during lactation (L). Results suggested that the gut microbiota changed across the perinatal period with microbial function and abundance varying between the prenatal and postnatal periods. The alpha diversity was higher in the postnatal period than in the prenatal period. Thirty-eight genera were distributed between the two periods with Methanobrevibacter, Desulfovibrio, Akkermansia, and Turicibacter being enriched in the prenatal period while Eubacterium, Actinobacillus, Paludibacter, Butyricimonas, Megasphaera, Succiniclasticum, Acidaminococcus, and Rummeliibacillus were enriched in the postnatal period. Analysis done at the different time points of the prenatal period suggested that Days 27 and 113 had more microbial biomarkers than other days. Bacteroidales, Bacteroidia, and Prevotella were enriched on the 27th day, while bacteria belonging to the Clostridium and Ruminococcaceae were enriched on the 113th day. On the other hand, Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridia, and unclassified Christensenellaceae were enriched three days after delivery. Predicted microbial KO functions were also more enriched on Day 27 of the gestation period and Day 3 of the lactation period. Random forest, a machine learning method, was used to identify the top five important genera of Megasphaera, Stenotrophomonas, Phyllobacterium, Catenibacterium, and Turicibacter, while the most important function was arginine and proline metabolism.
