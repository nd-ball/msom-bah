However, despite numerous revisions, MELD allocation still does not allow for equitable access to all waitlisted candidates. An optimized prediction of mortality (OPOM) was developed (http://www.opom.online) utilizing machine-learning optimal classification tree models trained to predict a candidate's 3-month waitlist mortality or removal utilizing the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) dataset. The Liver Simulated Allocation Model (LSAM) was then used to compare OPOM to MELD-based allocation. Out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated for candidate groups of increasing disease severity. OPOM allocation, when compared to MELD, reduced mortality on average by 417.96 (406.8-428.4) deaths every year in LSAM analysis. Improved survival was noted across all candidate demographics, diagnoses, and geographic regions. OPOM delivered a substantially higher AUC across all disease severity groups. OPOM more accurately and objectively prioritizes candidates for liver transplantation based on disease severity, allowing for more equitable allocation of livers with a resultant significant number of additional lives saved every year.

F.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,"Since the inception of living donor kidney transplantation, physicians have expressed concern about the voluntariness of the donors and their ability to recuse themselves. The literature from the late 1960s and early 1970s reveals the practice of offering a false medical excuse, although more recent comments seem to focus more on a 'general statement of lack of suitability' or 'a blameless explanation'. Simmerling et al. argue that the provision of a medical excuse rests on deception, which is wrong on deontological grounds (that physicians should hold to a principle of veracity) and on consequential grounds (deception threatens to damage trust and the doctor-patient relationship and deception may have adverse impact on the donor's relationship with his family). In this paper I examine and reject these objections. I argue that a false medical excuse is morally unjustifiable, but the medical excuse understood as a 'general statement of lack of suitability' is morally permissible because it promotes donor autonomy (the donor's right to decide whether or not to donate), and protects and preserves the donor's rights to privacy and confidentiality (by affirming the donor as an independent patient).",2010,10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.03010.x,10,4,731-736,eng,1600-6143 1600-6135,Humans and Privacy and Confidentiality and Informed Consent and *Decision Making and *Kidney Transplantation and Coercion and *Living Donors,NA,NA,2010/04//undefined,Am J Transplant,NA,NA,NA,NA

About half of newly diagnosed ESRD in the United States occurs by age 65, and about half of that is from diabetic nephropathy, which takes about 25 years to develop. Therefore, the remaining baseline lifetime risk for ESRD is significantly lower in the normal, nondiabetic 55-year-old donor candidate. Some older donors with an isolated medical abnormality such as mild hypertension will be at lower or about the same overall baseline lifetime risk for ESRD as are young 'normal' donor candidates.

In an effort to harmonize integration of the concept of frailty among transplant centers, the AST and ASTS supported the efforts of our working group to develop this statement from experts in the field. Frailty is a multidimensional construct that represents the end-manifestation of derangements of multiple physiologic systems leading to decreased physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to health stressors. In hepatology/liver transplantation, investigation of frailty has largely focused on physical frailty, which subsumes the concepts of functional performance, functional capacity, and disability.

Yet living donation challenges the ethical principle of nonmaleficence by subjecting healthy individuals to medical, psychosocial and unknown risks. Therefore, transplant providers, policy-makers and donors are committed to ensuring that prospective donors provide adequate informed consent to undergo the procedure. Informed consent for living donation is ethically required as a means of demonstrating respect for donor's autonomy and protecting their safety. However, all elements of informed consent are fraught with difficulties due to the unique nature of the donation process and outcome. This paper reviews empirical research on informed consent for live kidney donors (LKD) and live liver donors (LLD) for both adult and pediatric recipients. As this review shows, studies that empirically assessed the quality of informed consent elements reveal considerable variability and deficiencies across the informed consent process, suggesting the need for improvement.

Kiberd_2011_Tran,JOUR,Simultaneous liver kidney transplantation: a medical decision analysis,"Kiberd, Bryce and Skedgel, Chris and Alwayn, Ian and Peltekian, Kevork",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: The use of simultaneous liver kidney transplantation has increased dramatically. When the liver and kidney are available from the same deceased donor, what is the best decision? There are two allocation options. In the combined allocation, both organs are allocated to a liver failure (end-stage liver disease [ESLD]) patient on dialysis leaving an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient on dialysis. In split allocation, the liver is allocated to the liver failure patient on dialysis and the kidney to the patient with ESRD. METHODS: A computerized medical decision analysis was performed using published US survival data. The two options were compared by examining differences in projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Combined allocation was the best strategy (+0.806 QALYs) if liver transplant recipients on dialysis have proportionately worse survival compared with kidney failure alone patients on dialysis. However, because some patients with hepatorenal syndrome recover kidney function post-liver transplant alone (LTA), a second analysis incorporated the possibilities of being dialysis free. If the chance of recovery of renal function is 50% rather than 0%, the decision reversed. Here, the split allocation provided 1.02 more total QALYs than the combined allocation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that simultaneous liver kidney transplantation is an excellent strategy in most patients with both ESLD and ESRD. However, allocating a kidney to a patient with ESLD, who has the potential to be dialysis free without a kidney transplant, does not maximize overall outcomes when all patients are considered.",2011,10.1097/tp.0b013e3181fcc943,91,1,121-127,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,"Humans and Treatment Outcome and Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and *Kidney Transplantation and *Liver Transplantation and Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality/*surgery and Liver Failure/mortality/*surgery",NA,NA,2011/01/15/,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA

The role of myosteatosis in posttransplant outcomes remains to be determined. Here we investigated skeletal muscle mass and myosteatosis as prognostic factors in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The data of 225 consecutive OLT recipients from a prospective database were retrospectively analyzed (May 2010-December 2017). Computed tomography-based skeletal-muscle-index (muscle mass), visceral-fat-area (visceral adiposity), and mean skeletal-muscle-radiation-attenuation (myosteatosis) were calculated using a segmentation tool. Cut-off values of myosteatosis resulted in a good stratification of patients into low- and high-risk groups in terms of morbidity (Clavien-Dindo <e2><89><a5>3b). Patients with myosteatosis had significantly higher complication rates (90-day Comprehensive Complication Index 68 <c2><b1> 32 vs 44 <c2><b1> 30, P < .001) and also displayed significantly longer intensive care (18 <c2><b1> 25 vs 11 <c2><b1> 21 days, P < .001) and hospital stay (56 <c2><b1> 55 vs 33 <c2><b1> 24 days, P < .001).

A well-developed CDSS weighs the benefits of therapy versus the cost in terms of loss of quality of life and financial loss and recommends the decision that can be expected to provide maximum overall benefit. This article provides an introduction to developing CDSSs using Bayesian networks, such CDSS can help with the often complex decisions involving transplants. First, we review Bayes theorem in the context of medical decision making. Then, we introduce Bayesian networks, which can model probabilistic relationships among many related variables and are based on Bayes theorem. Next, we discuss influence diagrams, which are Bayesian networks augmented with decision and value nodes and which can be used to develop CDSSs that are able to recommend decisions that maximize the expected utility of the predicted outcomes to the patient. By way of comparison, we examine the benefit and challenges of using the Kidney Donor Risk Index as the sole decision tool.

Sutherland_2020_Tran,JOUR,Utilizing a Hospital-based Setting to Increase Organ Donor Registrations,"Sutherland, Michael and Moloney, Gail and Norton, Maddison and Bowling, Alison and Walker, Iain",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Shortages of organs for transplantation are a concern for many countries. In Australia's ""opt-in"" system, people register their donation decision on the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR) in their own time, yet <30% of the population have done so. Consent registrations are honored by the next-of-kin in 90% of cases, so increasing registrations will increase donated organs for transplantation. This study investigated the efficacy of offering an immediate registration opportunity in 2 hospitals, and the role that beliefs about organ donation play in registration behavior. METHODS: An immediate registration opportunity was offered at a public and a private hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Participants (N = 168) categorized as medical/healthcare (eg, doctor and nurse) and nonhealthcare (eg, teacher and chef) completed a measure of beliefs about organ donation, were encouraged to discuss their fears and concerns about organ donation, and given an immediate opportunity to register on the AODR. RESULTS: A total of 81.5% of medical/healthcare participants who were eligible registered, and 71.5% of all eligible participants registered on the spot. Beliefs about the negative consequences of donation and concerns over the medical care given to potential donors predicted (non)registration. Medical/healthcare participants reported lower levels of fears and concerns than nonhealthcare participants. Although both groups reported strong positive beliefs about donation, these did not predict registration. CONCLUSIONS: Offering an immediate registration opportunity in 2 hospitals notably increased the number of registrations on the AODR, suggesting this is a strategy that could potentially increase registrations in opt-in donation systems.",2020,10.1097/TP.0000000000002981,104,6,1210-1214,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and New South Wales and *Decision Making and *Professional-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires/statistics & numerical data and Registries/statistics & numerical data and Tissue Donors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Hospitals/statistics & numerical data and Organ Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data and Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Prasad_2014_Tran,JOUR,Impact and cost of the serum galactomannan assay at a tertiary care facility,"Prasad, Paritosh and Fishman, Jay A.",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Invasive aspergillosis carries a high mortality with a rising prevalence in immunocompromised hosts. Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is challenging and delays in treatment are associated with poor outcomes. The galactomannan assay (GM), a non-culture-based surrogate marker of fungal infection, is widely used in diagnosis. It is unknown whether this assay impacts clinical decision making. We evaluated whether GM testing results in earlier initiation of antifungal therapy and is cost effective. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of all patients undergoing GM at a 907-bed tertiary-care general hospital from July 11, 2011, to June 12, 2012. Records of patients with a positive GM were individually reviewed to determine the timing of the assay result, presence and timing of relevant culture data, whether BAL GM was performed, radiology data consistent with invasive aspergillosis, and the timing of initiation of antifungal therapy. For each case, it was determined whether GM results impacted the decision to initiate antifungal therapy. RESULTS: Forty-six nonduplicate GM samples were positive (>0.5) of 1419 performed. Results were considered to be false positives in 18 cases by care teams. In 21 cases, antifungal therapy was initiated before the assay result based on clinical suspicion, culture data, and/or radiology.

Such disparities may be in part explained by nephrologists' beliefs and decisions about recipient eligibility. This study aims to describe nephrologists' attitudes towards recipient eligibility and access to living kidney donor transplantation. METHODS: Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted from June to October 2013 with 41 nephrologists from Australia and New Zealand. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: We identified five major themes: championing optimal recipient outcomes (maximizing recipient survival, increasing opportunity, accepting justified risks, needing control and certainty of outcomes, safeguarding psychological wellbeing), justifying donor sacrifice (confidence in reasonable utility, sparing the donor, ensuring reciprocal donor benefit), advocating for patients (being proactive and encouraging, addressing ambivalence, depending on supportive infrastructure, avoiding selective recommendations), maintaining professional boundaries (minimizing conflict of interest, respecting shared decision-making, emphasizing patient accountability, restricted decisional power, protecting unit interests), and entrenched inequities (exclusivity of living donors, inherently advantaging self-advocates, navigating language barriers, increasing center transparency, inevitable geographical disadvantage, understanding cultural barriers). CONCLUSIONS: Nephrologists' decisions about recipient suitability for living donor transplantation aimed to achieve optimal recipient outcomes, but were constrained by competing priorities to ensure reasonable utility derived from the donor kidney and protect the integrity of the transplant program.

To make an informed choice about whether to pursue kidney transplant, patients must be knowledgeable of its risks and benefits. To reliably and validly measure ESRD patients' kidney transplant knowledge, rigorously tested measures are required. This article describes the development and psychometric testing of the Knowledge Assessment of Renal Transplantation (KART). METHODS: We administered 17 transplant knowledge items to a sample of 1294 ESRD patients. Item characteristics and scale scores were estimated using an Item Response Theory graded response model. Construct validity was tested by examining differences in scale scores between patients who had spent less than 1 and 1 hour or longer receiving various types of transplant education. RESULTS: Item Response Theory modeling suggested that 15 items should be retained for the KART. This scale had a marginal reliability of 0.75 and evidenced acceptable reliability (>0.70) across most of its range. Construct validity was supported by the KART's ability to distinguish patients who had spent less than 1 and 1 hour or longer receiving different types of kidney transplant education, including talking to doctors/medical staff (effect size [ES], 0.61; P < 0.001), reading brochures (ES, 0.45; P < 0.001), browsing the internet (ES, 0.56; P < 0.001), and watching videos (ES, 0.56; P < 0.001).

METHODS: This retrospective study aimed to describe a large single-center experience of infants who received isolated LTx, illustrate important differences in infants versus older children, and identify pretransplant factors which influence survival. More than 25 pre-LTx demographic, laboratory, and operative variables were analyzed using the Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 2006, 216 LTx were performed in 186 infants with a mean follow-up time of 62 months. Median age at LTx was 9 months, the majority had cholestatic liver disease, were hospitalized pre-LTx, and received whole grafts. Leading indications for re-LTx (n=30) included vascular complications (43%) and graft nonfunction (40%), whereas leading causes of death were sepsis and multiorgan failure. One-, 5-, and 10-year graft and patient survivals were 75%/72%/68% and 79%/77%/75%, respectively. Relative to older pediatric recipients, infants had worse overall patient survival (P=0.05).

This study elicited community attitudes on deceased organ donation and the current Australian organ donation system. METHODS: Thirteen focus groups with 114 participants aged between 18 and 75 years. Qualitative analysis using a grounded theory approach was used. RESULTS: Participants were generally positive toward deceased organ donation, but this did not always translate to decisions to be a donor. Three main categories of themes emerged. (1) Participants held core beliefs that both encouraged donation, such as ""giving is good"" and ""saving lives,"" and discouraged donation, such as loss of body dignity, need for body wholeness, and differing medical care for donors. (2) A range of factors could influence how core beliefs were weighted in the decision-making process, including family, knowledge, information, media, grief, apathy, and fear. (3) Participants discussed the need for a simpler consent system where family members could not overrule their donation decision, greater public awareness for organ donation, and the availability of more information on the organ donation process. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist to improve deceased organ donation rates by education to improve confidence in the donation process, positive media coverage, and clear information on each religion's stance on organ donation.

We calculated the proportion of candidates at each center who were listed for SLK transplantation within 6 months of eligibility. Multilevel logistic regression and parametric survival model was used to estimate the center-specific probability of SLK listing, adjusting for patient and center-level characteristics. RESULTS: Among 4736 SLK-eligible candidates, 64.8% were listed for SLK within 6 months of eligibility. However, the percentage of SLK listing ranged from 0% to 100% across centers. African American race, male sex, transplant history, diabetes, and hypertension were associated with a higher likelihood of SLK listing. Conversely, older age was associated with a lower likelihood of SLK listing. After adjusting for candidate characteristics, the percentage of SLK listing still ranged from 3.8% to 80.2% across centers; this wide variation persisted even after further adjusting for center-level characteristics.

Knight_2018_Tran,JOUR,Development of a Clinical Decision Support System for Living Kidney Donor Assessment Based on National Guidelines,"Knight, Simon R. and Cao, Khoa N. and South, Matthew and Hayward, Nicki and Hunter, James P. and Fox, John",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Live donor nephrectomy is an operation that places the donor at risk of complications without the possibility of medical benefit. Rigorous donor selection and assessment is therefore essential to ensure minimization of risk and for this reason robust national guidelines exist. Previous studies have demonstrated poor adherence to donor guidelines. METHODS: We developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS), based on national living donor guidelines, to facilitate the identification of contraindications, additional investigations, special considerations, and the decision as to nephrectomy side in potential living donors. The CDSS was then tested with patient data from 45 potential kidney donors. RESULTS: The CDSS comprises 17 core tasks completed by either patient or nurse, and 17 optional tasks that are triggered by certain patient demographics or conditions. Decision rules were able to identify contraindications, additional investigations, special considerations, and predicted operation side in our patient cohort. Seventeen of 45 patients went on to donate a kidney, of whom 7 had major contraindications defined in the national guidelines, many of which were not identified by the clinical team. Only 43% of additional investigations recommended by national guidelines were completed, with the most frequently missed investigations being oral glucose tolerance testing and routine cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of turning a complex set of national guidelines into an easy-to-use machine-readable CDSS. Comparison with real-world decisions suggests that use of this CDSS may improve compliance with guidelines and informed consent tailored to individual patient risks.",2018,10.1097/TP.0000000000002374,102,10,e447-e453,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,"Humans and Female and Retrospective Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Health Plan Implementation and Clinical Decision-Making/methods and Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects and *Living Donors and Informed Consent/standards and Nephrectomy/*adverse effects and Preoperative Care/methods/standards and Donor Selection/*organization & administration/standards and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*organization & administration/standards and Guideline Adherence/organization & administration/standards and Kidney/surgery and Nursing Assessment/organization & administration/standards",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Tong_2010_Tran,JOUR,Community preferences for the allocation of solid organs for transplantation: a systematic review,"Tong, Allison and Howard, Kirsten and Jan, Stephen and Cass, Alan and Rose, John and Chadban, Steven and Allen, Richard D. and Craig, Jonathan C.",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Organs for transplantation are a scarce community resource but community preferences and how they are incorporated into allocation policies are unclear. This systematic review aimed to ascertain community preferences for organ allocation and the principles underpinning these preferences. METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, EconLit, and gray literature databases were searched. Quantitative data were extracted, and a qualitative textual synthesis of the results and conclusions reported in each included study was performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies involving more than 5563 respondents were included. Seven themes describing community preferences for organ allocation were identified: (1) maximum benefit, to achieve maximum health gain in recipient survival and quality of life; (2) social valuation, to base preferences on societal gain; (3) moral deservingness, to consider the ""worthiness"" of recipients based on their social standing and lifestyle decisions; (4) prejudice, to make a judgement based on personal ideologic viewpoints; (5) ""fair innings,"" to provide an organ preferentially to the younger recipient giving opportunity for a ""normal"" life span and to those waiting for a first organ rather than a retransplant; (6) ""first come, first served,"" to allocate the organ to recipients wait-listed the longest; and (7) medical urgency, to allocate based on illness severity and saving life. CONCLUSIONS: Community preferences for organ allocation hinge on a complex balance of efficiency, social valuation, morality, fairness, and equity principles. Being a community-held resource, effective ways to identify and incorporate community preferences into allocation algorithms for solid organ transplantation are warranted.",2010,10.1097/TP.0b013e3181cf1ee1,89,7,796-805,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,"Humans and Decision Making and Health Policy and Algorithms and Prognosis and Morals and Social Values and Decision Support Systems, Clinical and Prejudice and *Patient Selection and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Public Opinion and Waiting Lists and *Community Health Services/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration and *Health Care Rationing/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration and *Organ Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence and *Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration and Social Desirability and Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/*supply & distribution",NA,NA,2010/04/15/,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cognard_2018_Tran,JOUR,Recurrence of Renal Cell Cancer After Renal Transplantation in a Multicenter French Cohort,"Cognard, Noelle and Anglicheau, Dany and Gatault, Philippe and Girerd, Sophie and Essig, Marie and Hurault de Ligny, Bruno and Le Meur, Yann and Le Roy, Franck and Garrouste, Cyril and Thierry, Antoine and Colosio, Charlotte and Rivalan, Joseph and Sayegh, Johnny and Choukroun, Gabriel and Moulin, Bruno and Caillard, Sophie",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Renal cancer accounts for 3% of adult malignancies; renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 80% of all renal cancers, and is characterized by late recurrences. Recurrences after kidney transplantation are associated with a high mortality rate. We aimed to determine if recurrences are linked to tumor characteristics and to delays between diagnosis and transplantation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from French kidney-transplanted patients with medical histories of pretransplant renal cancer, focusing on the most common histological subtypes: clear cell and papillary cancers. Characteristics of the tumors, patients, and kidney transplantations were documented, and posttransplant patient survival was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 13 experienced cancer recurrence after kidney transplantation. The mean delay in recurrence was 3 <c2><b1> 2.3 years posttransplantation, and the cumulative incidences of recurrence were 7.7% at 5 years and 14.9% at 10 years. The risk of recurrence was higher in patients with clear cell RCC (13% vs 0%, P = 0.015). There was no correlation between posttransplant recurrence and the interval before transplantation. Factors associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence were histological clear cell RCC (P = 0.025), tumor stage pT2 (P = 0.002), and Fuhrman grade IV (P < 0.001). Recurrences were associated with a high mortality rate; 76.9% of patients with recurrences had died by the end of the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrences of clear cell RCC are not uncommon after kidney transplantation and are associated with very poor prognoses. These results should be considered before listing patients with a history of renal cancer for transplantation.",2018,10.1097/TP.0000000000002009,102,5,860-867,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Aged and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome and Incidence and Patient Selection and France and Clinical Decision-Making and Carcinoma, Renal Cell/mortality/pathology/*surgery and Kidney Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*surgery and Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality and Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology",NA,NA,2018/05//undefined,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Freeman_2017_Tran,JOUR,Has the Department of Veterans Affairs Found a Way to Avoid Racial Disparities in the Evaluation Process for Kidney Transplantation?,"Freeman, Michael A. and Pleis, John R. and Bornemann, Kellee R. and Croswell, Emilee and Dew, Mary Amanda and Chang, Chung-Chou H. and Switzer, Galen E. and Langone, Anthony and Mittal-Henkle, Anuja and Saha, Somnath and Ramkumar, Mohan and Adams Flohr, Jareen and Thomas, Christie P. and Myaskovsky, Larissa",Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Minority groups are affected by significant disparities in kidney transplantation (KT) in Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA transplant centers. However, prior VA studies have been limited to retrospective, secondary database analyses that focused on multiple stages of the KT process simultaneously. Our goal was to determine whether disparities during the evaluation period for KT exist in the VA as has been found in non-VA settings. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter longitudinal cohort study of 602 patients undergoing initial evaluation for KT at 4 National VA KT Centers. Participants completed a telephone interview to determine whether, after controlling for medical factors, differences in time to acceptance for transplant were explained by patients' demographic, cultural, psychosocial, or transplant knowledge factors. RESULTS: There were no significant racial disparities in the time to acceptance for KT [Log-Rank <cf><87> = 1.04; P = 0.594]. Younger age (hazards ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.99), fewer comorbidities (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95), being married (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99), having private and public insurance (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.51), and moderate or greater levels of depression (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.03-3.29) predicted a shorter time to acceptance. The influence of preference for type of KT (deceased or living donor) and transplant center location on days to acceptance varied over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the VA National Transplant System did not exhibit the racial disparities in evaluation for KT as have been found in non-VA transplant centers.",2017,10.1097/TP.0000000000001377,101,6,1191-1199,eng,1534-6080 0041-1337,"Emotions and United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Risk Factors and Interviews as Topic and Patient Education as Topic and Proportional Hazards Models and Chi-Square Distribution and Kaplan-Meier Estimate and Cultural Characteristics and *Patient Selection and *Clinical Decision-Making and Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology and Process Assessment, Health Care and Waiting Lists and *Minority Groups/psychology and *Ethnicity/psychology and *United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology and Kidney Failure, Chronic/diagnosis/ethnology/*surgery and Kidney Transplantation/*methods and Veterans Health/*ethnology",NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,Transplantation,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bertsimas_2020_Tran,JOUR,Balancing efficiency and fairness in liver transplant access: tradeoff curves for the assessment of organ distribution policies,"Bertsimas, Dimitris and Papalexopoulos, Theodore and Trichakis, Nikolaos and Wang, Yuchen and Hirose, Ryutaro and Vagefi, Parsia A",Transplantation,"Background: Current distribution policies have resulted in persistent geographic disparity in access to donated livers across the country for waitlisted candidates. Methods: Using mathematical optimization, and subsequently the Liver Simulation Allocation Model, the following organ distribution concepts were assessed: (1) current policy, (2) proposed alternative models, and (3) a novel continuous distribution model. A number of different scenarios for each policy distribution concept were generated and analyzed through efficiency-fairness tradeoff curves. Results: The continuous distribution concept allowed both for the greatest reduction in patient deaths and for the most equitable geographic distribution across comparable organ transportation burden. When applied with an Optimized Prediction of Mortality allocation scheme, continuous distribution allowed for a significant reduction in number of deaths-on the order of 500 lives saved annually (https://livervis.github.io/). Conclusions: Tradeoff curves allow for a visualized understanding on the efficiency/fairness balance, and have demonstrated that liver candidates awaiting transplant would benefit from a model employing continuous distribution as this holds the greatest advantage for mortality reduction. Development and implementation of continuous distribution models for all solid organ transplants may allow for minimization of the geographic disparity in organ distribution, and allow for efficient and fair access to a limited national resource for all candidates.",2020,NA,104,5,981-987,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020///,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
