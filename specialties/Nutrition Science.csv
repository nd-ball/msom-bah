Colmenarejo_2020_Nutr,JOUR,Machine Learning Models to Predict Childhood and Adolescent Obesity: A Review,"Colmenarejo, Gonzalo",Nutrients,"The prevalence of childhood and adolescence overweight an obesity is raising at an alarming rate in many countries. This poses a serious threat to the current and near-future health systems, given the association of these conditions with different comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) and even death. In order to design appropriate strategies for its prevention, as well as understand its origins, the development of predictive models for childhood/adolescent overweight/obesity and related outcomes is of extreme value. Obesity has a complex etiology, and in the case of childhood and adolescence obesity, this etiology includes also specific factors like (pre)-gestational ones; weaning; and the huge anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal changes that during this period the body suffers. In this way, Machine Learning models are becoming extremely useful tools in this area, given their excellent predictive power; ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables; and capacity to deal with high-dimensional data typical in this area. This is especially important given the recent appearance of large repositories of Electronic Health Records (EHR) that allow the development of models using datasets with many instances and predictor variables, from which Deep Learning variants can generate extremely accurate predictions. In the current work, the area of Machine Learning models to predict childhood and adolescent obesity and related outcomes is comprehensively and critically reviewed, including the latest ones using Deep Learning with EHR. These models are compared with the traditional statistical ones that used mainly logistic regression. The main features and applications appearing from these models are described, and the future opportunities are discussed.",2020,10.3390/nu12082466,12,8,NA,eng,2072-6643,"deep learning and machine learning and data science and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Forecasting and BMI and Comorbidity and Prevalence and obesity and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 and Cardiovascular Diseases and *Models, Statistical and *Deep Learning and Metabolic Syndrome and childhood obesity and overweight and Pediatric Obesity/*epidemiology/*prevention & control and statistical models",NA,NA,2020/08/16/,Nutrients,NA,NA,NA,NA

It provides rich nutrition for human health and satisfies various other requirements for food consumption. However, establishing traceability systems for processed food faces a different set of challenges compared to primary agro-food, because of the variety of raw materials, batch mixing, and resource transformation. In this paper, progress in the traceability of processed food is reviewed. Based on an analysis of the food supply chain and processing stage, the problem of traceability in food processing results from the transformations that the resources go through. Methods to implement traceability in food processing, including physical separation in different lots, defining and associating batches, isotope analysis and DNA tracking, statistical data models, internal traceability system development, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain-based approaches are summarized. Traceability is evaluated based on recall effects, TRUs (traceable resource units), and comprehensive granularity. Different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. The combined application of different methods should consider the specific application scenarios in food processing to improve granularity. On the other hand, novel technologies, including batch mixing optimization with AI, quality forecasting with big data, and credible traceability with blockchain, are presented in the context of improving traceability performance in food processing.",2022,10.1080/10408398.2020.1825925,62,3,679-692,eng,1549-7852 1040-8398,Humans and traceability and Artificial intelligence (AI) and Food Supply and *Artificial Intelligence and *Blockchain and batch mixing and Food Handling and food processing and resource transformation,NA,NA,2022///,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pamela K. and Grayson, James and Lie, Amanda and Yu, Chong Ho",Nutrients,"To personalize nutrition, the purpose of this study was to examine five key genes in the folate metabolism pathway, and dietary parameters and related interactive parameters as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) by measuring the healthy eating index (HEI) in multiethnic families. The five genes included methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 and 1298, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756, methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 19bp, and they were used to compute a total gene mutation score. We included 53 families, 53 CRC patients and 53 paired family friend members of diverse population groups in Southern California. We measured multidimensional data using the ensemble bootstrap forest method to identify variables of importance within domains of genetic, demographic, and dietary parameters to achieve dimension reduction. We then constructed predictive generalized regression (GR) modeling with a supervised machine learning validation procedure with the target variable (cancer status) being specified to validate the results to allow enhanced prediction and reproducibility. The results showed that the CRC group had increased total gene mutation scores compared to the family members (p < 0.05). Using the Akaike's information criterion and Leave-One-Out cross validation GR methods, the HEI was interactive with thiamine (vitamin B1), which is a new finding for the literature. The natural food sources for thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish which HEI scoring included as part of healthy portions (versus limiting portions on salt, saturated fat and empty calories). Additional predictors included age, as well as gender and the interaction of MTHFR 677 with overweight status (measured by body mass index) in predicting CRC, with the cancer group having more men and overweight cases. The HEI score was significant when split at the median score of 77 into greater or less scores, confirmed through the machine-learning recursive tree method and predictive modeling, although an HEI score of greater than 80 is the US national standard set value for a good diet.

To accurately quantify dietary intake, measurement of the portion size or food volume is required. For volume estimation, previous research studies mostly focused on using model-based or stereo-based approaches which rely on manual intervention or require users to capture multiple frames from different viewing angles which can be tedious. In this paper, a view synthesis approach based on deep learning is proposed to reconstruct 3D point clouds of food items and estimate the volume from a single depth image. A distinct neural network is designed to use a depth image from one viewing angle to predict another depth image captured from the corresponding opposite viewing angle. The whole 3D point cloud map is then reconstructed by fusing the initial data points with the synthesized points of the object items through the proposed point cloud completion and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms. Furthermore, a database with depth images of food object items captured from different viewing angles is constructed with image rendering and used to validate the proposed neural network.

A. and Brunak, Soren","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","BACKGROUND: Individuals respond differently to dietary intake leading to different associations between diet and traits. Most studies have investigated large cohorts without subgrouping them. OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to identify non-uniform associations between diets and anthropometric traits that appeared to be in conflict with one another across subgroups. DESIGN: We used a cohort comprising 43,790 women and men, the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study, which includes a baseline examination at age 50-64 years and a follow-up about 5 years later. The baseline examination involved anthropometrics, body fat percentage, a food frequency questionnaire and information on lifestyle. From the questionnaire data we computed association rules between the intake of food groups and changes in waist circumference and body weight. Using association rule mining on subgroups and gender-specific cohorts, we identified non-uniform associations. The two gender-specific cohorts were stratified into subgroups using a non-linear, self-organizing map based method. RESULTS: We found 22 and 7 cases of conflicting rules in 8 participant subgroups for different anthropometric traits in women and men, respectively. For example, in a subgroup of women moderate waist loss was associated with a dietary pattern characterized by low intake in both cabbages and wine, in conflict with the association trends of both dietary factors in the female cohort. The finding of more conflicting rules in women suggests that inter-individual differences in response to dietary intake are stronger in women than in men.

Conflicting rules adds an additional layer of complexity that should be integrated into the study of these relationships, for example in relation to genotypes.",2020,10.1016/j.clnu.2019.02.003,39,1,265-275,eng,1532-1983 0261-5614,Machine learning and Denmark and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Sex Factors and Machine Learning and Cohort Studies and Data Mining and Life Style and Dietary patterns and *Anthropometry and Association mining and Anthropometric changes and Diet/*methods/*statistics & numerical data and Incongruent subgroups,NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Clin Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hamad_2019_ThAmjoofclnu,JOUR,Comparing demographic and health characteristics of new and existing SNAP recipients: application of a machine learning algorithm,"Hamad, Rita and Templeton, Zachary S. and Schoemaker, Lena and Zhao, Michelle and Bhattacharya, Jay",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"BACKGROUND: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) expanded significantly after the Great Recession of 2008-2009, but no studies have characterized this new group of recipients. Few data sets provide details on whether an individual is a new or established recipient of SNAP. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify new and existing SNAP recipients, and to examine differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health, nutritional status, and food purchasing behavior between new and existing recipients of SNAP after the recession. METHODS: We created a probabilistic algorithm to identify new and existing SNAP recipients using the 1999-2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We applied this algorithm to the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), fielded during 2012-2013, to predict which individuals were likely to be new SNAP recipients. We then compared health and nutrition characteristics between new, existing, and never recipients of SNAP in FoodAPS. RESULTS: New adult SNAP recipients had higher socioeconomic status, better self-reported health, and greater food security relative to existing recipients, and were more likely to smoke relative to never recipients. New child SNAP recipients were less likely to eat all meals and had lower BMI relative to existing recipients. New SNAP households exhibited differences in food access and expenditures, although dietary quality was similar to that of existing SNAP households. CONCLUSION: We developed a novel algorithm for predicting new and existing SNAP recipiency that can be applied to other data sets, and subsequently demonstrated differences in health characteristics between new and existing recipients.

The primary aim of this study was to use energy balance components, namely input (dietary energy intake and macronutrient composition) and output (physical activity) to predict energy stores (body weight) as a way to evaluate their ability to identify potential phenotypes based on these parameters. From the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI OS), carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fibers, sugars, and physical activity variables, namely energy expended from mild, moderate, and vigorous intensity activity, were used to predict current body weight (both as body weight in kilograms and as a body mass index (BMI) category). Several machine learning tools were used for this prediction. Finally, cluster analysis was used to identify putative phenotypes. For the numerical predictions, the support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms performed modestly, with mean approximate errors (MAEs) of 6.70 kg, 6.98 kg, and 6.90 kg, respectively. For categorical prediction, SVM performed the best (54.5% accuracy), followed closely by the bagged tree ensemble and kNN algorithms. K-means cluster analysis improved prediction using numerical data, identified 10 clusters suggestive of phenotypes, with a minimum MAE of ~1.1 kg. A classifier was used to phenotype subjects into the identified clusters, with MAEs <5 kg for 15% of the test set (n = ~2000).

This is a minimum set of practicable indicators for use in characterizing a patient/client as malnourished, considering the global variations in screening and nutrition assessment, and to be used across different health care settings. As with other consensus-based frameworks for diagnosing disease states, these operational criteria require validation and reliability testing as they are currently based solely on expert opinion. METHODS: Several forms of validation and reliability are reviewed in the context of GLIM, providing guidance on how to conduct retrospective and prospective studies for criterion and construct validity. FINDINGS: There are some aspects of GLIM criteria which require refinement; research using large data bases can be employed to reach this goal. Machine learning is also introduced as a potential method to support identification of the best cut-points and combinations of operational criteria for use with the different forms of malnutrition, which the GLIM criteria were created to denote. It is noted as well that the validation and reliability testing need to occur in a variety of sectors, populations and with diverse persons completing the criteria.

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed through two Mediterranean diet scores. Differences in maternal characteristics (diet, education, income, parity, smoking, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), physical activity, contraception) with regards to location and dietary habits were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The machine learning approach was used to reveal other potential non-linear relationships. The results showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was low to moderate among the pregnant women in this study, with no significant mainland-island differences. The highest adherence was observed among wealthier women with generally healthier lifestyle choices. The most significant mainland-island differences were observed for lifestyle and socioeconomic factors (income, education, physical activity).

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to develop a prediction model to identify patients who need prophylactic gastrostomy insertion, defined as the expected use of TF for at least four weeks. METHODS: Four-hundred-fifty LAHNSCC patients receiving CRT/BRT with curative intent between 2013 and 2016 were included in the study. Primary outcome was TF-dependency for four weeks or longer. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were extracted from the medical records and their effects on the use of TF were analyzed using univariable and multivariable analysis. The prediction model was internally validated using bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent (294/450 patients) required TF for four weeks or longer.

The uncovering of healthy dietary patterns is an important strategy to prevent or delay sarcopenia. We used K-means clustering to identify subgroups of men and women based on nutritional and health-related factors and investigated risk factors for low muscle mass in the subgroups and in the study population as a whole. METHODS: We analyzed a total 10,863 participants over 40 years of age who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey from 2008 to 2011. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to determine the appendicular lean mass (ALM) of the participants. Participants with low ALM adjusted BMI (ALM/BMI) were then identified using the criteria of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health sarcopenia project. K-means clustering and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze associations between nutritional and health-related variables and low ALM/BMI in the population as a whole and in the individual clusters. RESULTS: A total of 712 (15.8%) men and 869 (13.7%) women had low ALM/BMI. Five clusters were identified in men and women, respectively. Two clusters of men and one cluster of women exhibited an increased risk of low ALM/BMI. Old age, low total energy intake, low levels of physical activity, and a high number of chronic diseases were consistent risk factors for low ALM/BMI in all Korean men and women. Low protein was a common risk factor for low ALM/BMI in men. After dividing all subjects by the K-means clustering algorithm, two risk factors (high fat intake and smoking) and four factors (low intakes of carbohydrate, protein and fat, and high alcohol consumption) were additionally proposed in Korean men and women, respectively.

We examined purchases of health- and policy-relevant food and beverage groups [e.g., fruit and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)] and nutrients (e.g., total calories and sodium).Results: Regardless of SNAP status, households had low mean purchases of fruit, vegetables, and fiber and high mean purchases of junk foods, saturated fat, and sodium. After adjustment for multiple comparisons and demographic characteristics, we found significant differences by SNAP status of purchases of fruit, processed meat, salty snacks, sweeteners and toppings, SSBs, and total calories, fiber, sugar, and sodium.

Sustained remission remains a therapeutic challenge. Enteral nutrition, containing macro- and micro-nutrients, is nutritionally complete, and is provided in powder or liquid form. Enteral nutrition is a low-risk and minimally invasive therapy. It is well-established and recommended as first line induction therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease with remission rates of up to 80%. Other than in Japan, enteral nutrition is not routinely used in the adult population among Western countries, mainly due to unpalatable formulations which lead to poor compliance. This study aims to offer a comprehensive review of available enteral nutrition formulations and the literature supporting the use and mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition in adult Crohn's disease patients, in order to support clinicians in real world decision-making when offering/accepting treatment. The mechanisms of actions of enteral feed, including their impact on the gut microbiome, were explored. Barriers to the use of enteral nutrition, such as compliance and the route of administration, were considered. All available enteral preparations have been comprehensively described as a practical guide for clinical use. Likewise, guidelines are reported and discussed.",2019,10.3390/nu11092222,11,9,NA,eng,2072-6643,"Humans and Adult and *Enteral Nutrition and Crohn Disease/*therapy and Crohn's disease and enteral nutrition and exclusive enteral nutrition and Food, Formulated and partial enteral nutrition",NA,NA,2019/09/14/,Nutrients,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vora_2020_ThAmjoofclnu,JOUR,Drug-nutrient interactions: discovering prescription drug inhibitors of the thiamine transporter ThTR-2 (SLC19A3),"Vora, Bianca and Green, Elizabeth A. E. and Khuri, Natalia and Ballgren, Frida and Sirota, Marina and Giacomini, Kathleen M.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"BACKGROUND: Transporter-mediated drug-nutrient interactions have the potential to cause serious adverse events. However, unlike drug-drug interactions, these drug-nutrient interactions receive little attention during drug development. The clinical importance of drug-nutrient interactions was highlighted when a phase III clinical trial was terminated due to severe adverse events resulting from potent inhibition of thiamine transporter 2 (ThTR-2; SLC19A3). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that therapeutic drugs inhibit the intestinal thiamine transporter ThTR-2, which may lead to thiamine deficiency. METHODS: For this exploration, we took a multifaceted approach, starting with a high-throughput in vitro primary screen to identify inhibitors, building in silico models to characterize inhibitors, and leveraging real-world data from electronic health records to begin to understand the clinical relevance of these inhibitors. RESULTS: Our high-throughput screen of 1360 compounds, including many clinically used drugs, identified 146 potential inhibitors at 200 <ce><bc>M. Inhibition kinetics were determined for 28 drugs with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 1.03 <ce><bc>M to >1 mM. Several oral drugs, including metformin, were predicted to have intestinal concentrations that may result in ThTR-2-mediated drug-nutrient interactions. Complementary analysis using electronic health records suggested that thiamine laboratory values are reduced in individuals receiving prescription drugs found to significantly inhibit ThTR-2, particularly in vulnerable populations (e.g., individuals with alcoholism). CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive analysis of prescription drugs suggests that several marketed drugs inhibit ThTR-2, which may contribute to thiamine deficiency, especially in at-risk populations.",2020,10.1093/ajcn/nqz255,111,1,110-121,eng,1938-3207 0002-9165,machine learning and Humans and electronic health records and HEK293 Cells and *Food-Drug Interactions and clinical data and Biological Transport/drug effects and drug-nutrient interactions and high-throughput screen and Membrane Transport Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism and Pharmaceutical Preparations/*chemistry/metabolism and Prescription Drugs/chemistry/metabolism and Thiamine/metabolism and transporters and vitamin B1 and vitamin deficiency,NA,NA,2020/01/01/,Am J Clin Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the importance of defining reliable nutrient reference values, there is a need for an explicit, objective, and transparent process to set these values. The Tufts Medical Center Evidence-based Practice Center assembled a group of nutrition experts from academic institutions and federal government agencies, led participants in discussions, conducted exercises in formulating questions and evidence review criteria that would be amenable to systematic reviews of the scientific literature, performed a literature search on the questions to identify potentially relevant publications, and identified challenges and limitations of applying this method to support the development of nutrient reference values using vitamin A as an example. The workgroup concluded that the systematic review approach could be productively used to inform the development of reference values. Challenges identified in this exercise include prioritizing and defining research questions when the volume of literature is large, relying on intermediate (surrogate) outcomes when few or no studies directly linking nutrient intake with clinical outcomes are available, and determining reliable nutrient biomarkers. Ultimately, an objective, unbiased systematic review of a defined question could be useful, not only in helping to set nutrient reference values, but also for increasing the transparency of the decision making process.",2009,10.3945/ajcn.2008.27154,89,3,728-733,eng,1938-3207 0002-9165,Humans and *Review Literature as Topic and *Nutrition Policy and Vitamin A/*administration & dosage,NA,NA,2009/03//undefined,Am J Clin Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA

We selected markers for hyperhomocysteinemia among middle-aged adults, studied time-dependent Hcy-marker associations and computed highly predictive indices of hyperhomocysteinemia, with cross-sectional and longitudinal validations. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, phase 2, n(max) = 4000), the NHANES 1999-2006 (n(max) = 10,151) and pooled NHANES (cross-sectional validation).

Machine learning detected nine independent markers for Hcy > 14 <c2><b5>mol/L (NHANES III, phase 2): older age; lower folate and B-12 status; higher serum levels of creatinine, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, and cotinine; mean cell hemoglobin and red cell distribution widths (RDW); results replicated in the 1999-2006 NHANES [AUC = 0.60-0.80]. Indices combining binary markers increased elevated Hcy odds by 6.9-7.5-fold. In HANDLS, first-visit Hcy predicted annual increase in creatinine, RDW and alkaline phosphatase, with third-visit index (2013-2018) directly predicting Hcy (2004-2009).

To understand the complex interplay of risk factors, we investigated a prospective population sample from the Jiangsu province in China. At baseline, three-day food intake was measured for 2849 individuals (20 to 87 years of age, mean age 47 <c2><b1> 14, range 20-87 years, 64% women). At a five-year follow-up, anemia status was re-assessed for 1262 individuals. The dataset was split and age-matched to accommodate cross-sectional (n = 2526), prospective (n = 837), and subgroup designs (n = 1844). We applied a machine learning framework (self-organizing map) to define four subgroups. The first two subgroups were primarily from the less affluent North: the High Fibre subgroup had a higher iron intake (35 vs. 21 mg/day) and lower anemia incidence (10% vs. 25%) compared to the Low Vegetable subgroup. However, the predominantly Southern subgroups were surprising: the Low Fibre subgroup showed a lower anemia incidence (10% vs. 27%), yet also a lower iron intake (20 vs. 28 mg/day) compared to the High Rice subgroup.

Heather and Kraft, Peter and Rosner, Bernard A. and Willett, Walter C.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"BACKGROUND: Carotenoids have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of many diseases, but associations with intakes or blood concentrations may arise from other constituents of fruit and vegetables. Use of genetic variation in Î²-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO1), a key enzyme in provitamin A carotenoid metabolism, as a surrogate for carotenoid exposure may aid in determining the role of carotenoids unconfounded by other carotenoid-containing food constituents, but important variants must be identified. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to select BCMO1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predict plasma carotenoid concentrations for use in future epidemiologic studies. DESIGN: We assessed the associations between 224 SNPs in BCMO1 Â± 20 kb imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel with plasma carotenoid and retinol concentrations by using 7 case-control data sets (n = 2344) within the Nurses' Health Study, randomly divided into training (n = 1563) and testing (n = 781) data sets. SNPs were chosen in the training data set through stepwise selection in multivariate linear regression models; Î²-coefficients were used as weights in weighted gene scores. RESULTS: Two or 3 SNPs were selected as predictors of Î²-carotene, Î±-carotene, Î²-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin. In the testing data set, the weighted gene scores were significantly associated with plasma concentrations of the corresponding carotenoid (P = 6.4 * 10â»Â¹Â², 3.3 * 10â»Â³, 0.02, and 1.8 * 10â»Â¹â·, respectively), and concentrations differed by 48%, 15%, 15%, and 36%, respectively, across extreme score quintiles.

Berry_2019_ThAmjoofclnu,JOUR,Lack of historical evidence to support folic acid exacerbation of the neuropathy caused by vitamin B12 deficiency,"Berry, Robert J.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"In 1998 a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for folic acid was established based on case reports from the 1940s suggesting that high-dosage folic acid intake, used to treat patients with pernicious anemia, had the potential to precipitate or speed-up the development of neurological problems. This UL has been employed in the decision-making process used by more than 80 countries to establish programs to fortify staple foods with folic acid to prevent neural tube birth defects. Some have claimed that this UL is flawed and has become an obstacle to the wider adoption of neural tube defect prevention programs and have called for re-evaluation of the scientific validity of this UL. Case reports cannot establish causality, but they can reveal patterns in the timing of the onset and treatment of patients with pernicious anemia. These patterns can be compared with secular trends of usual medical practice for the treatment of pernicious anemia and with the changes in usage of folic acid preparations, including recommended therapeutic dosage and precautions for its usage surrounding the synthesis of folic acid in 1945 and vitamin B12 in 1948. Folic acid package inserts, early editions of hematology textbooks, and international expert reports provide valuable historical information. The recommended therapeutic daily dosage for folic acid of 5-20 mg was unchanged from 1946 through to 1971. The likely cause of the neurological problems encountered is the development of vitamin B12 neuropathy when pernicious anemia was treated with high-dosage folic acid before vitamin B12 was widely available in the early 1950s. Thus, the historical record does not provide compelling evidence that folic acid can potentially cause neurologic complications among those with low vitamin B12 status and lends support for reconsidering the basis for the UL of folic acid.",2019,10.1093/ajcn/nqz089,110,3,554-561,eng,1938-3207 0002-9165,"Humans and public health and History, 20th Century and folate and folic acid and Folic Acid/*adverse effects and fortification and neural tube defects and neuropathy and Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/history and pernicious anemia and Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/*complications and Vitamin B 12/therapeutic use and vitamin B12",NA,NA,2019/09/01/,Am J Clin Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to assess and provide baseline data on the nutritional status of bariatric candidates. A retrospective study was conducted on obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery from 2008 to 2015. The medical records of 1538 patients were reviewed for this study. Pre-operatively, the most commonly observed vitamin deficiencies were Vitamin D (76%) and Vitamin B(12) (16%). Anemia and iron status parameters were low in a considerable number of patients before surgery, as follows: hemoglobin 20%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 48%, ferritin 28%, serum iron 51%, and transferrin saturation 60%. Albumin and transferrin were found to be low in 10% and 9% of the patients, respectively, prior to surgery. In addition to deficiencies, a great number of patients had hypervitaminosis pre-operatively. Excess levels of Vitamin B<e2><82><86> (24%) was the most remarkable.
