Sutherland_2019_Frinpe,JOUR,Big Data and Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury: The Promise of Electronic Health Record Systems,"Sutherland, Scott M.",Frontiers in pediatrics,"Over the last decade, our understanding of acute kidney injury (AKI) has evolved considerably. The development of a consensus definition standardized the approach to identifying and investigating AKI in children. As a result, pediatric AKI epidemiology has been refined and the consequences of renal injury are better established. Similarly, ""big data"" methodologies experienced a dramatic evolution and maturation, leading the critical care community to explore potential AKI/big data synergies. One such concept with tremendous potential is electronic health record (EHR) enabled informatics. Much of the promise surrounding these approaches is due to the unique position of the EHR which sits at the intersection of data accumulation and care delivery. EHR data is generated simply via the provision of routine clinical care and should be considered ""big"" from the standpoint of volume, variety, and velocity as a myriad of diverse elements accumulate rapidly in real time, spontaneously generating an immense dataset. This massive dataset interfaces directly with providers which creates tremendous opportunity. AKI can be diagnosed more accurately, AKI-related care can be optimized, and subsequent outcomes can be improved. Although applying big data concepts to the EHR has proven more challenging than originally thought, we have seen much success and continue to explore its potential. In this review article, we will discuss the EHR in the context of big data concepts, describe approaches applied to date, examine the challenges surrounding optimal application, and explore future directions.",2019,10.3389/fped.2019.00536,7,NA,536,eng,2296-2360,pediatrics and outcomes and electronic health record (EHR) and acute kidney injury (AKI) and big data and analytics,NA,NA,2019///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: Can a machine-learning based prediction algorithm using electronic healthcare record (EHR) data predict severe sepsis onset in pediatric populations? Methods: EHR data were collected from a retrospective set of de-identified pediatric inpatient and emergency encounters for patients between 2-17 years of age, drawn from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center, with encounter dates between June 2011 and March 2016. Results: Pediatric patients (n = 9,486) were identified and 101 (1.06%) were labeled with severe sepsis following the pediatric severe sepsis definition of Goldstein et al. (1). In 4-fold cross-validation evaluations, the machine learning algorithm achieved an AUROC of 0.916 for discrimination between severe sepsis and control pediatric patients at the time of onset and AUROC of 0.718 at 4 h before onset. The prediction algorithm significantly outperformed the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score (PELOD-2) (p < 0.05) and pediatric Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) (p < 0.05) in the prediction of severe sepsis 4 h before onset using cross-validation and pairwise t-tests.

Analysis of electronic health record data may allow for identification of persons at risk of host-defense impairments from within the general population. Our hypothesis was that coded infection history would inform individual risk of disease and ultimately lead to diagnosis. Methods: In this study we assessed individual risk for primary immunodeficiency by analyzing diagnostic codes and pharmacy records from members (n = 185,892) of a large pediatric health network. Relevant infection-associated diagnostic codes were weighted and enumerated for individual members allowing for risk score calculations (""Risk Vital Sign""). At-risk individuals underwent further assessment by chart review and re-analysis of diagnostic codes 12 months later. Results: Of the original cohort, 2188 (1.2%) individuals were identified as medium-high-risk for having a primary immunodeficiency. This group included 41 subjects who were ultimately diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency. An additional 57 medium-high risk patients had coded diagnoses worthy of referral.

Digital simulation presents a potential alternative; however, its effectiveness and reception by healthcare professionals (HCPs) remains largely unexplored. Objectives: This study explores HCPs' attitudes toward a digital simulator, technology, and mindset to elucidate their effects on neonatal resuscitation performance in simulation-based assessments. Methods: The study was conducted from April to August 2019 with 2-month (June-October 2019) and 5-month (September 2019-January 2020) follow-up at a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada. Of 300 available neonatal HCPs, 50 participated. Participants completed a demographic survey, a pretest, two practice scenarios using the RETAIN neonatal resuscitation digital simulation, a posttest, and an attitudinal survey (100% response rate). Participants repeated the posttest scenario in 2 months (86% response rate) and completed another posttest scenario using a low-fidelity, tabletop simulator (80% response rate) 5 months after the initial study intervention. Participants' survey responses were collected to measure attitudes toward digital simulation and technology. Knowledge was assessed at baseline (pretest), acquisition (posttest), retention (2-month posttest), and transfer (5-month posttest). Results: Fifty neonatal HCPs participated in this study (44 females and 6 males; 27 nurses, 3 nurse practitioners, 14 respiratory therapists, and 6 doctors). Most participants reported technology in medical education as useful and beneficial. Three attitudinal clusters were identified by a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on survey responses.

This study investigates the prediction accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach and a linear model. The heuristic expecting 1 day of stay per percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) serves as the performance benchmark. Methods: The study is based on pediatric burn patient's data sets from an international burn registry (N = 8,542). Mean absolute error and standard error are calculated for each prediction model (rule of thumb, linear regression, and random forest). Factors contributing to a prolonged stay and the relationship between TBSA and the residual error are analyzed. Results: The random forest-based approach and the linear model are statistically superior to the rule of thumb (p < 0.001, resp. p = 0.009). The residual error rises as TBSA increases for all methods. Factors associated with a prolonged LOS are particularly TBSA, depth of burn, and inhalation trauma.

Weiss_2018_JAMApedi,JOUR,Characteristics Associated With Preferences for Parent-Centered Decision Making in Neonatal Intensive Care,"Weiss, Elliott Mark and Xie, Dawei and Cook, Noah and Coughlin, Katherine and Joffe, Steven",JAMA pediatrics,"IMPORTANCE: Little is known about how characteristics of particular clinical decisions influence decision-making preferences by patients or their surrogates. A better understanding of the factors underlying preferences is essential to improve the quality of shared decision making. OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of particular decisions that are associated with parents' preferences for family- vs medical team-centered decision making across the spectrum of clinical decisions that arise in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey assessed parents' preferences for parent- vs medical team-centered decision making across 16 clinical decisions, along with parents' assessments of 7 characteristics of those decisions. Respondents included 136 parents of infants in 1 of 3 academically affiliated hospital NICUs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from January 7 to July 8, 2016. Respondents represented a wide range of educational levels, employment status, and household income but were predominantly female (109 [80.1%]), white (68 [50.0%]) or African American (53 [39.0%]), and married (81 of 132 responding [61.4%]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preferences for parent-centered decision making. For each decision characteristic (eg, urgency), multivariable analyses tested whether middle and high levels of that characteristic (compared with low levels) were associated with a preference for parent-centered decision making, resulting in 2 odds ratios (ORs) per decision characteristic. RESULTS: Among the 136 respondents (109 women [80.1%] and 27 men [19.9%]; median age, 30 years [range, 18-43 years]), preferences for parent-centered decision making were positively associated with decisions that involved big-picture goals (middle OR, 2.01 [99% CI, 0.83-4.86]; high OR, 3.38 [99% CI, 1.48-7.75]) and that had the potential to harm the infant (middle OR, 1.32 [99% CI, 0.84-2.08]; high OR, 2.62 [99% CI, 1.67-4.11]). In contrast, preferences for parent-centered decision making were inversely associated with the following 4 decision characteristics: technical decisions (middle OR, 0.82 [99% CI, 0.45-1.52]; high OR, 0.48 [99% CI, 0.25-0.93]), the potential to benefit the infant (middle OR, 0.42 [99% CI, 0.16-1.05]; high OR, 0.21 [99% CI, 0.08-0.52]), requires medical expertise (middle OR, 0.48 [99% CI, 0.22-1.05]; high OR, 0.21 [99% CI, 0.10-0.48]), and a high level of urgency (middle OR, 0.47 [99% CI, 0.24-0.92]; high OR, 0.42 [99% CI, 0.22-0.83]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preferences for parent-centered vs medical team-centered decision making among parents of infants in the NICU may vary systematically by the characteristics of particular clinical decisions. Incorporating this variation into shared decision making and endorsing models that allow parents to cede control to physicians in appropriate clinical circumstances might improve the quality and outcomes of medical decisions.",2018,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.5776,172,5,461-468,eng,2168-6211 2168-6203,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Socioeconomic Factors and Pennsylvania and Infant, Newborn and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal and *Attitude to Health and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and Patient-Centered Care/methods and Intensive Care, Neonatal/*methods",NA,NA,2018/05/01/,JAMA Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Albersheim_2020_Frinpe,JOUR,The Extremely Preterm Infant: Ethical Considerations in Life-and-Death Decision-Making,"Albersheim, Susan",Frontiers in pediatrics,"Care of the preterm infant has improved tremendously over the last 60 years, with attendant improvement in outcomes. For the extremely preterm infant, <28 weeks' gestation, concerns related to survival as well as neurodevelopmental impairment, have influenced decision-making to a much larger extent than seen in older children. Possible reasons for conferring a different status on extremely preterm infants include: (1) the belief that the brain is a privileged organ, (2) the degree of medical uncertainty in terms of outcomes, (3) the fact that the family will deal with the psychological, emotional, physical, and financial consequences of treatment decisions, (4) that the extremely preterm looks more like a fetus than a term newborn, (5) the initial lack of relational identity, (6) the fact that extremely preterm infants are technology-dependent, and (7) the timing of decision-making around delivery. Treating extremely preterm infants differently does not hold up to scrutiny. They are owed the same respect as other pediatric patients, in terms of personhood, and we have the same duties to care for them. However, the degree of medical uncertainty and the fact that parents will deal with the consequences of decision-making, highlights the importance of providing a wide band of discretion in parental decision-making authority. Ethical principles considered in decision-making include best interest (historically the sine qua non of pediatric decision-making), a reasonable person standard, the ""good enough"" parent, and the harm principle, the latter two being more pragmatic. To operationalize these principles, potential models for decision-making are the Zone of Parental Discretion, the Not Unreasonable Standard, and a Shared Decision-Making model. In the final analysis shared decision-making with a wide zone of parental discretion, which is based on the harm principle, would provide fair and equitable decision-making for the extremely preterm infant. However, in the rare circumstance where parents do not wish to embark upon intensive care, against medical recommendations, it would be most helpful to develop local guidelines both for support of health care practitioners and to provide consistency of care for extremely preterm infants.",2020,10.3389/fped.2020.00055,8,NA,55,eng,2296-2360,decision-making and shared decision-making and extremely preterm infant and harm principle and justice as fairness and neurodevelopmental impairment and parental discretion and personhood,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mills_2020_Frinpe,JOUR,"Moral Distress in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: What Is It, Why It Happens, and How We Can Address It","Mills, Manisha and Cortezzo, DonnaMaria E.",Frontiers in pediatrics,"Moral distress is prevalent in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where decisions regarding end-of-life care, periviable resuscitation, and medical futility are common. Due to its origins in the nursing literature, moral distress has primarily been reported among bedside nurses in relation to the hierarchy of the medical team. However, it is increasingly recognized that moral distress may exist in different forms than initially described and that healthcare professions outside of nursing experience it. Advances in medical technology have allowed the smallest, sickest neonates to survive. The treatment for critically ill infants is no longer simply limited by the capability of medical technology but also by moral and ethical boundaries of what is right for a given child and family. Shared decision-making and the zone of parental discretion can inform and challenge the medical team to balance the complexities of patient autonomy against harm and suffering. Limited ability to prognosticate and uncertainty in outcomes add to the challenges faced with ethical dilemmas. While this does not necessarily equate to moral distress, subjective views of quality of life and personal values in these situations can lead to moral distress if the plans of care and the validity of each path are not fully explored. Differences in opinions and approaches between members of the medical team can strain relationships and affect each individual differently. It is unclear how the various types of moral distress uniquely impact each profession and their role in the distinctively challenging decisions made in the NICU environment.

The interaction between the peculiarities of individuals, and the clinical conditions presented define a changing and complex profile of health needs, which requires organized, dynamic and multidimensional responses. The approach to the pediatric patient must consider its biological, psychological, relational and clinical characteristics. Such aspects in fact determine and modulate the type and quantity of the needs presented, conditioning the actions to be taken and the organizational models to be implemented. In accordance with some international regulations, it is essential that healthcare professionals provide adequate information to the patient's understanding in order to enhance participation in the decision-making process regardless of the possibility of expressing consent or dissent to the treatment.

The goal of the present study was to determine the differences in clinical decision making by attending physicians based on the pH probe results versus MII results. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in which physicians were initially given pH probe results and asked how they would change the patient's clinical management based on these results. Physicians were then given the MII results and asked how their management would change. Physicians then were asked whether they believed MII affected their clinical decision making overall. RESULTS: pH probe results changed clinical management 40% of the time and MII results changed clinical management an additional 22% of the time. Clinical decision making was not influenced by the performance of pH-MII on or off acid suppression. The escalation of acid suppression therapy was the main management change that occurred based on the pH-MII results.

Participants included English-speaking parents of children (0-17 years) attending one Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric (DBP) clinic and their child's clinician. Prior to visit start, parents received either the intervention prompt encouraging engagement with the clinician in decision-making, or the comparison prompt reminding them to request a school/work excuse note if needed. After the visit, SDM was assessed by both parents and DBP clinicians. SDM was scored as present if the respondent answered ""strongly agree"" to all SDM-related items. Logistic regression tested effects of visit, child, parent, clinician characteristics, and intervention group status on parent-reported SDM. Cohen's kappa assessed alignment between parent and clinician perceptions of SDM. RESULTS: Of 88 parents screened, 50 (61%) met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate (intervention n = 26; comparison n = 24). Eligible participants (parents and clinicians) for analysis completed the surveys with no missing data. Overall, SDM was present in 76% of parents and 34% of clinicians. With high rates of parent-reported SDM in both intervention and comparison groups, no main intervention effect was detected. Compared to the comparison group, there was greater alignment between parent and clinician perception of SDM in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Parent and clinician enrollment and data collection with minimal loss suggest that this novel approach is easy to use and could be employed in future outpatient studies exploring SDM. In this clinical setting, both intervention and comparison group parents reported high levels of SDM participation and no main group effect was detected. Further study of this novel parent-directed SDM intervention approach is needed in a larger sample with greater variability in parent-reported SDM to determine its efficacy.",2018,10.3389/fped.2018.00060,6,NA,60,eng,2296-2360,doctor-patient communication and medical decision-making and shared decision-making and developmental-behavioral pediatrics and neurodevelopmental disorders,NA,NA,2018///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

The number of pediatric medication and device trials has increased in part because of the past 20 years of US legislation requiring and incentivizing study of the effects of medical products in children (Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, Pediatric Rule in 1998, Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002, and Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003). There are some limitations of traditional approaches to studying medication safety in children. Randomized clinical trials within the regulatory context may not enroll patients who are representative of the general pediatric population, provide the power to detect rare safety signals, or provide long-term safety data. BD sources may have these capabilities. In recent years, medical records have become digitized, and cell phones and personal devices have proliferated. In this process, the field of biomedical science has progressively used BD from those records coupled with other data sources, both digital and traditional. Additionally, large distributed databases that include pediatric-specific outcome variables are available.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic yield and use of clinical exome sequencing in critically ill infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical exome sequencing was performed for 278 unrelated infants within the first 100 days of life who were admitted to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas, during a 5-year period between December 2011 and January 2017. Exome sequencing types included proband exome, trio exome, and critical trio exome, a rapid genomic assay for seriously ill infants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Indications for testing, diagnostic yield of clinical exome sequencing, turnaround time, molecular findings, patient age at diagnosis, and effect on medical management among a group of critically ill infants who were suspected to have genetic disorders. RESULTS: The mean (SEM) age for infants participating in the study was 28.5 (1.7) days; of these, the mean (SEM) age was 29.0 (2.2) days for infants undergoing proband exome sequencing, 31.5 (3.9) days for trio exome, and 22.7 (3.9) days for critical trio exome. Clinical indications for exome sequencing included a range of medical concerns. Overall, a molecular diagnosis was achieved in 102 infants (36.7%) by clinical exome sequencing, with relatively low yield for cardiovascular abnormalities. The diagnosis affected medical management for 53 infants (52.0%) and had a substantial effect on informed redirection of care, initiation of new subspecialist care, medication/dietary modifications, and furthering life-saving procedures in select patients. Critical trio exome sequencing revealed a molecular diagnosis in 32 of 63 infants (50.8%) at a mean (SEM) of 33.1 (5.6) days of life with a mean (SEM) turnaround time of 13.0 (0.4) days. Clinical care was altered by the diagnosis in 23 of 32 patients (71.9%). The diagnostic yield, patient age at diagnosis, and medical effect in the group that underwent critical trio exome sequencing were significantly different compared with the group who underwent regular exome testing. For deceased infants (n = 81), genetic disorders were molecularly diagnosed in 39 (48.1%) by exome sequencing, with implications for recurrence risk counseling.

First, we describe problem structuring recognizing that parents often face multiple potential problems or decisions with multiple potential solutions, rather than a single problem, and the initial challenge is deciding which of the problems to focus on. Second, we discuss sense-making recognizing that difficult decisions are not made in isolation but are often part of a confusing, labyrinthian situation in which disoriented parents must make a series of decisions over time in hopes of getting closer to 1 or more goals. Third, we describe path dependency recognizing that decisions influence what and how decisions are made later. Fourth, we discuss personal sense of duty recognizing that parents and other surrogate decision-makers have central personal roles, self-identities, and relationships with the patient, culminating in a personal sense of duty, such as what they perceive they should do to be in their own judgment a ""good parent,"" which substantially affects their decision-making. Fifth, we describe self-judgments recognizing that parents experience distress when they judge themselves as falling short of their duties or if they think others are judging them for falling short.

Research related to children's decision-making in medical settings has been focused primarily on cognitive aspects of decision-making, such as understanding and capacity. The concept of decision-making involvement (DMI) recognizes that children can be involved in decision-making in multiple ways, regardless of capacity, and that parents and health care providers play a critical role in supporting children as they learn to make decisions on their own. Providers can facilitate DMI during medical encounters by asking for the children's opinions and concerns, encouraging turn-taking, soliciting questions, asking for information directly from the children, and checking that the children understand what has been said. Efforts to involve children send the message that the youth perspective is important and set the expectation for increased participation over time. Providers can also support parent-child decision-making about illness management at home by guiding parents as to how best to involve children in decisions about illness management, identifying areas in which more or less parental guidance and support are needed, and assisting youth in planning ahead for decision-making about illness management in high-risk situations. Additional research is needed to identify why children's DMI in medical settings remains low, develop and evaluate strategies to enhance DMI, and test the effects of DMI on health-related behaviors and outcomes over time.",2018,10.1542/peds.2018-0516D,142,Suppl 3,S142-S148,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Humans and Child and Physician's Role and *Decision Making and Chronic Disease/*psychology and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Patient Participation,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically severely contaminated by a considerable amount of various noise sources, rendering fetal ECG denoising a very challenging task. This work employs a deep learning approach for removing the residual noise from multi-channel fetal ECG after the maternal ECG has been suppressed. We propose a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network with symmetric skip-layer connections, learning end-to-end mappings from noise-corrupted fetal ECG signals to clean ones. Experiments on simulated data show an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.5 dB for fetal ECG signals with input SNR ranging between -20 and 20 dB. The method is additionally evaluated on a large set of real signals, demonstrating that it can provide significant quality improvement of the noisy fetal ECG signals. We further show that employment of multi-channel signal information by the network provides superior and more reliable performance as opposed to its single-channel network counterpart. The presented method is able to preserve beat-to-beat morphological variations and does not require any prior information on the power spectra of the noise or the pulse location.",2020,10.3389/fped.2020.00508,8,NA,508,eng,2296-2360,convolutional neural networks and encoder-decoder network and fetal ECG denoising and fetal ECG enhancement and fetal electrocardiography,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

For each decision, parents were asked detailed questions about who made each decision, whom they would have preferred to make the decision, and why. Using standard qualitative methods, responses were coded and organized such that decision-level characteristics could be analyzed according to preferred decision-making role. RESULTS: Parents identified 2 factors that were associated with a preference to delegate decisions to the medical team (high degree of urgency, high level of required medical expertise) and 4 factors associated with a preference to retain parental control (high perceived risk, high personal experience with the decision, involvement of foreign bodily fluids, and similarity to decisions that they perceived as part of the normal parental role).

According to the guidelines, the optimal diagnostic work-up of LTS patients relies both on a comprehensive anamnesis and on endoscopic and radiological assessments. All the causes of LTS result in an impairment in airflow, mucociliary clearance, phonation, and sometimes in swallowing disorders. The main goals of treatment are to maintain an adequate respiratory space and restore the Upper Aero-Digestive Tract (UADT) physiology. The first step when dealing with LTS patients is to properly assess their medical history. The main causes of pediatric LTS can be divided into two groups, i.e., congenital and acquired. The most common causes of congenital LTS are: laryngomalacia (60%), vocal fold paralysis (15-20%), subglottic stenosis (SGS) (10-15%), laryngeal webs and atresia (5%), subglottic hemangioma (1.5-3%), and others. On the other hand, 90% of acquired pediatric LTS cases are subsequent to post-intubation injuries. Other less frequent causes are: iatrogenic complications from endoscopic laryngeal interventions, benign tumors, caustic or thermal injuries, external blunt force injury or trauma, chronic inflammatory disorders, or idiopathic causes. Diagnostic work-up consists in a step-by-step investigation: awake and asleep transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy (TNFL), direct laryngoscopy with 0<c2><b0> and angled telescopes to investigate the type of stenosis (arytenoid mobility, craniocaudal extension, involved anatomical sites, and active or mature scar tissue), and broncho-esophagoscopy to rule out associated mediastinal malformations. To date there are several available classifications for each of the involved sites: Cohen's classification for anterior glottic stenosis, Bogdasarian's for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) and Myer-Cotton's for subglottic stenosis, even though others are used in daily practice (Lano-Netterville, FLECS, etc.). The European Laryngological Society recently proposed a new classification which is applicable in all LTS cases.

Interview questions focused on information used to make decisions and factors that influenced decision making. We used thematic analysis for all coding and analysis. Coding structure was developed by a multidisciplinary team review of the initial interviews.

These assessments are impacted by uncertainty, which is a common feature of neonatal intensive care. The relative presence or absence of uncertainty may impact perceptions of parental decisions and a medical provider's decision to seek state intervention to overrule parents. In this article, we propose a model integrating prognostic uncertainty into pediatric decision-making that may aid providers in such assessments.

Providing parents with guidance in decision making might improve their confidence to seek timely advice when a child becomes ill. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ""How to recognize if your child is seriously ill"" leaflet on parents' confidence, health-seeking behaviors, and usefulness during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method: A nine-item survey, codesigned with parent advisors, was used to measure confidence and health-seeking behavior. Social media was used for data collection in a 6-week period (April-June 2020) during COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Categorical data were analyzed as frequencies, and inductive content analysis was performed with the qualitative data. Results: In total, 171 parents responded. Most parents (n = 160, 93.6%) found the leaflet helpful. The leaflet increased the confidence among 116 parents (67.8%) to recognize if their child is ill, and 156 (91.2%) parents had a better understanding of when and where to seek help. Thirty-three (19.2%) parents used the leaflet, while their child was unwell during COVID-19 lockdown, and in 14 (42%) cases, the leaflet resulted in changing health-seeking behavior for that episode. Twelve of these parents decided to seek medical consultation when they had not planned to before. Content analysis revealed three categories. (1) Knowledge-parents found the leaflet an objective source to validate their concerns. (2) Usability-parents reported that the leaflet was clearly designed. (3) Decision aid-parents commented that the leaflet provided clarification around recognition of serious symptoms and when and where to seek appropriate care. Conclusions: Our leaflet provided parents with guidance on decision making and risk assessment of ill children during COVID-19 lockdown.

However, translating findings from data-driven analyses into meaningful insights and actionable solutions requires approaches and tools which move beyond mining and patterning longitudinal data. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in phenotyping of asthma, to discuss key hurdles currently hampering the translation of phenotypic variation into mechanistic insights and clinical setting, and to suggest potential solutions that may address these limitations and accelerate moving discoveries into practice. In order to advance the field of phenotypic discovery, greater focus should be placed on investigating the extent of within-phenotype variation. We advocate a more cautious modeling approach by ""supervising"" the findings to delineate more precisely the characteristics of the individual trajectories assigned to each phenotype. Furthermore, it is important to employ different methods within a study to compare the stability of derived phenotypes, and to assess the immutability of individual assignments to phenotypes. If we are to make a step change toward precision (stratified or personalized) medicine and capitalize on the available big data assets, we have to develop genuine cross-disciplinary collaborations, wherein data scientists who turn data into information using algorithms and machine learning, team up with medical professionals who provide deep insights on specific subjects from a clinical perspective.",2018,10.3389/fped.2018.00258,6,NA,258,eng,2296-2360,machine learning and big data and disease progression and asthma and longitudinal data and phenotypes,NA,NA,2018///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although numerous studies have used recalled age at menarche (first menstruation) to assess secular trends of pubertal timing, no systematic review has been conducted of secular trends of thelarche. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate published data on pubertal timing based on age at thelarche and evaluate the change in pubertal onset in healthy girls around the world. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase of all original peer-reviewed articles published in English before June 20, 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies used clinical assessment of breast development in healthy girls and used adequate statistical methods, including the reporting of SEs or CIs. The quality of the articles was evaluated by assessing study design, potential sources of bias, main characteristics of the study population, and methods of statistical analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, all articles were assessed for eligibility independently by 2 authors. Weighted regression analysis was performed using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Studies examining age at thelarche (development of Tanner breast stage 2) in healthy girls. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in a total of 3602 studies, of which 30 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. There was a secular trend in ages at thelarche according to race/ethnicity and geography. Overall, the age at thelarche decreased 0.24 years (95% CI, -0.44 to -0.04) (almost 3 months) per decade from 1977 to 2013 (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The age at thelarche has decreased a mean of almost 3 months per decade from 1977 to 2013. A younger age at pubertal onset may change current diagnostic decision-making. The medical community needs current and relevant data to redefine ""precocious puberty,"" because the traditional definition may be outdated, at least in some regions of the world.",2020,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.5881,174,4,e195881,eng,2168-6211 2168-6203,Humans and Female and Adolescent and Child and Age Factors and Breast/*growth & development and Puberty/*physiology,NA,NA,2020/04/01/,JAMA Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA
Weise_2017_Pedi,JOUR,Guidance on Forgoing Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment,"Weise, Kathryn L. and Okun, Alexander L. and Carter, Brian S. and Christian, Cindy W.",Pediatrics,"Pediatric health care is practiced with the goal of promoting the best interests of the child. Treatment generally is rendered under a presumption in favor of sustaining life. However, in some circumstances, the balance of benefits and burdens to the child leads to an assessment that forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment (LSMT) is ethically supportable or advisable. Parents are given wide latitude in decision-making concerning end-of-life care for their children in most situations. Collaborative decision-making around LSMT is improved by thorough communication among all stakeholders, including medical staff, the family, and the patient, when possible, throughout the evolving course of the patient's illness. Clear communication of overall goals of care is advised to promote agreed-on plans, including resuscitation status. Perceived disagreement among the team of professionals may be stressful to families. At the same time, understanding the range of professional opinions behind treatment recommendations is critical to informing family decision-making. Input from specialists in palliative care, ethics, pastoral care, and other disciplines enhances support for families and medical staff when decisions to forgo LSMT are being considered. Understanding specific applicability of institutional, regional, state, and national regulations related to forgoing LSMT is important to practice ethically within existing legal frameworks. This guidance represents an update of the 1994 statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics on forgoing LSMT.",2017,10.1542/peds.2017-1905,140,3,e20171905,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Communication and Humans and Child and Patient Care Team and Physician's Role and Patient Care Planning and *Decision Making and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and *Life Support Care and *Withholding Treatment and Nuclear Family/psychology,NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Navne_2018_Pedi,JOUR,A Clinical Careography: Steering Life-and-death Decisions Through Care,"Navne, Laura E. and Svendsen, Mette N.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVES: In many Euro-American societies, the ideal of patient and family involvement in clinical decision-making prevails. This ideal exists alongside the doctor's obligation and responsibility to make decisions and to be accountable for them. In this article, we explore how medical staff navigate the tension between autonomy and authority when engaging life-and-death decision-making in a Danish NICU. METHODS: The study rests on ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish NICU, involving participant observations in everyday care and decision-making work and semistructured interviews with staff and parents. All interviews were taped and transcribed. The empirical material was analyzed using thematic coding and validated in discussions with staff, parents, and social scientists. RESULTS: Decisions are relational. Multiple moves, spaces, temporalities, and actors are involved in life-and-death decisions in the NICU. Therefore, the concept of medical decision-making fails to do justice to the complex efforts of moving infants in or out of life. Yet, many of these decision-making moments are staged, timed, and coordinated by medical staff. Therefore, we introduce an alternative vocabulary for talking about life-and-death decision-making in neonatology to help us attend to the moral stakes, the emotional tenor, and the fine-grained mechanisms of authority implied in such decisions around tiny infants. CONCLUSIONS: We conceptualize decisions as an art of ""careography."" Careography is the work of aligning care for the infant, care for the parents, care for staff, care for other infants, and care for society at large, in the process of deciding whether it is best to continue or withdraw life support.",2018,10.1542/peds.2018-0478G,142,Suppl 1,S558-S566,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Anthropology, Cultural and Infant, Newborn and Denmark/epidemiology and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and *Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/ethics/*standards and Infant Care/ethics/*standards and Infant, Extremely Premature/*physiology and Withholding Treatment/ethics/standards",NA,NA,2018/09//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has now been extended to models produced from medical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT). Here we report the production of a selection of 3D models to compliment the available imaging data for a 12-month-old child with double-outlet right ventricle and two ventricular septal defects. The models were produced to assist with case management and surgical planning. We used both stereolithography and polyjet techniques to produce white rigid and flexible color models, respectively. The models were discussed both at the joint multidisciplinary meeting and between surgeon and cardiologist. From the blood pool model the clinicians were able to determine that the position of the coronary arteries meant an arterial switch operation was unlikely to be feasible. The soft myocardium model allowed the clinicians to assess the VSD anatomy and relationship with the aorta. The models, therefore, were of benefit in the development of the surgical plan. It was felt that the clinical situation was stable enough that an immediate intervention was not required, but the timing of any intervention would be dictated by decreasing oxygen saturation. Subsequently, the oxygen saturation of the patient did decrease and the decision was made to intervene. A further model was created to demonstrate the tricuspid apparatus. An arterial switch was ultimately performed without the LeCompte maneuver, the muscular VSD enlarged and baffled into the neo aortic root and the perimembranous VSD closed.

Through collaboration, SDM helps to facilitate evidence-based medical decisions that are closely aligned with patient or surrogate preferences, values, and goals. How to implement SDM in clinical pediatric practice, however, remains elusive, in part because SDM in pediatrics is complicated by the involvement of parents as a special class of surrogate decision-maker. A provisional framework for the process of SDM in pediatrics was recently proposed by Opel to help facilitate its implementation. To identify aspects of the framework that require refinement, we applied it across a diverse range of clinical cases from multiple pediatric specialties. In doing so, several questions surfaced that deserve further scrutiny: (1) For which medical decisions is consideration of SDM required? (2) What is considered medically reasonable when there is variability in standard practice? (3) Can an option that is not consistent with standard practice still be medically reasonable? (4) How should public health implications be factored into SDM? (5) How should variability in preference sensitivity be approached? (6) How should the developing autonomy of adolescents be integrated into SDM?; and (7) How should SDM address parental decisional burden for emotionally charged decisions?

METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional observational study of 69 parents of 46 children who participated in the Decision-making in Pediatric Palliative Care Study between 2006 and 2008 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Parents were guided individually through a semistructured in-depth interview about their experiences and thoughts regarding making medical decisions on behalf of their ill children, and the transcribed interviews were qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: All parents in our study employed explicit heuristics in interviews about decision-making for their children, with the number of identified explicit heuristics used by an individual parent ranging from tens to hundreds. The heuristics served 5 general functions: (1) to depict or facilitate understanding of a complex situation; (2) to clarify, organize, and focus pertinent information and values; (3) to serve as a decision-making compass; (4) to communicate with others about a complex topic; and (5) to justify a choice.

When the child and parents disagree regarding medical decisions, the pediatrician has the challenging task of guiding the family to a final decision. Unresolved discord can affect family cohesiveness, patient adherence, and patient self-management. In this article, we outline 3 models for the pediatrician's role in the setting of decisional discord: deference, advocative, and arbitrative. In the deference model, the pediatrician prioritizes parental decision-making authority. In the advocative model, the pediatrician advocates for the child's preference in decision-making so long as the child's decision is medically reasonable. In the arbitrative model, the pediatrician works to resolve the conflict in a balanced fashion. Although each model has advantages and disadvantages, the arbitrative model should serve as the initial model in nearly all settings. The arbitrative model is likely to reach the most beneficial decision in a manner that maintains family cohesiveness by respecting the authority of parents and the developing autonomy of children. We also highlight, however, occasions when the deference or advocative models may be more appropriate.

METHODS: This was a qualitative multicenter study. We identified English-speaking parents at 3 hospitals whose infants had died as a result of extreme prematurity or lethal congenital anomalies in 1999-2005. Parents were interviewed about their prenatal decision-making. Maternal medical charts were reviewed for documented discussions regarding delivery room resuscitation. Subject enrollment was stopped when saturation of themes was achieved. RESULTS: Twenty-six mothers of infants were interviewed. All parents wanted to participate to some degree in decisions regarding delivery room resuscitation. Few parents recalled discussing options for delivery room resuscitation with physicians, and even fewer recalled being offered the option of comfort care, even when these discussions were documented in the medical chart. Parents did not report physicians' predictions of morbidity and death to be central to their decision-making. Religion, spirituality, and hope guided decision-making for most parents. Some parents felt that they had not made any decisions regarding resuscitation and instead ""left things in God's hands."" These parents typically were documented by staff members to ""want everything done."" CONCLUSIONS: The values that parents find most important during decision-making regarding delivery room resuscitation may not be addressed routinely in prenatal counseling.

Recent findings: PnPC is a new concept in neonatal intensive care approach. Advancements in perinatal diagnostics and medical technology have changed the landscape of the perinatal world. The threshold of viability continues to decrease, and diagnostic information is available earlier in pregnancy and more rapidly at the bedside; overall outcomes continue to improve. This rapid technological improvement brings ethical debates on the quality of life of patients with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions and the need to involve the family in the decision-making process, according to their wishes and cultural beliefs. Although the Perinatal Hospice concept was developed in the 1980s in the US, the first recommendations on how to develop a PnPC pathway were published in the early 2000s. We considered the most relevant position statements or guidelines on PnPC published in the last two decades. Some of them were more pertinent to pediatrics but still useful for the fundamental concepts and PnPC project's development. Summary: Health care providers and institutions are encouraged to develop PnPC programs, which have the goal of maximizing the quality of life of infants with non-curable conditions. These may generally include the following: a formal prenatal consultation; development of a coordinated birth plan between obstetrician, newborn care, and family; access to other neonatal and pediatric specialties, as needed; comfort palliative care during the prenatal, birth, and postnatal periods; and psychosocial and spiritual support for families, siblings, and staff.",2020,10.3389/fped.2020.596744,8,NA,596744,eng,2296-2360,life-limiting condition and life-threatening condition and limit of viability and perinatal palliative care and program,NA,NA,2020///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

Shilkofski_2015_Pedi,JOUR,Identification of Barriers to Pediatric Care in Limited-Resource Settings: A Simulation Study,"Shilkofski, Nicole and Hunt, Elizabeth A.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVES: Eighty percent of the 10 million annual deaths in children aged <5 years in developing countries are estimated to be avoidable, with improvements in education for pediatric emergency management being a key factor. Education must take into account cultural considerations to be effective. Study objectives were: (1) to use simulation to identify factors posing barriers to patient care in limited resource settings (LRS); and (2) to understand how simulations in LRS can affect communication and decision-making processes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted at 17 different sites in 12 developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Data from observations of 68 in situ simulated pediatric emergencies were coded for thematic analysis. Sixty-two different ""key informants"" were interviewed regarding perceived benefit of simulations. RESULTS: Coding of observations and interviews yielded common themes: impact of culture on team hierarchy, impact of communication and language barriers on situational awareness, systematic emergency procedures, role delineation, shared cognition and resource awareness through simulation, logistic barriers to patient care, and use of recognition-primed decision-making by experienced clinicians. Changes in clinical environments were implemented as a result of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Ad hoc teams in LRS face challenges in caring safely for patients; these include language and cultural barriers, as well as environmental and resource constraints. Engaging teams in simulations may promote improved communication, identification of systems issues and latent threats to target for remediation.

Academic research on children's privacy has primarily focused on the safety risks involved in sharing personal information on the Internet, leaving market forces (such as commercial data collection) as a less discussed aspect of children's privacy. Yet, children's privacy in the digital era cannot be fully understood without examining marketing practices, especially in the context of ""big data."" As children increasingly consume content on an ever-expanding variety of digital devices, media and advertising industries are creating new ways to track their behaviors and target them with personalized content and marketing messages based on individual profiles. The advent of the so-called Internet of Things, with its ubiquitous sensors, is expanding these data collection and profiling practices. These trends raise serious concerns about digital dossiers that could follow young people into adulthood, affecting their access to education, employment, health care, and financial services.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether higher survival rates and better short-term outcomes for infants born at 22 or 23 weeks' gestation may be achieved by active prenatal and postnatal care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 106 infants born at 22 or 23 weeks of gestation at a level III neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Cologne Medical Centre in Cologne, Germany, between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed in June 2015. EXPOSURES: Active prenatal and postnatal care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival until hospital discharge and survival without neonatal or short-term severe complications (defined as high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage, surgery for abdominal complications, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or retinopathy of prematurity). RESULTS: Of 106 liveborn infants (45 born at 22 weeks and 61 born at 23 weeks and 6 days), 20 (19%) received palliative care (17 born at 22 weeks and 3 born at 23 weeks), and 86 (81%) received active care (28 born at 22 weeks and 58 born at 23 weeks). Of the 86 infants who received active care (mean [SD] maternal age, 32 [6] years), 58 (67%) survived until hospital discharge (17 born at 22 weeks and 41 born at 23 weeks).

When it comes to SDM in cross-cultural encounters, we recommend that clinicians acknowledge their own cultural beliefs and values (including those stemming from the culture of medicine), maintain awareness of potential biases and assumptions, appreciate the complexity of patient and family identities and narratives, practice cultural humility, understand the moral relevance of culture, and respect patient and family preferences for SDM.

The underlying concern for many relates to the perceived value of these children. Clinicians should make efforts to appreciate the family's perspective regarding children with profound disabilities who require respiratory and nutritional medical support. Finding opportunities to learn about the family members' lives outside of the health care setting may facilitate a deeper understanding of what it means to live with a child who has profound disabilities. In conversations with families, referring to interventions as futile and conditions as lethal will obscure the value-based nature of these decisions. Respiratory and nutritional interventions are not clearly against the interests of most children. Even for children with a limited life span, life-sustaining interventions may be important for the child and family. Health care costs are a serious societal issue; however, the costs associated with profound disabilities are not the most significant contributor. Societal decisions not to provide life-sustaining health care to children with profound disabilities would require a public process. Clinicians may have personal views regarding decisions for their own family or for their vision for society. However, clinicians have professional obligations to families who have different values. It is important to present balanced information and support parental decision-making so parents may decide to forgo or use life-sustaining interventions according to their values and goals.",2014,10.1542/peds.2013-3608H,133 Suppl 1,NA,49-S44,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Male and ethics and Infant, Newborn and Ethics, Medical and medical decision-making and *Professional-Family Relations and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Pediatrics/*ethics and tracheostomy and values and *Disabled Children and Value of Life and assisted ventilation and Palliative Care/economics/*ethics and profound disabilities and Respiration, Artificial/economics/ethics",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Walter_2014_Pedi,JOUR,Relational autonomy: moving beyond the limits of isolated individualism,"Walter, Jennifer K. and Ross, Lainie Friedman",Pediatrics,"Although clinicians may value respecting a patient's or surrogate's autonomy in decision-making, it is not always clear how to proceed in clinical practice. The confusion results, in part, from which conception of autonomy is used to guide ethical practice. Reliance on an individualistic conception such as the ""in-control agent"" model prioritizes self-sufficiency in decision-making and highlights a decision-maker's capacity to have reason transcend one's emotional experience. An alternative model of autonomy, relational autonomy, highlights the social context within which all individuals exist and acknowledges the emotional and embodied aspects of decision-makers. These 2 conceptions of autonomy lead to different interpretations of several aspects of ethical decision-making. The in-control agent model believes patients or surrogates should avoid both the influence of others and emotional persuasion in decision-making. As a result, providers have a limited role to play and are expected to provide medical expertise but not interfere with the individual's decision-making process. In contrast, a relational autonomy approach acknowledges the central role of others in decision-making, including clinicians, who have a responsibility to engage patients' and surrogates' emotional experiences and offer clear guidance when patients are confronting serious illness. In the pediatric setting, in which decision-making is complicated by having a surrogate decision-maker in addition to a patient, these conceptions of autonomy also may influence expectations about the role that adolescents can play in decision-making.",2014,10.1542/peds.2013-3608D,133 Suppl 1,NA,23-S16,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Communication and communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Physician-Patient Relations and ethics and autonomy and Models, Psychological and *Personal Autonomy and Parents/psychology and Professional-Family Relations and *Psychology, Adolescent and Withholding Treatment/ethics and palliative care and Palliative Care/*ethics and Pediatrics/*ethics and relational autonomy and Psychology, Child",NA,NA,2014/02//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Harley_2019_Frinpe,JOUR,The Role of Parental Concerns in the Recognition of Sepsis in Children: A Literature Review,"Harley, Amanda and Latour, Jos M. and Schlapbach, Luregn J.",Frontiers in pediatrics,"Background: Sepsis is a time critical disease and outcomes strongly depend on time to initiation of appropriate treatment in hospital. A range of studies have assessed sepsis recognition in hospital settings, whereas little is known about sepsis recognition in the community. The decision-making of parents in seeking medical care may substantially impact survival of children with sepsis. An improved understanding of the parental perspective in recognizing sepsis is urgently needed to inform the design of education campaigns and consideration of using parental concerns as a trigger in sepsis screening tools. Aim: To review the literature on parental concerns in the diagnosis of sepsis in children. Methods: A literature review on parental concerns in pediatric sepsis was performed accessing publications in PubMed, CINAHL and Medline published between 1990 and 2018. In addition, we compared guidelines and online institutional sepsis recognition tools and assessed whether parental concerns were used for screening. Results: Out of 188 articles reviewed, 11 met the criteria. One article was found prospectively assessing the diagnostic performance of parental concern in children evaluated for infection, indicating high positive (16.4) and negative likelihood ratio (0.23) for sepsis/meningitis in presence of parental concerns. The role of parental concern was listed as a sign assisting recognition of sepsis in four studies reporting original data, and six reviews commented on parental concern listed as a factor upon diagnosis of sepsis. When comparing selected examples of institutional sepsis pathways available online, parental concern was variably listed as a criterion to prompt evaluation for sepsis. Conclusions: Despite some guidelines emphasizing the role of parental concern in recognizing sepsis, there is a paucity of data in the field. An improved understanding of whether parental concerns adds diagnostic value to sepsis recognition at acceptable sensitivity and specificity is urgently needed. Future prospective studies should assess whether including parental concerns in sepsis screening tools benefits the assessment resulting in early diagnosis and treatment of children with sepsis.",2019,10.3389/fped.2019.00161,7,NA,161,eng,2296-2360,diagnosis and sepsis and recognition and infection and child and parent and concern and septic shock,NA,NA,2019///,Front Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

People around the world rely on CAM, so similar issues face clinicians in many countries. In law, few cases have dealt with CAM use. The few that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases that involved conventional care while taking into account considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the relatively limited research on the efficacy and safety of CAM compared with conventional medicine, especially in children, which requires clinicians to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The clinical scenarios presented focus on patients who represent a range of ages, clinical conditions, and settings. They act as anchors to explore particular CAM policy issues and illustrate the application of and shortcomings in existing guidance and intervention principles.

Murray_2020_JAMApedi,JOUR,Association of Gestational Age at Birth With Risk of Perinatal Mortality and Special Educational Need Among Twins,"Murray, Sarah and MacKay, Daniel and Stock, Sarah and Pell, Jill and Norman, Jane",JAMA pediatrics,"IMPORTANCE: Twin pregnancies account for 3% of live births but experience substantially more perinatal morbidity and mortality than singleton pregnancies. Optimizing the timing of birth is a key strategy in improving twin pregnancy outcomes. Current UK and US policies are based on observational studies of perinatal mortality and not on longer-term effects. The association of timing of birth with long-term childhood outcomes among twins is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To identify the optimal gestation week for birth of twin infants by calculating the week of birth associated with the lowest risk of short-term and long-term adverse outcomes (perinatal mortality and special educational need [SEN] at school). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, data-linkage cohort study included 43 133 twin infants born at a gestational age of 34 weeks onward between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2015, in Scotland. The data were analyzed from June 1, 2017, to March 1, 2019. EXPOSURES: Gestational age (in weeks) at the time of birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were extended perinatal mortality and a record of SEN (<e2><89><a5>1 of intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, physical or motor impairment, language or speech disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties) at school (children aged 4-18 years). To infer the consequence of the gestational age at birth, clinical outcomes of twin infants born at each week of gestation from 34 weeks onward were compared with those of twin infants remaining in utero thereafter. RESULTS: Of the total 43 133 twin infants included in the study, 21 696 (50.3%) were females. Although maternity records were available for all infants, 9519 sex-discordant twin children were linked to their educational data, of whom 1069 (13.8%) had a record of SEN. Compared with twins remaining in utero (n = 26<e2><80><af>172), birth at any gestational age from 34 to 37 weeks was associated with increased odds of perinatal death (ie, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.69 at 36 weeks [n = 8056]) and increased risk of SEN at school (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.74, for birth at 36 weeks compared with 37 weeks). In a competing risk analysis, the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were balanced at 37 weeks (risk difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.8-3.3). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that, in the absence of a medical complication, twins should not be routinely delivered before 37 completed weeks of gestation.

We performed multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between self-efficacy and parental participation, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: One hundred thirty of 278 eligible parents completed surveys and 86% reported participating in MDM about their child's care. After adjusting for covariates, parents with scores in the middle and highest self-efficacy tertiles had higher odds of participating in MDM compared with parents in the lowest tertile.

Forty-seven conversations were audio recorded, ranging from 1 to 8 meetings per patient. By means of a coding instrument we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed physicians' and parents' communicative behaviors. On average, physicians spoke 67% of the time, parents 30%, and nurses 3%. All physicians focused primarily on providing medical information, explaining their preferred course of action, and informing parents about the decision being reached by the team. Only in 2 cases were parents asked to share in the decision-making. Despite their intense emotions, most parents made great effort to actively participate in the conversation. They did this by asking for clarifications, offering their preferences, and reacting to the decision being proposed (mostly by expressing their assent). In the few cases where parents strongly preferred LST to be continued, the physicians either gave parents more time or revised the decision.

Yet as medical technology has advanced and life-sustaining treatments multiplied, medicine's capacity to both prevent and create suffering has grown exponentially. In pediatric medicine, the ability to stave off death with life-sustaining treatments allows children to survive but also to suffer in ways that are diverse and unprecedented. However, although parents and pediatric clinicians broadly agree that all children can suffer, there is little published literature in which researchers analyze or clarify the concept of pediatric suffering. This gap is worrisome, especially in light of growing concerns that the label of suffering is used to justify end-of-life decision-making and mask quality-of-life determinations for pediatric patients with profound neurologic impairment. Moreover, the awareness that some children can experience suffering but cannot communicate whether and how they are suffering creates a problem.

Huang_2020_Joofpegaannu,JOUR,Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Distribute Transition Services to Adolescents With Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Huang, Jeannie S. and Yueh, Ryan and Wood, Kalie and Ma, Stacy and Cruz, Rusvelda and Boyd, Nancy and Kruth, Robin and Parker, Jacob",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and utility of an electronic health record (EHR) activity to assess transitional readiness, deliver services to meet individual needs, and to track patient progress. METHODS: We developed a Transition EHR activity (TEA) to track patients through a standardized process where transition readiness is annually assessed and services distributed based on need. The process assesses transition skills starting at age 12 years and sets goals through shared decision-making, delivers resources according to need, reviews patients' personal medical histories, and documents healthcare transfer to adult gastroenterology. We piloted TEA among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ages <e2><89><a5>12 years. Distribution to patients was measured and tolerability assessed via patient self-report evaluations. RESULTS: Since launch, TEA has been distributed to all eligible patients (N = 53) with a median age of 16 (14,18) years (median [IQR]), 62% male, 58% white, 26% Hispanic at our weekly dedicated IBD clinic. All have performed the transition skills' self-assessment and practicum, and set transition goals with their healthcare provider. Of these individuals, 41 (77%) participated in survey feedback. On a utility rating scale of 0 (not helpful at all) to 10 (very helpful), patients reported median (IQR) utility scores of 8 (7,10) for the transition readiness assessment, 9 (7,10) for transition resources provided, and 9 (7,10) for the medical history summary. Most (91%) would recommend TEA to other patients.

Little is known, however, about how prebariatric EGD in adolescents influences clinical management or outcome. Our aim was to assess if an abnormal prebariatric EGD resulted in interventions or modification of bariatric surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adolescents undergoing evaluation for bariatric surgery. We obtained demographic and anthropometric data in addition to EGD findings, biopsy pathology, gastrointestinal symptoms, and surgical outcomes. An EGD was considered abnormal if either abnormal gross findings or abnormal pathology was reported. Patients were followed until a 6-week postop visit. RESULTS: Of 134 patients presenting for evaluation, 94 (70%) underwent preoperative EGD. Fifty-one (54%) had a normal EGD and 43 (46%) had EGD abnormalities including 7 with an anatomical abnormality and 36 with mild mucosal abnormalities. Among patients with EGD abnormalities, 22% received medical intervention including proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration (n = 10) and Helicobacter pylori eradication (n = 11). GI symptoms were the only predictor of EGD abnormalities (odds ratio [OR] 4.9: 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-15.0; P < 0.001). No factors predicted likelihood of a post-EGD intervention. An abnormal EGD did not correlate with any postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of adolescents undergoing evaluation for SG, 46% had an abnormal EGD, of which 22% received a medical intervention. Symptoms were the only predictor of EGD abnormalities.

The patient's family lives in a rural area with few health care resources and his parents are already handling hours of daily skin care for his epidermolysis bullosa. In an attempt to convince the parents to pursue the intervention, the medical team recommends that the family move to an area with additional resources to assist in the child's care. The parents refuse to move, citing the many benefits their home environment provides for their son. The medical team calls an ethics consultation, questioning whether this decision constitutes medical neglect. This case raises important questions about medical decision-making in pediatrics. First, is a parent's refusal of a recommended medical intervention because it would require moving their family to a new environment a reasonable decision? Second, how broadly can parents define their child's best interest? Should only physical interests be included when making medical decisions? Is there a limit to what can be considered a relevant interest? Third, can parents only consider the interests of the individual child, or can they consider the interests of other members of the family? Finally, what is the threshold for overruling a parental decision? Is it whenever the parent's definition of a patient's best interest is different from the medical team's, or do other criteria have to be met?",2019,10.1542/peds.2019-1130,144,6,e20191130,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Male and Child, Preschool and Rural Population and Parents/psychology and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics/methods and Epidermolysis Bullosa/diagnosis/*therapy and Rural Health Services/*ethics and Supraglottitis/diagnosis/*therapy",NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Opel_2018_Pedi,JOUR,A 4-Step Framework for Shared Decision-making in Pediatrics,"Opel, Douglas J.",Pediatrics,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a well-established component of patient-centered care, and yet, its application in pediatrics is poorly understood. Common features of pediatric decision-making are not completely addressed in current SDM models, such as the fact that the principal SDM participant is the patient's surrogate, who, unlike competent adult patients deciding for themselves, has limitations on decision-making authority. To address this gap and improve the practice of SDM in pediatrics, a practical 4-step framework is presented. In step 1, physicians are posed the following question for any discrete decision: does the decision include >1 medically reasonable option? If the answer is no, SDM is not indicated. If the answer is yes, physicians proceed to step 2 and answer the following question: does 1 option have a favorable medical benefit-burden ratio compared with other options? If yes, physician-guided SDM is appropriate. If no, parent-guided SDM is appropriate. For each SDM approach, the physician proceeds to step 3 and answers the following question: how preference sensitive are the options? This helps to determine the specific SDM approach in step 4, which ranges from a strong or weak version of physician-guided SDM to a strong or weak version of parent-guided SDM. Several decisional characteristics, if present, can also help calibrate the version of SDM used. Additional analyses are needed to consider the inclusion of adolescents into this SDM framework.",2018,10.1542/peds.2018-0516E,142,Suppl 3,S149-S156,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Physicians and Humans and Child and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Parents and *Decision Making and *Physician-Patient Relations and Pediatrics/*methods,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN: We examined the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a representative survey of 40 242 parents of CSHCN. CMC was defined as needing or using more medical care than usual, seeing 2 or more subspecialists, and positive response on at least 3 other items on the CSHCN screener. We identified 3 subgroups each of CMC and noncomplex CSHCN by sentinel diagnoses: asthma, seizures, and other diagnoses. SDM was defined as a binary composite variable, derived from 4 discrete items. We constructed 4 stepwise multivariable models to assess the relative odds of SDM, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics (age, income, language, race, ethnicity, and marital status), behavioral comorbidity, family-centered care, and patient-centered medical home. RESULTS: The study population included 39 876 respondents. Compared with noncomplex CSHCN, CMC had a lower likelihood of SDM (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91), which persisted in diagnostic subgroups: CMC with asthma (aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.92) and CMC with other diagnoses (aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94), but not CMC with seizures (aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59-1.51).

Adam and King, Nancy M. P.",The Journal of pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the perceptions of caregivers of children with medical complexity (CMC) about their decision to pursue tracheostomy for their children, in particular the satisfaction with their decision. STUDY DESIGN: In this qualitative study conducted in western North Carolina between 2013 and 2014, we interviewed 56 caregivers of 41 CMC who had received tracheostomies in the past 5 years. Three of the CMC were deceased at the time of the interview; 8 were decannulated. In-depth interviews (35 English, 6 Spanish) were conducted, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. We used ATLAS.ti software to manage data and identified themes related to caregiver perceptions about tracheostomy decision. RESULTS: We found that caregivers often chose tracheostomy because extending the lives of their children and being able to care for them at home were important. Caregivers reported the many benefits of tracheostomy including improvement in respiratory symptoms, physical and developmental health, quality of life, and means to provide medical care quickly when needed. There were negative effects of tracheostomy such as mucous plugs, excessive secretions, accidental decannulation necessitating emergency tracheostomy tube change, and the increased infection risk. Providing medical care for CMC with tracheostomy at home was difficult, but improved over time. Caregivers were generally satisfied with their decision to pursue tracheostomy for their CMC. CONCLUSIONS: Decisional satisfaction with tracheostomy for CMC is high. In counseling caregivers about tracheostomy, clinicians should present both the benefits and risks.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical files of 359 newborns who had died during 1 year in the 10 Dutch NICUs and identified 150 deaths that were preceded by an EoL decision on the basis of the child's poor prognosis. The attending neonatologists of 147 of the 150 newborns were interviewed to obtain details about the decision-making process. RESULTS: EoL decisions about infants with a poor prognosis were initiated mainly by the physician, who subsequently involved the parents. Conflicts between parents and the medical team occurred in 18 of 147 cases and were mostly about the child's poor neurologic prognosis. Conflicts within the team occurred in 6 of 147 cases and concerned the uncertainty of the prognosis. In the event of conflict, the EoL decision was postponed. Consensus was reached by calling additional meetings, performing additional diagnostic tests, or obtaining a second opinion. The chief causes of conflict encountered by the physicians were religious convictions that forbade withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and poor communication between the parents and the team. CONCLUSIONS: The parents were involved in all EoL decision-making processes, and consensus was ultimately reached in all cases. Conflicts within the team occurred in 4% of the cases and between the team and the parents in 12% of the cases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of the 2002-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which represents 2 million children with ADHD and 4 million children with asthma. The outcome, high SDM, was defined by using latent class models based on 7 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey items addressing aspects of SDM. We entered factors potentially associated with SDM into logistic regression models with high SDM as the outcome. Marginal standardization then described the standardized proportion of children's households with high SDM for each factor. RESULTS: For both ADHD and asthma, 65% of children's households had high SDM. Those who reported poor general health for their children were 13% less likely to have high SDM for ADHD (64 vs 77%) and 8% less likely for asthma (62 vs 70%) when adjusting for other factors. Results for behavioral impairment were similar. Respondent demographic characteristics were not associated with SDM. Those with difficulty contacting their clinician by telephone were 26% (ADHD: 55 vs 81%) and 29% (asthma: 48 vs 77%) less likely to have high SDM than those without difficulty.

METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 60 parents of children 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD (50% black and 43% college educated) and 30 primary care clinicians with varying experience. Open-ended interviews explored how pediatric clinicians and parents understood SDM in ADHD. Interviews were taped, transcribed, and then coded. Data were analyzed by using a modified grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Parents and clinicians both viewed SDM favorably. However, parents described SDM as a partnership between equals, with physicians providing medical expertise and the family contributing in-depth knowledge of the child. In contrast, clinicians understood SDM as a means to encourage families to accept clinicians' preferred treatment. These findings affected care because parents mistrusted clinicians whose presentation they perceived as biased. Both groups discussed how real-world barriers limit the consideration of evidence-based options, and they emphasized the importance of engaging professionals, family members, and/or friends in SDM. Although primary themes did not differ according to race, white parents more commonly received support from medical professionals in their social networks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite national guidelines prioritizing SDM in ADHD, challenges to implementing the process persist.

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA, 2008) aimed to improve access to mental health treatment by requiring employer-sponsored health plans to include insurance coverage for behavioral health services. METHODS: Investigators used IBM Watson/Truven Analytics MarketScan claims data (2007-2013) to examine: (1) the distribution of mental illness; (2) trends in utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures; and (3) the overall effect of the MHPAEA on mental health services utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures among privately-insured children aged 3 to 17 with mental health disorders. Multivariate Poisson regression and linear regression modeling techniques were used. RESULTS: Mental health services use for outpatient behavioral health therapy (BHT) was higher in the years after the implementation of the MHPAEA (2010-2013). Specifically, before the MHPAEA implementation, the annual total visits for BHT provided by mental health physicians were 17.1% lower and 2.5% lower for BHT by mental health professionals, compared to years when MHPAEA was in effect. Children covered by consumer-driven and high-deductible plans had significantly higher out-of-pocket expenditures for BHT compared to those enrolled PPOs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate increased mental health services use and higher out-of-pocket costs per outpatient visit after implementation of the MHPAEA.

STUDY DESIGN: We adapted a published test of ethics knowledge for use in neonatology. The novel instrument had 46 true/false questions distributed among 7 domains of neonatal ethics: ethical principles, professionalism, genetic testing, beginning of life/viability, end of life, informed permission/decision making, and research ethics. Content and correct answers were derived from published statements and guidelines. We administered the voluntary, anonymous test via e-mailed link to 103 participants, including medical students, neonatology fellows, neonatologists, neonatology nurses, and pediatric ethicists.

STUDY DESIGN: A self-reported questionnaire was administered to assess the practice of ACP, advance directives, and barriers to ACP for adolescent patients with cancer. All 3392 Japanese board-certified hematologists were surveyed, and 600 hematologists (227 pediatricians, 373 internists) who take care of adolescent patients with cancer with decision-making capacity were analyzed. RESULTS: If a patient's prognosis for survival was <3 months, pediatricians were significantly less likely to discuss ACP with their patients than internists, including discussions regarding the patient's medical condition (59% vs 70%), the patient's understanding of his/her medical condition (55% vs 66%), do not attempt resuscitation orders (17% vs 24%), and ventilator treatment if the patient's condition worsened (19% vs 25%). More than 75% of hematologists (both pediatricians and internists) discussed all ACP topics with patients' families. Similarly, with regard to advance directives, pediatricians were less likely than internists to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation (24% vs 47%) and the use of ventilators (31% vs 51%), vasopressors (24% vs 42%), and antibiotics (21% vs 31%) with their patients. Both pediatricians and internists discussed these issues more often with patients' families than with patients, especially cardiopulmonary resuscitation (98%) as well as the use of ventilators (98%) and vasopressors (91%).

STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative interviews with parents of children who faced a decision about home ventilation in the previous 5 years at 3 geographically dispersed institutions. RESULTS: In total, 38 families (42 parents) were interviewed; 20 families opted for pediatric home ventilation, and 18 families opted against. Approximately one-quarter of children had isolated chronic lung disease; the remainder had medical complexity that was expected to remain static or decline. Parent perspectives about home ventilation generally reflected whether the child was early, or later, in their disease trajectory. Early on, parents often interpreted prognostic uncertainty as hope and saw home ventilation as a tool permitting time for improvement. For families of children later in their disease course, often already with home technology and home nursing, home ventilation held less possibility for meaningful improvement. Nearly all families experienced the decision as very emotionally distressing. Reflecting back, most families described feeling satisfied with whatever decision they made.

Advance care planning (ACP) conversations need to be uniquely tailored to this population. Our primary objective for this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of the ACP experiences from the perspectives of both parents and health care providers (HCPs) of CMC. METHODS: We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with parents of CMC and HCPs of various disciplines from a tertiary pediatric hospital. Interview guide questions were focused on ACP, including understanding of the definition, positive and negative experiences, and suggestions for improvement. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen mothers and 11 HCPs participated in individual interviews. Interviews revealed 4 major themes and several associated subthemes (in parentheses): (1) holistic mind-set, (2) discussion content (beliefs and values, hopes and goals, and quality of life), (3) communication enhancers (partnerships in shared decision-making, supportive setting, early and ongoing conversations, consistent language and practice, family readiness, provider expertise in ACP discussions, and provider comfort in ACP discussions), and (4) the ACP definition.

In these circumstances, it is not always a simple matter for physicians and other medical professionals who treat adolescents to ascertain the applicable law. In this article, we discuss the underlying differences between medical ethics and law, which have caused some of the confusion in this area, and we set out the most current legal rules governing adolescent decision-making authority in general medical settings.

We conducted phone interviews a median of 65 (IQR 51-77) days after surgery. We audio recorded, transcribed, and coded (line-by-line) interviews using grounded theory by 2 independent reviewers, and discussed among investigators to induce themes associated with surgical decision making and preparation. RESULTS: Six themes emerged about decision making and preparation for spinal fusion: (1) simplify risks and benefits; it is easy to get lost in the details; (2) families prolonging the decision whether or not to pursue spinal fusion surgery may not benefit the child; (3) anticipate anxiety and fear when making a decision about spinal fusion; (4) realize that your child might experience a large amount of pain; (5) anticipate a long recovery and healing process after spinal fusion; and (6) be engaged and advocate for your child throughout the perioperative spinal fusion process. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children who had recently undergone spinal fusion had strong perceptions about what information to convey to families considering surgery, which may improve communication between future parents and physicians.

METHODS: In the STAR cluster-randomized trial, 6- to 12-year-old children with obesity seen at pediatric practices with electronic health record (EHR)-based decision support for primary care providers and self-guided behavior-change support for parents had significantly smaller increases in BMI than children who received usual care. We used a microsimulation model of a national implementation of STAR from 2015 to 2025 among all pediatric primary care providers in the United States with fully functional EHRs to estimate cost, impact on obesity prevalence, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The expected population reach of a 10-year national implementation is <e2><88><bc>2 million children, with intervention costs of $119 per child and $237 per BMI unit reduced. At 10 years, assuming maintenance of effect, the intervention is expected to avert 43 000 cases and 226 000 life-years with obesity at a net cost of $4085 per case and $774 per life-year with obesity averted. Limiting implementation to large practices and using higher estimates of EHR adoption improved both cost-effectiveness and reach, whereas decreasing the maintenance of the intervention's effect worsened the former. CONCLUSIONS: A childhood obesity intervention with electronic decision support for clinicians and self-guided behavior-change support for parents may be more cost-effective than previous clinical interventions.

METHODS: All neonates who died between 2000 and 2009 were identified. The causes and circumstances of death were abstracted from the medical records. Trends in end-of-life decisions were compared between 2 time periods: 2000-2004 versus 2005-2009. RESULTS: Overall, 239 neonates died. The leading cause of death in both study periods was prematurity and its complications (76%). Among term infants, the leading cause of death was congenital anomalies (48%). Fifty-six percent of the infants received maximal intensive care; 28% had redirection of intensive care, of whom 10% had withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment; and 16% had primary nonintervention care.

We began by explaining underlying concepts and principles in ethical, legal, and clinical reasoning and then used case scenarios to explore how they apply and identify gaps that remain in practice and policy. In this concluding article, we review our major findings, summarize our recommendations, and suggest further research. We focus on several key areas: practitioner and patient/parent relationships; decision-making; dispute resolution; standards of practice; hospital/health facility policies; patient safety; education; and research. Ethical principles, standards, and rules applicable when making decisions about conventional care for children apply to decision-making about CAM as well. The same is true of legal reasoning. Although CAM use has seldom led to litigation, general legal principles relied on in cases involving conventional medical care provide the starting point for analysis. Similarly, with respect to clinical decision-making, clinicians are guided by clinical judgment and the best interests of their patient. Whether a therapy is CAM or conventional, clinicians must weigh the relative risks and benefits of therapeutic options and take into account their patient's values, beliefs, and preferences.

A. and Bos, Albert P.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate how Dutch pediatric specialists reach end-of-life decisions, how they involve parents, and how they address conflicts. METHODS: We conducted a national cross-sectional survey among pediatric intensivists, oncologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and metabolic pediatricians practicing in the 8 Dutch university hospitals. We collected information on respondents' overall opinions and their clinical practice. RESULTS: Of the 185 eligible pediatric specialists, 74% returned the questionnaire. All responding physicians generally discuss an end-of-life decision with colleagues before discussing it with parents. In half of the reported cases, respondents informed parents about the intended decision and asked their permission. In one-quarter of the cases, respondents informed parents without asking for their permission. In the remaining one-quarter of the cases, respondents advised parents and consequently allowed them to have the decisive voice. The chosen approach is highly influenced by type of decision and type and duration of treatment. Conflicts within medical teams arose as a result of uncertainties about prognosis and treatment options. Most conflicts with parents arose because parents had a more positive view of the prognosis or had religious objections to treatment discontinuation. All conflicts were eventually resolved by a combination of strategies. In 66% of all cases, pain and symptom management were intensified before the child's death. CONCLUSIONS: Within Dutch pediatrics, end-of-life decisions are team decisions. Pediatric specialists differ considerably in how they involve parents in end-of-life decision-making, ranging from benevolent paternalism to parental autonomy.

Ott_2014_Pedi,JOUR,Contraception for adolescents,"Ott, Mary A. and Sucato, Gina S.",Pediatrics,"A working knowledge of contraception will assist the pediatrician in both sexual health promotion as well as treatment of common adolescent gynecologic problems. Best practices in adolescent anticipatory guidance and screening include a sexual health history, screening for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, counseling, and if indicated, providing access to contraceptives. Pediatricians' long-term relationships with adolescents and families allow them to help promote healthy sexual decision-making, including abstinence and contraceptive use. Additionally, medical indications for contraception, such as acne, dysmenorrhea, and heavy menstrual bleeding, are frequently uncovered during adolescent visits.

Weithorn_2020_Pedi,JOUR,When Does A Minor's Legal Competence To Make Health Care Decisions Matter?,"Weithorn, Lois A.",Pediatrics,"In this article, I examine the role of minors' competence for medical decision-making in modern American law. The doctrine of parental consent remains the default legal and bioethical framework for health care decisions on behalf of children, complemented by a complex array of exceptions. Some of those exceptions vest decisional authority in the minors themselves. Yet, in American law, judgments of minors' competence do not typically trigger shifts in decision-making authority from adults to minors. Rather, minors' decisional capacity becomes relevant only after legislatures or courts determine that the default of parental discretion does not achieve important policy goals or protect implicated constitutional rights in a particular health care context and that those goals can best be achieved or rights best protected by authorizing capable minors to choose for themselves. It is at that point that psychological and neuroscientific evidence plays an important role in informing the legal inquiry as to whether minors whose health is at issue are legally competent to decide.",2020,10.1542/peds.2020-0818G,146,Suppl 1,S25-S32,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,United States and Humans and Adolescent and Child and Civil Rights and Family and Personal Autonomy and Parent-Child Relations and Child Development and Child Rearing and Adolescent Development and Treatment Refusal/legislation & jurisprudence and *Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Patient Self-Determination Act and Parental Consent/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Child Health Services/legislation & jurisprudence and Child Welfare/legislation & jurisprudence and Health Services Accessibility/legislation & jurisprudence and Informed Consent By Minors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Mental Competency/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards and Minors/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Proxy/legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Determining the indications and timing for intervention requires assessment of patient size, type of object ingested, location, clinical symptoms, time since ingestion, and myriad other factors. Often the easiest and least anxiety-producing decision is the one to proceed to endoscopic removal, instead of observation alone. Because of variability in pediatric patient size, there are less firm guidelines available to determine which type of object will safely pass, as opposed to the clearer guidelines in the adult population. In addition, the imprecise nature of the histories often leaves the clinician to question the timing and nature of the ingestion. Furthermore, changes in the types of ingestions encountered, specifically button batteries and high-powered magnet ingestions, create an even greater potential for severe morbidity and mortality among children. As a result, clinical guidelines regarding management of these ingestions in children remain varied and sporadic, with little in the way of prospective data to guide their development. An expert panel of pediatric endoscopists was convened and produced the present article that outlines practical clinical approaches to the pediatric patient with a variety of foreign body ingestions. This guideline is intended as an educational tool that may help inform pediatric endoscopists in managing foreign body ingestions in children. Medical decision making, however, remains a complex process requiring integration of clinical data beyond the scope of these guidelines. These guidelines should therefore not be considered to be a rule or to be establishing a legal standard of care. Caregivers may well choose a course of action outside of those represented in these guidelines because of specific patient circumstances. Furthermore, additional clinical studies may be necessary to clarify aspects based on expert opinion instead of published data. Thus, these guidelines may be revised as needed to account for new data, changes in clinical practice, or availability of new technology.",2015,10.1097/MPG.0000000000000729,60,4,562-574,eng,1536-4801 0277-2116,Pediatrics and Humans and Child and Eating and Endoscopy and *Digestive System and Foreign Bodies/*therapy and Gastrointestinal Diseases/*therapy,NA,NA,2015/04//undefined,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,NA,NA,NA,NA
Miller_2012_Pedi,JOUR,Factors related to voluntary parental decision-making in pediatric oncology,"Miller, Victoria A. and Nelson, Robert M.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to examine demographic and contextual correlates of voluntariness in parents making research or treatment decisions for their children with cancer. METHODS: Participants included 184 parents of children with cancer who made a decision about enrolling the child in a research or treatment protocol within the previous 10 days. Parents completed questionnaires that assessed voluntariness, external influence by others, concern that the child's care would be negatively affected if the parent did not agree, time pressure, information adequacy, and demographics. RESULTS: Lower perceived voluntariness was associated with lower education, male gender, minority status, and not having previous experience with a similar decision. Parents who reported lower voluntariness also perceived more external influence and time pressure, had more concern about the child's care being negatively affected if they declined, and perceived that they had either too much or not enough information about the decision. In a multivariate regression, education, minority status, gender, external influence, and too little information remained significantly associated with voluntariness. CONCLUSIONS: Several groups of parents appear to be at risk for decreased voluntariness when making research or treatment decisions for their seriously ill children, including fathers, nonwhite parents, and those with less education. Parental voluntariness may be enhanced by helping parents to mitigate the effects of unhelpful or unwanted influences by others and ensuring that their information needs are met.",2012,10.1542/peds.2011-3056,129,5,903-909,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Child and Multivariate Analysis and Educational Status and Ethics, Medical and Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and Parents/education/*psychology and Patient Selection/ethics and Parental Consent/*ethics/psychology and Antineoplastic Protocols and Volition/*ethics",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Failure to recognize AHT and respond appropriately at any step in the process, from medical diagnosis to child protection and legal decision-making, can place children at risk. The American Academy of Pediatrics revises the 2009 policy statement on AHT to incorporate the growing body of knowledge on the topic. Although this statement incorporates some of that growing body of knowledge, it is not a comprehensive exposition of the science.

METHODS: Adolescent cancer survivors were interviewed with a structured questionnaire using hypothetical case descriptions. The results were compared with a study of 1769 adolescents without experience of chronic illness. RESULTS: Eighty-three adolescents, 11 to 18 years of age, were interviewed. In terminal situations, 70% to 90% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 84% requests for APS, and 57% to 64% requests for euthanasia. Requests for end-of-life decisions were less acceptable in nonterminal situations, where 28% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 39% to 47% requests for APS, and 11% to 21% requests for euthanasia. Frequently cited reasons for holding back physicians from administering a lethal drug to a child were the child not being well informed about his or her condition (92%) and the parents' opinion not being asked (92%). Compared with adolescents without experience with chronic illness, cancer survivors were more accepting toward requests for NTDs and APS in terminal situations. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent cancer survivors, like other adolescents, want to be involved in medical decision-making at the end of life. They value autonomous decision-making, without excluding parents from the process.

Diekema_2009_Pedi,JOUR,Clinical report--Forgoing medically provided nutrition and hydration in children,"Diekema, Douglas S. and Botkin, Jeffrey R.",Pediatrics,"There is broad consensus that withholding or withdrawing medical interventions is morally permissible when requested by competent patients or, in the case of patients without decision-making capacity, when the interventions no longer confer a benefit to the patient or when the burdens associated with the interventions outweigh the benefits received. The withdrawal or withholding of measures such as attempted resuscitation, ventilators, and critical care medications is common in the terminal care of adults and children. In the case of adults, a consensus has emerged in law and ethics that the medical administration of fluid and nutrition is not fundamentally different from other medical interventions such as use of ventilators; therefore, it can be forgone or withdrawn when a competent adult or legally authorized surrogate requests withdrawal or when the intervention no longer provides a net benefit to the patient. In pediatrics, forgoing or withdrawing medically administered fluids and nutrition has been more controversial because of the inability of children to make autonomous decisions and the emotional power of feeding as a basic element of the care of children. This statement reviews the medical, ethical, and legal issues relevant to the withholding or withdrawing of medically provided fluids and nutrition in children.

We aimed to use national registry data and parametric models to project 20- and 30-year post-transplant outcomes for recently transplanted pediatric LT recipients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 13,442 first-time pediatric (age <18) LT recipients using 1987 to 2018 Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data. We validated the proposed method (ie, to project long-term patient and graft survival using parametric survival models and short-term data) in 2 historic cohorts (1987-1996 and 1997-2006) and estimated long-term projections among patients transplanted between 2007 and 2018. Projections were stratified by raft type, recipient age, and indication for transplant. RESULTS: Parsimonious parametric models with Weibull distribution can be applied to post-transplant data and used to project long-term outcomes for pediatric LT recipients beyond observed data. Projected 20-year patient survival for pediatric LT recipients transplanted in 2007 to 2018 was 84.0% (95% confidence interval 81.5-85.8), compared to observed 20-year survival of 72.8% and 63.6% among those transplanted in 1997 to 2006 and 1987 to 1996, respectively. Projected 30-year survival for pediatric LT recipients in 2007 to 2018 was 80.1% (75.2-82.7), compared to projected 30-year survival of 68.6% (66.1-70.9) in the 1997 to 2006 cohort and observed 30-year survival of 57.5% in the 1987 to 1996 cohort. Twenty- and 30-year patient and graft survival varied slightly by recipient age, graft type, and indication for transplant.

METHODS: All United States-based pediatricians whose board certification had expired and who had not recertified as a generalist or subspecialist in 2004 or 2005 were surveyed. The total sample included 1001 pediatric generalists and 1237 subspecialists. We conducted a mail survey study, with a total of 3 mailings to nonrespondents. Analyses initially were conducted separately for generalists with expired certificates, subspecialists with active subspecialty but expired general pediatrics certificates, and subspecialists with expired subspecialty certificates (regardless of their general pediatrics certification status). RESULTS: The overall response rates were 68% for generalists and 76% for subspecialists. Of pediatricians who had allowed their certificates to expire, the majority still intended to recertify (65% of the generalists and 86% of the subspecialists, in their primary subspecialty). The most common reasons cited by the 35% of generalists with expired certificates who were not planning to participate in maintenance of certification were the expense, the time required to complete maintenance of certification, and the perceived lack of relevance to their current practice. The 14% of subspecialists who were not planning to recertify in their primary subspecialty most commonly cited the expense, a change in career path making recertification unnecessary, and the time required.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey of pediatric surgeons and neonatologists via the American Pediatric Surgical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. We examined how respondents' recommendations were affected by a variety of patient and provider factors. RESULTS: There were 288 neonatologists and 316 pediatric surgeons who responded. Irrespective of remaining bowel length, comfort care was recommended by 73% of providers for a premature infant with necrotizing enterocolitis and 54% for a full-term infant with midgut volvulus. The presence of comorbidities and earlier gestational age increased the proportion of providers recommending comfort care. Neonatologists were more likely to recommend comfort care than surgeons across all scenarios (OR, 1.45-2.00; P < .05), and this difference was more pronounced with infants born closer to term. In making these recommendations, neonatologists placed more importance on neurodevelopmental outcomes (P < .001), and surgeons emphasized experience with long-term quality of life (P < .001).

Hill_2018_Pedi,JOUR,Changes in Parental Hopes for Seriously Ill Children,"Hill, Douglas L. and Nathanson, Pamela G. and Carroll, Karen W. and Schall, Theodore E. and Miller, Victoria A. and Feudtner, Chris",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND: Hopes of parents of children with serious illness play an important role in decision-making and coping. Little is known about how parent hopes change over time. We describe the changes in parent hopes across multiple domains and time intervals, examine hopes in a subgroup of parents whose child died, and explore the maintenance of domains over time. METHODS: In a mixed-methods prospective cohort study on decision-making, parents of seriously ill children reported demographic characteristics and hopes at baseline and reported any changes in hopes at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-month follow-up visits. Hopes were coded into 9 domains. Hope changes and domain changes were identified for each parent at each visit. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine parents of 158 patients most often reported hopes in the domains of quality of life (75%), physical body (69%), future well-being (47%), and medical care (34%). Hope percentages increased over time for quality of life (84%), future well-being (64%), and broader meaning (21%). The hope domains reported by parents of children who died were similar to the rest of the sample. The majority of parents who completed 5 to 6 follow-up visits changed at least 1 domain. At the individual parent level, some domains revealed considerable change over time, whereas other domains were stable among a subset of parents. CONCLUSIONS: The specific hopes and overall areas of hope of parents of seriously ill children vary over time, although most hopes fall within 4 major areas. Accordingly, clinicians should regularly check with parents about their current hopes.",2018,10.1542/peds.2017-3549,141,4,NA,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and *Severity of Illness Index and Quality of Life/psychology and Parents/*psychology and Critical Illness/*psychology/therapy and Adaptation, Psychological/physiology and *Decision Making/physiology and *Hope/physiology",NA,NA,2018/04//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Brody_2007_Pedi,JOUR,Radiation risk to children from computed tomography,"Brody, Alan S. and Frush, Donald P. and Huda, Walter and Brent, Robert L.",Pediatrics,"Imaging studies that use ionizing radiation are an essential tool for the evaluation of many disorders of childhood. Ionizing radiation is used in radiography, fluoroscopy, angiography, and computed tomography scanning. Computed tomography is of particular interest because of its relatively high radiation dose and wide use. Consensus statements on radiation risk suggest that it is reasonable to act on the assumption that low-level radiation may have a small risk of causing cancer. The medical community should seek ways to decrease radiation exposure by using radiation doses as low as reasonably achievable and by performing these studies only when necessary. There is wide agreement that the benefits of an indicated computed tomography scan far outweigh the risks. Pediatric health care professionals' roles in the use of computed tomography on children include deciding when a computed tomography scan is necessary and discussing the risk with patients and families. Radiologists should be a source of consultation when forming imaging strategies and should create specific protocols with scanning techniques optimized for pediatric patients. Families and patients should be encouraged to ask questions about the risks and benefits of computed tomography scanning.

This policy statement reviews the forms of advertising that children and teenagers encounter, including newer forms of digital marketing, such as sponsored content, influencers, data collection, persuasive design, and personalized behavioral marketing driven by machine learning. Parents and pediatric health care providers need to be aware of the ways different marketing messages reach children and teenagers, including Internet sites, social media, and mobile apps. Evidence suggests that exposure to advertising is associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverages; use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes; use of alcohol and marijuana; and indoor tanning. Children are uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive effects of advertising because of immature critical thinking skills and impulse inhibition. School-aged children and teenagers may be able to recognize advertising but often are not able to resist it when it is embedded within trusted social networks, encouraged by celebrity influencers, or delivered next to personalized content. This policy statement expresses concern about the practice of tracking and using children's digital behavior to inform targeted marketing campaigns, which may contribute to health disparities among vulnerable children or populations. Pediatricians should guide parents and children to develop digital literacy skills to prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, but it is equally important that policy makers and technology companies embrace digital design, data collection, and marketing practices within today's broad digital environment that support healthier decision-making and outcomes.",2020,10.1542/peds.2020-1681,146,1,e20201681,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Humans and Adolescent and Child and *Internet and *Child Health and *Advertising,NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to determine the rate of unnecessary exclusion decisions by child care directors in a state that endorses AAP/APHA guidelines and to identify factors that are associated with higher unnecessary exclusion decisions. METHODS: A telephone survey was administered to directors in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Directors were randomly sampled from a list of 971 registered centers. Director, center, and neighborhood characteristics were obtained. Directors reported whether immediate exclusion was indicated for 5 vignettes that featured children with mild illness that do not require exclusion by AAP/APHA guidelines. Weighted data were summarized by using descriptive statistics. Regression analysis was used to identify factors that were associated with directors' exclusion decisions. RESULTS: A total of 305 directors completed the survey. Overall, directors would unnecessarily exclude 57% of children. More than 62% had never heard of the AAP/APHA guidelines. Regression analysis showed fewer exclusions among more experienced compared with less experienced directors, among larger centers compared with smaller centers, and among centers that were located in areas with a higher percentage of female heads of household.

H. and van Meerveld, R. Corine and Sauer, Pieter J. J.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: Decisions regarding end-of-life care in critically ill newborns in The Netherlands have received considerable criticism from the media and from the public. This might be because of a lack of proper information and knowledge. Our purpose was to provide detailed information about how and when the implementation of end-of-life decisions, which are based on quality-of-life considerations, takes place. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all infants who died within the first 2 months of life at 2 university hospitals in The Netherlands from January to July 2005 and extracted all relevant information about the end-of-life decisions. We interviewed the responsible neonatologists about the end-of-life decisions and the underlying quality-of-life considerations and about the process of implementation. RESULTS: Of a total of 30 deaths, 28 were attributable to withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. In 18 of 28 cases, the infant had no chance to survive; in 10 cases, the final decision was based on the poor prognosis of the infant. In 6 patients, 2 successive different end-of-life decisions were made. The arguments that most frequently were used to conclude that quality of life was deemed poor were predicted suffering and predicted inability of verbal and nonverbal communication. Implementation consisted of discontinuation of ventilatory support and alleviation of pain and symptoms. Neuromuscular blockers were added shortly before death in 5 cases to prevent gasping, mostly on parental request. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of deaths were attributable to withholding or withdrawing treatment. In most cases, the newborn had no chance to survive and prolonging of treatment could not be justified. In the remaining cases, withholding or withdrawing treatment was based on quality-of-life considerations, mostly the predicted suffering and predicted inability of verbal and nonverbal communication.

Unguru_2010_Pedi,JOUR,The experiences of children enrolled in pediatric oncology research: implications for assent,"Unguru, Yoram and Sill, Anne M. and Kamani, Naynesh",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND: Most children with cancer enroll in clinical research trials. Whenever possible, children must provide their assent before enrolling in research studies. We studied what children aged 7 to 18 with cancer understand about research, their research-related treatment, and their preferences for inclusion in decision-making. PROCEDURE: Thirty-seven face-to-face, audiorecorded interviews using a novel, semi-structured tool, the quality-of-assent instrument, were conducted. Exploratory univariate and bivariate analyses of the quantitative data elucidated patterns and trends of understanding and preferences. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 37 children (51%) did not know or recall that their treatment was considered research, and 19 of 22 (86%) did not understand their doctor when he or she discussed the trial. More children enrolled in trials to help future children with cancer (27 of 37 [73%]), than to get better personally (22 of 37 [60%]). Irrespective of age, children with Hodgkin's disease, germ-cell tumors, and leukemia had significantly greater research awareness and appreciation than children with other cancers (P = .019 and P < .001, respectively). Although all children wanted to be involved in decision-making, 18 of 37 (49%) did not have or recall having a role in deciding to enroll in their trial, and 14 of 37 (38%) did not feel free to dissent to trial enrollment. Only 4 of 37 children (11%) discussed increased decision-making roles with parents, and only 7 of 37 (19%) discussed them with their doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Most children have limited understanding of research despite physicians' explanations. Many children reported that they feel minimally involved in the decision to enroll in clinical trials. Tools to assist investigators ascertain that children understand what they are agreeing to when they assent to research and to determine their preferences for inclusion in research may help make assent more meaningful.",2010,10.1542/peds.2008-3429,125,4,883-e876,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Child and Surveys and Questionnaires and Age Factors and Biomedical Research and Medical Oncology and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Research Subjects/*psychology and Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/*psychology and Informed Consent/*psychology and Patient Participation/methods/*psychology",NA,NA,2010/04//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article explores ways to extend these concerns to clinical WGS in neonatal care. By considering these perspectives during the early phases of expanded use of WGS in the NICU, this article encourages clinicians and bioethicists to continue to reflect on ways to attend to the concerns of disability rights advocates, foster trust and cooperation between the medical and disability communities, and forestall some of the social harms clinical WGS might cause to persons with disabilities and their families.",2016,10.1542/peds.2015-3731I,137 Suppl 1,NA,55-S47,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Decision Making and Pregnancy and Infant, Newborn and Sequence Analysis, DNA and Prejudice and *Genetic Predisposition to Disease and Social Stigma and *Intensive Care Units, Neonatal and Genetic Testing/*ethics and *Disabled Children and Prenatal Diagnosis and Genetic Counseling and *High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and Neonatal Screening/*ethics",NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has been true since the time of Hippocrates who warned physicians not to treat patients who were ""overmastered by their disease."" This principle remains valid today but, as the Society for Critical Care Medicine notes, it is difficult to identify treatment as absolutely futile in all but a few clinical situations. Far more common, they note, are ""treatments that are extremely unlikely to be beneficial, are extremely costly, or are of uncertain benefit."" These, they say, ""may be considered inappropriate and hence inadvisable, but should not be labeled futile."" So what should doctors do when they have a case that seems close to the futility threshold but does not, perhaps, quite cross it? In such cases, is it appropriate to make unilateral decisions to withhold life-sustaining treatment even if the family objects? Or should treatment be provided knowing that it might cause pain and suffering to an infant with no likelihood of benefit? To address these questions, we present a case of an extremely premature infant with a giant omphalocele and ask 3 neonatologists, Dr Dalia Feltman of Evanston Hospital, Dr Theophil Stokes of the Walter Reed Medical Center, and Dr Jennifer Kett, a neonatologist and fellow in bioethics at Seattle Children's Hospital, to comment.",2014,10.1542/peds.2013-1001,133,1,123-128,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and ethics and Infant, Newborn and *Infant, Extremely Premature and palliative care and shared decision-making and futility and Palliative Care/ethics and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and Neonatology/*ethics and Medical Futility/*ethics and Hernia, Umbilical/*therapy and Herniorrhaphy/*ethics and Infant, Premature, Diseases/*therapy and Intensive Care, Neonatal/ethics and legal issues and omphalocele and prematurity and Resuscitation/*ethics",NA,NA,2014/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Toward this end, I also offer 1 approach, a 24/7 telephone consultation network, for enriching interaction of primary care providers (PCPs) and subspecialists who can potentially provide rapid access to needed advice, reduce demand for subspecialty appointments, bolster decision-making and expertise, and realign resources with need. METHODS: Data were obtained from 579 requests by PCPs for telephone consultation by subspecialists in 8 areas (including child psychiatry). RESULTS: Of calls, 27% took <5 minutes and 79% took 5 to 15 minutes. Of calls, 28% resulted in a clinic visit; 8% prompted hospital transfer, hospital admission, or referral to an emergency department; and the remaining 64% resulted in continued management by PCP with reinforcement of the plan. Assuming most inquiries would have resulted in referral to a subspecialist were there no telephone consultation, we estimated that 70% (8+64%) of consultations realigned resources with need, resulting in large saving of unnecessary clinic visits, travel, expense to families, lost days at work, or missed school.

We categorized deaths using a 2-by-2 matrix and determined whether mechanical ventilation was withdrawn/withheld and whether the child was dying despite ventilation or physiologically stable but extubated for neurological prognosis. RESULTS: Most unstable patients in all units died in their parents' arms after mechanical ventilation was withdrawn. In Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen, 4% to 12% of patients died while receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This proportion was higher in Chicago (31%). Elective extubation for quality-of-life reasons never occurred in Chicago and occurred in 19% to 35% of deaths in the other units. The proportion of DR deaths in Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen was 16% to 22%. No DR deaths occurred in Chicago. CONCLUSIONS: Death in the NICU occurred differently within and between countries.

In addition, residents were surveyed to quantify these concepts. RESULTS: Thirty-one faculty members and 25 residents were interviewed. Most exposure to CYSHCN was reported to occur in inpatient settings. However, most formal teaching about CYSHCN was described as occurring in the ambulatory setting. Promising educational strategies included home and community visits, inclusion of CYSHCN in resident continuity panels, and simulation and role-playing. Overall, the programs had little training emphasis on the lives and needs of CYSHCN and their families outside the hospital setting.

It recognizes the importance of preserving the child's open future, recommending that genetic testing for adult-onset diseases be deferred.

This duty is predicated on 2 important factors: (1) best interest of the child and (2) nonabandonment. Children exist in the context of a family and therefore excellent care for the child must include attention to the needs of the family, including siblings. The principle of nonabandonment is an important one in pediatric palliative care, as many families report being well cared for during their child's treatment, but feel as if the physicians and team members suddenly disappear after the death of the child. Family-centered care requires frequent, kind, and accurate communication with parents that leads to shared decision-making during treatment, care of parents and siblings during end-of-life, and assistance to the family in bereavement after death.

Groll_2014_Pedi,JOUR,Four models of family interests,"Groll, Daniel",Pediatrics,"In this article, I distinguish between 4 models for thinking about how to balance the interests of parents, families, and a sick child: (1) the oxygen mask model; (2) the wide interests model; (3) the family interests model; and (4) the direct model. The oxygen mask model - which takes its name from flight attendants' directives to parents to put on their own oxygen mask before putting on their child's - says that parents should consider their own interests only insofar as doing so is, ultimately, good for the sick child. The wide interests model suggests that in doing well by my child I am at the very same time doing well by myself. My interests can, and plausibly do, encompass the interests of others; they are, to that extent, wide. There is, then, no sharp separation between the interests of the sick child and the interests of other family members. In the family interests model, families themselves are seen as having interests that are neither identical to the sum, nor a simple function, of the interests of individual family members. The family has goals, values, and aspirations that are essentially corporate rather than individual. According to this model, these family interests can explain why sacrifices can sometimes be demanded of some family members for the sake of others in a medical setting. Finally, the direct model takes a simpler view of family members' interests; it claims that these interests matter simply on their own and should be taken into account in making treatment decisions for a sick child. This model openly considers the competing interests that parents and other family members often have when caring for a sick child, and advocates for weighing those interests when making decisions for and about the sick child. While there is room for all four models at the bedside, I argue that the direct model should be highlighted in clinical decision-making.",2014,10.1542/peds.2014-1394C,134 Suppl 2,NA,86-S81,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Child and ethics and law and Family Relations and *Models, Theoretical and family and Decision Making/*ethics and Parents/*psychology and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Professional-Family Relations/*ethics and Child Advocacy/ethics and child and best interest and Pediatrics/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2014/10//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hyman_2020_Pedi,JOUR,"Identification, Evaluation, and Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder","Hyman, Susan L. and Levy, Susan E. and Myers, Scott M.",Pediatrics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with reported prevalence in the United States of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%). Core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. There is an increasing evidence base to support behavioral and other interventions to address specific skills and symptoms. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions.

Understanding the impact of G-tubes from the family's perspective will inform decision-making and improve support from health care providers. This study explored the experiences of families after G-tube placement in children with neurologic impairment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of English-language qualitative primary research studies describing family experiences after G-tube placement. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2014. Two authors independently screened and identified relevant studies, evaluated quality of reporting by using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research tool, and extracted data. Overarching concepts were developed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: From 2674 screened abstracts, 84 texts were reviewed, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. G-tubes affect the lives of children, parents, and the family unit in many ways, both positive and negative. Improvements and challenges were described for children's health and happiness, for parental caregiving and stress, and for logistics and bonding within the family. G-tube feeding also changed relationships within the family, between the family and the medical system, and between the family and the outside world. Furthermore, experiences varied, with different families framing similar concepts as positive and negative. CONCLUSIONS: G-tube placement has diverse effects on daily life for children with neurologic impairment and their families. Clinicians may use the themes identified in this study to guide conversations with families about their values, experiences, and expectations before and after G-tube placement.",2015,10.1542/peds.2014-4162,136,1,151-e140,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Child and *Decision Making and *Family and Enteral Nutrition/*methods and Intubation, Gastrointestinal/*instrumentation",NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bagley_2007_Pedi,JOUR,"Is a ""wage-payment"" model for research participation appropriate for children?","Bagley, Stephen J. and Reynolds, William W. and Nelson, Robert M.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the applicability of a ""wage-payment"" model to inducements for children to participate in research. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We interviewed 42 children and adolescents between the ages of 4 and 16 years who had diabetes, asthma, seizures, or no chronic medical condition. The interview explored hypothetical participation decisions for up to 4 research scenarios. To evaluate factors that would influence children and adolescents' decision-making for research participation, we probed for the impact of monetary and other incentives. The interviews were transcribed and coded for specific themes related to money or other rewards and incentives. RESULTS: Older children, mainly those >9 years of age, showed an appreciation for the role and value of money through (a) an accurate concept of the material value of money in society or (b) asking for a realistic amount of money in exchange for their research participation. Younger children, primarily those <9 years of age, showed an inability to appreciate the role and value of money by: (a) asking for excessive monetary amounts that bore no relationship to the sum warranted by participation; (b) having no concept of what that money could buy; (c) not comprehending the meaning of a wage as earning a reward for working; or (d) justifying proposed amounts with reasons unrelated to the time and effort involved. CONCLUSIONS: An age-appropriate token of appreciation as an inducement for research participation is appropriate for the younger child who is <9 years old, because they generally have an inadequate understanding of the value of money and, therefore, the meaning of a wage. A wage-payment model for compensating older children (>9 years of age) and adolescents for the time and effort of research participation is appropriate because they generally understand the meaning and value of a wage.",2007,10.1542/peds.2006-1813,119,1,46-51,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Decision Making and Clinical Trials as Topic and Interviews as Topic and Psychology, Adolescent and Patient Participation/*psychology and *Motivation and *Biomedical Research and *Psychology, Child and *Salaries and Fringe Benefits",NA,NA,2007/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to determine the diagnostic performance of automated cell counts and emergency department point-of-care (POC) dipstick urinalyses in the evaluation of young febrile children. METHODS: We prospectively identified a convenience sample of febrile pediatric emergency department patients <48 months of age who underwent urethral catheterization to obtain POC and automated urinalyses and urine culture. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed and diagnostic indices were calculated for POC dipstick and automated cell counts at different cutpoints. RESULTS: Of 342 eligible children, 42 (12%) had urinary bacterial growth <e2><89><a5> 50000/mL. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were: automated white blood cell count, 0.97; automated bacterial count, 0.998; POC leukocyte esterase, 0.94; and POC nitrite, 0.76.

STUDY DESIGN: Pediatric providers were surveyed using scenarios for 6 critically ill patients of different ages with outcomes explicitly described. Providers were asked (1) whether resuscitation was in each patient's best interest; (2) whether they would accept families' wishes for comfort care (no resuscitation); and (3) to rank patients in order of priority for resuscitation. In a structured interview, each participant explained how they evaluated patient interests and when applicable, why their answers differed for neonates. Interviews were audiotaped; transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and mixed methods. RESULTS: Eighty pediatric residents and neonatal nurses participated (response rate 74%). When making life and death decisions, participants considered (1) patient characteristics (96%), (2) personal experience/biases (85%), (3) family's wishes and desires (81%), (4) disease characteristics (74%), and (5) societal perspectives (36%). These factors were not in favor of sick neonates: of the participants, 85% reported having negative biases toward neonates and 60% did not read, misinterpreted, and/or distrusted neonatal outcome statistics. Additional factors used to justify comfort care for neonates included limited personhood and lack of relationships/attachment (73%); prioritization of family's best interest, and social acceptability of death (36%). When these preconceptions were discussed, 70% of respondents reported they would change their answers in favor of neonates.

Adolescents should be encouraged to involve their parents and other trusted adults in decisions regarding pregnancy termination, and most do so voluntarily. The majority of states require that minors have parental consent for an abortion. However, legislation mandating parental involvement does not achieve the intended benefit of promoting family communication, and it increases the risk of harm to the adolescent by delaying access to appropriate medical care.

The case made international headlines about what was in Charlie's best interest. In the medical ethics community, it raised the question of whether best interest serves as a guidance principle (a principle that provides substantive directions as to how decisions are to be made), an intervention principle (a principle specifying the conditions under which third parties are to intervene), both guidance and intervention, or neither. I show that the United Kingdom uses best interest as both guidance and intervention, and the United States uses best interest for neither.

STUDY DESIGN: A set of 10 simulated scenarios was designed for the training and assessment of pediatric RRTs. Pediatric RRTs, comprising a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) registered nurse and respiratory therapist, led by a PICU intensivist-in-training or a pediatric nurse practitioner, managed 7 simulated acutely decompensating patients. Two raters evaluated the scenario performances and psychometric analyses of the scenarios were performed. RESULTS: The teams readily managed scenarios such as supraventricular tachycardia and opioid overdose but had difficulty with more complicated scenarios such as aortic coarctation or head injury. The management of any particular scenario was reasonably predictive of overall team performance. The teams led by the PICU intensivists-in-training outperformed the teams led by the pediatric nurse practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation provides a method for RRTs to develop decision-making skills in managing decompensating pediatric patients.

We hypothesized that hydroxyurea use in children with SCD increased over time and was associated with decreased acute care visits. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Truven Health Analytics-IBM Watson Health MarketScan Medicaid database from 2009 to 2015. The multistate, population-based cohort included children 1 to 19 years old with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or 10th Revision diagnosis of SCD between 2009 and 2015. Changes in hydroxyurea were measured across study years. The primary outcome was the receipt of hydroxyurea, identified through filled prescription claims. Acute care visits (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) were extracted from billing data. RESULTS: A mean of 5138 children each year were included. Hydroxyurea use increased from 14.3% in 2009 to 28.2% in 2015 (P < .001).

We hypothesized that 2 steps in the decision-making process would influence evaluation and diagnosis: social intuition from meeting the family and objective social information associated with child abuse risk. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 32 child abuse pediatricians (CAPs) submitted 730 child abuse consultations including original medical evaluations and diagnoses. CAPs evaluated and diagnosed each other's cases. Comparisons of evaluations and diagnoses were made by levels of social understanding available to the CAP: meeting the family (social intuition and information), reading the case (social information), and reading the case without social information. Evaluations were compared with a consensus gold standard by using logistic regression modeling adjusting for child and CAP characteristics. Diagnostic categories were compared by level of social understanding and diagnostic certainty by using contingency tables. RESULTS: CAPs without access to social intuition were approximately twice as likely to perform gold standard evaluations for neurotrauma and long bone fracture compared with CAPs who met families. Diagnostic agreement fell from 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70.1%-76.5%) when social information was present to 66.5% (95% CI: 63.1%-70.0%) when social information was restricted. In cases with less certainty, agreement dropped to 51.3% (95% CI: 46.0%-56.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Social intuition and information play a role in the physical child abuse decision-making process, which may contribute to differential diagnosis.

We hoped to (1) gain a better understanding of the patient and family experience with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, (2) measure hospital staff satisfaction with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds, and (3) understand the time commitment for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds and conventional rounds. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was undertaken during a 2-week period. During the first week, the hospital staff conducted conventional rounds. Families were surveyed daily, and the staff were surveyed at the end of the week regarding their experiences. During the second week, newly admitted patients received family-centered multidisciplinary rounds at the bedside. Again, both families and staff were surveyed. Observers recorded the interactions between families and staff and measured the time required to conduct rounds. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were admitted during the 2-week study period. No significant differences were found in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. A total of 53 surveys were collected from staff members. The staff reported better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds. It required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. With family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Family-centered multidisciplinary rounds is a method of conducting inpatient hospital rounds that fosters teamwork and empowers hospital staff. The patient and family are engaged in and are the focal point of the rounds. Staff members are able to hear everyone's perspective and give input. The impact on staff satisfaction and the family's ability to participate in their care is significant.",2009,10.1542/peds.2008-2238,123,4,608-e603,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Models, Organizational and Pennsylvania and Professional-Family Relations and Patient Care Team/*organization & administration and Medical Staff, Hospital/education and Hospitals, Teaching/organization & administration and Hospitals, Pediatric/*organization & administration and Pediatrics/education/organization & administration",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Russell and Alessandrini, Evaline A. and Guevara, James P.",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To understand the association between shared decision-making (SDM) and health care expenditures and use among children with special health care needs (CSHCN). METHODS: We identified CSHCN <18 years in the 2002-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey by using the CSHCN Screener. Outcomes included health care expenditures (total, out-of-pocket, office-based, inpatient, emergency department [ED], and prescription) and utilization (hospitalization, ED and office visit, and prescription rates). The main exposure was the pattern of SDM over the 2 study years (increasing, decreasing, or unchanged high or low). We assessed the impact of these patterns on the change in expenditures and utilization over the 2 study years. RESULTS: Among 2858 subjects representing 12 million CSHCN, 15.9% had increasing, 15.2% decreasing, 51.9% unchanged high, and 17.0% unchanged low SDM. At baseline, mean per child total expenditures were $2131. Over the 2 study years, increasing SDM was associated with a decrease of $339 (95% confidence interval: $21, $660) in total health care costs. Rates of hospitalization and ED visits declined by 4.0 (0.1, 7.9) and 11.3 (4.3, 18.3) per 100 CSHCN, and office visits by 1.2 (0.3, 2.0) per child with increasing SDM. Relative to decreasing SDM, increasing SDM was associated with significantly lower total and out-of-pocket costs, and fewer office visits. CONCLUSIONS: We found that increasing SDM was associated with decreased utilization and expenditures for CSHCN. Prospective study is warranted to confirm if fostering SDM reduces the costs of caring for CSHCN for the health system and families.",2012,10.1542/peds.2011-1352,129,1,107-99,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Health Care Costs and Socioeconomic Factors and Health Services Needs and Demand and *Decision Making and *Health Expenditures and *Professional-Family Relations and *Disabled Children and Hospitalization/economics/statistics & numerical data and Child Health Services/*economics/*statistics & numerical data and Emergency Service, Hospital/economics/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ecker_2013_Pedi,JOUR,Factors affecting caregivers' use of antibiotics available without a prescription in Peru,"Ecker, Lucie and Ochoa, Theresa J. and Vargas, Martha and Del Valle, Luis J. and Ruiz, Joaquim",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: To determine factors that affect caregivers' decisions about antibiotic use in children in settings where antibiotics are available without prescription. METHODS: In a house-to-house survey, 1200 caregivers in 3 periurban districts of Lima, Peru, were asked about antibiotic use in young children. RESULTS: In this sample, 87.2% of children aged <5 years had received an antibiotic drug in their lives; 70.3% had received antibiotics before 1 year of age, and 98.8% of those had been prescribed by a physician. Given hypothetical cases of common cold and nondysenteric diarrhea, caregivers would seek medical advice in 76.4% and 87.1%, respectively, and 84.6% of caregivers said they respected medical decisions even if an antibiotic was not prescribed. Caregivers with high school-level education accepted 80% more medical decisions of not using an antibiotic and used fewer pharmacist-recommended antibiotics. For each additional year of life, the risk of self-medicated antibiotic use and the use of pharmacist-recommended antibiotics increased in 30%. (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, P = .001 and OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5, P < .001, respectively). Caregivers respected a medical decision of not prescribing an antibiotic 5 times more when physicians had explained the reason for their advice (OR: 5.0, 95% CI: 3.2-7.8, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Prescribed antibiotic use in these young children is common. Even if they are available without prescription, caregivers usually comply with medical advice and follow physicians' recommendations when antibiotics are not prescribed.

She was initially medically treated with <ce><b2>-blocker therapy; however, after suffering 1 episode of syncope during exertion, she underwent placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Since then, she has never had syncope. However, during the few months before this presentation, she experienced shocks on multiple occasions without any underlying arrhythmias. These shocks are disconcerting for her, and she is having significant anxiety about them. She requests the defibrillator to be inactivated. However, her mother, who also shares the diagnosis of long QT syndrome, disagrees and wants the defibrillator to remain active. The ethics team is consulted in this setting of disagreement between an adolescent, who is 2 months shy of the age of maturity and medical decision-making, and her mother, who is currently responsible for her medical decisions. The question for the consultation is whether it would be ethically permissible for the doctors to comply with the patient's request to turn off the defibrillator or whether the doctors should follow the mother's wishes until the patient is 18 years of age.",2019,10.1542/peds.2018-3714,144,1,e20183714,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Adolescent and Age Factors and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and *Patient Participation/psychology and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and Parental Consent/*ethics/psychology and Defibrillators, Implantable/adverse effects/*ethics/psychology and Informed Consent By Minors/*ethics/psychology and Long QT Syndrome/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy and Mother-Child Relations/psychology",NA,NA,2019/07//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gilmour_2011_Pedi_5,JOUR,Informed consent: advising patients and parents about complementary and alternative medicine therapies,"Gilmour, Joan and Harrison, Christine and Asadi, Leyla and Cohen, Michael H. and Vohra, Sunita",Pediatrics,"Although research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies is still limited, systematic reviews have revealed sufficient evidence to conclude that CAM can be effective for certain conditions. In this article we discuss clinicians' responsibilities to inform parents/patients about CAM alternatives and use the example of acupuncture for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting remain significant adverse effects of cancer therapy, and some patients cannot find relief with standard therapies. When making decisions for a child with a life-threatening illness, parents must consider all reasonable options and decide what is in the child's best interests. A physician's failure to provide parents with relevant information regarding therapies with the prospect of therapeutic benefit impedes their ability to make an informed decision. Physicians have the ethical duty of beneficence; they must be aware of current research in pain and symptom management and other aspects of care. A physician's duty of care does not necessarily include the obligation to provide information about therapies outside the range of conventional treatment or those not yet supported in the medical literature. However, as CAM therapies such as acupuncture become better studied and their safety and efficacy are established, the scope of disclosure required may expand to include them. The legal and ethical obligation to obtain informed consent to treatment requires disclosure and discussion of therapies when there is reliable evidence of potential therapeutic benefit. At the same time, the more limited state of knowledge regarding effects of a particular therapy in the pediatric population must be factored into decision-making when treating a child.",2011,10.1542/peds.2010-2720H,128 Suppl 4,NA,192-S187,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"United States and Humans and Male and Child and Physician-Patient Relations and Canada and Parents and Liability, Legal and Ethics, Medical and Professional-Family Relations and *Complementary Therapies/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Disclosure/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Informed Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Acupuncture Therapy/ethics and Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects and Nausea/etiology/therapy and Vomiting/etiology/therapy",NA,NA,2011/11//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated the change in prescription error rates with the introduction of CPOE with and without a CDSS limited to weight-based dosing in a PICU. METHODS: In a PICU of a major tertiary-care pediatric medical center, 5000 orders were reviewed, that is, 1250 orders from each of 4 periods: period 1, before CPOE implementation; period 2, 1 year after CPOE implementation; period 3, after CDSS implementation; and period 4, after a change in prescription authorization. Prescription errors were identified and classified into: potential adverse drug events (ADEs), medication prescription errors (MPEs), and rule violations (RVs). RESULTS: We identified 273 errors (5.5%). The rate of potential ADEs decreased slightly between periods 1 and 2 (from 2.5% to 2.4%) and significantly in periods 3 and 4 (to 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively; P < .005). The rate of MPEs decreased slightly between periods 1 and 2 (from 5.5% to 5.3%), but new types of MPEs appeared. There was a significant decrease in period 3 (to 3.8%; P < .05) and a dramatically significant decrease in period 4 (to 0.7%; P < .0005). Only 3 RVs were found. Interrater agreement (kappa statistic) was 0.788 between evaluators. CONCLUSIONS: CPOE implementation decreased prescription errors only to a small extent. However, the addition of a CDSS that limits doses by weight significantly reduced prescription error rates and, most importantly, potential ADEs.

Sisk_2020_Pedi,JOUR,Communication in Pediatric Oncology: A Qualitative Study,"Sisk, Bryan A. and Friedrich, Annie and Blazin, Lindsay J. and Baker, Justin N. and Mack, Jennifer W. and DuBois, James",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND: When children are seriously ill, parents rely on communication with their clinicians. However, in previous research, researchers have not defined how this communication should function in pediatric oncology. We aimed to identify these communication functions from parental perspectives. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 78 parents of children with cancer from 3 academic medical centers at 1 of 3 time points: treatment, survivorship, or bereavement. We analyzed interview transcripts using inductive and deductive coding. RESULTS: We identified 8 distinct functions of communication in pediatric oncology. Six of these functions are similar to previous findings from adult oncology: (1) building relationships, (2) exchanging information, (3) enabling family self-management, (4) making decisions, (5) managing uncertainty, and (6) responding to emotions. We also identified 2 functions not previously described in the adult literature: (7) providing validation and (8) supporting hope. Supporting hope manifested as emphasizing the positives, avoiding false hopes, demonstrating the intent to cure, and redirecting toward hope beyond survival. Validation manifested as reinforcing ""good parenting"" beliefs, empowering parents as partners and advocates, and validating concerns. Although all functions seemed to interact, building relationships appeared to provide a relational context in which all other interpersonal communication occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Parent interviews provided evidence for 8 distinct communication functions in pediatric oncology. Clinicians can use this framework to better understand and fulfill the communication needs of parents whose children have serious illness. Future work should be focused on measuring whether clinical teams are fulfilling these functions in various settings and developing interventions targeting these functions.",2020,10.1542/peds.2020-1193,146,3,NA,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Emotions and Disclosure and Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Family and *Communication and *Pediatrics and *Medical Oncology and Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy and Empathy and Empowerment and Parents/*psychology and Professional-Family Relations and Self-Management and Bereavement and Hope and Patient Advocacy/psychology and Cancer Survivors and Parenting/psychology,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Rea_2018_Pedi,JOUR,Families' Experiences With Pediatric Family-Centered Rounds: A Systematic Review,"Rea, Kelly E. and Rao, Priyanka and Hill, Elizabeth and Saylor, Kate M. and Cousino, Melissa K.",Pediatrics,"CONTEXT: Family-centered rounding (FCR) is of increasing importance in pediatric medicine. Although researchers have begun to understand the effect of FCR on providers and systematic health care outcomes, we provide a systematic review of the literature regarding families' experiences with FCR. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review patient and family experiences with pediatric FCR. DATA SOURCES: Our data sources included PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria included publication in a peer-reviewed journal between January 2007 and February 2017, written in the English language, pediatric population (patients 0-21 years), and specific measurement of a families' experience with FCR. DATA EXRACTION: Data extracted were sample size, participating medical unit, measures of family experience, and overall results of family experience. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. It is unclear whether participation in FCR increases family satisfaction compared with standard rounds; however, families report a strong desire to participate in FCR. Family benefits of FCR included increased understanding of information and confidence in the medical team, as well as reduced parental anxiety. LIMITATIONS: There were only 2 studies in which researchers examined pediatric patients' experiences with FCR, and literature on the communication needs of non-English-speaking families was also limited. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it is suggested that families positively perceive their experience with FCR, although more research is needed to determine if satisfaction is greater in FCR versus standard rounds as well as to better understand different perspectives of adolescent patients and non-English-speaking families.",2018,10.1542/peds.2017-1883,141,3,e20171883,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Patient Care Team and Decision Making and Communication Barriers and Anxiety and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Patient Satisfaction and Pediatrics/*education and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and *Teaching Rounds",NA,NA,2018/03//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, options counseling is just one aspect of what may be one of the more challenging scenarios in the pediatric office. Pediatricians must remain alert to the possibility of pregnancy among their adolescent female patients. When discovering symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, pediatricians must obtain a relevant history, perform diagnostic testing and properly interpret the results, and understand the significance of the results from the patient perspective and reveal them to the patient in a sensitive manner. If the patient is indeed pregnant, the pediatrician, in addition to providing comprehensive options counseling, may need to help recruit adult support for the patient and should offer continued assistance to the adolescent and her family after the office visit. All pediatricians should be aware of the legal aspects of adolescent reproductive care and the resources for pregnant adolescents in their communities.

Although children account for 40% of family physicians' workload, little is known about the safety of care in the community setting. Using data from a national patient safety incident reporting system, this study aimed to characterize the pediatric safety incidents occurring in family practice. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective, cross-sectional, mixed methods study of pediatric reports submitted to the UK National Reporting and Learning System from family practice. Analysis involved detailed data coding using multiaxial frameworks, descriptive statistical analysis, and thematic analysis of a special-case sample of reports. Using frequency distributions and cross-tabulations, the relationships between incident types and contributory factors were explored. RESULTS: Of 1788 reports identified, 763 (42.7%) described harm to children. Three crosscutting priority areas were identified: medication management, assessment and referral, and treatment. The 4 incident types associated with the most harmful outcomes are errors associated with diagnosis and assessment, delivery of treatment and procedures, referrals, and medication provision. Poor referral and treatment decisions in severely unwell or vulnerable children, along with delayed diagnosis and insufficient assessment of such children, featured prominently in incidents resulting in severe harm or death. CONCLUSION: This is the first analysis of nationally collected, family practice-related pediatric safety incident reports. Recommendations to mitigate harm in these priority areas include mandatory pediatric training for all family physicians; use of electronic tools to support diagnosis, management, and referral decision-making; and use of technological adjuncts such as barcode scanning to reduce medication errors.",2015,10.1542/peds.2014-3259,135,6,1027-1035,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Humans and Child and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and United Kingdom and *Primary Health Care and *Patient Safety and Medical Errors/*statistics & numerical data and *Family Practice and *Office Visits,NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Miljeteig_2009_Pedi,JOUR,Impact of ethics and economics on end-of-life decisions in an Indian neonatal unit,"Miljeteig, Ingrid and Sayeed, Sadath Ali and Jesani, Amar and Johansson, Kjell Arne and Norheim, Ole Frithjof",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to describe how providers in an Indian NICU reach life-or-death treatment decisions. METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews, field observations, and document analysis were conducted at an Indian nonprofit private tertiary institution that provided advanced neonatal care under conditions of resource scarcity. RESULTS: Compared with American and European units with similar technical capabilities, the unit studied maintained a much higher threshold for treatment initiation and continuation (range: 28-32 completed gestational weeks). We observed that complex, interrelated socioeconomic reasons influenced specific treatment decisions. Providers desired to protect families and avoid a broad range of perceived harms: they were reluctant to risk outcomes with chronic disability; they openly factored scarcity of institutional resources; they were sensitive to local, culturally entrenched intrafamilial dynamics; they placed higher regard for ""precious"" infants; and they felt relatively powerless to prevent gender discrimination. Formal or regulatory guidelines were either lacking or not controlling. CONCLUSIONS: In a tertiary-level academic Indian NICU, multiple factors external to predicted clinical survival of a preterm newborn influence treatment decisions. Providers adjust their decisions about withdrawing or withholding treatment on the basis of pragmatic considerations. Numerous issues related to resource scarcity are relevant, and providers prioritize outcomes that affect stakeholders other than the newborn.

STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients aged <18 years (n = 1000) undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were enrolled prospectively. Biopsy specimens were obtained from IPs and the proximal and distal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII-pH) was performed in all symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors for 8 weeks, and IP ablation by argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed in unresponsive patients. RESULTS: The endoscopic incidence of IP was 6.3%, with a cumulative missing rate of 5.8%. Thirty-five of the 63 patients (56%) were asymptomatic, 11 (17%) had symptoms clearly related to the underlying digestive disorder, and 17 (27%) had chronic IP-related symptoms. MII-pH was positive in 10 of the 28 symptomatic patients. All 17 patients with IP-related symptoms were unresponsive to proton pump inhibitors and were treated with APC, and all had achieved complete remission by the 3-year follow-up. Patients with underlying disorders were successfully treated with medical therapy, and asymptomatic patients remained symptom-free, with no endoscopic or histological changes seen at the 3-year follow-up.

Jr",The Journal of pediatrics,"OBJECTIVES: To determine independent predictors of gluten avoidance and of a physician's decision to initiate a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents without confirmed celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a structured medical record review of 579 patients aged 1-19 years presenting for evaluation of celiac disease between January 2000 and December 2010 at a large Boston teaching hospital. We collected data including demographic information, medical history, serology, small intestinal biopsy, history of gluten avoidance, and the postworkup recommendation of implementation of a GFD. Predictors of gluten-related issues were identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 579 children without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease (mean age, 8.7 years), 43 (7.4%) had ever avoided gluten. Independent predictors of gluten avoidance were irritability or poor temper (OR, 3.2), diarrhea (OR, 2.5), weight issues (OR, 0.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 5.3), and family history of celiac disease (OR, 2.2). Among 143 children without confirmed celiac disease who underwent diagnostic evaluation, several predictive factors were associated with a physician- recommended/parent-initiated GFD: irritability (OR, 6.4), diarrhea (OR, 3.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 7.9), and positive serology before the referral (OR, 4.3). CONCLUSION: Gluten avoidance among children and adolescents without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease is relatively common. The identified predictors suggest that gluten avoidance is associated with nonspecific behavioral and gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived dietary responses in another family member thought to have celiac disease.",2012,10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.02.049,161,3,471-475,eng,1097-6833 0022-3476,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Logistic Models and Decision Making and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Feeding Behavior and *Diet, Gluten-Free and Celiac Disease/*diet therapy",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,J Pediatr,NA,NA,NA,NA

By using latent class analysis, we identified 4 attitudinal groups with similar patterns of prioritization: ""fetocentric"" (n = 232), risk-sensitive (n = 197), maternal autonomy (n = 167), and family impact and social support (n = 64). Neonatologists were more likely to be in the fetocentric group, whereas surgeons were more likely to be in the risk-sensitive group, and maternal-fetal medicine physicians made up the largest percentage of the family impact and social support group. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians vary in how they weigh the importance of social and ethical considerations regarding maternal-fetal surgery.

Low.Kapalu_2020_Pedi,JOUR,Preventing Self-Harm From Repeat Foreign-Body Ingestion,"Low Kapalu, Christina and Lantos, John and Booser, Adam and Thomson, Mike and Attard, Thomas",Pediatrics,"Mental health disorders in adolescents present some of the most challenging of all ethical dilemmas. This is particularly true when they lead to self-injurious behavior that can only be prevented by either limiting the freedom of the adolescent or forcing treatments on them that they do not want. Intentional and repeated foreign-body ingestion (FBI) in youth is a poorly understood self-injurious behavior that can be life-threatening. It poses unique clinical and ethical challenges. Ingestion of sharp or magnetic objects increases the need for endoscopic retrieval or surgical intervention with associated risks, including perforation and anesthesia-related adverse events. When behavior modification efforts fail to prevent recurrent FBI, the cumulative risk of medical intervention mounts. Sometimes, as a last resort, doctors consider surgical procedures that limit jaw movement and may physically prevent recurrent FBI. In this Ethics Rounds article, we present a case in which doctors consider whether it is in the best interest of a teenager with this behavior to undergo orthodontic jaw wiring as a next step in treatment of repeated FBI.

To reduce the number of low-value interruptive DDI alerts at our hospital, we implemented an iterative, multidimensional quality improvement effort, which included an interdisciplinary advisory group, alert metrics, and measurement of perceived clinical value. METHODS: Alert data analysis indicated that DDIs were the most common interruptive medication alert. An interdisciplinary alert advisory group was formed to provide expert advice and oversight for alert refinement and ongoing review of alert data. Alert data were categorized into drug classes and analyzed to identify DDI alerts for refinement. Refinement strategies included alert suppression and modification of alerts to be contextually aware. RESULTS: On the basis of historical analysis of classified DDI alerts, 26 alert refinements were implemented, representing 47% of all alerts. Alert refinement efforts resulted in the following substantial decreases in the number of interruptive DDI alerts: 40% for all clinicians (22.9-14 per 100 orders) and as high as 82% for attending physicians (6.5-1.2 per 100 orders). Two patient safety events related to alert refinements were reported during the project period. CONCLUSIONS: Our quality improvement effort refined 47% of all DDI alerts that were firing during historical analysis, significantly reduced the number of DDI alerts in a 54-week period, and established a model for sustained alert refinements.",2019,10.1542/peds.2017-4111,143,3,NA,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Medication Errors/*prevention & control and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/standards/trends and Drug Interactions/*physiology and Hospitals, Pediatric/*standards/trends and Medical Order Entry Systems/*standards/trends and Medication Systems, Hospital/*standards/trends and Reminder Systems/standards/trends",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Menachemi_2009_Pedi,JOUR,Use of health information technology by children's hospitals in the United States,"Menachemi, Nir and Brooks, Robert G. and Schwalenstocker, Ellen and Simpson, Lisa",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the adoption of health information technology by children's hospitals and to document barriers and priorities as they relate to health information technology adoption. METHODS: Primary data of interest were obtained through the use of a survey instrument distributed to the chief information officers of 199 children's hospitals in the United States. Data were collected on current and future use of a variety of clinical health information technology and telemedicine applications, organizational priorities, barriers to use of health information technology, and hospital and chief information officer characteristics. RESULTS: Among the 109 responding hospitals (55%), common clinical applications included clinical scheduling (86.2%), transcription (85.3%), and pharmacy (81.9%) and laboratory (80.7%) information. Electronic health records (48.6%), computerized order entry (40.4%), and clinical decision support systems (35.8%) were less common. The most common barriers to health information technology adoption were vendors' inability to deliver products or services to satisfaction (85.4%), lack of staffing resources (82.3%), and difficulty in achieving end-user acceptance (80.2%). The most frequent priority for hospitals was to implement technology to reduce medical errors or to promote safety (72.5%).

Jr and Skinner, Debra and Davis, Arlene M. and Whitmarsh, Ian and Powell, Cynthia",Pediatrics,"Technology will make it possible to screen for fragile X syndrome and other conditions that do not meet current guidelines for routine newborn screening. This possibility evokes at least 8 broad ethical, legal, and social concerns: (1) early identification of fragile X syndrome, an ""untreatable"" condition, could lead to heightened anxiety about parenting, oversensitivity to development, alterations in parenting, or disrupted bonding; (2) because fragile X syndrome screening should be voluntary, informed consent could overwhelm parents with information, significantly burden hospitals, and reduce participation in the core screening program; (3) screening will identify some children who are or appear to be phenotypically normal; (4) screening might identify children with other conditions not originally targeted for screening; (5) screening could overwhelm an already limited capacity for genetic counseling and comprehensive care; (6) screening for fragile X syndrome, especially if carrier status is disclosed, increases the likelihood of negative self-concept, societal stigmatization, and insurance or employment discrimination; (7) screening will suggest risk in extended family members, raising ethical and legal issues (because they never consented to screening) and creating a communication burden for parents or expanding the scope of physician responsibility; and (8) screening for fragile X syndrome could heighten discrepancies in how men and women experience genetic risk or decide about testing. To address these concerns we recommend a national newborn screening research network; the development of models for informed decision-making; materials and approaches for helping families understand genetic information and communicating it to others; a national forum to address carrier testing and the disclosure of secondary or incidental findings; and public engagement of scientists, policy makers, ethicists, practitioners, and other citizens to discuss the desired aims of newborn screening and the characteristics of a system needed to achieve those aims.",2008,10.1542/peds.2007-0820,121,3,704-e693,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Infant, Newborn and Social Change and Ethics, Medical and Informed Consent/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Cystic Fibrosis/diagnosis and Fragile X Syndrome/*diagnosis and Genetic Testing/*standards/trends and Neonatal Screening/*standards/trends",NA,NA,2008/03//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 11 parents whose infants had undergone withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in the NICU at McMaster University Medical Centre to obtain their views on helpful practices. Interviews continued until no new items were obtained (ie, saturation point). A total of 370 items were distilled into 82 questionnaire statements on care by a multidisciplinary team and grouped for analysis into 6 domains: communication, quality of care, quality of life, shared decision-making, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment process, and bereavement care. Respondents were asked to rank how frequently events occurred on a 7-point Likert scale anchored from 1 = never to 7 = always. A score of >5 was considered favorable. The questionnaire was distributed to a pretest sample of perinatal social workers who attended a bereavement workshop at an international conference. RESULTS: The response rate was 48%. Respondents ranked items that pertained to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment process highest, indicating that items were done well. Items related to quality of care and bereavement care ranked lowest. Other domains ranked as follows: communication, shared decision-making, and quality of life. Consistency of items within domains was tested by Cronbach's alpha and split-half testing and were >0.6 for most domains. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' views on important aspects of end-of-life care in the NICU were incorporated into a quality assurance questionnaire.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of parents and caregivers of children who have chronic illness. During ambulatory medical visits, participants were asked about previous AD experience and knowledge, future preferences regarding AD discussions, their child's past and current health status, and family demographics. RESULTS: Among 307 participants surveyed, previous AD experience was low, with 117 (38.1%) having heard of an AD, 54 (17.6%) having discussed one, and 77 (25.1%) having known someone who had an AD. Furthermore, 27 (8.8%) participants had an AD or living will of their own, and 8 (2.6%) reported that their chronically ill child had an AD. Previous AD knowledge was significantly more likely among parents and caregivers who had a college degree than those who did not have a high school diploma, yet significantly less likely among primarily Spanish-speaking parents and caregivers than those primarily English-speaking. Interest in creating an AD for the child was reported by 151 (49.2%) participants, and was significantly more likely among families who had more frequent emergency department visits over the previous year.

Although there is increasing acceptance of out-of-hospital termination of resuscitation for adult traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest when there is no expectation of a good outcome, children are routinely excluded from state termination-of-resuscitation protocols. The decision to withhold resuscitative efforts in a child under specific circumstances (decapitation or dependent lividity, rigor mortis, etc) is reasonable. If there is any doubt as to the circumstances or timing of the traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest, under the current status of limiting termination of resuscitation in the field to persons older than 18 years in most states, resuscitation should be initiated and continued until arrival to the appropriate facility. If the patient has arrested, resuscitation has already exceeded 30 minutes, and the nearest facility is more than 30 minutes away, involvement of parents and family of these children in the decision-making process with assistance and guidance from medical professionals should be considered as part of an emphasis on family-centered care because the evidence suggests that either death or a poor outcome is inevitable.",2014,10.1542/peds.2014-0176,133,4,1116-e1104,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Child and children and emergency medical services and adolescent and outcome and *Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and survival and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and *Withholding Treatment and advanced life support and basic life support and blunt trauma and cardiorespiratory arrest and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and out-of-hospital termination of resuscitation and resuscitative thoracotomy and traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/etiology/*therapy and Thoracic Injuries/complications and Wounds, Nonpenetrating/complications",NA,NA,2014/04//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This evaluation of study data seeks (1) to identify factors clinicians weighed when deciding whether to report injuries they suspected might have been caused by child abuse; (2) to describe clinicians' management strategies for children with injuries from suspected child abuse that were not reported; and (3) to describe how clinicians explained not reporting high-suspicion injuries. METHODS: From the 434 pediatric primary care clinicians who participated in the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study and who indicated they had provided care for a child with an injury they perceived as suspicious, a subsample of 75 of 81 clinicians completed a telephone interview. Interviewees included 36 clinicians who suspected child abuse but did not report the injury to child protective services (12 with high suspicion and 24 with some suspicion) and 39 who reported the suspicious injury. Interviews were analyzed for major themes and subthemes, including decision-making regarding reporting of suspected physical child abuse to child protective services and alternative management strategies. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged regarding the clinicians' reporting decisions, that is, familiarity with the family, reference to elements of the case history, use of available resources, and perception of expected outcomes of reporting to child protective services. When they did not report, clinicians planned alternative management strategies, including active or informal case follow-up management. When interviewed, some clinicians modified their original opinion that an injury was likely or very likely caused by abuse, to explain why they did not report to child protective services.

States who participate in the pilot program commit to review all SUID cases in their state by using their multidisciplinary state and local child death review teams. These teams request and review data from death scene investigators, medical examiners and coroners, law enforcement, social services, pediatric and obstetric providers, and public health per usual, but as part of the pilot program, supplement their SUID case reviews by discussing additional medical, environmental, and behavioral factors, and entering this data using the NCCDR Web-based Case Reporting System.

METHODS: Conceptual model, informed by literature review. RESULTS: To optimize learning across QI studies requires the integration of small-scale theories (middle-range theories, theories of change) within the context of larger unifying theories. We propose that health care QI research would benefit from a theory that describes the operations of health care delivery, including the multiplicity of roles that interpersonal interactions play. The broadest constructs of the model are entry into the system, and assessment and management of the patient, with the subordinate operations of access; recognition, assessment, and diagnosis; and medical decision-making (developing a plan), coordination of care, execution of care, referral and reassessment, respectively. Interpersonal aspects of care recognize the patient/caregiver as a source of information, an individual in a cultural context, a complex human being, and a partner in their care. Impacts to any and all of these roles may impact the quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: Such a theory can promote opportunities for moving the field forward and organizing the planning and interpretation of comparable studies.

Using the framework developed by Buchanan and Brock for surrogate decision-making, I examine what role the adolescent should morally play when deciding about therapy for life-threatening conditions. I argue that the greater the efficacy of treatment, the less voice the adolescent (and the parent) should have. I then consider how refusals of highly effective transplant cases are similar to and different from refusals of other lifesaving therapies (eg, chemotherapy for leukemia), which is more commonly discussed in the media and medical literature. I examine whether organ scarcity and the need for lifelong immunosuppression justify differences in whether the state intervenes when an adolescent and his or her parents refuse a transplant. I argue that the state, as parens patriae, has an obligation to provide the social supports needed for a successful transplant and follow-up treatment plan, although family refusals may be permissible when the transplant is experimental or of low efficacy because of comorbidities or other factors.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed for a nationally representative sample of US parents from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy. Parent performance on 13 child health-related tasks was assessed by simple weighted analyses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to describe factors associated with low parent health literacy and to explore the relationship between health literacy and self-reported child health insurance status, difficulty understanding over-the-counter medication labeling, and use of food labels. RESULTS: More than 6100 parents made up the sample (representing 72600098 US parents); 28.7% of the parents had below-basic/basic health literacy, 68.4% were unable to enter names and birth dates correctly on a health insurance form, 65.9% were unable to calculate the annual cost of a health insurance policy on the basis of family size, and 46.4% were unable to perform at least 1 of 2 medication-related tasks. Parents with below-basic health literacy were more likely to have a child without health insurance in their household (adjusted odds ratio: 2.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.1-4.9]) compared with parents with proficient health literacy. Parents with below-basic health literacy had 3.4 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 1.6-7.4) of reporting difficulty understanding over-the-counter medication labels. Parent health literacy was associated with nutrition label use in unadjusted analyses but did not retain significance in multivariate analyses. Health literacy accounted for some of the effect of education, racial/ethnic, immigrant-status, linguistic, and income-related disparities. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of US parents have limited health-literacy skills. Decreasing literacy demands on parents, including simplification of health insurance and other medical forms, as well as medication and food labels, is needed to decrease health care access barriers for children and allow for informed parent decision-making.

Lieu_2015_Pedi,JOUR,Geographic clusters in underimmunization and vaccine refusal,"Lieu, Tracy A. and Ray, G. Thomas and Klein, Nicola P. and Chung, Cindy and Kulldorff, Martin",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parental refusal and delay of childhood vaccines has increased in recent years and is believed to cluster in some communities. Such clusters could pose public health risks and barriers to achieving immunization quality benchmarks. Our aims were to (1) describe geographic clusters of underimmunization and vaccine refusal, (2) compare clusters of underimmunization with different vaccines, and (3) evaluate whether vaccine refusal clusters may pose barriers to achieving high immunization rates. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health records among children born between 2000 and 2011 with membership in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The study population included 154,424 children in 13 counties with continuous membership from birth to 36 months of age. We used spatial scan statistics to identify clusters of underimmunization (having missed 1 or more vaccines by 36 months of age) and vaccine refusal (based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes). RESULTS: We identified 5 statistically significant clusters of underimmunization among children who turned 36 months old during 2010-2012. The underimmunization rate within clusters ranged from 18% to 23%, and the rate outside them was 11%. Children in the most statistically significant cluster had 1.58 (P < .001) times the rate of underimmunization as others. Underimmunization with measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccines clustered in similar geographic areas. Vaccine refusal also clustered, with rates of 5.5% to 13.5% within clusters, compared with 2.6% outside them. CONCLUSIONS: Underimmunization and vaccine refusal cluster geographically.

O.Connell_2007_Pedi,JOUR,Family presence during pediatric trauma team activation: an assessment of a structured program,"O'Connell, Karen J. and Farah, Mirna M. and Spandorfer, Philip and Zorc, Joseph J.",Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: When a child presents to a trauma center with a serious injury, family members are often excluded from the initial trauma team evaluation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a structured program of family presence during pediatric trauma team activations by measuring (1) the need for termination of family presence, (2) times to completion of key parts of the trauma evaluation, and (3) the opinions of staff surveyed immediately after conclusion of family presence. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that combined prospectively obtained data and surveys from trauma team evaluations in which family presence occurred, with retrospective chart review of all trauma activations during an 18-month study period. The study was conducted at a level 1 pediatric trauma center with a preestablished family presence program that assigns a staff member to screen family members for family presence, provide support, and record events. Times to completion of key components of the trauma evaluation were calculated and compared for cases with and without family presence. Cross-sectional surveys were performed immediately after each trauma team evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 197 family members participated in family presence. There were no cases of interference with medical care by family members. Seven family members were asked to leave the trauma area by staff after initiation of family presence for various reasons. Times to completion of key components of the trauma evaluation did not differ significantly between enrolled patients with family presence and those without family presence. Surveys were completed for 136 cases, and the majority of providers reported that family presence either had no effect on or improved medical decision-making (97%), institution of patient care (94%), communication among providers (92%), and communication with family members (98%). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study suggests that there is an overall low prevalence of negative outcomes associated with family presence during pediatric trauma team evaluation after implementation of a structured family presence program.

STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study (July 2011-June 2016) of febrile infants <e2><89><a4>60 days of age with pathogenic bacterial growth in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Subjects were identified by query of local microbiology laboratory and/or electronic medical record systems, and clinical data were extracted by medical record review. Mixed-effect logistic regression was employed to determine clinical factors associated with 30-day adverse outcomes, which were defined as death, neurologic sequelae, mechanical ventilation, or vasoactive medication receipt. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty infants met inclusion criteria; 279 (79.7%) with bacteremia without meningitis and 71 (20.3%) with bacterial meningitis. Forty-two (12.0%) infants had a 30-day adverse outcome: 29 of 71 (40.8%) with bacterial meningitis vs 13 of 279 (4.7%) with bacteremia without meningitis (36.2% difference, 95% CI 25.1%-48.0%; P < .001).

STUDY DESIGN: This observational cohort study at 6 pediatric emergency department and urgent care sites used a training dataset (5 sites, April 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016), a temporal test set (5 sites, January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018), and a geographic test set (a sixth site, April 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018). Patients 60 days to 18 years of age in whom clinicians suspected sepsis were included; patients with septic shock on arrival were excluded. The outcome, septic shock, was systolic hypotension with vasoactive medication or <e2><89><a5>30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid within 24 hours of arrival. Elastic net regularization, a penalized regression technique, was used to develop a model in the training set. RESULTS: Of 2464 included visits, septic shock occurred in 282 (11.4%). The model had an area under the curve of 0.79 (0.76-0.83) in the training set, 0.75 (0.69-0.81) in the temporal test set, and 0.87 (0.73-1.00) in the geographic test set.

Rapid genomic testing in the NICU is expected to be genomic medicine's ""critical application,"" providing such clear benefits that it drives the adoption of genomics more broadly. Studies from multiple centers worldwide have now demonstrated the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of rapid genomic sequencing in this setting, paving the way for widespread implementation. However, the introduction of this potentially powerful tool for predicting future impairment in the NICU also raises profound ethical challenges. Developing models of good practice that incorporate the identification, exploration, and analysis of ethical issues will be critical for successful implementation. In this article, we analyze 3 such issues: (1) the value and meaning of gaining consent to a complex test in a stressful, emotionally charged environment; (2) the effect of rapid diagnosis on parent-child bonding and its implications for medical and family decisions, particularly in relation to treatment limitation; and (3) distributive justice (ie, whether the substantial cost and diversion of resources to deliver rapid genomic testing in the NICU can be justified).",2019,10.1542/peds.2018-1099D,143,Suppl 1,S14-S21,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Parents and Infant, Newborn and Parent-Child Relations and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal and *Object Attachment and Genomics/ethics and Bioethical Issues and Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Parental Consent/*ethics and Health Care Rationing/economics/*ethics and Resource Allocation/economics/ethics and Intensive Care, Neonatal/economics/*ethics and Whole Genome Sequencing/economics/*ethics/methods",NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 3664 clinical encounters were examined. Random-effects longitudinal models with time-related covariates were used to estimate the effect of HC therapy on linear growth. RESULTS: The predicted AH z-score (-0.7) was similar between the sexes and among CAH subtypes. The mean growth period HC dose was 18.9 <c2><b1> 5.6 mg/m(2)/day. In the final regression model, HC dose was negatively associated with predicted AH, with each mg/m(2)/day increase in average growth period HC dose predicting a 0.37-cm decrease in AH (P < .004).

METHODS: Parents referred to neonatology for prenatal consultation after the diagnosis of a congenital anomaly. Completed 2 qualitative interviews: the first within 1 week of the consultation and the second 1 week after delivery. Interviews were analyzed for themes by using the constant comparative method associated with the grounded theory method. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was achieved after 42 interviews (22 women); only mothers participated. Five main themes emerged: (1) preparation; (2) knowledgeable physician; (3) caring providers; (4) allowing hope; and (5) time. Mothers believed that a consultation with a neonatologist helped them prepare for the perinatal course. They wished to know the management plan and all possible outcomes. Mothers wanted information specific to their situation and tailored to their knowledge base. Receiving conflicting information from physicians increased anxiety and eroded confidence. Seeing the NICU during the consultation was emotionally difficult but valuable. Mothers wanted realistic information, regardless of how grim, yet wanted to retain hope. All mothers would recommend a prenatal consultation with a neonatologist.

Rosenbaum_2009_Pedi,JOUR,Health information law in the context of minors,"Rosenbaum, Sara and Abramson, Susan and MacTaggart, Patricia",Pediatrics,"This article presents a legal overview of privacy and autonomy considerations related to children in the context of health information technology adoption and use. All uses of health-related technologies take place within a legal framework that guides health care generally; the privacy laws and autonomy principles long predate health information technology and can be expected to shape its design and use. Furthermore, it is a legal tenet that technology advances shape the law, and this can be expected as health information technology use evolves. Most laws related to health care, medical practice, and the right to privacy are state-based and subject to high variability. As the health information revolution increasingly eliminates the importance of geographic boundaries to health care, interstate tensions can be expected to grow. Health information privacy law is even more complex in the case of children, because the relationship between privacy law and children is itself complex. The law considers minor children to be deserving of special protection against harm and risk exposure, and this concern extends to privacy. Regardless of whether minors can shield health information from parents, it is clear that parents and children have the power to control the flow of information to and among entities. Although information protections may pose a higher standard where information about children is concerned, this fact should not overshadow the extent to which information can be used under existing legal principles. Over time, as the security and safety of information sharing are established, the law may yet evolve to permit a freer flow of information.",2009,10.1542/peds.2008-1755M,123 Suppl 2,NA,121-S116,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,Public Health and United States and Humans and Child and Decision Making and Parents and Minors/legislation & jurisprudence and Informed Consent/legislation & jurisprudence and Consumer Health Information/*legislation & jurisprudence and Child Health Services/*legislation & jurisprudence and Confidentiality/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2009/01//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study surveying providers regarding their rationale, interpretation, resultant change, and confidence in their management before and after obtaining KUBs in patients seen for suspected constipation. Demographics and clinical findings were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: A total of 24 providers were surveyed after 72 patient encounters. Reasons for obtaining an abdominal radiograph included evaluation of stool burden (70%), need for a clean out (35%), fecal impaction (27%), cause of abdominal pain (24%), demonstration of stool burden to families (14%), assessment of response to therapy (13%), or encopresis (10%). The plan was changed in 47.6% of cases based on radiographic findings. In cases in which a plan was outlined before obtaining the radiograph (69%), the initial plan was implemented on average in 52.5%.

Quality communication is represented by widespread documentation of prognostic, goals-of-care conversations (PGOCC) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and should occur without variation by patient characteristics. METHODS: Cohort included 645 PICU admissions in the top decile of risk of mortality on admission over six years. Electronic medical records were used to determine PGOCC, diagnosis on admission and complex chronic condition (CCC) status. Multivariate logistic regression and time-to-event analyses were used. RESULTS: Overall, 31% had a documented PGOCC. 51% had CCC status. 11% had an oncologic, 13% had a cardiovascular diagnosis on admission. 94% of patients who died in the PICU had PGOCC documented, but among the 200 patients with documented PGOCC, 78% did not die in the PICU. Oncologic diagnosis on admission was associated with a higher likelihood of PGOCC compared to non-CCC patients (ARR=1.86; SE=0.26) whereas no other diagnosis category reached the level of statistical significance. Median time from admission to PGOCC was 2 days. Age, gender and CCC status were not associated with whether a PGOCC was documented or with time from admission to PGOCC documentation. 45% of PGOCC in the cohort and 50% of conversations in patients with CCC were documented by PICU physicians.

METHODS: This study analyzed data from the National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs. Two alternative definitions of underinsurance, designated attitudinal and economic, were investigated. Logistic regression models in which the response variables were the child's status for each of the target core outcomes and underinsurance status was a dichotomous predictor variable were created. In addition to underinsurance status, 10 other predictor variables were included in the model. RESULTS: Underinsurance is associated with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau core outcomes for children with special health care needs related to satisfaction with care and partnering with families in decision-making, access to a medical home, community-based service delivery that is easy to use, and access to services to make transitions to adulthood. In each case, children with special health care needs who were underinsured had significantly poorer outcomes than did children who were adequately insured. CONCLUSIONS: Although these results cannot clarify the cause of poorer outcomes, there are clear negative effects associated with the problem of underinsurance.

In classic infantile-onset Pompe disease, ERT should start as soon as possible. Once started, regular, routine follow-up is necessary to monitor for treatment effects, disease progression, and adverse effects. Decision-making for when or if to start ERT in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is more challenging because patients typically have no measurable signs or symptoms or predictable time of symptom onset at NBS. With LOPD, adequate, ongoing follow-up and assessments for onset or progression of signs and symptoms are important to track disease state and monitor and adjust care before and after treatment is started. Because numerous tests are used to monitor patients at variable frequencies, a standardized approach across centers is lacking. Significant variability in patient assessments may result in missed opportunities for early intervention. Management of Pompe disease requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach with timely disease-specific interventions that target the underlying disease process and symptom-specific manifestations. Regardless of how identified, all patients who have signs or symptoms of the disease require coordinated medical care and follow-up tailored to individual needs throughout their lives.

Collaborative improvement networks can serve as large-scale, health system laboratories to engage clinicians, researchers, patients, and parents in testing approaches to translate research into practice. Improvement networks are of particular importance for pediatric T2 and T3 research, as evidence to establish safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions in children is often lacking. Networks for improvement and research are also consistent with the Institute of Medicine's Learning Healthcare Systems model in which learning networks provide a system for improving care and outcomes and generate new knowledge in near real-time. Creation of total population registries in collaborative network sites provides large, representative study samples with high-quality data that can be used to generate evidence and to inform clinical decision-making. Networks use collaboration, data, and quality-improvement methods to standardize practice. Therefore, variation in outcomes due to unreliable and unnecessary care delivery is reduced, increasing statistical power, and allowing a consistent baseline from which to test new strategies. In addition, collaborative networks for improvement and research offer the opportunity to not only make improvements but also to study improvements to determine which interventions and combination of strategies work best in what settings.",2013,10.1542/peds.2012-3786H,131 Suppl 4,NA,214-S210,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"United States and Humans and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Community Participation and Certification and quality improvement and Societies, Medical and Registries and Patient-Centered Care/organization & administration and Quality Improvement/*organization & administration and *Cooperative Behavior and *Interdisciplinary Communication and Community Networks/*organization & administration and Chronic Disease/therapy and Professional-Family Relations and Hospitals, Pediatric/organization & administration and Translational Research, Biomedical/*organization & administration and *Child Welfare and Health Services Research/*organization & administration and Evidence-Based Medicine/organization & administration and Learning Healthcare System and Learning Networks and Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/organization & administration and Parents/education and Pediatrics/education/*organization & administration and Rapid Learning Networks",NA,NA,2013/06//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Willems_2014_Pedi,JOUR,Infants' best interests in end-of-life care for newborns,"Willems, Dick L. and Verhagen, A. A. Eduard and van Wijlick, Eric",Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric bioethics presumes that decisions should be taken in the child's best interest. If it's ambiguous whether a decision is in the child's interest, we defer to parents. Should parents be permitted to consider their own interests in making decisions for their child? In the Netherlands, where neonatal euthanasia is legal, such questions sometimes arise in deciding whether to hasten the death of a critically ill, suffering child. We describe the recommendations of a national Dutch committee. Our objectives were to analyze the role of competing child and family interests and to provide guidance on end-of-life decisions for doctors caring for severely ill newborns. METHODS: We undertook literature review, 7 consensus meetings in a multidisciplinary expert commission, and invited comments on draft report by specialists' associations. RESULTS: Initial treatment is mandatory for most ill newborns, to clarify the prognosis. Continuation of treatment is conditional on further diagnostic and prognostic data. Muscle relaxants can sometimes be continued after withdrawal of artificial respiration without aiming to shorten the child's life. When gasping causes suffering, or protracted dying is unbearable for the parents, muscle relaxants may be used to end a newborn's life. Whenever muscle relaxants are used, cases should be reported to the national review committee. CONCLUSIONS: New national recommendations in the Netherlands for end-of-life decisions in newborns suggest that treatment should generally be seen as conditional. If treatment fails, it should be abandoned. In those cases, palliative care should be directed at both infant and parental suffering. Sometimes, this may permit interventions that hasten death.",2014,10.1542/peds.2014-0780,134,4,1168-e1163,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Male and Infant, Newborn and *Decision Making and Netherlands/epidemiology and end-of-life decisions and palliative care and Withholding Treatment/*standards and neonatal intensive care and Terminal Care/methods/*standards and Hospice Care/methods/standards and Palliative Care/methods/standards and *Consensus Development Conferences as Topic and clinical bioethics and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/standards",NA,NA,2014/10//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study using the 2013-2014 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatrics, which prospectively collected data at 56 and 64 hospitals in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Primary exposure was CHD. Primary outcome was overall in-hospital postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 30-day morbidity (any nondeath adverse event). Among 34?543 children who underwent laparoscopic surgery, 1349, 1106, and 266 had minor, major, and severe CHD, respectively. After propensity score matching within each stratum of CHD severity, morbidity and mortality were compared between children with and without CHD. RESULTS: Children with severe CHD had higher overall mortality and 30-day morbidity (OR 12.31, 95% CI 1.59-95.01; OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.57-4.01, respectively), compared with matched controls. Overall mortality and 30-day morbidity were also higher among children with major CHD compared with children without CHD (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.49-8.06; OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65-2.61, respectively). Children with minor CHD had similar mortality outcomes, but had higher 30-day morbidity compared with children without CHD (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.37-2.13).

METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with parents/guardians accompanying their vaccine-eligible 11- to 17-year-old daughters to medical visits. Interviews were conducted in 1 public clinic and 3 private practice settings to ascertain why girls did or did not receive HPV vaccination. Questions probed vaccine decision-making from the point of view of parents/guardians and providers. RESULTS: A total of 124 parents/guardians and 37 providers participated. The most common reasons parents reported for not vaccinating their daughters was the lack of a physician recommendation (44%). Both parents and providers believed that HPV vaccination provided important health benefits, but the timing of vaccination with relation to sexual activity was an important theme related to vaccine delay. Providers with lower self-reported vaccination rates delayed vaccine recommendations in girls perceived to be at low risk for sexual activity, and several parents reported that their providers suggested or supported delaying vaccination until their daughters were older. However, parents/guardians and providers agreed that predicting the timing of sexual debut was extremely difficult. In contrast, providers with high vaccination rates presented HPV vaccination as a routine vaccine with proven safety to prevent cancer, and parents responded positively to these messages. CONCLUSIONS: Although most parents and providers believe that HPV vaccination is important, missed opportunities result from assumptions about the timing of vaccination relative to sexual activity. Routinely recommending HPV vaccination as cancer prevention to be coadministered with other vaccines at age 11 years can improve vaccination rates.",2014,10.1542/peds.2014-0442,134,3,674-e666,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Aged and qualitative methods and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Qualitative Research and *Parent-Child Relations and HPV vaccination and Papillomavirus Vaccines/*therapeutic use and Sexual Behavior/psychology and *Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology and missed opportunities and parental attitudes and provider attitudes and Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control/psychology and Vaccination/psychology/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2014/09//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted of neuroimaging rates for 725 children and adolescents who were aged 3 to 18 years with nonacute headache and normal neurologic examination and were evaluated in a single pediatric neurology clinic during study years 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004. Following recommendations of current practice parameters, patients with conditions that justify consideration for neuroimaging (eg, progressive headache, abnormal neurologic examination) were excluded from this analysis. We recorded the origin of any neuroimaging request at the time of the clinic visit and any abnormal neuroimaging findings that led to major clinical consequences. RESULTS: Overall, the mean rate of neuroimaging for patients with nonacute headache was 45%. Use rates remained steady during the 13-year study period (range: 41%-47%). The majority of neuroimaging studies were ordered originally by primary care providers. The proportion of neuroimaging studies that were ordered by primary care providers increased significantly from 1992 to 2004. CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of patients who had nonacute pediatric headache and were referred to a child neurology clinic, neuroimaging-use rates remained stable during the past decade. An increasing proportion of neuroimaging studies are ordered by primary care providers. The influence of evidence-based medicine on medical decision-making may be partly responsible for curbing increases in neuroimaging overuse.

M.",The Journal of pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into health and related costs associated with very preterm births, one needs accurate information about the prevalence of the disabling conditions, including neonatal hearing loss (NHL). STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the prevalence of NHL by week of gestation and categories of birth weight in very preterm neonates. Results of the 2-stage Automated Auditory Brainstem Response nationwide Newborn Hearing Screening Program in Dutch Neonatal Intensive Care Units and diagnostic examinations were centrally registered between October 1998 and December 2012 and included in this study. NHL was defined as impaired when the neonate conventional Auditory Brainstem Response level exceeded 35 dB near Hearing Level at diagnostic examination. Birth weight was stratified into <750 g, 750-999 g, 1000-1249 g, 1250-1499 g, and <e2><89><a5> 1500 g, and by small for gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile) vs appropriate for gestational age. Logistic regression analyses and recursive partitioning were performed. RESULTS: In total, 18,564 very preterm neonates were eligible. The prevalence of NHL consistently increased with decreasing week of gestation (1.2%-7.5% from 31 to 24 weeks) and decreasing birth weight (1.4%-4.8% from <e2><89><a5> 1500 g to <750 g, all P < .002). Most vulnerable to NHL were girls <28 weeks, boys <30 weeks, and SGA neonates. The SGA effect started at 27 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age and birth weight quantify the risk of NHL.

AST combines weekly use of the Asthma Control Test with a color-coded graph for visual trending. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of children age 2 to 18 years admitted for asthma. Parents or children (n = 210) completed baseline AST assessments during hospitalization, then over 6 months after discharge. Concurrent with the first 5 AST assessments, the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was administered for comparison. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) was moderate, with a small longitudinal variation of AST measurements within subjects during follow-ups. Internal consistency was strong at baseline (Cronbach's <ce><b1> 0.70) and during follow-ups (Cronbach's <ce><b1> 0.82-0.90). Criterion validity demonstrated a significant correlation between AST and ACQ scores at baseline (r = -0.80, P < .01) and during follow-ups (r = -0.64, -0.72, -0.63, and -0.69). The AST was responsive to change over time; an increased ACQ score by 1 point was associated with a decreased AST score by 2.65 points (P < .01) at baseline and 3.11 points (P < .01) during follow-ups. Discriminant validity demonstrated a strong association between decreased AST scores and increased oral corticosteroid use (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.16, P < .01) and increased unscheduled acute asthma visits (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.28, P < .01).

Gilliland_2009_Pedi,JOUR,"Outdoor air pollution, genetic susceptibility, and asthma management: opportunities for intervention to reduce the burden of asthma","Gilliland, Frank D.",Pediatrics,"Outdoor air pollution at levels occurring in many urban areas around the world has substantial adverse effects on health. Children in general, and children with asthma in particular, are sensitive to the adverse effects of outdoor air pollutants, including ozone, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matter. A growing number of studies also show that children living in environments near traffic have increased risks of new-onset asthma, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, school absences, and asthma-related hospitalizations. The large population of children exposed to high levels of outdoor air pollutants and the substantial risks for adverse health effects present unexploited opportunities to reduce the burden of asthma. Because the evidence indicates significant adverse effects of air pollution at current levels, there is clearly a need to reduce levels of regulated pollutants such as ozone, as well as unregulated pollutants in tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles. Achieving this long-term goal requires the active involvement of physicians and medical providers to ensure that the health of children is at the top of the list of competing priorities for regulatory policy decision-making. Clinical approaches include treatment to control asthma and patient education to reduce adverse effects of the disease. Reduction in exposures also can be approached at a policy level through changes in schools and school bus operations. Beyond clinical and public health approaches to reduce exposure, another strategy to be used before clean air goals are met is to decrease the susceptibility of children to air pollution. Emerging research indicates that dietary supplementation for individuals with low antioxidant levels is one promising approach to reducing susceptibility to air pollution. A second approach involves induction of enzymatic antioxidant defenses, especially for individuals with at-risk genetic variants of key antioxidant enzymes.",2009,10.1542/peds.2008-2233G,123 Suppl 3,Suppl 3,173-S168,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Public Health and Hospitalization and Humans and Child and Absenteeism and Urban Health and Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data and *Genetic Predisposition to Disease and California/epidemiology and Air Pollution/*adverse effects/analysis and Particle Size and Asthma/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention & control and Bronchitis/epidemiology/etiology and Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/prevention & control and Nitrogen Dioxide/toxicity and Ozone/toxicity and Respiratory Sounds and Vehicle Emissions",NA,NA,2009/03//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to (1) define service use groups and (2) determine associations of sociodemographic, developmental, behavioral, and health characteristics with service use groups among school-aged children with ASD. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 1378 children aged 6 to 18 years with an ASD diagnosis from the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network registry for 2008-2015, which included 16 US sites and 2 Canadian sites. Thirteen service use indicators spanning behavioral and medical treatments (eg, developmental therapy, psychotropic medications, and special diets) were examined. Latent class analysis was used to identify groups of children with similar service use patterns. RESULTS: By using latent class analysis, school-aged children with ASD were placed into 4 service use classes: limited services (12.0%), multimodal services (36.4%), predominantly educational and/or behavioral services (42.6%), or predominantly special diets and/or natural products (9.0%). Multivariable analysis results revealed that compared with children in the educational and/or behavioral services class, those in the multimodal services class had greater ASD severity and more externalizing behavior problems, those in the limited services class were older and had less ASD severity, and those in the special diets and/or natural products class had higher income and poorer quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 4 service use groups among school-aged children with ASD that may be related to certain sociodemographic, developmental, behavioral, and health characteristics.

X2018_Pedi,JOUR,"Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Influenza in Children, 2018-2019",NA,Pediatrics,"The authors of this statement update the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children. Highlights for the upcoming 2018-2019 season include the following:1. Annual influenza immunization is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents.2. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), trivalent or quadrivalent, as the primary choice for influenza vaccination in children because the effectiveness of a live attenuated influenza vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) was inferior during past influenza seasons and is unknown for this upcoming season.3. A live attenuated influenza vaccine may be used for children who would not otherwise receive an influenza vaccine (eg, refusal of an IIV) and for whom it is appropriate because of age (2 years of age and older) and health status (ie, healthy and without any underlying chronic medical condition).4. All 2018-2019 seasonal influenza vaccines contain an influenza A(H1N1) vaccine strain similar to that included in the 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines. In contrast, the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B (Victoria lineage) vaccine strains included in the 2018-2019 trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines differ from those in the 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines.a. Trivalent vaccines contain an influenza A(Michigan/45/2015[H1N1])pdm09-like virus, an influenza A(Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016[H3N2])-like virus (updated), and an influenza B (Colorado/60/2017)-like virus (B/Victoria lineage; updated).b. Quadrivalent vaccines contain an additional B virus (Phuket/3073/2013-like virus; B/Yamagata lineage).5. All children with egg allergy of any severity can receive an influenza vaccine without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for all vaccines.6. Pregnant women may receive an influenza vaccine (IIV only) at any time during pregnancy to protect themselves as well as their infants, who benefit from the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Postpartum women who did not receive vaccination during pregnancy should be encouraged to receive an influenza vaccine before discharge from the hospital. Influenza vaccination during breastfeeding is safe for mothers and their infants.7. The vaccination of health care workers is a crucial step in preventing influenza and reducing health care-associated influenza infections because health care personnel often care for individuals at high risk for influenza-related complications.8. Pediatricians should attempt to promptly identify their patients who are suspected of having an influenza infection for timely initiation of antiviral treatment when indicated and on the basis of shared decision-making between each pediatrician and child caregiver to reduce morbidity and mortality. Although best results are seen when a child is treated within 48 hours of symptom onset, antiviral therapy should still be considered beyond 48 hours of symptom onset in children with severe disease or those at high risk of complications (see Table 2 in the full policy statement).",2018,10.1542/peds.2018-2367,142,4,e20182367,eng,1098-4275 0031-4005,"Humans and Child and United States/epidemiology and Influenza Vaccines/*therapeutic use and Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards and Immunization Schedule and Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use and Pediatrics/methods/standards and Academies and Institutes/standards and Influenza, Human/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2018/10//undefined,Pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA
