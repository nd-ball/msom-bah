Han_2020_Actabiom,JOUR,Machine learning as a tool to design glasses with controlled dissolution for healthcare applications,"Han, Taihao and Stone-Weiss, Nicholas and Huang, Jie and Goel, Ashutosh and Kumar, Aditya",Acta biomaterialia,"The advancement of glass science has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality and length of human life. However, with an ever-increasing demand for glasses in a variety of healthcare applications - especially with controlled degradation rates - it is becoming difficult to design new glass compositions using conventional approaches. For example, it is difficult, if not impossible, to design new gene-activation bioactive glasses, with controlled release of functional ions tailored for specific patient states, using trial-and-error based approaches. Notwithstanding, it is possible to design new glasses with controlled release of functional ions by using artificial intelligence-based methods, for example, supervised machine learning (ML). In this paper, we present an ensemble ML model for reliable prediction of time- and composition-dependent dissolution behavior of a wide variety of oxide glasses relevant for various biomedical applications. A comprehensive database, comprising of over 1300 data-records consolidated from original glass dissolution experiments, has been used for training and subsequent testing of prediction performance of the ML model. Results demonstrate that the ensemble ML model can predict chemical degradation behavior of glasses in aqueous solutions over a wide range of pH relevant for their usage in a human body where the environment can be highly acidic (for example, pH = 3), for example, due to secretion of citric acid by osteoclasts, or highly alkaline (pH <e2><89><88>10) due to the release of alkali cations from bioactive glasses.

This approach is motivated by the goal of diagnosing gait abnormalities on a symptom-by-symptom basis, irrespective of other neuromuscular movement disorders the patients may be affected by. This could lead to improvements in treatment and offer a greater insight into movement disorders. METHODS: In-shoe pressure was measured for 12 able-bodied participants, each subject to eight artificially induced gait alterations, achieved by modifying the underside of the shoe. The data were recorded at 100 Hz over 2520 data channels and were analyzed using the deep learning architecture and the long term short term memory networks. Additionally, the rationale for the decision-making process of these networks was investigated. CONCLUSION: Long term short term memory networks are applicable to the classification of the gait function. The classifications can be made using only 2 s of sparse data (82.0% accuracy over 96 000 instances of test data) from participants who were not a part of the training set.

This paper uses the morphological clustering and analysis of ICP (MOCAIP) algorithm to derive 24 metrics characterizing morphology of ICP pulses and test the hypothesis that preintracranial hypertension (Pre-IH) segments of ICP can be differentiated, using these morphological metrics, from control segments that were not associated with any ICP elevation or at least 1 h prior to ICP elevation. Furthermore, we investigate whether a global optimization algorithm could effectively find the optimal subset of these morphological metrics to achieve better classification performance as compared to using full set of MOCAIP metrics. The results showed that Pre-IH segments, using the optimal subset of metrics found by the differential evolution algorithm, can be differentiated from control segments at a specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 37% for these Pre-IH segments 5 min prior to the ICP elevation. While the sensitivity decreased to 21% for Pre-IH segments, 20 min prior to ICP elevation, the high specificity of 99% was retained. The performance using the full set of MOCAIP metrics was shown inferior to results achieved using the optimal subset of metrics. This paper demonstrated that advanced ICP pulse analysis combined with machine learning could potentially leads to the forecasting of ICP elevation so that a proactive ICP management could be realized based on these accurate forecasts.",2010,10.1109/TBME.2009.2037607,57,5,1070-1078,eng,1558-2531 0018-9294,"Humans and Forecasting and Prognosis and Computer Simulation and *Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Models, Neurological and *Intracranial Pressure and Intracranial Hypertension/*diagnosis/*physiopathology and Manometry/*methods",NA,NA,2010/05//undefined,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kachuee_2017_IEtronbien,JOUR,Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Algorithms for Continuous Health-Care Monitoring,"Kachuee, Mohammad and Kiani, Mohammad Mahdi and Mohammadzade, Hoda and Shabany, Mahdi",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"GOAL: Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring can provide invaluable information about individuals' health conditions. However, BP is conventionally measured using inconvenient cuff-based instruments, which prevents continuous BP monitoring. This paper presents an efficient algorithm, based on the pulse arrival time (PAT), for the continuous and cuffless estimation of the systolic BP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) values. METHODS: The proposed framework estimates the BP values through processing vital signals and extracting two types of features, which are based on either physiological parameters or whole-based representation of vital signals. Finally, the regression algorithms are employed for the BP estimation. Although the proposed algorithm works reliably without any need for calibration, an optional calibration procedure is also suggested, which can improve the system's accuracy even further. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated on about a thousand subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards. The method complies with the AAMI standard in the estimation of DBP and MAP values. Regarding the BHS protocol, the results achieve grade A for the estimation of DBP and grade B for the estimation of MAP. CONCLUSION: We conclude that by using the PAT in combination with informative features from the vital signals, the BP can be accurately and reliably estimated in a noninvasive fashion.

Development of wearable motion sensors along with machine learning algorithms offer a great opportunity for ADL recognition. However, the performance of the ADL recognition systems may significantly degrade when they are used by a new user due to inter-subject variability. This issue limits the usability of these systems. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted personalization framework for ADL recognition with the aim to maximize the personalization performance while minimizing solicitation of inputs or labels from the user to reduce user's burden. The proposed framework consists of unsupervised retraining of automatic feature extraction layers and supervised fine-tuning of classification layers through a novel active learning model based on a given model's uncertainty. We design a Bayesian deep convolutional neural network with stochastic latent variables that allows us to estimate both aleatoric (data-dependent) and epistemic (model-dependent) uncertainties in recognition task. In this study, for the first time, we show how distinguishing between the two aforementioned sources of uncertainty leads to more effective active learning. The experimental results show that our proposed method improves the accuracy of ADL recognition on a new user by 25% on average compared to the case of using a model for a new user with no personalization with an average final accuracy of 89.2%.

Johnson_2021_IEtronbien,JOUR,Multidimensional Ground Reaction Forces and Moments From Wearable Sensor Accelerations via Deep Learning,"Johnson, William R. and Mian, Ajmal and Robinson, Mark A. and Verheul, Jasper and Lloyd, David G. and Alderson, Jacqueline A.",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"OBJECTIVE: Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of catastrophic non-contact knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom early-warning detection system. This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. METHODS: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F(z) 0.97, anterior F(y) 0.96 (both running), and lateral F(x) 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). CONCLUSION: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing.

Huang_2018_IEtronbien,JOUR,A Regularized Deep Learning Approach for Clinical Risk Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Using Electronic Health Records,"Huang, Zhengxing and Dong, Wei and Duan, Huilong and Liu, Jiquan",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"OBJECTIVE: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as a common and severe cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death and the principal cause of serious long-term disability globally. Clinical risk prediction of ACS is important for early intervention and treatment. Existing ACS risk scoring models are based mainly on a small set of hand-picked risk factors and often dichotomize predictive variables to simplify the score calculation. METHODS: This study develops a regularized stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) model to stratify clinical risks of ACS patients from a large volume of electronic health records (EHR). To capture characteristics of patients at similar risk levels, and preserve the discriminating information across different risk levels, two constraints are added on SDAE to make the reconstructed feature representations contain more risk information of patients, which contribute to a better clinical risk prediction result. RESULTS: We validate our approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 3464 ACS patient samples. The performance of our approach for predicting ACS risk remains robust and reaches 0.868 and 0.73 in terms of both AUC and accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results show that the proposed approach achieves a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in dealing with the clinical risk prediction problem.

Sahli.Costabal_2019_Actabiom,JOUR,Multiscale characterization of heart failure,"Sahli Costabal, F. and Choy, J. S. and Sack, K. L. and Guccione, J. M. and Kassab, G. S. and Kuhl, E.",Acta biomaterialia,"Dilated cardiomyopathy is a progressive irreversible disease associated with contractile dysfunction and heart failure. During dilated cardiomyopathy, elevated diastolic wall strains trigger mechanotransduction pathways that initiate the addition of sarcomeres in series and an overall increase in myocyte length. At the whole organ level, this results in a chronic dilation of the ventricles, an increase in end diastolic and end systolic volumes, and a decrease in ejection fraction. However, how exactly changes in sarcomere number translate into changes in myocyte morphology, and how these cellular changes translate into ventricular dilation remains incompletely understood. Here we combined a chronic animal study, continuum growth modeling, and machine learning to quantify correlations between sarcomere dynamics, myocyte morphology, and ventricular dilation. In an eight-week long volume overload study of six pigs, we found that the average sarcomere number increased by +3.8%/week, from 47 to 62, resulting in a myocyte lengthening of +3.3%/week, from 85 to 108<e2><80><af><ce><bc>m, while the sarcomere length and myocyte width remained unchanged. At the same time, the average end diastolic volume increased by +6.0%/week. Using continuum growth modeling and Bayesian inference, we correlated alterations on the subcellular, cellular, and organ scales and found that the serial sarcomere number explained 88% of myocyte lengthening, which, in turn, explained 54% of cardiac dilation. Our results demonstrate that sarcomere number and myocyte length are closely correlated and constitute the major determinants of dilated heart failure. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for more sophisticated multiscale models of heart failure. Our study suggests that altering sarcomere turnover-and with it myocyte morphology and ventricular dimensions-could be a potential therapeutic target to attenuate or reverse the progression of heart failure. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Heart failure is a significant global health problem that affects more than 25 million people worldwide and increases in prevalence as the population ages. Heart failure has been studied excessively at various scales; yet, there is no compelling concept to connect knowledge from the subcellular, cellular, and organ level across the scales. Here we combined a chronic animal study, continuum growth modeling, and machine learning to quantify correlations between sarcomere dynamics, myocyte morphology, and ventricular dilation. We found that the serial sarcomere number explained 88% of myocyte lengthening, which, in turn, explained 54% of cardiac dilation. Our results show that sarcomere number and myocyte length are closely correlated and constitute the major determinants of dilated heart failure. This suggests that altering the sarcomere turnover-and with it myocyte morphology and ventricular dimensions-could be a potential therapeutic target to attenuate or reverse heart failure.",2019,10.1016/j.actbio.2018.12.053,86,NA,66-76,eng,1878-7568 1742-7061,Machine learning and Heart failure and Female and Male and Bayesian inference and Animals and Computer Simulation and Swine and Diastole and Systole and Growth and remodeling and Heart Failure/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/physiopathology and Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology and Multiscale modeling and Muscle Cells/pathology and Myocyte and Sarcomere and Sarcomeres/pathology and Uncertainty quantification,NA,NA,2019/03/01/,Acta Biomater,NA,NA,NA,NA

Missing data has shown particularly problematic for remotely diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) using smartphones. This contribution presents multi-source ensemble learning, a methodology which combines dataset deconstruction with ensemble learning and enables participants with incomplete data (i.e., where not all sensor data is available) to be included in the training of machine learning models and achieves a 100% participant retention rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on a cohort of 1513 participants, 91.2% of which contributed incomplete data in tapping, gait, voice, and/or memory tests. The use of multi-source ensemble learning, alongside convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capitalizing on the amount of available data, increases PD classification accuracy from 73.1% to 82.0% as compared to traditional techniques. The increase in accuracy is found to be partly caused by the use of multi-channel CNNs and partly caused by developing models using the large cohort of participants. Furthermore, through bootstrap sampling we reveal that feature selection is better performed on a large cohort of participants with incomplete data than on a small number of participants with complete data. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of wearable/remote monitoring datasets that suffer from missing data and contributes to improving the ability to remotely monitor PD via revealing novel methods of accounting for symptom heterogeneity.",2019,10.1109/TBME.2018.2873252,66,5,1402-1411,eng,1558-2531 0018-9294,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Telemedicine and *Databases, Factual and Neural Networks, Computer and *Machine Learning and *Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and Gait/physiology and Memory/physiology and Memory and Learning Tests and Parkinson Disease/*diagnosis",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most chronic diseases are related to lifestyle, and daily activity records can be used as an important indicator of health. Specifically, using advanced technology to automatically monitor actual activities can effectively prevent and manage chronic diseases.

We designed an efficient Adaboost-Stump running on a smartphone to classify five common activities: cycling, running, sitting, standing, and walking and achieved a satisfactory classification accuracy of 98%. We designed an online learning method, and the classification model requires continuous training with actual data.

Sleep disruption may impact neural function, and can be a symptom of both physical and mental disorders. This study proposes wearable in-ear electroencephalography (ear-EEG) for overnight sleep monitoring as a 24/7 continuous and unobtrusive technology for sleep quality assessment in the community. METHODS: A total of 22 healthy participants took part in overnight sleep monitoring with simultaneous ear-EEG and conventional full polysomnography recordings. The ear-EEG data were analyzed in the both structural complexity and spectral domains. The extracted features were used for automatic sleep stage prediction through supervized machine learning, whereby the PSG data were manually scored by a sleep clinician. RESULTS: The agreement between automatic sleep stage prediction based on ear-EEG from a single in-ear sensor and the hypnogram based on the full PSG was 74.1% in the accuracy over five sleep stage classification. This is supported by a substantial agreement in the kappa metric (0.61). CONCLUSION: The in-ear sensor is feasible for monitoring overnight sleep outside the sleep laboratory and also mitigates technical difficulties associated with PSG. It, therefore, represents a 24/7 continuously wearable alternative to conventional cumbersome and expensive sleep monitoring.

Herein, we propose a new approach to preterm infants' limb pose estimation that features spatio-temporal information to detect and track limb joints from depth videos with high reliability. METHODS: Limb-pose estimation is performed using a deep-learning framework consisting of a detection and a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) for rough and precise joint localization, respectively. The CNNs are implemented to encode connectivity in the temporal direction through 3D convolution. Assessment of the proposed framework is performed through a comprehensive study with sixteen depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice from sixteen preterm infants (the babyPose dataset). RESULTS: When applied to pose estimation, the median root mean square distance, computed among all limbs, between the estimated and the ground-truth pose was 9.06 pixels, overcoming approaches based on spatial features only (11.27 pixels). CONCLUSION: Results showed that the spatio-temporal features had a significant influence on the pose-estimation performance, especially in challenging cases (e.g., homogeneous image intensity). SIGNIFICANCE: This article significantly enhances the state of art in automatic assessment of preterm infants' health status by introducing the use of spatio-temporal features for limb detection and tracking, and by being the first study to use depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice for limb-pose estimation.

Similar to other real-time measurement modalities, especially in healthcare, the identification of high-quality signals is essential for clinical interpretation. Our goal is to identify poor quality beats and remove them prior to further analysis of the TCD signal. METHODS: We selected objective features for this purpose including Euclidean distance between individual and average beat waveforms, cross-correlation between individual and average beat waveforms, ratio of the high-frequency power to the total beat power, beat length, and variance of the diastolic portion of the beat waveform. We developed an iterative outlier detection algorithm to identify and remove the beats that are different from others in a recording. Finally, we tested the algorithm on a dataset consisting of more than 15 h of TCD data recorded from 48 stroke and 34 in-hospital control subjects. RESULTS: We assessed the performance of the algorithm in the improvement of estimation of clinically important TCD parameters by comparing them to that of manual beat annotation. The results show that there is a strong correlation between the two, that demonstrates the algorithm has successfully recovered the clinically important features. We obtained significant improvement in estimating the TCD parameters using the algorithm accepted beats compared to using all beats.

Thus, a frequent and objective PD assessment is highly valuable for effective health management of people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). Here, we propose a method for monitoring PwP by stochastically modeling the relationships between wrist movements during unscripted daily activities and corresponding annotations about clinical displays of movement abnormalities. We approach the estimation of PD motor signs by independently modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes of commonly observed movement abnormalities in PwP including tremor, (non-tremulous) bradykinesia, and (non-tremulous) dyskinesia. We use clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models, thus allowing our multi-layer Gaussian process prediction models to estimate not only their presence but also their severities. The experimental validation of our approach demonstrates strong agreement of the model predictions with these PD annotations.

Bing_2020_Joofthmebeofbima,JOUR,Medical imaging based in silico head model for ischaemic stroke simulation,"Bing, Yun and Garcia-Gonzalez, Daniel and Voets, Natalie and Jerusalem, Antoine",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and a leading factor of disability in adults worldwide. It occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is significantly reduced, potentially leading to the formation of brain oedema. Owing to the rigid nature of the skull, brain expansion results in the shifting of tissue structure, often captured by measurement of the midline shift (MLS). Clinically, MLS has been used in practice as an indication of stroke severity, potential tissue damage and as a way to assess whether decompressive surgery should be performed. However, a growing body of research points towards limitations in such predictive ability. Inspired by the recent progress made in traumatic brain injury simulations, in silico experiments appear as the ideal candidate to elucidate stroke consequences on brain tissues, e.g., morphological changes, in particular in the overarching context of computer model assisted clinical decision making support. To this end, two biologically-informed finite element head models, human and rat, were constructed to support such analysis. The main components of the models include magnetic resonance imaging-derived grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and skull, while the human head model also includes the vasculature, additional cerebral components and axonal tractography. Constitutive models representing the mechanical behaviour of each component account in particular for the behaviour of brain tissues during the swelling process accompanying oedema development. The rat model was leveraged for the calibration of the swelling parameters, in turn used for the simulation of human stroke. Human oedema development as a result of stroke was simulated at three frequent locations: basal ganglia, fronto-opercular/anterior insula and temporo-parietal. All three cases exhibit a quadratic MLS evolution with time with the basal ganglia and temporo-parietal showing the largest and smallest values, respectively, at any given time. A proposed injury criterion for axonal tract damage was shown to be larger in the temporo-parietal case. Taken together, these results point towards i) the importance of considering stroke location when using the MLS as an indication of stroke severity, and ii) the potential lack of correlation between MLS value and tissue damage. Ultimately, we propose an in silico methodology that may hold promise in predicting stroke evolution based on an estimate of MLS and stroke location at a given time.",2020,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103442,101,NA,103442,eng,1878-0180,Humans and Animals and Rats and *Computer Simulation and *Magnetic Resonance Imaging and *Finite Element Analysis and *Head and Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology and Finite element method and In silico experiment and Ischaemic stroke and Ischemic Stroke/*diagnostic imaging/pathology and Midline shift,NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,NA,NA,NA,NA

T. M.",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"Assessment of coordination disorders is valuable for monitoring progression of patients, distinguishing healthy and pathological conditions, and ultimately aiding in clinical decision making, thereby offering the possibility to improve medical care or rehabilitation. A common method to assess movement disorders is by using clinical rating scales. However, rating scales depend on the evaluation and interpretation of an observer, implying that subjective phenotypic assignment precedes the application of the scales. Objective and more accurate methods are under continuous development but gold standards are still scarce. Here, we show how a method we previously developed, originally aimed at assessing dynamic balance by a probabilistic generalized linear model, can be used to assess a broader range of functional movements. In this paper, the method is applied to distinguish patients with coordination disorders from healthy controls. We focused on movements recorded during the finger-to-nose task (FNT), which is commonly used to assess coordination disorders. We also compared clinical FNT scores and model scores. Our method achieved 84% classification accuracy in distinguishing patients and healthy participants, using only two features.

This paper explores image recognition for the screening of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not discovered in its initial stages. Many previous reports on DR imaging focus on the segmentation of the retinal image, on quality assessment, and on the analysis of presence of DR-related lesions. Although this study has advanced the detection of individual DR lesions from retinal images, the simple presence of any lesion is not enough to decide on the need for referral of a patient. Deciding if a patient should be referred to a doctor is an essential requirement for the deployment of an automated screening tool for rural and remote communities. We introduce an algorithm to make that decision based on the fusion of results by metaclassification. The input of the metaclassifier is the output of several lesion detectors, creating a powerful high-level feature representation for the retinal images. We explore alternatives for the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW)-based lesion detectors, which critically depends on the choices of coding and pooling the low-level local descriptors.

The maximum diameter criterion, typically used for aneurysm rupture risk estimations, has been challenged by more sophisticated biomechanically motivated models in the past. Although these models are very helpful for the clinicians in decision-making, they do not attempt to capture material failure. Following a short overview of the microstructure of the aorta, we analyze the failure mechanisms involved in the dissection and rupture by considering also traumatic rupture. We continue with a literature review of experimental studies relevant to quantify tissue strength. More specifically, we summarize more extensively uniaxial tensile, bulge inflation and peeling tests, and we also specify trouser, direct tension and in-plane shear tests. Finally we analyze biomechanically motivated models to predict rupture risk. Based on the findings of the reviewed studies and the rather large variations in tissue strength, we propose that an appropriate material failure criterion for aortic tissues should also reflect the microstructure in order to be effective.
