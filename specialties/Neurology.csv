Xia_2017_Neur,JOUR,"Functional connectomics from a ""big data"" perspective","Xia, Mingrui and He, Yong",NeuroImage,"In the last decade, explosive growth regarding functional connectome studies has been observed. Accumulating knowledge has significantly contributed to our understanding of the brain's functional network architectures in health and disease. With the development of innovative neuroimaging techniques, the establishment of large brain datasets and the increasing accumulation of published findings, functional connectomic research has begun to move into the era of ""big data"", which generates unprecedented opportunities for discovery in brain science and simultaneously encounters various challenging issues, such as data acquisition, management and analyses. Big data on the functional connectome exhibits several critical features: high spatial and/or temporal precision, large sample sizes, long-term recording of brain activity, multidimensional biological variables (e.g., imaging, genetic, demographic, cognitive and clinic) and/or vast quantities of existing findings. We review studies regarding functional connectomics from a big data perspective, with a focus on recent methodological advances in state-of-the-art image acquisition (e.g., multiband imaging), analysis approaches and statistical strategies (e.g., graph theoretical analysis, dynamic network analysis, independent component analysis, multivariate pattern analysis and machine learning), as well as reliability and reproducibility validations. We highlight the novel findings in the application of functional connectomic big data to the exploration of the biological mechanisms of cognitive functions, normal development and aging and of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We advocate the urgent need to expand efforts directed at the methodological challenges and discuss the direction of applications in this field.",2017,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.031,160,NA,152-167,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,Humans and Big data and Graph theory and Dynamics and Brain/*physiology and *Metadata and Brain networks and Connectome and Connectome/*methods and Fingerprint and Nerve Net/*physiology and Neural Pathways/*physiology,NA,NA,2017/10/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

R. and Bastiani, Matteo and Miller, Karla L. and Nichols, Thomas E. and Smith, Stephen M.",NeuroImage,"Dealing with confounds is an essential step in large cohort studies to address problems such as unexplained variance and spurious correlations. UK Biobank is a powerful resource for studying associations between imaging and non-imaging measures such as lifestyle factors and health outcomes, in part because of the large subject numbers. However, the resulting high statistical power also raises the sensitivity to confound effects, which therefore have to be carefully considered. In this work we describe a set of possible confounds (including non-linear effects and interactions that researchers may wish to consider for their studies using such data). We include descriptions of how we can estimate the confounds, and study the extent to which each of these confounds affects the data, and the spurious correlations that may arise if they are not controlled. Finally, we discuss several issues that future studies should consider when dealing with confounds.",2021,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117002,224,NA,117002,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,Machine learning and Humans and Time Factors and United Kingdom and Electronic Data Processing and *Biological Specimen Banks and *Brain and *Neuroimaging/methods and Big data imaging and Confounds and Data modelling and Epidemiological studies and Head and Image analysis and Multi-modal data integration and Statistica l modelling,NA,NA,2021/01/01/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cole_2017_Neur,JOUR,Predicting brain age with deep learning from raw imaging data results in a reliable and heritable biomarker,"Cole, James H. and Poudel, Rudra P. K. and Tsagkrasoulis, Dimosthenis and Caan, Matthan W. A. and Steves, Claire and Spector, Tim D. and Montana, Giovanni",NeuroImage,"Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict chronological age in healthy people. Deviations from healthy brain ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to further establish the credentials of 'brain-predicted age' as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples (within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. CNN accurately predicted chronological age using GM (correlation between brain-predicted age and chronological age r = 0.96, mean absolute error [MAE] = 4.16 years) and raw (r = 0.94, MAE = 4.65 years) data. This was comparable to GPR brain-predicted age using GM data (r = 0.95, MAE = 4.66 years). Brain-predicted age was a heritable phenotype for all models and input data (h(2) <e2><89><a5> 0.5). Brain-predicted age showed high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90-0.99). Multi-centre reliability was more variable within high ICCs for GM (0.83-0.96) and poor-moderate levels for WM and raw data (0.51-0.77). Brain-predicted age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-influenced phenotype, that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.",2017,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.059,163,NA,115-124,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Deep learning and Gaussian processes and Reliability and Aged, 80 and over and Neuroimaging and Phenotype and *Machine Learning and *Neural Networks, Computer and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Biomarker and *Aging/pathology and Brain ageing and Brain/*diagnostic imaging/pathology and Convolutional neural networks and Heritability and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods",NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Consequently, such brain activity is continuously changing whether or not one is focusing on an externally imposed task. Previously, we have introduced an analysis method that allows us, using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to model task or rest brain activity as a dynamic sequence of distinct brain networks, overcoming many of the limitations posed by sliding window approaches. Here, we present an advance that enables the HMM to handle very large amounts of data, making possible the inference of very reproducible and interpretable dynamic brain networks in a range of different datasets, including task, rest, MEG and fMRI, with potentially thousands of subjects. We anticipate that the generation of large and publicly available datasets from initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project and UK Biobank, in combination with computational methods that can work at this scale, will bring a breakthrough in our understanding of brain function in both health and disease.",2018,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.077,180,Pt B,646-656,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,Humans and Neural Pathways/physiology and *Big Data and Brain/*physiology and Brain Mapping/methods and *Markov Chains and Nerve Net/*physiology and Rest/physiology,NA,NA,2018/10/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Fassbender_2020_TheLanNeu,JOUR,Prehospital stroke management in the thrombectomy era,"Fassbender, Klaus and Walter, Silke and Grunwald, Iris Q. and Merzou, Fatma and Mathur, Shrey and Lesmeister, Martin and Liu, Yang and Bertsch, Thomas and Grotta, James C.",The Lancet. Neurology,"Acute stroke management has been revolutionised by evidence of the effectiveness of thrombectomy. Because time is brain in stroke care, the speed with which a patient with large vessel occlusion is transferred to a thrombectomy-capable centre determines outcome. Therefore, each link in the stroke rescue chain, starting with symptom onset and ending with recanalisation, should be streamlined. However, in contrast to inhospital delays, prehospital delays are unchanged despite substantial efforts in quality improvement. Furthermore, thrombectomy is offered by only a few, usually distant, specialised centres and not by the many other, usually nearer, hospitals. To take maximum advantage of the first so-called golden hours after stroke, and because of the difficulty of on-scene triage decision making with respect to the target hospital offering the required level of care, the focus of stroke research has shifted to the prehospital setting. Current research focuses on the effects of public education, implementation of protocols for emergency medical services for streamlining clinical investigations and accurate triage, use of preclinical scales for stroke recognition, and deployment of novel technical solutions such as smartphone applications, telemedicine, and mobile stroke units.",2020,10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30102-2,19,7,601-610,eng,1474-4465 1474-4422,Humans and Emergency Medical Services/*methods and *Thrombectomy and Stroke/*surgery,NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,Lancet Neurol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Liu_2013_Neur,JOUR,Locally linear embedding (LLE) for MRI based Alzheimer's disease classification,"Liu, Xin and Tosun, Duygu and Weiner, Michael W. and Schuff, Norbert",NeuroImage,"Modern machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in neuroimaging studies, such as the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI. However, finding a good representation for multivariate brain MRI features in which their essential structure is revealed and easily extractable has been difficult. We report a successful application of a machine learning framework that significantly improved the use of brain MRI for predictions. Specifically, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm of local linear embedding (LLE) to transform multivariate MRI data of regional brain volume and cortical thickness to a locally linear space with fewer dimensions, while also utilizing the global nonlinear data structure. The embedded brain features were then used to train a classifier for predicting future conversion to AD based on a baseline MRI. We tested the approach on 413 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had baseline MRI scans and complete clinical follow-ups over 3 years with the following diagnoses: cognitive normal (CN; n=137), stable mild cognitive impairment (s-MCI; n=93), MCI converters to AD (c-MCI, n=97), and AD (n=86). We found that classifications using embedded MRI features generally outperformed (p<0.05) classifications using the original features directly. Moreover, the improvement from LLE was not limited to a particular classifier but worked equally well for regularized logistic regressions, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis. Most strikingly, using LLE significantly improved (p=0.007) predictions of MCI subjects who converted to AD and those who remained stable (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.68/0.80/0.56). In contrast, predictions using the original features performed not better than by chance (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.56/0.65/0.46). In conclusion, LLE is a very effective tool for classification studies of AD using multivariate MRI data. The improvement in predicting conversion to AD in MCI could have important implications for health management and for powering therapeutic trials by targeting non-demented subjects who later convert to AD.",2013,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.033,83,NA,148-157,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Sensitivity and Specificity and Reproducibility of Results and Computer Simulation and Alzheimer's disease and *Algorithms and Linear Models and *Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Brain/*pathology and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods and Image Enhancement/methods and Alzheimer Disease/*pathology and Classification of AD and Locally linear embedding and MRI and Statistical learning",NA,NA,2013/12//undefined,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Using quality improvement methodology, we implemented interventions to increase documentation of epilepsy diagnosis, seizure frequency, and type from 49.8% to 70% of adult nonemployee patients seen by 6 providers over 5 months of routine clinical care. The main intervention consisted of an interactive SmartPhrase that mirrored a documentation template developed by the Epilepsy Learning Healthcare System. We assessed the weekly proportion of complete SmartPhrases among eligible patient encounters with a statistical process control chart. We used a subset of patients with established epilepsy care linked to existing patient-reported survey data to examine the proportion of patient-to-provider agreement on epilepsy diagnosis (yes vs no/unsure). We also examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients who disagreed vs agreed with provider's documentation of epilepsy diagnosis. RESULTS: The median SmartPhrase weekly completion rate was 78%. Established patients disagreed with providers with respect to epilepsy diagnosis in 18.5% of encounters (<ce><ba> = 0.13), indicating that they did not have or were unsure if they had epilepsy despite having a provider-documented epilepsy diagnosis. Patients who disagreed with providers were similar to those who agreed with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, seizure frequency, type, and other quality-of-life measures. CONCLUSION: This project supports the feasibility of implementing standardized documentation of data relevant to epilepsy care in a tertiary epilepsy clinic and highlights an opportunity for improvement in patient-provider communication.",2020,10.1212/WNL.0000000000009778,95,2,e213-e223,eng,1526-632X 0028-3878,Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Quality Improvement and Surveys and Questionnaires and Machine Learning and Treatment Outcome and Socioeconomic Factors and Quality of Life and Health Personnel/*standards and Tertiary Care Centers/standards and Documentation/*standards and Epilepsy/psychology/*therapy and Seizures/classification/epidemiology,NA,NA,2020/07/14/,Neurology,NA,NA,NA,NA

Neurology,"Autism is both a medical condition that gives rise to disability and an example of human variation that is characterised by neurological and cognitive differences. The goal of evidence-based intervention and support is to alleviate distress, improve adaptation, and promote wellbeing. Support should be collaborative, with autistic individuals, families, and service providers taking a shared decision-making approach to maximise the individual's potential, minimise barriers, and optimise the person-environment fit. Comprehensive, naturalistic early intervention with active caregiver involvement can facilitate early social communication, adaptive functioning, and cognitive development; targeted intervention can help to enhance social skills and aspects of cognition. Augmentative and alternative communication interventions show preliminary evidence of benefit in minimising communication barriers. Co-occurring health issues, such as epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders, sleep problems, and mental health challenges, should be treated in a timely fashion.

Neurology,"Cardiac complications are a frequent medical problem during the first few days after an ischaemic stroke, and patients present with a broad range of symptoms including myocardial injury, cardiac dysfunction, and arrhythmia, with varying overlap between these three conditions. Evidence from clinical and neuroimaging studies and animal research suggests that these cardiac disturbances share the same underlying mechanisms. Although the exact cascade of events has yet to be elucidated, stroke-induced functional and structural alterations in the central autonomic network, with subsequent dysregulation of normal neural cardiac control, are the assumed pathophysiology. This dysregulation can promote myocardial necrosis, microvascular dysfunction, coronary demand ischaemia, and arrhythmogenesis. These stroke-associated cardiac alterations can be summarised as a distinct so-called stroke-heart syndrome. Independent cohort studies have shown a strong association between this syndrome and unfavourable short-term prognosis; however, long-term consequences, including secondary cardiac events and death, are less well described and specific therapeutic targets are scarce.

Neurology,"Most health-care professionals are trained to promote and maintain life and often have difficulty when faced with the often rapid decline and death of people with terminal illnesses such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By contrast, data suggest that early and open discussion of end-of-life issues with patients and families allows time for reflection and planning, can obviate the introduction of unwanted interventions or procedures, can provide reassurance, and can alleviate fear. Patients' perspectives regarding end-of-life interventions and use of technologies might differ from those of the health professionals involved in their care, and health-care professionals should recognise this and respect the patient's autonomy. Advance care directives can preserve autonomy, but their legal validity and use varies between countries. Clinical management of the end of life should aim to maximise quality of life of both the patient and caregiver and, when possible, incorporate appropriate palliation of distressing physical, psychosocial, and existential distress. Training of health-care professionals should include the development of communication skills that help to sensitively manage the inevitability of death.

Price_2017_Neur,JOUR,Ten problems and solutions when predicting individual outcome from lesion site after stroke,"Price, Cathy J. and Hope, Thomas M. and Seghier, Mohamed L.",NeuroImage,"In this paper, we consider solutions to ten of the challenges faced when trying to predict an individual's functional outcome after stroke on the basis of lesion site. A primary goal is to find lesion-outcome associations that are consistently observed in large populations of stroke patients because consistent associations maximise confidence in future individualised predictions. To understand and control multiple sources of inter-patient variability, we need to systematically investigate each contributing factor and how each factor depends on other factors. This requires very large cohorts of patients, who differ from one another in typical and measurable ways, including lesion site, lesion size, functional outcome and time post stroke (weeks to decades). These multivariate investigations are complex, particularly when the contributions of different variables interact with one another. Machine learning algorithms can help to identify the most influential variables and indicate dependencies between different factors. Multivariate lesion analyses are needed to understand how the effect of damage to one brain region depends on damage or preservation in other brain regions. Such data-led investigations can reveal predictive relationships between lesion site and outcome. However, to understand and improve the predictions we need explanatory models of the neural networks and degenerate pathways that support functions of interest. This will entail integrating the results of lesion analyses with those from functional imaging (fMRI, MEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) studies of healthy participants and patients.",2017,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.08.006,145,Pt B,200-208,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Humans and *Machine Learning and Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods/standards and *Stroke/diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology and Neuroimaging/*methods/standards",NA,NA,2017/01/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pinotsis_2019_Neur,JOUR,Sensory processing and categorization in cortical and deep neural networks,"Pinotsis, Dimitris A. and Siegel, Markus and Miller, Earl K.",NeuroImage,"Many recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are rooted in visual neuroscience. However, ideas from more complicated paradigms like decision-making are less used. Although automated decision-making systems are ubiquitous (driverless cars, pilot support systems, medical diagnosis algorithms etc.), achieving human-level performance in decision making tasks is still a challenge. At the same time, these tasks that are hard for AI are easy for humans. Thus, understanding human brain dynamics during these decision-making tasks and modeling them using deep neural networks could improve AI performance. Here we modelled some of the complex neural interactions during a sensorimotor decision making task. We investigated how brain dynamics flexibly represented and distinguished between sensory processing and categorization in two sensory domains: motion direction and color. We used two different approaches for understanding neural representations. We compared brain responses to 1) the geometry of a sensory or category domain (domain selectivity) and 2) predictions from deep neural networks (computation selectivity). Both approaches gave us similar results. This confirmed the validity of our analyses. Using the first approach, we found that neural representations changed depending on context. We then trained deep recurrent neural networks to perform the same tasks as the animals. Using the second approach, we found that computations in different brain areas also changed flexibly depending on context. Color computations appeared to rely more on sensory processing, while motion computations more on abstract categories. Overall, our results shed light to the biological basis of categorization and differences in selectivity and computations in different brain areas. They also suggest a way for studying sensory and categorical representations in the brain: compare brain responses to both a behavioral model and a deep neural network and test if they give similar results.",2019,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116118,202,NA,116118,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Decision making and Female and Male and Deep neural networks and Animals and LSTM and Decision Making/*physiology and *Deep Learning and Nerve Net/*physiology and Cerebral Cortex/*physiology and Behavior, Animal/physiology and Categories and Color Perception/*physiology and Cortical hierarchies and Macaca mulatta and Motion Perception/*physiology and Psychomotor Performance/*physiology and Recurrent networks",NA,NA,2019/11/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Neurology,"BACKGROUND: To increase the effective use of thrombolytics for acute stroke, the expertise of vascular neurologists must be disseminated more widely. We prospectively assessed whether telemedicine (real-time, two-way audio and video, and digital imaging and communications in medicine [DICOM] interpretation) or telephone was superior for decision making in acute telemedicine consultations. METHODS: From January, 2004, to August, 2007, patients older than 18 years who presented with acute stroke symptoms at one of four remote spoke sites were randomly assigned, through a web-based, permuted blocks system, to telemedicine or telephone consultation to assess their suitability for treatment with thrombolytics, on the basis of standard criteria. The primary outcome measure was whether the decision to give thrombolytic treatment was correct, as determined by central adjudication. Secondary outcomes were the rate of thrombolytic use, 90-day functional outcomes (Barthel index [BI] and modified Rankin scale [mRS]), the incidence of intracerebral haemorrhages, and technical observations. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00283868. FINDINGS: 234 patients were assessed prospectively. 111 patients were randomised to telemedicine, and 111 patients were randomised to telephone consultation; 207 completed the study. Mean National Institutes of Health stroke scale score at presentation was 9.5 (SD 8.1) points (11.4 [8.7] points in the telemedicine group versus 7.7 [7.0] points in the telephone group; p=0.002). One telemedicine consultation was aborted for technical reasons, although it was included in the analyses. Correct treatment decisions were made more often in the telemedicine group than in the telephone group (108 [98%] vs 91 [82%], odds ratio [OR] 10.9, 95% CI 2.7-44.6; p=0.0009). Intravenous thrombolytics were used at an overall rate of 25% (31 [28%] telemedicine vs 25 [23%] telephone, 1.3, 0.7-2.5; p=0.43). 90-day functional outcomes were not different for BI (95-100) (0.6, 0.4-1.1; p=0.13) or for mRS score (0.6, 0.3-1.1; p=0.09). There was no difference in mortality (1.6, 0.8-3.4; p=0.27) or rates of intracerebral haemorrhage after treatment with thrombolytics (2 [7%] telemedicine vs 2 [8%] telephone, 0.8, 0.1-6.3; p=1.0). However, there were more incomplete data in the telephone group than in the telemedicine group (12%vs 3%, 0.2, 0.1-0.3; p=0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The authors of this trial report that stroke telemedicine consultations result in more accurate decision making compared with telephone consultations and can serve as a model for the effectiveness of telemedicine in other medical specialties. The more appropriate decisions, high rates of thrombolysis use, improved data collection, low rate of intracerebral haemorrhage, low technical complications, and favourable time requirements all support the efficacy of telemedicine for making treatment decisions, and might enable more practitioners to use this medium in daily stroke care.",2008,10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70171-6,7,9,787-795,eng,1474-4422 1474-4465,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Time Factors and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Double-Blind Method and Telephone and *Telemedicine and *Referral and Consultation and Quality Assurance, Health Care/methods and Emergency Medical Services/standards and Fibrinolytic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Stroke/*diagnosis/*drug therapy and Thrombolytic Therapy/*methods and Tissue Plasminogen Activator/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Videoconferencing",NA,NA,2008/09//undefined,Lancet Neurol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several studies have hypothesized that a brain maturation index integrating patterns of neuroanatomical measurements may reliably identify individual subjects deviating from a normative neurodevelopmental trajectory. However, while recent studies have shown great promise in developing accurate brain maturation indices using neuroimaging data and multivariate machine learning techniques, this approach has not been validated using a large sample of longitudinal data from children and adolescents. METHODS: T1-weighted scans from 303 healthy subjects aged 4.88 to 18.35years were acquired from the National Institute of Health (NIH) pediatric repository (http://www.pediatricmri.nih.gov). Out of the 303 subjects, 115 subjects were re-scanned after 2years. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm (LASSO) was 'trained' to integrate neuroanatomical changes across chronological age and predict each individual's brain maturity. The resulting brain maturation index was developed using first-visit scans only, and was validated using second-visit scans. RESULTS: We report a high correlation between the first-visit chronological age and brain maturation index (r=0.82, mean absolute error or MAE=1.69years), and a high correlation between the second-visit chronological age and brain maturation index (r=0.83, MAE=1.71years). The brain maturation index captured neuroanatomical volume changes between the first and second visits with an MAE of 0.27years. CONCLUSIONS: The brain maturation index developed in this study accurately predicted individual subjects' brain maturation longitudinally. Due to its strong clinical potentials in identifying individuals with an abnormal brain maturation trajectory, the brain maturation index may allow timely clinical interventions for individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders.",2015,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.071,117,NA,311-318,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Child, Preschool and Longitudinal Studies and Neuroimaging and *Machine Learning and *Health Status Indicators and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods and Brain maturation index and Brain/*anatomy & histology/*growth & development and Longitudinal brain imaging and Neurodevelopmental trajectories",NA,NA,2015/08/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Girault_2019_Neur,JOUR,White matter connectomes at birth accurately predict cognitive abilities at age 2,"Girault, Jessica B. and Munsell, Brent C. and Puechmaille, Danaele and Goldman, Barbara D. and Prieto, Juan C. and Styner, Martin and Gilmore, John H.",NeuroImage,"Cognitive ability is an important predictor of mental health outcomes that is influenced by neurodevelopment. Evidence suggests that the foundational wiring of the human brain is in place by birth, and that the white matter (WM) connectome supports developing brain function. It is unknown, however, how the WM connectome at birth supports emergent cognition. In this study, a deep learning model was trained using cross-validation to classify full-term infants (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>75) as scoring above or below the median at age 2 using WM connectomes generated from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images at birth. Results from this model were used to predict individual cognitive scores. We additionally identified WM connections important for classification. The model was also evaluated in a separate set of preterm infants (n<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>37) scanned at term-age equivalent. Findings revealed that WM connectomes at birth predicted 2-year cognitive score group with high accuracy in both full-term (89.5%) and preterm (83.8%) infants. Scores predicted by the model were strongly correlated with actual scores (r<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.98 for full-term and r<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>0.96 for preterm). Connections within the frontal lobe, and between the frontal lobe and other brain areas were found to be important for classification. This work suggests that WM connectomes at birth can accurately predict a child's 2-year cognitive group and individual score in full-term and preterm infants. The WM connectome at birth appears to be a useful neuroimaging biomarker of subsequent cognitive development that deserves further study.",2019,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.02.060,192,NA,145-155,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Prediction and Humans and Female and Male and Child, Preschool and Infant and Cognition and Deep Learning and Infant, Newborn and Infant, Premature and Biomarker and Connectome and Cognition/*physiology and Brain/*anatomy & histology/*physiology and Infant brain and White matter and White Matter/*anatomy & histology",NA,NA,2019/05/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

A. and Filippini, Nicola and Singh-Manoux, Archana and Kivimaki, Mika and Westlye, Lars T. and Ebmeier, Klaus P.",NeuroImage,"Brain age is becoming a widely applied imaging-based biomarker of neural aging and potential proxy for brain integrity and health. We estimated multimodal and modality-specific brain age in the Whitehall II (WHII) MRI cohort using machine learning and imaging-derived measures of gray matter (GM) morphology, white matter microstructure (WM), and resting state functional connectivity (FC). The results showed that the prediction accuracy improved when multiple imaging modalities were included in the model (R(2) = 0.30, 95% CI [0.24, 0.36]). The modality-specific GM and WM models showed similar performance (R(2) = 0.22 [0.16, 0.27] and R(2) = 0.24 [0.18, 0.30], respectively), while the FC model showed the lowest prediction accuracy (R(2) = 0.002 [-0.005, 0.008]), indicating that the FC features were less related to chronological age compared to structural measures. Follow-up analyses showed that FC predictions were similarly low in a matched sub-sample from UK Biobank, and although FC predictions were consistently lower than GM predictions, the accuracy improved with increasing sample size and age range. Cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, alcohol intake, and stroke risk score, were each associated with brain aging in the WHII cohort. Blood pressure showed a stronger association with white matter compared to gray matter, while no differences in the associations of alcohol intake and stroke risk with these modalities were observed. In conclusion, machine-learning based brain age prediction can reduce the dimensionality of neuroimaging data to provide meaningful biomarkers of individual brain aging. However, model performance depends on study-specific characteristics including sample size and age range, which may cause discrepancies in findings across studies.",2020,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117292,222,NA,117292,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,Machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Risk Factors and *Aging and Brain/*physiology and Heart Disease Risk Factors and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods and Cognition/*physiology and Neuroimaging/methods and Brain age prediction and Cardiovascular Diseases/*physiopathology and Cardiovascular risk and Gray Matter/physiopathology and Multimodal MRI and White Matter/physiology,NA,NA,2020/11/15/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

We called this index AD Pattern Similarity (AD-PS) scores. To demonstrate the construct validity of the scores, we investigated their associations with several AD risk factors. The ADNI and WHIMS imaging databases were collected with different goals, populations and data acquisition protocols: it is important to demonstrate that the approach to estimating AD-PS scores can bridge these differences. METHODS: MRI data from both studies were processed using high-dimensional warping methods. High-dimensional classifiers were then estimated using the ADNI MRI data. Next, the classifiers were applied to baseline and follow-up WHIMS-MRI GM data to generate the GM AD-PS scores. To study the validity of the scores we investigated associations between GM AD-PS scores at baseline (Scan 1) and their longitudinal changes (Scan 2 -Scan 1) with: 1) age, cognitive scores, white matter small vessel ischemic disease (WM SVID) volume at baseline and 2) age, cognitive scores, WM SVID volume longitudinal changes respectively. In addition, we investigated their associations with time until classification of independently adjudicated status in WHIMS-MRI. RESULTS: Higher GM AD-PS scores from WHIMS-MRI baseline data were associated with older age, lower cognitive scores, and higher WM SVID volume. Longitudinal changes in GM AD-PS scores (Scan 2 - Scan 1) were also associated with age and changes in WM SVID volumes and cognitive test scores. Increases in the GM AD-PS scores predicted decreases in cognitive scores and increases in WM SVID volume. GM AD-PS scores and their longitudinal changes also were associated with time until classification of cognitive impairment. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curves showed that baseline GM AD-PS scores of cognitively normal participants carried information about future cognitive status determined during follow-up. DISCUSSION: We applied a high-dimensional machine learning approach to estimate a novel AD risk factor for WHIMS-MRI study participants using ADNI data. The GM AD-PS scores showed strong associations with incident cognitive impairment and cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age, cognitive function, cognitive status and WM SVID volume lending support to the ongoing validation of the GM AD-PS score.",2018,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.08.040,183,NA,401-411,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Machine learning and Humans and Female and Aged and Prognosis and Alzheimer's disease and Follow-Up Studies and *Databases, Factual and *Machine Learning and Risk Assessment/*methods and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods and Neuroimaging/*methods and MRI and AD-PS and Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and Cognitive Dysfunction/*physiopathology and High-dimensional and White Matter/*diagnostic imaging",NA,NA,2018/12//undefined,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Neurology,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and treatment of cerebral and retinal transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are often delayed by the lack of immediate access to a dedicated TIA clinic. We evaluated the effects of rapid assessment of patients with TIA on clinical decision making, length of hospital stay, and subsequent stroke rates. METHODS: We set up SOS-TIA, a hospital clinic with 24-h access. Patients were admitted if they had sudden retinal or cerebral focal symptoms judged to relate to ischaemia and if they made a total recovery. Assessment, which included neurological, arterial, and cardiac imaging, was within 4 h of admission. A leaflet about TIA with a toll-free telephone number for SOS-TIA was sent to 15 000 family doctors, cardiologists, neurologists, and ophthalmologists in Paris and its administrative region. Endpoints were stroke within 90 days, and stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death within 1 year. FINDINGS: Between January, 2003, and December, 2005, we admitted 1085 patients with suspected TIA; 574 (53%) were seen within 24 h of symptom onset. 701 (65%) patients had confirmed TIA or minor stroke, and 144 (13%) had possible TIA. 108 (17%) of the 643 patients with confirmed TIA had brain tissue damage. Median duration of symptoms was 15 min (IQR 5-75 min). Of the patients with confirmed or possible TIA, all started a stroke prevention programme, 43 (5%) had urgent carotid revascularisation, and 44 (5%) were treated for atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants. 808 (74%) of all patients seen were sent home on the same day. The 90-day stroke rate was 1.24% (95% CI 0.72-2.12), whereas the rate predicted from ABCD(2) scores was 5.96%.

C.",Neurology,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate longitudinal change in the medical decision-making capacity (MDC) of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) under different consent standards. METHODS: Eighty-eight healthy older controls and 116 patients with MCI were administered the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument at baseline and at 1 to 3 (mean = 1.7) annual follow-up visits thereafter. Covariate-adjusted random coefficient regressions were used to examine differences in MDC trajectories across MCI and control participants, as well as to investigate the impact of conversion to Alzheimer disease on MCI patients' MDC trajectories. RESULTS: At baseline, MCI patients performed significantly below controls only on the three clinically relevant standards of appreciation, reasoning, and understanding. Compared with controls, MCI patients experienced significant declines over time on understanding but not on any other consent standard. Conversion affected both the elevation (a decrease in performance) and slope (acceleration in subsequent rate of decline) of MCI patients' MDC trajectories on understanding. A trend emerged for conversion to be associated with a performance decrease on reasoning in the MCI group. CONCLUSIONS: Medical decision-making capacity (MDC) decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a relatively slow but detectable process. Over a 3-year period, patients with amnestic MCI show progressive decline in the ability to understand consent information. This decline accelerates after conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD), reflecting increasing vulnerability to decisional impairment.

J.",Neurology,"OBJECTIVE: Functional or psychogenic movement disorders (FMD) present a diagnostic challenge. To diagnose FMD, clinicians must have experience with signs typical of FMD and distinguishing features from other hyperkinetic disorders. The aim of this study was to clarify the decision-making process of expert clinicians while diagnosing FMD, myoclonus, and tics. METHODS: Thirty-nine movement disorders experts rated 60 patients using a standardized web-based survey resembling clinical practice. It provided 5 steps of incremental information: (1) visual first impression of the patient, (2) medical history, (3) neurologic examination on video, (4) the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), and (5) psychiatric evaluation. After full evaluation of each case, experts were asked which diagnostic step was decisive. In addition, interim switches in diagnosis after each informational step were calculated. RESULTS: After full evaluation, the experts annotated the first impression of the patients as decisive in 18.5% of cases. Medical history was considered decisive in 33.3% of cases. Neurologic examination was considered decisive in 39.7%, the BP in 8%, and the psychiatric interview in 0.5% of cases. Most diagnostic switches occurred after addition of the medical history (34.5%). Addition of the neurologic examination led to 13.8% of diagnostic switches. The BP results led to diagnostic switches in 7.2% of cases. Psychiatric evaluation resulted in the lowest number of diagnostic switches (2.7% of cases). CONCLUSIONS: Experts predominantly rely on clinical assessment to diagnose FMD.

We prospectively assessed medical decision-making capacity (MDC) in patients with MG using a standardized psychometric instrument. METHODS: Participants were 22 healthy controls and 26 patients with histologically verified MG. Group performance was compared on the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument (CCTI), a psychometric measure of MDC incorporating 4 standards (choice, understanding, reasoning, and appreciation), and on neuropsychological and demographic variables. Capacity outcomes (capable, marginally capable, or incapable) on the CCTI standards were identified for the MG group. Within the MG group, scores on demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological variables were correlated with scores on each CCTI standard, and significant bivariate correlates were subsequently entered into exploratory stepwise regression analyses to identify multivariate cognitive predictors of the CCTI standards. RESULTS: Patients with MG performed significantly below controls on consent standards of understanding and reasoning, and showed a trend on appreciation. Relative to controls, more than 50% of the patients with MG demonstrated capacity compromise (marginally capable or incapable outcomes) in MDC. In the MG group, cognitive measures of verbal acquisition/recall and, to a lesser extent, semantic fluency predicted performance on the appreciation, reasoning, and understanding standards. Karnofsky score was also associated with CCTI performance. CONCLUSIONS: Soon after diagnosis, patients with malignant glioma (MG) have impaired capacity to make treatment decisions relative to controls.

METHODS: We generated a list of factors potentially influential in acute stroke decision-making: uncertainty, patient demographics that may predispose to bias (age, sex, comorbidities), physician experiences and beliefs, and systems factors. An online survey was distributed to neurologists in the province of Ontario, Canada, to assess the influence of these elements. A response rate of 69% was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent (79%) of respondents were less likely to administer IV tPA to patients with dementia, and many were less likely to treat patients from nursing homes, with more severe strokes, or over age 80. All respondents recognized the presence of diagnostic uncertainty, and 87% believed that uncertainty in interpreting advanced imaging affected their use of tPA. The majority of respondents (70%) believed that a large left middle cerebral artery territory stroke was a fate worse than death. Four percent did not believe that IV tPA is an effective treatment for stroke.

METHODS: A total of 177 participants (111 persons with TBI and 66 healthy controls) were recruited from an inpatient/outpatient TBI rehabilitation unit and outpatient neurology department. Participants with TBI were classified by injury severity into subgroups: mild TBI (mTBI; n = 28), complicated mild TBI (cmTBI; n = 23), and moderate/severe TBI (msevTBI; n = 60). Control and TBI groups were compared at 1 month (t1), 6 months (t2), and 12 months (t3) postinjury using the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument (CCTI), which evaluates MDC using 5 consent standards: expressing choice, reasonable choice, appreciation, reasoning, and understanding. RESULTS: Relative to controls, no TBI group displayed impairment on CCTI expressing choice or reasonable choice at any timepoint. Those with mTBI had reduced appreciation and understanding at t1, which resolved by t2. The cmTBI and msevTBI groups were impaired on all 3 complex consent standards at t1. While patients with cmTBI improved to a level similar to controls by t3, those with msevTBI remained impaired on reasoning and understanding. Across all TBI groups, notable MDC improvement only occurred over the first 6 months postinjury. CONCLUSIONS: Over 1 year, most individuals with mTBI or cmTBI regain MDC, while many individuals with msevTBI have lingering deficits in reasoning and comprehension of treatment information.

Larriviere_2008_Neur,JOUR,Invited Article: Threats to physician autonomy in a performance-based reimbursement system,"Larriviere, Daniel G. and Bernat, James L.",Neurology,"Physician autonomy is currently threatened by the external application of pay for performance standards and required conformity to practice guidelines. This phenomenon is being driven by concerns over the economic viability of increasing per capita health care expenditures without a concomitant rise in favorable health outcomes and by the unjustified marked variations among physicians' practice patterns. Proponents contend that altering the reimbursement system to encourage physicians to make choices based upon the best available evidence would be one way to ensure better outcomes per health care dollar spent. Although physician autonomy is most easily justified when decisions are made by appealing to the best available evidence, incentivizing decision-making risks sacrificing physician autonomy to political and social forces if the limitations of evidence-based medicine are not respected. Any reimbursement system designed to encourage physicians to utilize the best available evidence by providing financial incentives must recognize physicians who try to play to the numbers as well as physicians who refuse to follow the best available evidence if doing so would conflict with good medicine or patient preferences.

Here, we characterize the dynamic changes in brain connectivity profiles inflicted by sleep deprivation and how they deviate from regular daily variability. To this end, we obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 60 young, adult male participants, scanned in the morning and evening of the same day and again the following morning. 41 participants underwent total sleep deprivation before the third scan, whereas the remainder had another night of regular sleep. Sleep deprivation strongly altered the connectivity of several resting-state networks, including dorsal attention, default mode, and hippocampal networks. Multivariate classification based on connectivity profiles predicted deprivation state with high accuracy, corroborating the robustness of the findings on an individual level.

RESULTS: This position paper reviews and compares the components of sports-related concussion laws, including education, removal from play, and clearance for return to play. It highlights the challenges privacy laws present relevant to providing care to concussed athletes and suggests ways to help physicians overcome these obstacles. The report also explores the ethical considerations physicians should bear in mind as they evaluate and manage concussed athletes, addressing them through a framework that includes considerations of professionalism, informed decision-making, patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, conflicts of interest, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians caring for concussed athletes have an ethical obligation to ensure that their primary responsibility is to safeguard the current and future physical and mental health of their patients. Physicians have a duty to provide athletes and their parents with information about concussion risk factors, symptoms, and the risks for postconcussion neurologic impairments. Physicians should facilitate informed and shared decision-making among athletes, parents, and medical teams while protecting athletes from potential harm.

Errors that occur during spatial normalization can influence hypothesis testing due to the dimensionalities of mapping algorithms and anatomical manifolds (landmarks, curves, surfaces, volumes) used to drive the mapping algorithms. The primary aim of this paper is to improve statistical inference using multiple anatomical manifolds and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithms. We propose that combining information generated by the various manifolds and algorithms improves the reliability of hypothesis testing. We used this unified approach to assess variation in the thickness of the cingulate gyrus in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects. Three different LDDMM algorithms for mapping landmarks, curves and triangulated meshes were used to transform thickness maps of the cingulate surfaces into an atlas coordinate system. We then tested for group differences by combining the information from the three types of anatomical manifolds and LDDMM mapping algorithms.

However, these advances have not benefitted all populations equally. A growing body of evidence indicates that barriers to care fall along racial and ethnic lines, with persons from minority groups frequently having lower rates of evaluation, diagnosis, and intervention, and consequently experiencing worse neurologic outcomes than their white counterparts. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) challenged its 2017 Diversity Leadership Program cohort to determine what the AAN can do to improve quality of care for racially and ethnically diverse patients with neurologic disorders. Developing a fuller understanding of the effect of disparities in neurologic care (neurodisparity) on patients is an important prerequisite for creating meaningful change. Clear insight into how bias and trust affect the doctor-patient relationship is also crucial to grasp the complexity of this issue. We propose that the AAN take a vital step toward achieving equity in neurologic care by enhancing health literacy, patient education, and shared decision-making with a focus on internet and social media. Moreover, by further strengthening its focus on health disparities research and training, the AAN can continue to inform the field and aid in the development of current and future leaders who will address neurodisparity.

METHODS: The authors systematically reviewed literature from January 2003 to August 2017 and developed practice recommendations using the American Academy of Neurology 2011 process, as amended. RESULTS: Fifteen Class I-III studies on migraine prevention in children and adolescents met inclusion criteria. There is insufficient evidence to determine if children and adolescents receiving divalproex, onabotulinumtoxinA, amitriptyline, nimodipine, or flunarizine are more or less likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving propranolol are possibly more likely than those receiving placebo to have an at least 50% reduction in headache frequency. Children and adolescents receiving topiramate and cinnarizine are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving amitriptyline plus cognitive behavioral therapy are more likely than those receiving amitriptyline plus headache education to have a reduction in headache frequency. RECOMMENDATIONS: The majority of randomized controlled trials studying the efficacy of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. Recommendations for the prevention of migraine in children include counseling on lifestyle and behavioral factors that influence headache frequency and assessment and management of comorbid disorders associated with headache persistence.

In the isointense stage (approximately 6-8 months of age), WM and GM exhibit similar levels of intensity in both T1 and T2 MR images, making the tissue segmentation very challenging. Only a small number of existing methods have been designed for tissue segmentation in this isointense stage; however, they only used a single T1 or T2 images, or the combination of T1 and T2 images. In this paper, we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting isointense stage brain tissues using multi-modality MR images. CNNs are a type of deep models in which trainable filters and local neighborhood pooling operations are applied alternatingly on the raw input images, resulting in a hierarchy of increasingly complex features. Specifically, we used multi-modality information from T1, T2, and fractional anisotropy (FA) images as inputs and then generated the segmentation maps as outputs. The multiple intermediate layers applied convolution, pooling, normalization, and other operations to capture the highly nonlinear mappings between inputs and outputs. We compared the performance of our approach with that of the commonly used segmentation methods on a set of manually segmented isointense stage brain images. Results showed that our proposed model significantly outperformed prior methods on infant brain tissue segmentation.

L.",NeuroImage,"Both normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases cause morphological changes to the brain. Age-related brain changes are subtle, nonlinear, and spatially and temporally heterogenous, both within a subject and across a population. Machine learning models are particularly suited to capture these patterns and can produce a model that is sensitive to changes of interest, despite the large variety in healthy brain appearance. In this paper, the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the rich UK Biobank dataset, the largest database currently available, are harnessed to address the problem of predicting brain age. We developed a 3D CNN architecture to predict chronological age, using a training dataset of 12,802 T1-weighted MRI images and a further 6,885 images for testing. The proposed method shows competitive performance on age prediction, but, most importantly, the CNN prediction errors <ce><94>(BrainAge)=Age(Predicted)-Age(True) correlated significantly with many clinical measurements from the UK Biobank in the female and male groups. In addition, having used images from only one imaging modality in this experiment, we examined the relationship between <ce><94>(BrainAge) and the image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from all other imaging modalities in the UK Biobank, showing correlations consistent with known patterns of ageing. Furthermore, we show that the use of nonlinearly registered images to train CNNs can lead to the network being driven by artefacts of the registration process and missing subtle indicators of ageing, limiting the clinical relevance. Due to the longitudinal aspect of the UK Biobank study, in the future it will be possible to explore whether the <ce><94>(BrainAge) from models such as this network were predictive of any health outcomes.",2021,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117401,224,NA,117401,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Phenotype and *Aging and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Imaging, Three-Dimensional and Convolutional neural networks and Brain/*diagnostic imaging and Brain aging and UK Biobank",NA,NA,2021/01/01/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA

Group differences in performance on the CCTI and neuropsychological variables were examined. In addition, the capacity status (capable, marginally capable, or incapable) of each MCI participant on each CCTI standard was examined using cut scores derived from control performance. RESULTS: Patients with MCI performed comparably to controls on minimal consent standards requiring merely expressing a treatment choice (S1) or making the reasonable treatment choice [S2], but significantly below controls on the three clinically relevant standards of appreciation (S3), reasoning (S4), and understanding (S5). In turn, the MCI group performed significantly better than the mild AD group on [S2], S4, and S5. Regarding capacity status, patients with MCI showed a progressive pattern of capacity compromise (marginally capable and incapable outcomes) related to stringency of consent standard. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) demonstrate significant impairments on clinically relevant abilities associated with capacity to consent to treatment.

In children and adolescents, neuroenhancement appears to be increasing in parallel to the rising rates of attention-deficit disorder diagnoses and stimulant medication prescriptions, and the opportunities for medication diversion. Pediatric neuroenhancement remains a particularly unsettled and value-laden practice, often without appropriate goals or justification. Pediatric neuroenhancement presents its own ethical, social, legal, and developmental issues, including the fiduciary responsibility of physicians caring for children, the special integrity of the doctor-child-parent relationship, the vulnerability of children to various forms of coercion, distributive justice in school settings, and the moral obligation of physicians to prevent misuse of medication. Neurodevelopmental issues include the importance of evolving personal authenticity during childhood and adolescence, the emergence of individual decision-making capacities, and the process of developing autonomy. This Ethics, Law, and Humanities Committee position paper, endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology, Child Neurology Society, and American Neurological Association, focuses on various implications of pediatric neuroenhancement and outlines discussion points in responding to neuroenhancement requests from parents or adolescents. Based on currently available data and the balance of ethics issues reviewed in this position paper, neuroenhancement in legally and developmentally nonautonomous children and adolescents without a diagnosis of a neurologic disorder is not justifiable.

Such data might provide insights which augment patient care, and may be instructive regarding medical education, since patient-related telephone calls are often addressed by physicians-in-training. METHODS: Characteristics of patient-related calls to a movement disorders center were prospectively recorded during a 2-month period. RESULTS: A total of 633 calls were generated by 397 patients. The average time per call was 6.6 +/- 4.7 minutes. Disease-related questions (35.1%), treatment-related questions (21.3%), and side effect reports (15.3%) represented the majority of calls. Patients with Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome (TS), and atypical parkinsonism (AP) called more frequently, while patients with dystonia and tremor called less frequently. CONCLUSION: Patient telephone calls contribute substantially to the patient care in a movement disorders center and represent an important aspect of training, providing an opportunity for movement disorders fellows to develop independent decision-making skills and monitor effectiveness of their physician-patient counseling. Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome (TS), and atypical parkinsonism (AP) contribute disproportionately to the total patient telephone volume, possibly due to coexisting obsessive-compulsive and impulse-control comorbidities in patients with TS, and complications or a change of diagnosis and prognosis in patients with AP.

METHODS: Proposals for the use of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid stenting (CAS), and medical therapy for stroke prevention in women with carotid stenosis were provided by a group of 9 international experts with consensus method. RESULTS: Symptomatic women with severe carotid stenosis can be managed by CEA provided that the perioperative risk of the operators is low (<4%). Periprocedural stroke risks may be increased in symptomatic women if revascularization is performed by CAS; however, the choice of CAS vs CEA can be tailored in subgroups best fit for each procedure (e.g., women with restenosis or severe coronary disease, best suited for CAS; women with tortuous vessels or old age, best suited for CEA). There is currently limited evidence to consider medical therapy alone as the best choice for women with neurologically severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis, who should be best managed within randomized trials including a medical arm. Medical management and cardiovascular risk factor control must be implemented in all women with carotid stenosis in periprocedural period and lifelong regardless of whether or not intervention is planned.

However, the popular existing pediatric brain atlases (e.g., National Institutes of Health pediatric atlases, NIH-PD) are mostly based on MR images obtained from Caucasian populations and thus are not ideal for the characterization of the brains of Chinese children due to neuroanatomical differences related to genetic and environmental factors. Here, we use an unbiased template construction algorithm to create a set of age-specific Chinese pediatric (CHN-PD) atlases based on high-quality T1-and T2-weighted MR images from 328 cognitively normal Chinese children aged 6-12 years. The CHN-PD brain atlases include asymmetric and symmetric templates, sex-specific templates and tissue probability templates, and contain multiple age-specific templates at one-year intervals. A direct comparison of the CHN-PD and NIH-PD atlases reveals dramatic anatomical differences mainly in the bilateral frontal and parietal regions.

Usually, a full dose radioactive tracer is required to obtain high-quality PET images for clinical needs. This inevitably raises concerns about potential health hazards. On the other hand, dose reduction may cause the increased noise in the reconstructed PET images, which impacts the image quality to a certain extent. In this paper, in order to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the high quality of PET images, we propose a novel method based on 3D conditional generative adversarial networks (3D c-GANs) to estimate the high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) include a generator network and a discriminator network which are trained simultaneously with the goal of one beating the other. Similar to GANs, in the proposed 3D c-GANs, we condition the model on an input low-dose PET image and generate a corresponding output full-dose PET image. Specifically, to render the same underlying information between the low-dose and full-dose PET images, a 3D U-net-like deep architecture which can combine hierarchical features by using skip connection is designed as the generator network to synthesize the full-dose image. In order to guarantee the synthesized PET image to be close to the real one, we take into account of the estimation error loss in addition to the discriminator feedback to train the generator network. Furthermore, a concatenated 3D c-GANs based progressive refinement scheme is also proposed to further improve the quality of estimated images. Validation was done on a real human brain dataset including both the normal subjects and the subjects diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Experimental results show that our proposed 3D c-GANs method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",2018,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.045,174,NA,550-562,eng,1095-9572 1053-8119,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Reproducibility of Results and Deep Learning and Radiation Dosage and Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods and Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods and Brain/*diagnostic imaging and Signal-To-Noise Ratio and 3D conditional GANs (3D c-GANs) and Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Image estimation and Low-dose PET and Positron emission tomography (PET)",NA,NA,2018/07/01/,Neuroimage,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kelly_2010_Neur,JOUR,Health state preferences and decision-making after malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions,"Kelly, Adam G. and Holloway, Robert G.",Neurology,"OBJECTIVES: Despite recent trials demonstrating improved functional outcomes in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery ischemic strokes treated with hemicraniectomy, survivors still experience significant stroke-related disability. The value assigned to health states with significant disability varies widely and may influence decisions regarding hemicraniectomy. METHODS: A medical decision analysis was used to evaluate the results of recent hemicraniectomy trials in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Survival data and probability of various functional outcome states (modified Rankin score 2-3 or 4-5) at 1 year were abstracted from clinical trial data. Utility scores for modified Rankin states were abstracted from literature sources. Sensitivity analyses were performed to study results over a wide range of utility values. All modeling was performed on TreeAge Pro software. RESULTS: The hemicraniectomy treatment pathway was associated with more quality-adjusted life-years over the first year than the medical management pathway (0.414 vs 0.145). Hemicraniectomy remained the preferred option except when the utility associated with the possible outcome states dropped considerably (0.72 to 0.40 for Rankin 2-3, and 0.41 to 0.04 for Rankin 4-5), or when 1-week surgical mortality increased considerably (5% to 67%).

Increased understanding of MS and its pathology, coupled with general concern that the original descriptors may not adequately reflect more recently identified clinical aspects of the disease, prompted a re-examination of MS disease phenotypes by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS.

C.",Neurology,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate medical decision-making capacity (MDC) in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) across a range of injury severity. METHODS: We evaluated MDC cross-sectionally 1 month after injury in 40 healthy controls and 86 patients with TBI stratified by injury severity (28 mild [mTBI], 15 complicated mild [cmTBI], 43 moderate/severe [msevTBI]). We compared group performance on the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument and its 5 consent standards (expressing choice, reasonable choice, appreciation, reasoning, understanding). Capacity impairment ratings (no impairment, mild/moderate impairment, severe impairment) on the consent standards were also assigned to each participant with TBI using cut scores referenced to control performance. RESULTS: One month after injury, the mTBI group performed equivalently to controls on all consent standards. In contrast, the cmTBI group was impaired relative to controls on the understanding standard. No differences emerged between the mTBI and cmTBI groups. The msevTBI group was impaired on almost all standards relative to both control and mTBI groups, and on the understanding standard relative to the cmTBI group. Capacity compromise (mild/moderate or severe impairment ratings) on the 3 clinically complex standards (understanding, reasoning, appreciation) occurred in 10%-30% of patients with mTBI, 50% of patients with cmTBI, and 50%-80% of patients with msevTBI.

The goal of this research was to ascertain the opinions regarding SFTID that are held by neurologists who are interested in ethics and end-of-life care. METHODS: Members of the American Academy of Neurology Ethics Section were surveyed regarding their familiarity and experience with SFTID and their opinions pertaining to it. To determine whether their opinions varied in relationship to clinical context, a single stem question for 5 different case scenarios was used. RESULTS: A total of 96% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the primary purpose of SFTID was to relieve suffering, 83% disagreed or strongly disagreed that SFTID was morally equivalent to euthanasia, and 85% disagreed or strongly disagreed that SFTID was legally equivalent to euthanasia. For the case scenarios, 92% agreed or strongly agreed that SFTID was acceptable for imminently dying patients with metastatic cancer, while 50% agreed or strongly agreed that SFTID was acceptable for patients with end-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and only 7% agreed or strongly agreed that SFTID was acceptable for posttraumatic quadriplegic patients not at risk for imminent death.

These guidelines represent the work of MS experts, patients, and guideline experts and are based on their review of randomized controlled trials and observational evidence that addresses a set of prespecified questions related to starting, switching, and potentially discontinuing DMTs. Many of the recommendations address decision-making regarding the use of DMTs and incorporate the perspective of patients. Modified Delphi methods were used to establish consensus recommendations that were assigned a level of clinical obligation (actions a clinician must [A], should [B], or may [C] do). Most guideline recommendations are level B. Few reached level A, and several achieved only level C, primarily because of lack of evidence. The guidelines eschew formal treatment algorithms and do not address financial considerations and a variety of other controversies. We identify remaining uncertainties, the most important of which is the choice of available DMTs for the average newly diagnosed patient. We reiterate a number of research needs identified in the guidelines that could affect the use of DMTs, including improved definition of breakthrough disease requiring change in therapy, development of better and universally accepted definitions of both benign and aggressive MS, more and longer-duration comparative effectiveness trials, discovery and validation of biomarkers of disease activity and response to therapy, and development of treatment strategies focused on neuroprotection, remyelination, and neural repair.",2018,10.1212/WNL.0000000000005574,90,24,1106-1112,eng,1526-632X 0028-3878,"Humans and Treatment Outcome and Societies, Medical and Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards and Multiple Sclerosis/*therapy and Neurology/organization & administration/*standards",NA,NA,2018/06/12/,Neurology,NA,NA,NA,NA

We endorse the renaming of ""permanent"" vegetative state to ""chronic"" vegetative state given the increased frequency of reports of late improvements but suggest that further refinement of this class of patients is necessary to distinguish late recoveries from patients who were misdiagnosed or in cognitive-motor dissociation. Additional nosologic clarity and prognostic refinement is necessary to preclude overestimation of low probability events. We argue that the new descriptor ""unaware wakefulness syndrome"" is no clearer than ""vegetative state"" in expressing the mismatch between apparent behavioral unawareness when patients have covert consciousness or cognitive motor dissociation. We advocate routine universal pain precautions as an important element of neuropalliative care for these patients given the risk of covert consciousness. In medical decision-making, we endorse the use of advance directives and the importance of clear and understandable communication with surrogates. We show the value of incorporating a learning health care system so as to promote therapeutic innovation.

Neurologic disorders accompany these complex humanitarian emergencies but often go unheeded, exacerbated by a scarcity of neurologists. Teleneurology offers the promise of neurologic care remotely in the face of this inadequate local clinician supply. We describe our experiences as voluntary neurology teleconsultants with Medecins Sans Frontieres in order to highlight both the promises and challenges of teleneurology in humanitarian contexts. We identified the major advantages of this service as (1) minimal resources and incurred costs while (2) changing a patient's clinical course favorably, and (3) creating a community for the field referrer and neurology specialist. Current challenges include (1) limited diagnostic resources and difficult diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making, (2) need for greater continuity and familiarity between the field site and neurologist, (3) gaps in the US neurology curriculum to provide expertise for all sites, (4) lack of follow-up and feedback from the field to advise future cases, and (5) low frequency of consultations. Growth opportunities include eventual expansion to the development of a community of neurologists who can provide context-specific care and maximize use of multimedia at low Internet bandwidth.

METHODS: Members of the American Academy of Neurology with an aging, dementia, or behavioral neurology practice focus were surveyed by self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Survey respondents were 420 providers (response rate 48%), and 88% reported at least monthly encounters with patients experiencing mild cognitive symptoms. Most respondents recognize MCI as a clinical diagnosis (90%) and use its diagnostic code for billing purposes (70%). When seeing these patients, most respondents routinely provide counseling on physical (78%) and mental exercise (75%) and communicate about dementia risk (63%); fewer provide information on support services (27%) or a written summary of findings (15%). Most (70%) prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors at least sometimes for this population, with memantine (39%) and other agents (e.g., vitamin E) prescribed less frequently. Respondents endorsed several benefits of a diagnosis of MCI: 1) involving the patient in planning for the future (87%); 2) motivating risk reduction activities (85%); 3) helping with financial planning (72%); and 4) prescribing medications (65%).

We aimed to develop a new Web-based methodology to assist physicians in identifying patients who might benefit from an epilepsy surgery evaluation. METHODS: The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used. Clinical scenarios were developed based on eligibility criteria from previously published surgical series. Thirteen national experts rated the scenarios for their appropriateness for an epilepsy surgery evaluation based on published evidence. All scenarios were rerated after a face-to-face meeting following a modified Delphi process. Appropriate scenarios were rerated for necessity to determine referral priority. RESULTS: Of the final 2646 scenarios, 20.6% (n = 544) were appropriate, 17.2% (n = 456) uncertain, and 61.5% (n = 1626) inappropriate for a surgical evaluation. Of the appropriate cases, 55.9% (n = 306) were rated as very high priority. Not attempting AED treatment was always rated as inappropriate for a referral. Trial of 2 AEDs was usually rated as appropriate unless seizure-free or not fully investigated Based on these data, a Web-based decision tool (www.epilepsycases.com) was created. CONCLUSIONS: Using the available evidence through 2008 and expert consensus, we developed a Web-based decision tool that provides a guide for determining candidacy for epilepsy surgery evaluations.

METHODS: Study participants presented to the emergency department with suspected mTBI (n = 277) with a CT and MRI scan and healthy controls (n = 49). Plasma concentrations of tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1, and neurofilament light chain (NFL) were measured using the single-molecule array technology. RESULTS: Concentrations of GFAP, tau, and NFL were higher in patients with mTBI, compared with those of controls (p's < 0.01). GFAP yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.96), confirming its discriminatory power for distinguishing mTBI from controls. Levels of GFAP, tau, and NFL were higher in patients with trauma-related intracranial findings on CT compared with those with normal CT, with the only significant predictor being GFAP (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.84). Among patients with mTBI, tau, NFL, and GFAP differentiated subjects with and without MRI abnormalities with an AUC of 0.83, with GFAP being the strongest predictor. Combining tau, NFL, and GFAP showed a good discriminatory power (AUC 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.90) for detecting MRI abnormalities, even in patients with mTBI with a normal CT. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms GFAP as a promising marker of brain injury in patients with acute mTBI. A combination of various biomarkers linked to different pathophysiologic mechanisms increases diagnostic subgroup accuracy. This multimarker strategy may guide medical decision making, facilitate the use of MRI scanning, and prove valuable in the stratification of patients with brain injuries in future clinical trials.

METHODS: AD pattern similarity (AD-PS) scores, developed by supervised machine learning and validated with MRI data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative, was used to capture high-dimensional gray matter atrophy in brain areas vulnerable to AD (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, inferior temporal lobe areas and midbrain). Based on participants' addresses and air monitoring data, we implemented a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average exposure to PM(2.5) preceding MRI-1. General linear models were used to examine the association between PM(2.5) and AD-PS scores (baseline and 5-year standardized change), accounting for potential confounders and white matter lesion volumes. RESULTS: For 1365 women aged 77.9<c2><b1>3.7 years in 2005-6, there was no association between PM(2.5) and baseline AD-PS score in cross-sectional analyses (<ce><b2>=-0.004; 95% CI: -0.019, 0.011). Longitudinally, each interquartile range increase of PM(2.5) (2.82-<c2><b5>g/m(3)) was associated with increased AD-PS scores during the follow-up, equivalent to a 24% (hazard ratio=1.24; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.34) increase in AD risk over 5-years (n=712; aged 77.4<c2><b1>3.5 years).

CONCLUSIONS: Late-life exposure to PM(2.5) is associated with increased neuroanatomical risk of AD, which may not be explained by available indicators of cerebrovascular damage.",2020,10.1212/WNL.0000000000011149,96,8,1201-e1190,eng,1526-632X 0028-3878,NA,NA,NA,2020/11/18/,Neurology,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) or in minimally conscious state (MCS) were enrolled within 3 months from their brain injury in 12 specialized medical institutions. Demographic, anamnestic, clinical, and neurophysiologic data were collected at study entry. Patients were then followed up for assessing the primary outcome, that is, clinical diagnosis according to standardized criteria at 6 months postinjury. RESULTS: We enrolled 147 patients (44 women; mean age 49.4 [95% confidence interval 46.1-52.6] years; VS/UWS 71, MCS 76; traumatic 55, vascular 56, anoxic 36; mean time postinjury 59.6 [55.4-63.6] days). The 6-month follow-up was complete for 143 patients (VS/UWS 70; MCS 73). With respect to study entry, the clinical diagnosis improved in 72 patients (VS/UWS 27; MCS 45). Younger age, shorter time postinjury, higher Coma Recovery Scale-Revised total score, and presence of EEG reactivity to eye opening at study entry predicted better outcome, whereas etiology, clinical diagnosis, Disability Rating Scale score, EEG background activity, acoustic reactivity, and P300 on event-related potentials were not associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal assessment could identify patients with higher likelihood of clinical improvement in order to help clinicians, families, and funding sources with various aspects of decision-making. This multicenter, international study aims to stimulate further research that drives international consensus regarding standardization of prognostic procedures for patients with DoC.",2020,10.1212/WNL.0000000000010254,95,11,e1488-e1499,eng,1526-632X 0028-3878,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Time Factors and Longitudinal Studies and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Prognosis and Follow-Up Studies and Brain Injuries/complications/*diagnosis/*physiopathology and Consciousness Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology and Electroencephalography/trends,NA,NA,2020/09/15/,Neurology,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kerrigan_2014_Neur,JOUR,Mental incapacity in patients undergoing neuro-oncologic treatment: a cross-sectional study,"Kerrigan, Simon and Erridge, Sara and Liaquat, Imran and Graham, Cat and Grant, Robin",Neurology,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of mental incapacity to make neuro-oncologic treatment decisions and to identify patients likely to experience difficulty with medical decision-making to enable a more rigorous and focused assessment. METHODS: The preoperative mental capacity to give valid consent to neurosurgery of 100 patients with radiologically suspected intracranial tumors was assessed. Mental capacity was formally assessed using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MACCAT-T) conducted by a dual-qualified physician and lawyer. To assess the relationship between cognition and mental capacity, cognitive function was assessed after the MACCAT-T interview using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-revised (ACE-R). Decisions about capacity made by the assessor were compared with the informal assessment of capacity of the neurosurgical team. RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 25 were identified by the assessor as lacking the necessary mental capacity to give valid consent to neurosurgery. Mental incapacity was most common among patients with World Health Organization grade IV tumors (38%) and was more common in men than women (36% of men lacked capacity vs 14% of women). Patients lacking mental capacity were significantly more cognitively impaired than those with capacity (median [interquartile range (IQR)] total ACE-R of 44 [0, 65.5] for incapable patients compared with a median [IQR] total ACE-R score of 88 [82, 95] for patients with capacity). Of 25 patients found to lack capacity by the assessor, 13 (52%) were identified as lacking capacity by the neurosurgical team and were treated under the provisions of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. A score of <4/7 in the semantic verbal fluency subset of the ACE-R (naming up to 10 animals in 1 minute) was predictive of incapacity (96% sensitivity, 63% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Mental incapacity in patients with intracranial tumors is common and is underestimated by clinicians seeking consent for neuro-oncologic treatment. Cognitive impairment is associated with incapacity. We propose a simple, brief cognitive screening test to identify patients who warrant a more rigorous interrogation of their mental capacity as part of the process of seeking consent for neuro-oncologic treatment.",2014,10.1212/WNL.0000000000000671,83,6,537-541,eng,1526-632X 0028-3878,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Treatment Outcome and Mental Competency/*psychology and Informed Consent/*psychology and Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*psychology/*surgery and Mental Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology and Neurosurgical Procedures/*psychology and Preoperative Care/methods/psychology,NA,NA,2014/08/05/,Neurology,NA,NA,NA,NA
