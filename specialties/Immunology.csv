For example, autoantibodies combined with other multi-analyte ""omic"" profiles will form the basis of disease prediction allowing for earlier intervention linked to disease prevention strategies, as well as earlier, effective and personalized interventions for established disease. As medical intervention moves to disease prediction and a model of ""intent to PREVENT,"" diagnostics will include an early symptom/risk-based, as opposed to a disease-based approach. Newer diagnostic platforms that utilize emerging megatrends such as deep learning and artificial intelligence and close the gaps in autoantibody diagnostics will benefit from paradigm shifts thereby facilitating the PH agenda.",2018,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02682,9,NA,2682,eng,1664-3224,precision medicine and Humans and Risk Factors and Artificial Intelligence and Early Diagnosis and Mass Spectrometry and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Precision Medicine/*methods and Mass Screening/methods and Biomarkers/analysis and biomarkers and autoantibodies and Autoantibodies/*analysis and Autoimmune Diseases/*diagnosis/economics/*prevention & control/therapy and autoimmunity and Fluorescent Antibody Technique and Luminescence and precision health,NA,NA,2018///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we profiled host responses to COVID-19 by performing plasma proteomics of a cohort of COVID-19 patients, including non-survivors and survivors recovered from mild or severe symptoms, and uncovered numerous COVID-19-associated alterations of plasma proteins. We developed a machine-learning-based pipeline to identify 11 proteins as biomarkers and a set of biomarker combinations, which were validated by an independent cohort and accurately distinguished and predicted COVID-19 outcomes. Some of the biomarkers were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a larger cohort. These markedly altered proteins, including the biomarkers, mediate pathophysiological pathways, such as immune or inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation and coagulation, and metabolism, that likely contribute to the pathogenesis.

Nakamori_2020_Frinim,JOUR,Immune Deregulation in Sepsis and Septic Shock: Reversing Immune Paralysis by Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway,"Nakamori, Yuki and Park, Eun Jeong and Shimaoka, Motomu",Frontiers in immunology,"Sepsis remains a major problem for human health worldwide, thereby manifesting high rates of morbidity and mortality. Sepsis, once understood as a monophasic sustained hyperinflammation, is currently recognized as a dysregulated host response to infection, with both hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis occurring simultaneously from the earliest stages of sepsis, involving multiple organ dysfunctions. Despite the recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying sepsis, no specific treatment to restore immune dysregulation in sepsis has been validated in clinical trials. In recent years, treatment for immune checkpoints such as the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand (PD-1/PD-L) pathway in tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes has been successful in the field of cancer immune therapy. As immune-paralysis in sepsis involves exhausted T-lymphocytes, future clinical applications of checkpoint inhibitors for sepsis are expected. In addition, the functions of PD-1/PD-L on innate lymphoid cells and the role of exosomal forms of PD-L1 warrant further research. Looking back on the history of repeatedly failed clinical trials of immune modulatory therapies for sepsis, sepsis must be recognized as a difficult disease entity for performing clinical trials. A major obstacle that could prevent effective clinical trials of drug candidates is the disease complexity and heterogeneities; clinically diagnosed sepsis could contain multiple sepsis subgroups that suffer different levels of hyper-inflammation and immune-suppression in distinct organs. Thus, the selection of appropriate more homogenous sepsis subgroup is the key for testing the clinical efficacy of experimental therapies targeting specific pathways in either hyperinflammation and/or immunoparalysis. An emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) may help to identify an immune paralysis subgroup who would best be treated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors.",2020,10.3389/fimmu.2020.624279,11,NA,624279,eng,1664-3224,"machine learning and artificial intelligence and Humans and Animals and *Immune Tolerance and B7-H1 Antigen/*immunology and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/therapeutic use and immune checkpoints inhibitors and immunomodulation and immunoparalysis and PD-1 and PD-L and Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*immunology and sepsis - diagnostics and Shock, Septic/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology",NA,NA,2020///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Knipping, Karen and Houben, Geert F. and Verschuren, Lars and Meijerink, Marjolein and Krishnan, Shaji",Frontiers in immunology,"A healthy immune status is strongly conditioned during early life stages. Insights into the molecular drivers of early life immune development and function are prerequisite to identify strategies to enhance immune health. Even though several starting points for targeted immune modulation have been identified and are being developed into prophylactic or therapeutic approaches, there is no regulatory guidance on how to assess the risk and benefit balance of such interventions. Six early life immune causal networks, each compromising a different time period in early life (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester of gestations, birth, newborn, and infant period), were generated. Thereto information was extracted and structured from early life literature using the automated text mining and machine learning tool: Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA). The tool identified relevant entities (e.g., genes/proteins/metabolites/processes/diseases), extracted causal relationships among these entities, and assembled them into early life-immune causal networks. These causal early life immune networks were denoised using GeneMania, enriched with data from the gene-disease association database DisGeNET and Gene Ontology resource tools (GO/GO-SLIM), inferred missing relationships and added expert knowledge to generate information-dense early life immune networks. Analysis of the six early life immune networks by PageRank, not only confirmed the central role of the ""commonly used immune markers"" (e.g., chemokines, interleukins, IFN, TNF, TGFB, and other immune activation regulators (e.g., CD55, FOXP3, GATA3, CD79A, C4BPA), but also identified less obvious candidates (e.g., CYP1A2, FOXK2, NELFCD, RENBP). Comparison of the different early life periods resulted in the prediction of 11 key early life genes overlapping all early life periods (TNF, IL6, IL10, CD4, FOXP3, IL4, NELFCD, CD79A, IL5, RENBP, and IFNG), and also genes that were only described in certain early life period(s). Concluding, here we describe a network-based approach that provides a science-based and systematical method to explore the functional development of the early life immune system through time. This systems approach aids the generation of a testing strategy for the safety and efficacy of early life immune modulation by predicting the key candidate markers during different phases of early life immune development.",2020,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00644,11,NA,644,eng,1664-3224,"machine learning and text mining and Humans and Infant and Machine Learning and Animals and Biomarkers and Infant, Newborn and Disease Models, Animal and Gene Regulatory Networks and Computational Biology/*methods and Child Development/*physiology and biomarkers and Chemokines/genetics and Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/genetics/metabolism and early life and Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics and immune networks and Immune System Diseases/genetics and Immune System/*physiology",NA,NA,2020///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lambert_2018_Frinim,JOUR,Education in Vaccinology: An Important Tool for Strengthening Global Health,"Lambert, Paul-Henri and Podda, Audino",Frontiers in immunology,"Over the past 20 years, education of scientists and public health professionals in Vaccinology has increased dramatically. There are now many international, regional, and national courses that provide education in vaccinology. The proliferation of these courses and the high number of applications submitted demonstrate the increasing and continuous need for improved education in this field since, generally, comprehensive vaccinology training is not offered to medical and/or biological sciences students as part of their Universities courses and consequently there is insufficient knowledge of vaccine topics among health-care providers. Multidisciplinary vaccinology courses have not only educational purposes but they may also contribute to strengthening the development, testing, and use of vaccines, which remain the most efficient tool for infectious disease prevention. The courses available have a varied focus and prioritize topics based on the trainees' different levels of professional exposure and requirements. Overall, they might be classified in two key categories: (i) courses targeting students who, after their university studies in Medicine, Biology, etc., develop a strong interest in vaccines, would like to learn more about the various aspects of vaccinology, and potentially develop a career in this field (postgraduate courses); (ii) courses targeting postdoctoral professionals, who already have a sufficiently broad knowledge of vaccinology, but would like to develop stronger skills to be able to play a leading role in decision-making for vaccine development (advanced professional courses). Both postgraduate and professional courses are available and are based on comprehensive curricula. In the future, particular attention should be paid to include in the training curricula topics that might help vaccine development, efficient and sustainable vaccine introduction through epidemiologically sound vaccination programs, and best practices to address associated challenges, including vaccine hesitancy which could become a threat to successful implementation of vaccination programs, particularly in developed countries. In addition, it appears that the next phase of vaccinology training could benefit from a global and more structured platform that could facilitate exchanges and collaboration and amplify the current capacity for disseminating vaccine education for future vaccinology leaders around the world. This would be favored by synergizing the efforts currently devoted to vaccinology education. To initiate this process of analysis and systematization, a multinational effort is needed.",2018,10.3389/fimmu.2018.01134,9,NA,1134,eng,1664-3224,"education and Humans and Global Health and Education, Medical, Continuing and Education, Medical, Graduate and *Education, Medical and training and global health and vaccines and vaccinology and Vaccinology/*education",NA,NA,2018///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sinha_2018_Frinim,JOUR,Integrating Immunology and Microfluidics for Single Immune Cell Analysis,"Sinha, Nidhi and Subedi, Nikita and Tel, Jurjen",Frontiers in immunology,"The field of immunoengineering aims to develop novel therapies and modern vaccines to manipulate and modulate the immune system and applies innovative technologies toward improved understanding of the immune system in health and disease. Microfluidics has proven to be an excellent technology for analytics in biology and chemistry. From simple microsystem chips to complex microfluidic designs, these platforms have witnessed an immense growth over the last decades with frequent emergence of new designs. Microfluidics provides a highly robust and precise tool which led to its widespread application in single-cell analysis of immune cells. Single-cell analysis allows scientists to account for the heterogeneous behavior of immune cells which often gets overshadowed when conventional bulk study methods are used. Application of single-cell analysis using microfluidics has facilitated the identification of several novel functional immune cell subsets, quantification of signaling molecules, and understanding of cellular communication and signaling pathways. Single-cell analysis research in combination with microfluidics has paved the way for the development of novel therapies, point-of-care diagnostics, and even more complex microfluidic platforms that aid in creating in vitro cellular microenvironments for applications in drug and toxicity screening. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on the integration of microsystems and microfluidics with immunology and focus on different designs developed to decode single immune cell behavior and cellular communication. We have categorized the microfluidic designs in three specific categories: microfluidic chips with cell traps, valve-based microfluidics, and droplet microfluidics that have facilitated the ongoing research in the field of immunology at single-cell level.",2018,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02373,9,NA,2373,eng,1664-3224,Humans and Animals and Immunoassay and *Microfluidics/methods and *Single-Cell Analysis/methods and Cell Communication and cellular communication and cellular heterogeneity and Immune System/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism and immunoengineering and Microfluidic Analytical Techniques and microfluidics and single-cell analysis,NA,NA,2018///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Martin.Galiano_2019_Frinim,JOUR,Using Omics Technologies and Systems Biology to Identify Epitope Targets for the Development of Monoclonal Antibodies Against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,"Martin-Galiano, Antonio J. and McConnell, Michael J.",Frontiers in immunology,"Over the past few decades, antimicrobial resistance has emerged as an important threat to public health due to the global dissemination of multidrug-resistant strains from several bacterial species. This worrisome trend, in addition to the paucity of new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action in the development pipeline, warrants the development of non-antimicrobial approaches to combating infection caused by these isolates. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as highly effective molecules for the treatment of multiple diseases. However, in spite of the fact that antibodies play an important role in protective immunity against bacteria, only three mAb therapies have been approved for clinical use in the treatment of bacterial infections. In the present review, we briefly outline the therapeutic potential of mAbs in the treatment of bacterial diseases and discuss how their development can be facilitated when assisted by ""omics"" technologies and interpreted under a systems biology paradigm. Specifically, methods employing large genomic, transcriptomic, structural, and proteomic datasets allow for the rational identification of epitopes. Ideally, these include those that are present in the majority of circulating isolates, highly conserved at the amino acid level, surface-exposed, located on antigens essential for virulence, and expressed during critical stages of infection. Therefore, these knowledge-based approaches can contribute to the identification of high-value epitopes for the development of effective mAbs against challenging bacterial clones.",2019,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02841,10,NA,2841,eng,1664-3224,"Humans and big data and *Drug Resistance, Bacterial and *Genomics/methods and systems biology and antibiotic resistance and *Systems Biology/methods and Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology and Bacteria/*drug effects/*immunology and bound rationality and Epitopes/*immunology and immunoinformatics and monoclonal antibodies and multidrug resistance",NA,NA,2019///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA

No vaccine is available, and immunity against the virus is not well-understood. Following the acute stage, HCV usually causes chronic infections. However, ~30% of infected individuals spontaneously clear the virus. Therefore, using HCV as a model for comparing immune responses between spontaneous clearer (SC) and chronically infected (CI) individuals may empower the identification of mechanisms governing viral infection outcomes. Here, we provide the first in-depth analysis of adaptive immune receptor repertoires in individuals with current or past HCV infection. We demonstrate that SC individuals, in contrast to CI patients, develop clusters of antibodies with distinct properties. These antibodies' characteristics were used in a machine learning framework to accurately predict infection outcome. Using combinatorial antibody phage display library technology, we identified HCV-specific antibody sequences. By integrating these data with the repertoire analysis, we constructed two antibodies characterized by high neutralization breadth, which are associated with clearance. This study provides insight into the nature of effective immune response against HCV and demonstrates an innovative approach for constructing antibodies correlating with successful infection clearance. It may have clinical implications for prognosis of the future status of infection, and the design of effective immunotherapies and a vaccine for HCV.",2018,10.3389/fimmu.2018.03004,9,NA,3004,eng,1664-3224,"Humans and Machine Learning and Prognosis and Computational Biology and Cell Line, Tumor and Remission, Spontaneous and Datasets as Topic and High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing and infectious disease and hepatitis C virus and Antibodies, Neutralizing/*analysis/genetics/immunology and antibody repertoire and Hepacivirus/*immunology/isolation & purification and Hepatitis C Antibodies/*analysis/genetics/immunology and Hepatitis C, Chronic/blood/*immunology/virology and immune signature and neutralizing antibodies and Peptide Library and Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology",NA,NA,2018///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Babayan_2018_Frinim,JOUR,The Immune and Non-Immune Pathways That Drive Chronic Gastrointestinal Helminth Burdens in the Wild,"Babayan, Simon A. and Liu, Wei and Hamilton, Graham and Kilbride, Elizabeth and Rynkiewicz, Evelyn C. and Clerc, Melanie and Pedersen, Amy B.",Frontiers in immunology,"Parasitic helminths are extremely resilient in their ability to maintain chronic infection burdens despite (or maybe because of) their hosts' immune response. Explaining how parasites maintain these lifelong infections, identifying the protective immune mechanisms that regulate helminth infection burdens, and designing prophylactics and therapeutics that combat helminth infection, while preserving host health requires a far better understanding of how the immune system functions in natural habitats than we have at present. It is, therefore, necessary to complement mechanistic laboratory-based studies with studies on wild populations and their natural parasite communities. Unfortunately, the relative paucity of immunological tools for non-model species has held these types of studies back. Thankfully, recent progress in high-throughput 'omics platforms provide powerful and increasingly practical means for immunologists to move beyond traditional lab-based model organisms. Yet, assigning both metabolic and immune function to genes, transcripts, and proteins in novel species and assessing how they interact with other physiological and environmental factors requires identifying quantitative relationships between their expression and infection. Here, we used supervised machine learning to identify gene networks robustly associated with burdens of the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus in its natural host, the wild wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus. Across 34 mice spanning two wild populations and across two different seasons, we found 17,639 transcripts that clustered in 131 weighted gene networks. These clusters robustly predicted H. polygyrus burden and included well-known effector and regulatory immune genes, but also revealed a number of genes associated with the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and hematopoiesis that have so far received little attention. We then tested the effect of experimentally reducing helminth burdens through drug treatment on those putatively protective immune factors. Despite the near elimination of H. polygyrus worms, the treatment had surprisingly little effect on gene expression. Taken together, these results suggest that hosts balance tissue homeostasis and protective immunity, resulting in relatively stable immune and, consequently, parasitological profiles. In the future, applying our approach to larger numbers of samples from additional populations will help further increase our ability to detect the immune pathways that determine chronic gastrointestinal helminth burdens in the wild.",2018,10.3389/fimmu.2018.00056,9,NA,56,eng,1664-3224,"Female and Male and Animals and Mice and Gene Expression Profiling and Disease Susceptibility and Transcriptome and transcriptome and Parasite Load and *Signal Transduction and anthelminthics and Apodemus sylvaticus and Heligmosomoides polygyrus and Helminthiasis/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/*parasitology and Helminths/*immunology and Host-Parasite Interactions/*immunology and Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/*parasitology and machine learning applied to immunology and Nematospiroides dubius/immunology and Strongylida Infections/immunology/parasitology and wild immunology",NA,NA,2018///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bettoni.da.Cunha.Riehm_2020_Frinim,JOUR,Vaccination With Live Attenuated Vaccines in Four Children With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia While on Imatinib Treatment,"Bettoni da Cunha-Riehm, Claudia and Hildebrand, Verena and Nathrath, Michaela and Metzler, Markus and Suttorp, Meinolf",Frontiers in immunology,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in childhood and adolescence is a rare malignancy that can successfully be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. According to the current experience, treatment is necessary for years and, in the majority of cases, a lifelong approach is required to control the malignant disease. To what extent imatinib causes immunosuppression in different age cohorts is a controversial discussion. According to general medical recommendations, live vaccines are contraindicated in individuals treated with imatinib. However, a recent increase in the number of globally reported cases of measles has been observed and continues to rise. Due to the high contagiousness of the virus, near-perfect vaccination coverage (herd immunity of 93 to 95%) is required to effectively protect against measles resurgence-a scenario that is not realistic in many countries. When four teenagers with CML (median age 13 years, range 12-15) who were enrolled into pediatric trial CML-paed II while on imatinib treatment (median treatment duration 36 months, range 11-84) were identified without protective measles and/or varicella titers, we carefully balanced the risks of a live vaccination under immunosuppressive TKI medication against the benefit of being protected. The patients underwent live vaccination with the live attenuated vaccines M-M-RVAX Pro((R)) and Varivax((R)) simultaneously (Patient #1), Priorix((R)) and Varilix((R)) consecutively (Patient #2), and Priorix((R)) (Patients #3 and #4). While the first three patients were vaccinated while receiving TKI therapy, treatment with imatinib was interrupted in patient #4 for 1 week prior and 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients #1 and #3 reacted with stable long-term seroconversion. In Patient #2, serum titer conversion against measles and varicella could not be demonstrated and thus revaccination with Priorix((R)) and Varilix((R)) was performed 3 years later. However, protective titers did not develop or were lost again. Patient #4 also lost protective titers against measles when assessed 10 months after vaccination, but revaccination resulted in stable seroprotective titers over 12 months after the last vaccination during ongoing imatinib treatment. We conclude that in all patients, the safety of live vaccines could be documented, as no acute or late adverse events were observed. However, in line with observations that memory B-cells are lost under exposure to imatinib, revaccination may become necessary (two out of four patients in this small series lost their seroprotection). Considering that the number of cases is very small, we also suggest some criteria for decision-making regarding live vaccinations of CML patients treated with imatinib.",2020,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00628,11,NA,628,eng,1664-3224,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Vaccination and Treatment Outcome and imatinib and chronic myeloid leukemia and tyrosine kinase inhibitors and Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use and measles and vaccination and Chickenpox Vaccine/immunology and Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use and Immunologic Memory and Immunosuppression Therapy and Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy and Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/*immunology and mild immunosuppression and pediatric CML and Seroconversion and Vaccines, Attenuated/*immunology and varicella",NA,NA,2020///,Front Immunol,NA,NA,NA,NA
