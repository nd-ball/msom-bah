There is a relation between reading, writing, and computer work and the development of myopia. Methods: Within this prospective pilot study in 44 patients aged between 6 and 12 years with myopia we compared possible treatment effects of acupuncture or moxibustion. The diopters of the right and left eye were evaluated before and after the two treatment methods. Results: Myopia was improved in 14 eyes of 13 patients (15.9%) within both complementary methods. Using acupuncture an improvement was observed in seven eyes from six patients out of 22 patients and a similar result (improvement in seven eyes from seven patients out of 22 patients) was noticed in the moxibustion group. The extent of improvement was better in the acupuncture group (p = 0.008 s., comparison before and after treatment); however, group analysis between acupuncture and moxibustion revealed no significant difference. Conclusions: Possible therapeutic aspects with the help of evidence-based complementary methods like acupuncture or moxibustion have not yet been investigated adequately in myopic patients. Our study showed that both acupuncture and moxibustion can improve myopia of young patients.

This study aims to provide evidence on these issues that was in short supply. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study based on data from National Engineering Laboratory of Application Technology in Medical Big Data. All outpatient pediatric patients aged 0-14 years with an uncomplicated AURI from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 in 138 hospitals across the country were included. We reported characteristics of patients, the average number of medications prescribed per encounter, the categories of medication used and their percentages, the cost per visit and prescription costs of drugs. For these measurements, discrepancies among diverse groups of age, regions, insurance types, and AURI categories were compared. Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test and Student-Newman-Keuls test were performed to identify differences among subgroups. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to examine the independent effects of those factors on the prescribing behavior. RESULTS: A total of 1,002,687 clinical records with 2,682,118 prescriptions were collected and analyzed. The average number of drugs prescribed per encounter was 2.8. The most frequently prescribed medication was Chinese traditional patent medicines (CTPM) (36.5% of overall prescriptions) followed by antibiotics (18.1%). It showed a preference of CPTM over conventional medicines. The median cost per visit was 17.91 USD. The median drug cost per visit was 13.84 USD. The expenditures of antibiotics and CTPM per visit (6.05 USD and 5.87 USD) were among the three highest categories of drugs. The percentage of out-of-pocket patients reached 65.9%. Disparities were showed among subgroups of different ages, regions, and insurance types. CONCLUSIONS: The high volume of CPTM usage is the typical feature in outpatient care of AURI pediatric patients in China.

Heusser_2014_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,The subjectively perceived quality of postgraduate medical training in integrative medicine within the public healthcare systems of Germany and Switzerland: the example of anthroposophic hospitals,"Heusser, Peter and Eberhard, Sabine and Berger, Bettina and Weinzirl, Johannes and Orlow, Pascale",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Integrative medicine (IM) integrates evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) with conventional medicine (CON). Medical schools offer basic CAM electives but in postgraduate medical training (PGMT) little has been done for the integration of CAM. An exception to this is anthroposophic medicine (AM), a western form of CAM based on CON, offering an individualized holistic IM approach. AM hospitals are part of the public healthcare systems in Germany and Switzerland and train AM in PGMT. We performed the first quality evaluation of the subjectively perceived quality of this PGMT. METHODS: An anonymous full survey of all 214 trainers (TR) and 240 trainees (TE) in all 15 AM hospitals in Germany and Switzerland, using the ETHZ questionnaire for annual national PGMT assessments in Switzerland (CH) and Germany (D), complemented by a module for AM. Data analysis included Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency questionnaire scales, 2-tailed Pearson correlation of specific quality dimensions of PGMT and department size, 2-tailed Wilcoxon Matched-Pair test for dependent variables and 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test for independent variables to calculate group differences. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Return rates were: D: TE 89/215 (41.39%), TR 78/184 (42.39%); CH: TE 19/25 (76%), TR 22/30 (73.33%). Cronbach's alpha values for TE scales were >0.8 or >0.9, and >0.7 to >0.5 for TR scales. Swiss hospitals surpassed German ones significantly in Global Satisfaction with AM (TR and TE); Clinical Competency training in CON (TE) and AM (TE, TR), Error Management, Culture of Decision Making, Evidence-based Medicine, and Clinical Competency in internal medicine CON and AM (TE). When the comparison was restricted to departments of comparable size, differences remained significant for Clinical Competencies in AM (TE, TR), and Culture of Decision Making (TE). CON received better grades than AM in Global Satisfaction and Clinical Competency. Quality of PGMT depended on department size, working conditions and structural training features. CONCLUSION: The lower quality of PGMT in German hospitals can be attributed to larger departments, more difficult working conditions, and less favorable structural features for PGMT in AM, possibly also in relation to increased financial pressure.",2014,10.1186/1472-6882-14-191,14,NA,191,eng,1472-6882,"Humans and Female and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and Germany and Switzerland and Health Personnel/*psychology and National Health Programs and Education, Medical, Graduate/methods and Anthroposophy/*psychology and Holistic Health/education/standards and Hospitals/standards/statistics & numerical data and Integrative Medicine/*education/standards",NA,NA,2014/06/16/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Berger_2015_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,"Watchful waiting or induction of labour--a matter of informed choice: identification, analysis and critical appraisal of decision aids and patient information regarding care options for women with uncomplicated singleton late and post term pregnancies: a review","Berger, Bettina and Schwarz, Christiane and Heusser, Peter",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making during pregnancy regarding different options of care can be difficult, particularly when risks of intervention versus no intervention for mother and baby are unclear. Unbiased information and support for decision making may be beneficial in these situations. The management of normal pregnancies at and beyond term is an example of such a situation. In order to determine the need to develop an evidence-based decision aid this paper searches, analyses and appraises patient decision aids and patient information leaflets regarding care options in cases of late term and post-term pregnancies, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). METHODS: A literature search was carried out in a variety of lay and medical databases. INCLUSION CRITERIA: written information related to uncomplicated singleton pregnancies and targeted at lay people. Analysis and appraisal of included material by means of quality criteria was set up based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards accounting for evidence-basing of CAM options. RESULTS: Inclusion of two decision aids and eleven leaflets from four decision aids and sixteen leaflets. One decision aid met the quality criteria almost completely, the other one only insufficiently despite providing some helpful information. Only one leaflet is of good quality, but cannot substitute a decision aid.

Zorgo_2018_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,A qualitative study of culturally embedded factors in complementary and alternative medicine use,"Zorgo, Szilvia and Purebl, Gyorgy and Zana, Agnes",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Within the intercultural milieu of medical pluralism, a nexus of worldviews espousing distinct explanatory models of illness, our research aims at exploring factors leading to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use with special attention to their cultural context. METHODS: The results are based on medical anthropological fieldwork (participant observation and in-depth interviews) spanning a period from January 2015 to May 2017 at four clinics of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Budapest, Hungary. Participant observation involved 105 patients (males N = 42); in-depth interviews were conducted with patients (N = 9) and practitioners (N = 9). The interviews were coded with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis; all information was aggregated employing Atlas.ti software. RESULTS: In order to avoid the dichotomization of ""push and pull factors,"" results obtained from the fieldwork and interviews were structured along milestones of the patient journey. These points of reference include orientation among sources of information, biomedical diagnosis, patient expectations and the physician-patient relationship, the biomedical treatment trajectory and reasons for non-adherence, philosophical congruence, and alternate routes of entry into the world of CAM. All discussed points which are a departure from the strictly western therapy, entail an underlying socio-cultural disposition and must be scrutinized in this context. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of one's culturally determined explanatory model is ubiquitous from the onset of the patient journey and exhibits a reciprocal relationship with subjective experience. Firsthand experience (or that of the Other) signifies the most reliable source of information in matters of illness and choice of therapy. Furthermore, the theme of (building and losing) trust is present throughout the patient journey, a determining factor in patient decision-making and dispositions toward both CAM and biomedicine.",2018,10.1186/s12906-018-2093-0,18,1,25,eng,1472-6882,"Humans and Female and Male and *Medicine, Chinese Traditional and Traditional Chinese Medicine and Health Behavior/*ethnology and Qualitative and *Anthropology, Medical and *Complementary Therapies and Complementary and alternative medicine and Medical anthropology and Therapy choice",NA,NA,2018/01/22/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Holmberg_2012_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,Experts' opinions on terminology for complementary and integrative medicine - a qualitative study with leading experts,"Holmberg, Christine and Brinkhaus, Benno and Witt, Claudia",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Integrative medicine (IM) is currently the most commonly used term to describe the integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into conventional medicine. In the definitions of IM the most important feature is the focus on evidence as crucial factor for therapeutic decision-making. However, there are discussions on the term ""integrative medicine"" with the most notable critique from within CAM that it describes the integration of complementary methods into conventional institutions and into a ""conventional framework of thinking"". The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the thoughts of leading experts on IM and on the scientific debate in the field as well as their personal opinions about terminology in general. METHODS: We have conducted semi-standardized interviews with ten leading experts in the field of CAM and integrative medicine in the USA, England, and Germany, who have had leading positions at medical schools or the NIH in 2010 and 2011. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis with the qualitative analysis software maxqda. RESULTS: Overall the current terminology was seen as a problem, although most experts agreed that the term ""integrative medicine"" (IM) described well what they do or they think is useful for medical care. The terminology debate was discussed from four perspectives: 1) from the perspective of medical practice, 2) from the perspective of research, 3) from the perspective of public relations, and 4) from the perspective of health care delivery. These perspectives may be used to evaluate the appropriateness of different terms in use in the field. When interviewees discussed the terminology question, they also discussed the type of health care system they envisioned. Such reflections led the interviewees to caution about too narrow a focus on the terminology question. The question of naming was one about influencing and changing medicine. CONCLUSION: The discussion of the experts demonstrated that the discussion about terminology is an important debate about the shaping of medicine. The experts discussed terminology in the light of ""how health care systems"" should look like in the future.",2012,10.1186/1472-6882-12-218,12,NA,218,eng,1472-6882,"United States and England and Humans and Research and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and National Institutes of Health (U.S.) and Germany and *Terminology as Topic and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Delivery of Health Care and Schools, Medical and *Complementary Therapies and *Integrative Medicine and Public Relations",NA,NA,2012/11/14/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Brien_2011_Ecaam.e,JOUR,The use of intuition in homeopathic clinical decision making: an interpretative phenomenological study,"Brien, Sarah and Dibb, Bridget and Burch, Alex",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,"While intuition plays a role in clinical decision making within conventional medicine, little is understood about its use in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate intuition from the perspective of homeopathic practitioners; its' manifestation, how it was recognized, its origins and when it was used within daily clinical practice. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with clinically experienced non-National Health Service (NHS) UK homeopathic practitioners. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyze the data. Homeopaths reported many similarities with conventional medical practitioner regarding the nature, perceived origin and manifestation of their intuitions in clinical practice. Intuition was used in two key aspects of the consultation: (i) to enhance the practitioner-patient relationship, these were generally trusted; and (ii) intuitions relating to the prescribing decision. Homeopaths were cautious about these latter intuitions, testing any intuitive thoughts through deductive reasoning before accepting them. Their reluctance is not surprising given the consequences for patient care, but we propose this also reflects homeopaths' sensitivity to the academic and medical mistrust of both homeopathy and intuition. This study is the first to explore the use of intuition in decision making in any form of complementary medicine. The similarities with conventional practitioners may provide confidence in validating intuition as a legitimate part of the decision making process for these specific practitioners. Further work is needed to elucidate if these findings reflect intuitive use in clinical practice of other CAM practitioners in both private and NHS (i.e., time limited) settings.",2011,10.1093/ecam/nep153,2011,NA,935307,eng,1741-4288 1741-427X,NA,NA,NA,2011///,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Barnes_2018_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,Complementary medicine products used in pregnancy and lactation and an examination of the information sources accessed pertaining to maternal health literacy: a systematic review of qualitative studies,"Barnes, Larisa Ariadne Justine and Barclay, Lesley and McCaffery, Kirsten and Aslani, Parisa",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of complementary medicine use in pregnancy and lactation has been increasingly noted internationally. This systematic review aimed to determine the complementary medicine products (CMPs) used in pregnancy and/or lactation for the benefit of the mother, the pregnancy, child and/or the breastfeeding process. Additionally, it aimed to explore the resources women used, and to examine the role of maternal health literacy in this process. METHODS: Seven databases were comprehensively searched to identify studies published in peer-reviewed journals (1995-2017). Relevant data were extracted and thematic analysis undertaken to identify key themes related to the review objectives. RESULTS: A total of 4574 articles were identified; 28 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Quantitative studies were removed for a separate, concurrent review. Herbal medicines were the main CMPs identified (n = 21 papers) in the qualitative studies, with a smaller number examining vitamin and mineral supplements together with herbal medicines (n = 3), and micronutrient supplements (n = 3). Shared cultural knowledge and traditions, followed by women elders and health care professionals were the information sources most accessed by women when choosing to use CMPs. Women used CMPs for perceived physical, mental-emotional, spiritual and cultural benefits for their pregnancies, their own health, the health of their unborn or breastfeeding babies, and/or the breastfeeding process. Two over-arching motives were identified: 1) to protect themselves or their babies from adverse events; 2) to facilitate the normal physiological processes of pregnancy, birth and lactation. Decisions to use CMPs were made within the context of their own cultures, reflected in the locus of control regarding decision-making in pregnancy and lactation, and in the health literacy environment. Medical pluralism was very common and women navigated through and between different health care services and systems throughout their pregnancies and breastfeeding journeys. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant and breastfeeding women use herbal medicines and micronutrient supplements for a variety of perceived benefits to their babies' and their own holistic health. Women access a range of CMP-related information sources with shared cultural knowledge and women elders the most frequently accessed sources, followed by HCPs. Culture influences maternal health literacy and thus women's health care choices including CMP use.",2018,10.1186/s12906-018-2283-9,18,1,229,eng,1472-6882,Culture and Humans and Female and Adult and Decision Making and Health literacy and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Breast Feeding and *Health Literacy and Lactation and *Women's Health and *Complementary Therapies/instrumentation/psychology and *Lactation and Breastfeeding and Complementary medicine products and Health care choices and Medical pluralism,NA,NA,2018/07/31/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Welz_2019_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,"What motivates new, established and long-term users of herbal medicine: is there more than push and pull?","Welz, Alexandra N. and Emberger-Klein, Agnes and Menrad, Klaus",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: The use of herbal medicine (HM) has become an essential form of treatment and it is more and more common around the world. Little is known about the reasons that drive people to initially use HM or to maintain their behaviour, and whether the so-called ""push and pull factors"" known in the context of decision making for complementary and alternative medicine, also play a role for HM use. Here, our goal was to provide answers to these open questions and to analyse the reasons that motivate new, established and long-term HM consumers in detail. METHODS: Thirteen reasons for HM usage, which were previously identified within a qualitative approach, were analysed quantitatively in a nationwide online survey in Germany. Data of 2,192 German HM users from the general population were grouped into new, established and long-term users. We performed a factor analysis in order to identify factors underlying the set of reasons. RESULTS: We discovered a reliable factor associated with longstanding family traditions and cultural importance of HM in Germany. This finding shows that the reasons for HM use require a three-factor structure going beyond the well-known push and pull factors that explain the use of complementary and alternative medicine. In using the identified factors for further calculations, we were able to reveal important group differences and test how the factor scores perform as predictors for the new, established and long-term choice of HM. Our results showed that a high score on the push factor is associated more with initial HM usage, while long-term HM usage is impacted more by high scores on the pull and traditional factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory survey and analysis of the reasons that underlie HM usage aimed at providing a better understanding of the decision for this treatment form. The findings of our work deliver insights for medical practitioners and health-care providers, including the role of family traditions for HM usage and the finding that new HM users are driven to use this treatment form in part because of negative aspects they associate with conventional medicine.",2019,10.1186/s12906-019-2584-7,19,1,170,eng,1472-6882,Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Motivation and Factor analysis and Germany and *Drug Utilization and CAM and Herbal medicine and Herbal Medicine/*statistics & numerical data/trends and Online survey and Reasons for use,NA,NA,2019/07/10/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Salamonsen_2019_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,"""Then I went to a hospital abroad"": acknowledging implications of stakeholders' differing risk understandings related to use of complementary and alternative medicine in European health care contexts","Salamonsen, Anita and Wiesener, Solveig",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a rather novel issue within public healthcare and health policy-making. CAM use in Europe is widespread, patient-initiated, and patient-evaluated, and the regulation across countries has been evaluated as disharmonized. CAM users are left in an uncertain position, and patient safety may be threatened. How ""risk"" is understood by individuals in health policy-making and clinical encounters involving the use of CAM has not yet been much debated. The aim of this article is to explore and discuss the existence and possible consequences of differing risk understandings among stakeholders maneuvering in the complex landscape of CAM practice and CAM regulation contextualized by European public healthcare systems. METHODS: Qualitative data were derived from two studies on CAM in European healthcare contexts. Findings from the EU project CAMbrella on legislation and regulation of CAM were mixed with data from an interview study exploring risk understandings, communication, and decision-making among Scandinavian CAM users and their doctors. In a secondary content analysis, we constructed the case Sara as a typology to demonstrate important findings with regard to risk understandings and patient safety involving European citizens' use of CAM in differing contexts. RESULTS: By combining and comparing individual and structural perspectives on risk and CAM use, we revealed underexplored gaps in risk understandings among individuals involved in European CAM regulation and legislation, and between CAM users and their medical doctors. This may cause health risks and uncertainties associated with CAM use and regulation. It may also negatively influence doctor-CAM user communication and CAM users' trust in and use of public healthcare. CONCLUSION: Acknowledging implications of stakeholders' differing risk understandings related to CAM use and regulation may positively influence patient safety in European healthcare. Definitions of the concept of risk should include the factors uncertainty and subjectivity to grasp the full picture of possible risks associated with the use of CAM. To transform the findings of this study into practical settings, we introduce sets of questions relevant to operationalize the important question ""What is risk?"" in health policy-making, clinical encounters and risk research involving European patients' use of CAM.",2019,10.1186/s12906-019-2499-3,19,1,93,eng,1472-6882,"Risk and Decision making and Patient safety and Humans and Europe and Risk perceptions and Policy Making and Risk communication and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Quality of Health Care and *Health Policy and Complementary and alternative medicine and *Complementary Therapies/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology/standards and Doctor-patient communication and Health policy-making and Person-centeredness and Quality in health care and Refusal of conventional treatment and Regulation, risk governance, Norway, Europe and Risk definitions and Risk ontology and Risk understandings: risk behaviors and Traditional and complementary medicine",NA,NA,2019/04/30/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yoga improves these outcomes in other cancers, but this hasn't been demonstrated in MPNs. The purpose of this study was to: (1) explore the limited efficacy (does the program show promise of success) of a 12-week online yoga intervention among MPN patients on symptom burden and quality of life and (2) determine feasibility (practicality: to what extent a measure can be carried out) of remotely collecting inflammatory biomarkers. METHODS: Patients were recruited nationally and randomized to online yoga (60 min/week of yoga) or wait-list control (asked to maintain normal activity). Weekly yoga minutes were collected with Clicky (online web analytics tool) and self-report. Those in online yoga completed a blood draw at baseline and week 12 to assess inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-<ce><b1>]). All participants completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, sexual function, total symptom burden, global health, and quality of life at baseline, week seven, 12, and 16. Change from baseline at each time point was computed by group and effect sizes were calculated. Pre-post intervention change in inflammation for the yoga group was compared by t-test. RESULTS: Sixty-two MPN patients enrolled and 48 completed the intervention (online yoga = 27; control group = 21). Yoga participation averaged 40.8 min/week via Clicky and 56.1 min/week via self-report. Small/moderate effect sizes were generated from the yoga intervention for sleep disturbance (d = - 0.26 to - 0.61), pain intensity (d = - 0.34 to - 0.51), anxiety (d = - 0.27 to - 0.37), and depression (d = - 0.53 to - 0.78). A total of 92.6 and 70.4% of online yoga participants completed the blood draw at baseline and week 12, respectively, and there was a decrease in TNF-<ce><b1> from baseline to week 12 (- 1.3 <c2><b1> 1.5 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Online yoga demonstrated small effects on sleep, pain, and anxiety as well as a moderate effect on depression.

Pattern differentiation and individual treatments are recognized as the most distinguishing features of TCM. Therefore, how practitioners determine curative effects is an issue worthy of research, though little has been done in this area up to this point. This study examines perceptions of the effectiveness of TCM treatments and the means of evaluating clinical outcomes from the practitioners' perspective. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: A total of nine TCM practitioners from three university-affiliated hospitals and two scientific institutions participated in the interviews in August 2013. Participants reported evaluation of periodical treatment as an important part of the process of individual treatment based on pattern differentiation. Themes included (1) ways of evaluating treatment outcomes; (2) relationships between treatment outcomes and pathological transformation; and (3) distinguishing manifestations of the healing process from true adverse reactions. These considerations helped determine the optional treatment principles for further follow-up. An additional theme emerged related to the characteristics of diagnosis and treatment in TCM. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals considered all of the following as important ways of evaluating TCM treatment outcomes: patients' input and subjective experience, physicians' intake and examination, laboratory tests and medical device measurements. Pathological conditions were determined based on all the above factors, and no single factor determined the effectiveness from the practitioners' perspectives. If the patients felt no significant beneficial effects, then it was necessary to judge the effectiveness from adverse effect. The follow-up measures were usually based on the previous treatment, and physicians' satisfaction with each phase of TCM treatment was a significant factor in the process of making further decisions.",2017,10.1186/s12906-017-1746-8,17,1,269,eng,1472-6882,"Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Evaluation and Evaluation Studies as Topic and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/*psychology and Medicine, Chinese Traditional/*psychology and Practitioners and Traditional Chinese medicine and Treatment outcomes",NA,NA,2017/05/18/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the evidence to date suggests that it has a limited impact on the clinical symptoms of the disease including joint pain, radiological progression, function and quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the prescribing patterns of glucosamine from 2002-2011 in an elderly Irish national population cohort using data from the Health Service Executive Primary Care Reimbursement (HSE-PCRS) General medical services (GMS) Scheme. METHODS: Patients aged <e2><89><a5> 70 years on the HSE-PCRS pharmacy claims database between January 2002 and December 2011 were included. ATC code M01AX05 (glucosamine) was extracted. Prevalence rates per 1000 eligible population with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all years and age groups (70-74 years, <e2><89><a5>75 years). A negative binomial regression analysis was used to determine longitudinal usage trends and compare prevalence rates across years, sex and age groups. RESULTS: The annual patient rate of glucosamine prescribing increased significantly from 13.0/1000 eligible population (95% CI 12.6-13.4) in 2002 to 68.7/1000 population (95% CI 67.8-69.5) in 2009 before decreasing to 62.4/1000 population (95% CI 61.6-63.2) in 2011. The rate of prescribing of glucosamine varied with sex, with women receiving significantly more prescriptions than men. The cost of glucosamine also increased from 2002-2008. In 2008 total expenditure reached a high of <e2><82><ac>4.6 million before decreasing to <e2><82><ac>2.6 million in 2011. CONCLUSION: The national trend in prescribing of glucosamine increased significantly from 2002 to 2009 before decreasing in 2010 and 2011, in keeping with current international guidelines. There is a need for awareness among healthcare professionals and patients alike of the best available evidence to inform decision making relating to the prescription and consumption of such supplements.",2013,10.1186/1472-6882-13-316,13,NA,316,eng,1472-6882,"Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Male and Aged and Databases, Factual and Cohort Studies and Prevalence and Aged, 80 and over and Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data and Glucosamine/economics/*therapeutic use and Osteoarthritis/*drug therapy and Prescription Drugs/economics/*therapeutic use",NA,NA,2013/11/13/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is commonly treated using integrative non-surgical methods by Korean medicine doctors (KMDs) in Korea, and this is the first study to assess current Korean medicine practice trends for LSS. METHODS: A survey on KMD diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and decision-making in LSS treatment was developed in a 3-step procedure of preliminary drafting, revision based on extramural expert opinion, and final editing. The survey was conducted at the internal conference of a spine-specialty Korean medicine hospital on January 25th, 2015. RESULTS: The response rate was high at 79.19% (n = 118/149). Participants replied that they treated 7.3 <c2><b1> 6.8 LSS patients/day using a multimodal treatment method consisting of acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicine, Chuna manipulation, and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture mainly used Ashi points and MSAT, and pharmacopuncture mainly Shinbaro solution. The most frequently prescribed herbal medicine was Chungpa-jun, and the most commonly applied Chuna techniques were sidelying lumbar extension dysfunction correction technique, and prone lumbosacral joint distraction method. Radiological findings were mainly referred to for diagnosis, and clinical symptoms, age, radiological findings, and medical history were regarded to be important for prognosis. Participants replied that 7.8 <c2><b1> 3.3 weeks were required for 50% reduction in pain, and 16.1 <c2><b1> 7.7 weeks for 80% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KMDs in Korea combine a conventional approach to LSS and a Korean medicine approach to low back pain for integration of empirical- and evidence-based diagnosis and treatment. The findings may contribute in bridging the divide between evidence and clinical practice guidelines for Korean medicine treatment of LSS and real-world clinical practice in future research.",2017,10.1186/s12906-017-1942-6,17,1,425,eng,1472-6882,"Physicians and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Practice Patterns, Physicians' and Republic of Korea and *Combined Modality Therapy and Acupuncture Therapy and Complementary therapies and Health surveys and Integrative medicine and Integrative Medicine and Low Back Pain/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy and Lumbar Vertebrae/physiopathology and Plant Preparations/administration & dosage and Spinal Stenosis and Spinal Stenosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology/*therapy",NA,NA,2017/08/29/,BMC Complement Altern Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
DeBar_2011_BMCcomandaltmed,JOUR,Acupuncture and chiropractic care for chronic pain in an integrated health plan: a mixed methods study,"DeBar, Lynn L. and Elder, Charles and Ritenbaugh, Cheryl and Aickin, Mikel and Deyo, Rick and Meenan, Richard and Dickerson, John and Webster, Jennifer A. and Jo Yarborough, Bobbi",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,"BACKGROUND: Substantial recent research examines the efficacy of many types of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies. However, outcomes associated with the ""real-world"" use of CAM has been largely overlooked, despite calls for CAM therapies to be studied in the manner in which they are practiced. Americans seek CAM treatments far more often for chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) than for any other condition. Among CAM treatments for CMP, acupuncture and chiropractic (A/C) care are among those with the highest acceptance by physician groups and the best evidence to support their use. Further, recent alarming increases in delivery of opioid treatment and surgical interventions for chronic pain--despite their high costs, potential adverse effects, and modest efficacy--suggests the need to evaluate real world outcomes associated with promising non-pharmacological/non-surgical CAM treatments for CMP, which are often well accepted by patients and increasingly used in the community. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-phase, mixed methods study will: (1) conduct a retrospective study using information from electronic medical records (EMRs) of a large HMO to identify unique clusters of patients with CMP (e.g., those with differing demographics, histories of pain condition, use of allopathic and CAM health services, and comorbidity profiles) that may be associated with different propensities for A/C utilization and/or differential outcomes associated with such care; (2) use qualitative interviews to explore allopathic providers' recommendations for A/C and patients' decisions to pursue and retain CAM care; and (3) prospectively evaluate health services/costs and broader clinical and functional outcomes associated with the receipt of A/C relative to carefully matched comparison participants receiving traditional CMP services. Sensitivity analyses will compare methods relying solely on EMR-derived data versus analyses supplementing EMR data with conventionally collected patient and clinician data. DISCUSSION: Successful completion of these aggregate aims will provide an evaluation of outcomes associated with the real-world use of A/C services. The trio of retrospective, qualitative, and prospective study will also provide a clearer understanding of the decision-making processes behind the use of A/C for CMP and a transportable methodology that can be applied to other health care settings, CAM treatments, and clinical populations.

We expected this trend to continue. People not only used acupuncture as a complementary and alternative approach to conventional treatment for a specific health condition, but also used it as a preventive means to promote general health.

Many patients now turn to complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) to treat their chronic illnesses; however, there is very little evidence to guide their decision-making in usual care. The following research recommendations were derived from a CIM Stakeholder Symposium on Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER): (1) CER studies should be made a priority in this field; (2) stakeholders should be engaged at every stage of the research; (3) CER study designs should highlight effectiveness over efficacy; (4) research questions should be well defined to enable the selection of an appropriate CER study design; (5) the CIM community should cultivate widely shared understandings, discourse, tools, and technologies to support the use and validity of CER methods; (6) Effectiveness Guidance Documents on methodological standards should be developed to shape future CER studies. CER is an emerging field and its development and impact must be reflected in future research strategies within CIM.

Disc resorption amount was measured 3-dimensionally with disc degeneration and modic change levels on baseline and follow-up MRIs. Patient characteristics, Korean medicine use, pain, symptom recurrence, and satisfaction were assessed through medical records and phone surveys. Of 505 participants, 19 did not show disc resorption, while 486 did. A total of 220 displayed resorption rates of <e2><89><a5>50%.

METHODS: The annual health check-up data including physical examination data; biochemical tests and Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) measurement data from 2014 to 2016 were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A predictive matrix was established by the longitudinal data of three consecutive years. TreeNet machine learning algorithm was applied to build prediction model to uncover the dependence relationship between physiological indexes, TCM constitutions, and MS. RESULTS: By model testing, the overall accuracy rate for prediction model by TreeNet was 73.23%. Top 12.31% individuals in test group (n=325) that have higher probability of having MS covered 23.68% MS patients, showing 0.92 times more risk of having MS than the general population. Importance of ranked top 15 was listed in descending order . The top 5 variables of great importance in MS prediction were TBIL difference between 2014 and 2015 (D_TBIL), TBIL in 2014 (TBIL 2014), LDL-C difference between 2014 and 2015 (D_LDL-C), CCMQ scores for balanced constitution in 2015 (balanced constitution 2015), and TCH in 2015 (TCH 2015). When D_TBIL was between 0 and 2, TBIL 2014 was between 10 and 15, D_LDL-C was above 19, balanced constitution 2015 was below 60, or TCH 2015 was above 5.7, the incidence of MS was higher. Furthermore, there were interactions between balanced constitution 2015 score and TBIL 2014 or D_LDL-C in MS prediction. CONCLUSION: Balanced constitution, TBIL, LDL-C, and TCH level can act as predictors for MS. The combination of TCM constitution and physiological indexes can give early warning to MS.",2019,10.1155/2019/1686205,2019,NA,1686205,eng,1741-427X 1741-4288,NA,NA,NA,2019///,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
