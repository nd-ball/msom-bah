Sanchez.Pinto_2018_Ches,JOUR,Big Data and Data Science in Critical Care,"Sanchez-Pinto, L. Nelson and Luo, Yuan and Churpek, Matthew M.",Chest,"The digitalization of the health-care system has resulted in a deluge of clinical big data and has prompted the rapid growth of data science in medicine. Data science, which is the field of study dedicated to the principled extraction of knowledge from complex data, is particularly relevant in the critical care setting. The availability of large amounts of data in the ICU, the need for better evidence-based care, and the complexity of critical illness makes the use of data science techniques and data-driven research particularly appealing to intensivists. Despite the increasing number of studies and publications in the field, thus far there have been few examples of data science projects that have resulted in successful implementations of data-driven systems in the ICU. However, given the expected growth in the field, intensivists should be familiar with the opportunities and challenges of big data and data science. The present article reviews the definitions, types of algorithms, applications, challenges, and future of big data and data science in critical care.",2018,10.1016/j.chest.2018.04.037,154,5,1239-1248,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,machine learning and data science and Humans and Forecasting and big data and *Big Data and Data Science/*methods and critical care and prediction models and *Critical Care/methods/organization & administration and *Delivery of Health Care/methods/trends,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA
Meyer_2018_TheLanResmed,JOUR,Machine learning for real-time prediction of complications in critical care: a retrospective study,"Meyer, Alexander and Zverinski, Dina and Pfahringer, Boris and Kempfert, Jorg and Kuehne, Titus and Sundermann, Simon H. and Stamm, Christof and Hofmann, Thomas and Falk, Volkmar and Eickhoff, Carsten",The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: The large amount of clinical signals in intensive care units can easily overwhelm health-care personnel and can lead to treatment delays, suboptimal care, or clinical errors. The aim of this study was to apply deep machine learning methods to predict severe complications during critical care in real time after cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS: We used deep learning methods (recurrent neural networks) to predict several severe complications (mortality, renal failure with a need for renal replacement therapy, and postoperative bleeding leading to operative revision) in post cardiosurgical care in real time. Adult patients who underwent major open heart surgery from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016, in a German tertiary care centre for cardiovascular diseases formed the main derivation dataset. We measured the accuracy and timeliness of the deep learning model's forecasts and compared predictive quality to that of established standard-of-care clinical reference tools (clinical rule for postoperative bleeding, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II for mortality, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes staging criteria for acute renal failure) using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and the F(1) measure (which computes a harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV). Results were externally retrospectively validated with 5898 cases from the published MIMIC-III dataset. FINDINGS: Of 47 559 intensive care admissions (corresponding to 42 007 patients), we included 11 492 (corresponding to 9269 patients). The deep learning models yielded accurate predictions with the following PPV and sensitivity scores: PPV 0<c2><b7>90 and sensitivity 0<c2><b7>85 for mortality, 0<c2><b7>87 and 0<c2><b7>94 for renal failure, and 0<c2><b7>84 and 0<c2><b7>74 for bleeding. The predictions significantly outperformed the standard clinical reference tools, improving the absolute complication prediction AUC by 0<c2><b7>29 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>23-0<c2><b7>35) for bleeding, by 0<c2><b7>24 (0<c2><b7>19-0<c2><b7>29) for mortality, and by 0<c2><b7>24 (0<c2><b7>13-0<c2><b7>35) for renal failure (p<0<c2><b7>0001 for all three analyses). The deep learning methods showed accurate predictions immediately after patient admission to the intensive care unit. We also observed an increase in performance in our validation cohort when the machine learning approach was tested against clinical reference tools, with absolute improvements in AUC of 0<c2><b7>09 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>03-0<c2><b7>15; p=0<c2><b7>0026) for bleeding, of 0<c2><b7>18 (0<c2><b7>07-0<c2><b7>29; p=0<c2><b7>0013) for mortality, and of 0<c2><b7>25 (0<c2><b7>18-0<c2><b7>32; p<0<c2><b7>0001) for renal failure. INTERPRETATION: The observed improvements in prediction for all three investigated clinical outcomes have the potential to improve critical care. These findings are noteworthy in that they use routinely collected clinical data exclusively, without the need for any manual processing. The deep machine learning method showed AUC scores that significantly surpass those of clinical reference tools, especially soon after admission. Taken together, these properties are encouraging for prospective deployment in critical care settings to direct the staff's attention towards patients who are most at risk.

F. and Humphries, Stephen M. and Wells, Athol U. and Brown, Kevin K.",The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,"Over the past decade, there has been a groundswell of research interest in computer-based methods for objectively quantifying fibrotic lung disease on high resolution CT of the chest. In the past 5 years, the arrival of deep learning-based image analysis has created exciting new opportunities for enhancing the understanding of, and the ability to interpret, fibrotic lung disease on CT. Specific unsolved problems for which computer-based imaging analysis might provide solutions include the development of reliable methods for assisting with diagnosis, detecting early disease, and predicting disease behaviour using baseline imaging data. However, to harness this technology, technical and societal challenges must be overcome. Large CT datasets will be needed to power the training of deep learning algorithms. Open science research and collaboration between academia and industry must be encouraged. Prospective clinical utility studies will be needed to test computer algorithm performance in real-world clinical settings and demonstrate patient benefit over current best practice.

Saglani_2019_Amjoofreancrcame,JOUR,Childhood Asthma: Advances Using Machine Learning and Mechanistic Studies,"Saglani, Sejal and Custovic, Adnan",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"A paradigm shift brought by the recognition that childhood asthma is an aggregated diagnosis that comprises several different endotypes underpinned by different pathophysiology, coupled with advances in understanding potentially important causal mechanisms, offers a real opportunity for a step change to reduce the burden of the disease on individual children, families, and society. Data-driven methodologies facilitate the discovery of ""hidden"" structures within ""big healthcare data"" to help generate new hypotheses. These findings can be translated into clinical practice by linking discovered ""phenotypes"" to specific mechanisms and clinical presentations. Epidemiological studies have provided important clues about mechanistic avenues that should be pursued to identify interventions to prevent the development or alter the natural history of asthma-related diseases. Findings from cohort studies followed by mechanistic studies in humans and in neonatal mouse models provided evidence that environments such as traditional farming may offer protection by modulating innate immune responses and that impaired innate immunity may increase susceptibility. The key question of which component of these exposures can be translated into interventions requires confirmation. Increasing mechanistic evidence is demonstrating that shaping the microbiome in early life may modulate immune function to confer protection. Iterative dialogue and continuous interaction between experts with different but complementary skill sets, including data scientists who generate information about the hidden structures within ""big data"" assets, and medical professionals, epidemiologists, basic scientists, and geneticists who provide critical clinical and mechanistic insights about the mechanisms underpinning the architecture of the heterogeneity, are keys to delivering mechanism-based stratified treatments and prevention.",2019,10.1164/rccm.201810-1956CI,199,4,414-422,eng,1535-4970 1073-449X,"machine learning and Humans and Child and Big Data and children and Models, Biological and *Machine Learning and asthma mechanism and Asthma/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control and Immunity, Innate",NA,NA,2019/02/15/,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is unknown whether individual physicians' approaches affect whether patients quit. RESEARCH QUESTION: This study assessed patient quit rates within a national quality-improvement learning collaborative to document variation in quit rates at the physician, practice, and health system levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of primary care patients identified from the Optum analytics database containing longitudinal ambulatory data for patients from 22 health-care organizations between January 2012 and December 2018. The study included smokers aged <e2><89><a5> 18 years who attended at least three ambulatory visits, with two visits at least 1 year apart. The primary study outcome was abstinence for <e2><89><a5> 1 year. A mixed effects logistic regression model was used to predict the probability of quitting as a function of patient variables. Quit rates were then adjusted by patient factors and calculated at the level of clinician, clinic/practice, and health system. RESULTS: Across all systems, 56% of patients had a documented smoking status in 2017. Among nearly 1 million smokers, 24% quit smoking. In the regression model, patient characteristics associated with quitting included older age, Hispanic ethnicity, being married, urban residence, commercial insurance, pregnancy, and a diagnosis of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, cataract, or asthma. Medicaid insurance, low income, high BMI, peripheral vascular disease, alcohol-related diagnosis, and COPD were negatively associated with smoking cessation. Adjusted quit rates ranged from 14.3% to 34.5% across 20 health systems, 5% to 66% among 1,399 practice sites, and 4% to 87% among 3,803 health-care providers. Of smokers, 10.2% were prescribed smoking deterrents, and 3.9% were referred for counseling.

Brandon and Nemati, Shamim and Malhotra, Atul",Chest,"BACKGROUND: Objective and early identification of hospitalized patients, and particularly those with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who may require mechanical ventilation (MV) may aid in delivering timely treatment. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 h in advance? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, Fio(2), and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. RESULTS: We obtained data from more than 30,000 ICU patients (including more than 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-h prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC, 0.895 vs 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (P < .001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range of 0.918 to 0.943.

Evaluation of control relies on subjective patient recall and may be overestimated by health-care professionals. This study assessed the value of spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurements, used alone or in combination, in models developed by a machine learning approach in the objective classification of asthma control according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and tested the model in a second group of children with asthma. METHODS: Fifty-three children with persistent atopic asthma underwent two to six evaluations of asthma control, including spirometry and FeNO. Soft computing evaluation was performed by means of artificial neural networks and principal component analysis. The model was then tested in a cross-sectional study in an additional 77 children with allergic asthma. RESULTS: The machine learning method was not able to distinguish different levels of control using either spirometry or FeNO values alone. However, their use in combination modeled by soft computing was able to discriminate levels of asthma control. In particular, the model is able to recognize all children with uncontrolled asthma and correctly identify 99.0% of children with totally controlled asthma. In the cross-sectional study, the model prospectively identified correctly all the uncontrolled children and 79.6% of the controlled children.

Murphy_2016_Ches,JOUR,Computerized Triggers of Big Data to Detect Delays in Follow-up of Chest Imaging Results,"Murphy, Daniel R. and Meyer, Ashley N. D. and Bhise, Viraj and Russo, Elise and Sittig, Dean F. and Wei, Li and Wu, Louis and Singh, Hardeep",Chest,"BACKGROUND: A ""trigger"" algorithm was used to identify delays in follow-up of abnormal chest imaging results in a large national clinical data warehouse of electronic health record (EHR) data. METHODS: We applied a trigger in a repository hosting EHR data from all Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facilities and analyzed data from seven facilities. Using literature reviews and expert input, we refined previously developed trigger criteria designed to identify patients potentially experiencing delays in diagnostic evaluation of chest imaging flagged as ""suspicious for malignancy."" The trigger then excluded patients in whom further evaluation was unnecessary (eg, those with terminal illnesses or with already completed biopsies). The criteria were programmed into a computerized algorithm. Reviewers examined a random sample of trigger-positive (ie, patients with trigger-identified delay) and trigger-negative (ie, patients with an abnormal imaging result but no delay) records and confirmed the presence or absence of delay or need for additional tracking (eg, repeat imaging in 6 months). Analysis included calculating the trigger's diagnostic performance (ie, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: On application to 208,633 patients seen between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, a total of 40,218 chest imaging tests were performed; 1,847 of the results were suspicious for malignancy, and 655 (35%) were trigger-positive.

Respiratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: Using latent class analysis (LCA) in five randomised controlled trial (RCT) cohorts, two distinct phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified: hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory. The phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this study was to develop parsimonious models for phenotype identification that could be accurate and feasible to use in the clinical setting. METHODS: In this retrospective study, three RCT cohorts from the National Lung, Heart, and Blood Institute ARDS Network (ARMA, ALVEOLI, and FACTT) were used as the derivation dataset (n=2022), from which the machine learning and logistic regression classifer models were derived, and a fourth (SAILS; n=715) from the same network was used as the validation test set. LCA-derived phenotypes in all of these cohorts served as the reference standard. Machine-learning algorithms (random forest, bootstrapped aggregating, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) were used to select a maximum of six important classifier variables, which were then used to develop nested logistic regression models. Only cases with complete biomarker data in the derivation dataset were used for variable selection. The best logistic regression models based on parsimony and predictive accuracy were then evaluated in the validation test set. Finally, the models' prognostic validity was tested in two external ARDS clinical trial datasets (START and HARP-2) by assessing mortality at days 28, 60, and 90 and ventilator-free days to day 28. FINDINGS: The six most important classifier variables were interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, protein C, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1, bicarbonate, and vasopressor use. From the nested models, three-variable (IL-8, bicarbonate, and protein C) and four-variable (3-variable plus vasopressor use) models were adjudicated to be the best performing. In the validation test set, both models showed good accuracy (AUC 0<c2><b7>94 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>92-0<c2><b7>95] for the three-variable model and 0<c2><b7>95 [95% CI 0<c2><b7>93-0<c2><b7>96] for the four-variable model) against LCA classifications. As with LCA-derived phenotypes, the hyperinflammatory phenotype as identified by the classifier model was associated with higher mortality at day 90 (87 [39%] of 223 patients vs 112 [23%] of 492 patients; p<0<c2><b7>0001) and fewer ventilator-free days (median 14 days [IQR 0-22] vs 22 days [0-25]; p<0<c2><b7>0001). In the external validation datasets, three-variable models developed in the derivation dataset identified two phenotypes with distinct clinical features and outcomes consistent with previous findings, including differential survival with simvastatin versus placebo in HARP-2 (p=0<c2><b7>023 for survival at 28 days). INTERPRETATION: ARDS phenotypes can be accurately identified with parsimonious classifier models using three or four variables. Pending the development of real-time testing for key biomarkers and prospective validation, these models could facilitate identification of ARDS phenotypes to enable their application in clinical trials and practice.

Although there is no consensus on terminology, we refer to these patients as ""unrepresented."" There is considerable controversy about how to make treatment decisions for these patients, and there is significant variability in both law and clinical practice.Purpose and Objectives: This multisociety statement provides clinicians and hospital administrators with recommendations for decision-making on behalf of unrepresented patients in the critical care setting.Methods: An interprofessional, multidisciplinary expert committee developed this policy statement by using an iterative consensus process with a diverse working group representing critical care medicine, palliative care, pediatric medicine, nursing, social work, gerontology, geriatrics, patient advocacy, bioethics, philosophy, elder law, and health law.Main Results: The committee designed its policy recommendations to promote five ethical goals: 1) to protect highly vulnerable patients, 2) to demonstrate respect for persons, 3) to provide appropriate medical care, 4) to safeguard against unacceptable discrimination, and 5) to avoid undue influence of competing obligations and conflicting interests. These recommendations also are intended to strike an appropriate balance between excessive and insufficient procedural safeguards. The committee makes the following recommendations: 1) institutions should offer advance care planning to prevent patients at high risk for becoming unrepresented from meeting this definition; 2) institutions should implement strategies to determine whether seemingly unrepresented patients are actually unrepresented, including careful capacity assessments and diligent searches for potential surrogates; 3) institutions should manage decision-making for unrepresented patients using input from a diverse interprofessional, multidisciplinary committee rather than ad hoc by treating clinicians; 4) institutions should use all available information on the patient's preferences and values to guide treatment decisions; 5) institutions should manage decision-making for unrepresented patients using a fair process that comports with procedural due process; 6) institutions should employ this fair process even when state law authorizes procedures with less oversight.Conclusions: This multisociety statement provides guidance for clinicians and hospital administrators on medical decision-making for unrepresented patients in the critical care setting.",2020,10.1164/rccm.202003-0512ST,201,10,1182-1192,eng,1535-4970 1073-449X,"Geriatrics and Humans and Patient Care Team and Judgment and Patient Advocacy and Societies, Medical and Patient Preference and Advance Care Planning and Clinical Decision-Making and *Intensive Care Units and Decision Making/*ethics and *Proxy and surrogate and Critical Care/ethics/*standards and adult orphan and patient without advocate and Pulmonary Medicine and substituted judgment and unrepresented",NA,NA,2020/05/15/,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

This retrospective study was designed to characterise the prediagnosis features of NTMLD patients in primary care and to assess the feasibility of using machine learning to identify undiagnosed NTMLD patients.IQVIA Medical Research Data (incorporating THIN, a Cegedim Database), a UK electronic medical records primary care database was used. NTMLD patients were identified between 2003 and 2017 by diagnosis in primary or secondary care or record of NTMLD treatment regimen. Risk factors and treatments were extracted in the prediagnosis period, guided by literature and expert clinical opinion. The control population was enriched to have at least one of these features.741 NTMLD and 112 784 control patients were selected. Annual prevalence rates of NTMLD from 2006 to 2016 increased from 2.7 to 5.1 per 100 000.

Das_2020_TheEurresjou,JOUR,Deep-learning algorithm helps to standardise ATS/ERS spirometric acceptability and usability criteria,"Das, Nilakash and Verstraete, Kenneth and Stanojevic, Sanja and Topalovic, Marko and Aerts, Jean-Marie and Janssens, Wim",The European respiratory journal,"RATIONALE: While American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) quality control criteria for spirometry include several quantitative limits, it also requires manual visual inspection. The current approach is time consuming and leads to high intertechnician variability. We propose a deep-learning approach called convolutional neural network (CNN), to standardise spirometric manoeuvre acceptability and usability. METHODS AND METHODS: In 36 873 curves from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey USA 2011-2012, technicians labelled 54% of curves as meeting ATS/ERS 2005 acceptability criteria with satisfactory start and end of test, but identified 93% of curves with a usable forced expiratory volume in 1 s. We processed raw data into images of maximal expiratory flow-volume curve (MEFVC), calculated ATS/ERS quantifiable criteria and developed CNNs to determine manoeuvre acceptability and usability on 90% of the curves. The models were tested on the remaining 10% of curves. We calculated Shapley values to interpret the models. RESULTS: In the test set (n=3738), CNN showed an accuracy of 87% for acceptability and 92% for usability, with the latter demonstrating a high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (96%). They were significantly superior (p<0.0001) to ATS/ERS quantifiable rule-based models. Shapley interpretation revealed MEFVC<1 s (MEFVC pattern within first second of exhalation) and plateau in volume-time were most important in determining acceptability, while MEFVC<1 s entirely determined usability. CONCLUSION: The CNNs identified relevant attributes in spirometric curves to standardise ATS/ERS manoeuvre acceptability and usability recommendations, and further provides individual manoeuvre feedback. Our algorithm combines the visual experience of skilled technicians and ATS/ERS quantitative rules in automating the critical phase of spirometry quality control.",2020,10.1183/13993003.00603-2020,56,6,2000603,eng,1399-3003 0903-1936,United States and Humans and Algorithms and Forced Expiratory Volume and Vital Capacity and *Deep Learning and Exhalation and Spirometry,NA,NA,2020/12//undefined,Eur Respir J,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, surrogate decision makers are asked to make judgments about what treatment pathway is most consistent with the patient's values. Surrogates often struggle with such decisions. The difficulty arises because answering the seemingly straightforward question, ""What do you think the patient would choose?"" is emotionally, cognitively, and morally complex. There is little guidance for clinicians to assist families in constructing an authentic picture of the patient's values and applying them to medical decisions, in part because current models of medical decision making treat the surrogate as the expert on the patient's values and the physician as the expert on technical medical considerations. However, many surrogates need assistance in identifying and working through the sometimes conflicting values relevant to medical decisions near the end of life.

The law of withholding and withdrawal of treatment has much in common with medical ethics. It is based on concerns about patient autonomy expressed by courts, legislatures, and the executive branch of the government. Legally, the patient's right of self-determination has been based on a variety of sources ranging from state and federal constitutions to the common law of torts and from cases to statutes and regulations. Understanding the various sources of the law, the distinctions among those sources, and the interaction of the branches of government in this context assists in understanding the law itself. In our federalist system of government, significant legal variations can exist among the states, but although technically valid, excessive concern about compliance with the precise contours of each state's statute when surrogate decision makers are engaging in bedside deliberations is unnecessary.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the attitudes of surrogate decision-makers toward receiving a physician's recommendation during deliberations about whether to limit life support for an incapacitated patient. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, mixed methods study among 169 surrogate decision-makers for critically ill patients. Surrogates sequentially viewed two videos of simulated physician-surrogate discussions about whether to limit life support, which varied only by whether the physician gave a recommendation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main quantitative outcome was whether surrogates preferred to receive a physicians' recommendation. Surrogates also participated in an in-depth, semistructured interview to explore the reasons for their preference. Fifty-six percent (95/169) of surrogates preferred to receive a recommendation, 42% (70/169) preferred not to receive a recommendation, and 2% (4/169) felt that both approaches were equally acceptable. We identified four main themes that explained surrogates' preferences, including surrogates' perceptions of physicians' appropriate role in life or death decisions and their perceptions of the positive or negative consequences of a recommendation on the physician-surrogate relationship, on the decision-making process, and on long-term regret for the family. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus among surrogates about whether physicians should routinely provide a recommendation regarding life support decisions for incapacitated patients.

Respiratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and staging of lung cancer is an important process that identifies treatment options and guides disease prognosis. We aimed to assess endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration as an initial investigation technique for patients with suspected lung cancer. METHODS: In this open-label, multicentre, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients who had undergone a CT scan and had suspected stage I to IIIA lung cancer, from six UK centres and randomly assigned them to either endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or conventional diagnosis and staging (CDS), for further investigation and staging. If a target node could not be accessed by EBUS-TBNA, then endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was allowed as an alternative procedure. Randomisation was stratified according to the presence of mediastinal lymph nodes measuring 1 cm or more in the short axis and by recruiting centre. We used a telephone randomisation method with permuted blocks of four generated by a computer. Because of the nature of the intervention, masking of participants and consenting investigators was not possible. The primary endpoint was the time-to-treatment decision after completion of the diagnostic and staging investigations and analysis was by intention-to-diagnose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00652769. FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2008, and July 4, 2011, we randomly allocated 133 patients to treatment: 66 to EBUS-TBNA and 67 to CDS (one later withdrew consent). Two patients from the EBUS-TBNA group underwent EUS-FNA. The median time to treatment decision was shorter with EBUS-TBNA (14 days; 95% CI 14-15) than with CDS (29 days; 23-35) resulting in a hazard ratio of 1<c2><b7>98, (1<c2><b7>39-2<c2><b7>82, p<0<c2><b7>0001). One patient in each group had a pneumothorax from a CT-guided biopsy sample; the patient from the CDS group needed intercostal drainage and was admitted to hospital. INTERPRETATION: Transbronchial needle aspiration guided by endobronchial ultrasound should be considered as the initial investigation for patients with suspected lung cancer, because it reduces the time to treatment decision compared with conventional diagnosis and staging techniques.

METHODS: The leadership of three large professional societies representing critical care practitioners convened a diverse group representing a wide variety of views regarding the role of clinical research results in clinical practice to develop a document to serve as a basis for agreement and a framework for ongoing discussion. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on several issues. While the results of rigorous clinical research are important in arriving at the best course of action for an individual critically ill patient, other forms of medical knowledge, including clinical experience and pathophysiologic reasoning, remain essential. No single source of knowledge is sufficient to guide clinical decisions, nor does one kind of knowledge always take precedence over others. Clinicians will find clinical research compelling for a variety of reasons that go beyond study design. While clinical practice guidelines and protocols based upon clinical research may improve care and decrease variability in practice, clinicians must be able to understand and articulate the rationale as to why a particular protocol or guideline is used or why an alternative approach is taken. Making this clinical reasoning explicit is necessary to understand practice variability.

Respiratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation after critical illness is an emerging public health challenge; however, long-term outcomes are incompletely understood. We aimed to systematically analyse long-term survival of critically ill patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library between 1988 and Nov 6, 2013, with no language restrictions, for studies on prolonged mechanical ventilation. We included studies of adult populations treated with mechanical ventilation for more than 14 days, who were admitted to a ventilator weaning unit, or who had a tracheostomy for acute respiratory failure. We abstracted data with a standardised collection template and assessed study quality (ie, risk of bias) using a customised Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We did a stratified analysis based on study setting (eg, acute vs post-acute care hospitals), and used a random-effects model to calculate pooled statistics (proportions with 95% CIs) for all outcomes. We did sensitivity analyses based on study quality (ie, high-quality studies only) and country of origin (USA vs non-USA and USA vs UK). The primary outcome was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, discharge destination among survivors, successful liberation from mechanical ventilation while in hospital, and mortality at timepoints longer than 1 year. FINDINGS: Of 6326 studies identified, 402 underwent full manuscript review, and 124 studies from 16 countries met the inclusion criteria. 39 studies reported mortality at 1 year, which was 59% (95% CI 56-62). Among the 29 high-quality studies, the pooled mortality at 1 year was 62% (95% CI 57-67). Pooled mortality at hospital discharge was 29% (95% CI 26-32). However, only 19% (16-24) were discharged to home and only 50% (47-53) were successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. For studies in post-acute care hospitals, outcomes were worse in the USA than internationally (mortality at 1 year was 73% [95% CI 67-78] in the USA vs 47% [29-65] in non-USA countries; in-hospital mortality was 31% [26-37] vs 18% [14-24]; and liberation from ventilation was 47% [42-51] vs 63% [59-68]; p<0<c2><b7>0001 for all).

This article explores the nature of the physician-patient relationship and of the practice of medicine dating from the Hippocratic tradition to the end of the 19th century, a period during which a beneficence-based medical ethic remained relatively stable. The medical literature dating from the Hippocratic texts to the early codes of the American Medical Association did not include a meaningful role for the patient in the decision-making process. In fact, the practice of benevolent deception--the deliberate withholding of any information thought by the physician to be detrimental to the patient's prognosis--was encouraged. However, as philosophers identified an inherent value in respecting patient self-determination and the law imposed a duty on physicians to obtain informed consent, 2,400 years of relative stability under the beneficence model gave way to the autonomy model.",2011,10.1378/chest.10-2532,139,3,669-673,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"United States and Humans and History, Ancient and *Decision Support Techniques and History, 19th Century and Decision Making/*ethics and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Physicians/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and History, 18th Century and History, Medieval and American Medical Association/history and Ethics, Medical/*history and Hippocratic Oath and History, 15th Century and History, 16th Century and History, 17th Century and Patient Participation/history and Patient Rights/ethics/*history/legislation & jurisprudence and Quality of Health Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards",NA,NA,2011/03//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite growing awareness of quality and safety risks, and significant efforts to improve, progress is difficult to measure. Hospital leaders, including boards and medical staffs, are accountable to improve care, yet they often address this duty independently. Shared responsibility for quality and patient safety improvement presents unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities for boards and medical staffs. To capitalize on the pressure to improve, both groups may benefit from a better understanding of their synergistic potential. Boards should be educated about the quality of care provided in their institutions and about the challenges of valid measurement and accurate reporting. Boards strengthen their quality oversight capacity by recruiting physicians for vacant board seats. Medical staff members strengthen their role as hospital leaders when they understand the unique duties of the governing board. A quality improvement strategy rooted in synergistic efforts by the board and the medical staff may offer the greatest potential for safer care. Such a mutually advantageous approach requires a clear appreciation of roles and responsibilities and respect for differences. In this article, we review these responsibilities, describe opportunities for boards and medical staffs to collaborate as leaders, and offer recommendations for how boards and medical staff members can address the challenges of shared responsibility for quality of care.",2010,10.1378/chest.09-2051,138,1,171-178,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"Humans and Risk Assessment/*methods and *Leadership and *Decision Making, Organizational and Governing Board/*standards and Medical Staff, Hospital/*organization & administration/*standards and Quality Assurance, Health Care/*trends",NA,NA,2010/07//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Under this model, physicians and other clinicians help patients clarify their values and reach consensus about treatment courses consistent with them. Because most critically ill patients are decisionally impaired, family members and other surrogates must make end-of-life decisions for them, ideally in accord with a substituted judgment standard. Physicians generally make decisions for patients who lack families or other surrogates and have no advance directives, based on a best interests standard and occasionally in consultation with other physicians or with review by a hospital ethics committee. End-of-life decisions for patients with surrogates usually are made at family conferences, the functioning of which can be improved by several methods that have been demonstrated to improve communications. Facilitative ethics consultations can be helpful in resolving conflicts when physicians and families disagree in end-of-life decisions.

Randall and Wall, Richard J. and Engelberg, Ruth A.",Chest,"RATIONALE: Families of ICU patients may be at risk for increased psychological morbidity due to end-of-life decision making. The identification of chart-based quality indicators of palliative care that predict family satisfaction with decision making may help to guide interventions to improve decision making and family outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine patient and family characteristics and chart the documentation of processes of care that are associated with increased family satisfaction with end-of-life decision making for ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of ICU patients dying in 10 medical centers in the Seattle-Tacoma area. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes from family surveys included summary scores for family satisfaction with decision making and a single-item score that indicated feeling supported during decision making. Predictor variables were obtained from surveys and chart abstraction. MAIN RESULTS: The survey response rate was 41% (442 of 1,074 families responded). Analyses were conducted of 356 families with questionnaire and chart abstraction data. Family satisfaction with decision making was associated with the withdrawal of life support, and chart documentation of physician recommendations to withdraw life support, discussions of patients' wishes, and discussions of families' spiritual needs. Feeling supported during decision making was associated with the withdrawal of life support, spiritual care involvement, and chart documentation of physician recommendations to withdraw life support, expressions of families' wishes to withdraw life support, and discussions of families' spiritual needs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased family satisfaction with decision making is associated with withdrawing life support and the documentation of palliative care indicators including the following: physician recommendations to withdraw life support; expressions of patients' wishes; and discussions of families' spiritual needs. These findings provide direction for future studies to investigate approaches to improving family satisfaction in end-of-life decision making. In addition, because there were few nonwhites in this study, these results may not be generalizable to more diverse populations.

The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is growing rapidly, and centers providing ECMO must strive to meet stringent quality standards such as those set out by the ECMONet working group. Prognostic tools such as the RESP score can assist clinicians in predicting outcomes for patients with severe acute respiratory failure but do not predict whether ECMO will enhance survival. Evidence continues to grow that novel modes of mechanical ventilation such as neurally adjusted ventilatory assist are feasible and improve patient physiology and patient-ventilator interaction; data on clinical outcomes are limited but supportive. Critical illness causes long-term psychological and function sequelae: the risk of a new psychiatric diagnosis and severe physical impairment is significantly increased in the months after discharge from the intensive care unit. These long-term effects might be amenable to changes in sedation practice and increased early mobilization. Daily sedation discontinuation enhances the validity of routine delirium assessment. Many critically ill patients merit assessment by palliative care clinicians; the demand for palliative care services among critically ill patients is expected to grow.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, prioritize topics, and propose methods for future research on how best to incorporate comorbidities in making decisions regarding LCS. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of international clinicians and researchers reviewed available data on the effects of comorbidities on LCS outcomes, focusing on the juxtaposition of lung cancer risk and competing risks of death, consideration of benefits and risks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, communication of risk, and treatment of screen-detected lung cancer. RESULTS: This statement identifies gaps in knowledge regarding how comorbidities and competing causes of death impact outcomes in LCS, and we have developed questions to help guide future research efforts to better inform patient selection, education, and implementation of LCS.

The traditional view holds that inflammation in sarcoidosis is compartmentalized to involved organs. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether whole blood gene expression signatures reflect inflammatory pathways in the lung in sarcoidosis and whether these signatures overlap with tuberculosis. METHODS: We analyzed transcriptomic data from blood and lung biopsies in sarcoidosis and compared these profiles with blood transcriptomic data from tuberculosis and other diseases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Applying machine learning algorithms to blood gene expression data, we built a classifier that distinguished sarcoidosis from health in derivation and validation cohorts (92% sensitivity, 92% specificity). The most discriminative genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR and correlated with disease severity. Transcript profiles significantly induced in blood overlapped with those in lung biopsies and identified shared dominant inflammatory pathways (e.g., Type-I/II interferons). Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis shared more overlap in blood gene expression compared with other diseases using the 86-gene signature reported to be specific for tuberculosis and the sarcoidosis signature presented herein, although reapplication of machine learning algorithms could identify genes specific for sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that blood transcriptome analysis provides a noninvasive method for identifying inflammatory pathways in sarcoidosis, that these pathways may be leveraged to complement more invasive procedures for diagnosis or assessment of disease severity, and that sarcoidosis and tuberculosis share overlap in gene regulation of specific inflammatory pathways.",2011,10.1164/rccm.201106-1143OC,184,10,1153-1163,eng,1535-4970 1073-449X,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Algorithms and Case-Control Studies and ROC Curve and Severity of Illness Index and Gene Expression Profiling and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Transcriptome/*genetics and Biopsy, Needle and Inflammation/genetics/*metabolism and Lung/immunology/*metabolism/pathology and Sarcoidosis, Pulmonary/blood/genetics/*metabolism/pathology and Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/blood/genetics/*metabolism",NA,NA,2011/11/15/,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objective was to perform a review, synthesizing published data identifying factors associated with family satisfaction with end-of-life care in critically ill adult populations. METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), MEDLINE Updated, EMBASE (Excerpta Medical Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycInfo, and PubMed. Two authors reviewed retrieved titles and abstracts. Studies describing nonadult and non-ICU populations or not addressing end-of-life care, family satisfaction, or factors affecting satisfaction were excluded. The remaining articles underwent full review and data extraction by two authors. Quality was assessed using a checklist based on the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials group. RESULTS: The search yielded 1,072 articles, with 23 articles describing 14 studies meeting inclusion criteria. All studies obtained satisfaction data from family members via surveys and structured interviews. Specific communication strategies increasing satisfaction included: expressions of empathy, nonabandonment, and assurances of comfort and provision of written information. Additionally, support for shared decision-making, family presence at time of death, and specific patient-care measures such as extubation before death were associated with increased satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Good-quality communication, support for shared decision-making, and specific patient-care measures were associated with increased satisfaction with end-of-life care. Assessing the family's desire to participate in shared decision-making may also be an important factor. Few interventions increased satisfaction.

Pope_2012_Ches,JOUR,Legal fundamentals of surrogate decision making,"Pope, Thaddeus Mason",Chest,"The four previous articles in this series have traced the history of patient autonomy and have identified its ethical and legal foundations. Patient autonomy is highly valued in the United States to the extent that the patient does not lose the right of self-determination when he or she loses the capacity to make health-care decisions for him or herself. The law has devised several tools to promote ""prospective autonomy."" One mechanism is the instructional advance directive or living will. But most of us do not write such directives. Another mechanism is the proxy directive or durable power of attorney for health care, designating another person, a surrogate, to direct the course of our medical treatment upon our incapacity. But most of us do not do that either. Therefore, the most common mechanism by which our prospective autonomy is protected and promoted is through the informal selection of surrogates based on statutory priority lists. These ""default"" surrogates are the most numerous type of surrogate. This article explains the importance and legal fundamentals of surrogate decision making. It first describes five basic types of surrogates. The article then looks at the role of these surrogates and how they are supposed to make decisions on the patient's behalf. Unfortunately, surrogate performance is often mediocre or poor. There are significant and persistent obstacles to good surrogate decision making.

These alternative payment models (APMs) are being introduced by government and commercial payers and will likely become the norm over time. Recent changes in sleep medicine related to advances in technology and approaches by payers for the management of OSA make this an appropriate time to incorporate the delivery of sleep medicine services into APMs. For OSA, the approaches that should lead to success include the appropriate use of home sleep apnea testing and automatic positive airway pressure; lower cost providers to manage less complex patients; evolving technologies including cloud-based positive airway pressure adherence monitoring, telemedicine, and Internet-based coaching to improve adherence with treatments; data analytics to better identify high-risk populations and to more appropriately allocate resources; and appropriate referrals of more complex cases to sleep specialists for management.

Tonelli_2010_Ches,JOUR,Compromised autonomy and the seriously ill patient,"Tonelli, Mark R. and Misak, Cheryl J.",Chest,"Respect for patient autonomy has become the preeminent principle of medical ethics, to the point that tools have been developed, such as instructive directives, in an attempt to preserve a semblance of autonomy even when it has become clearly and irretrievably lost. Much of the practice around the respect for autonomy, however, mistakenly supposes that the capacity for autonomous choice is an all-or-nothing proposition. But seriously ill patients may retain some ability to participate in discussions of medical care yet have their autonomy profoundly compromised by physical duress, cognitive dysfunction, or delirium. The choices of individuals with compromised autonomy do not carry the same moral weight as those of the fully autonomous. Clinicians, therefore, cannot rely on such choices for guiding medical decisions and are obligated to evaluate them more fully before acting. We argue that clinicians should compare the choices of individuals with compromised autonomy to a medical assessment of the patient's best interest. When the patient's choice and the best-interests assessment are discordant, acting in the patient's best interest may, at times, rightly override the requests of the patient. Such an approach, under a tightly constrained set of circumstances, would permit both the provision and the withholding of medical interventions despite patient requests to the contrary.",2010,10.1378/chest.09-1574,137,4,926-931,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"Humans and Patient Participation and *Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Critical Illness/*therapy and Patient Rights/ethics",NA,NA,2010/04//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aim was to measure the impact of 24-h, in-house, attending intensivist coverage on the quality of end-of-life care and the timing of end-of-life decision-making. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of all ICU deaths 6 months before and 6 months after the implementation of mandatory 24-h attending intensivist coverage in a medical ICU. Data relevant to end-of-life care per established consensus recommendations were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: The following changes were observed after implementation of 24-h intensivist coverage: Time from ICU admission to decision to withdraw mechanical ventilation and time to decision to change to do-not-resuscitate code status both were shortened by 2 days (both P = .03). Quality measures, such as increased family presence around time of death ( P = .01) also improved. Other findings, which did not reach statistical significance, included the following: Time to family conference was shortened by 2 days ( P = .09), time to decision to limit any life support was shortened by 1 day ( P = .08), time to death was shortened by 2 days ( P = .08), and intubations against patient wishes decreased (from three to none; P = .12). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of mandatory 24-h, in-house, attending intensivist coverage was associated with earlier decision-making across a number of domains related to end-of-life care.

Medical or ethics committees follow a prespecified process, the culmination of which is a justified decision about whether ongoing treatment should be withheld or withdrawn. These procedures have three stages. First, health-care providers must decide to refer patients for consideration of whether ongoing treatment is futile. Second, the committees involved must decide whether ongoing treatment is actually futile. Third, there is a clinical outcome that often is, but not always, patient death. We review the available data on procedure-based futility policies, arguing that there is limited information on their potential harms and how these harms are distributed. We consider the ethical implications of policy-making under informational uncertainty, invoking the precautionary principle--in the absence of clear data, if a policy has significant risk of significant harm, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those recommending the policy--as the guiding moral standard for hospitals and professional organizations considering whether to adopt a procedural approach to medical futility.

It is paramount to ensure that each patient receives optimal treatment in a safe, effective, and timely manner. Evidence suggests that an unacceptably high number of patients currently experience suboptimal care as the result of adverse events and medical error. Simulation-based training reduces medical error, enhances clinical outcomes, and reduces the cost of clinical care. It is surprising that medical simulation is not routinely integrated into the training curricula of all health-care professionals. Simulation enables doctors to practice and hone their technical, communication, decision making, and crisis management skills in a safe and educationally orientated environment. The process can foster the development of interprofessional working skills, leading to enhanced patient outcomes. Selection, credentialing, and revalidation of medical professionals are also possible in a simulation setting, enabling maintenance of standards of practice throughout a medical career.

OBJECTIVES: To observe how surrogates of chronically critically ill patients respond to information about prognosis from palliative care clinicians. METHODS: This was a qualitative analysis of a consecutive sample of audio-recorded meetings from a larger, multisite, randomized trial of structured informational and supportive meetings led by a palliative care physician and nurse practitioner for surrogates of patients in medical intensive care units with chronic critical illness (i.e., adults mechanically ventilated for <e2><89><a5>7 days and expected to remain ventilated and survive for <e2><89><a5>72 h). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 66 audio-recorded meetings involving 51 intervention group surrogates for 43 patients were analyzed using grounded theory. Six main categories of surrogate responses to prognostic information were identified: (1) receptivity, (2) deflection/rejection, (3) emotion, (4) characterization of patient, (5) consideration of surrogate role, and (6) mobilization of support. Surrogates responded in multiple and even antithetical ways, within and across meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic disclosure by skilled clinician communicators evokes a repertoire of responses from surrogates for the chronically critically ill.

We propose a new look at this old problem and suggest reframing the debate in terms of the implicit social contract, in healthy democracies, between the medical profession and the society it serves. This ever-evolving contract is predicated upon providing patients with beneficial and desired medical care within the constraints of scarce resources and the characteristics of our health-care system. The contract ranges over a continuum of decisions, from those that do not need an explicit negotiated agreement with the patient or surrogate, to those that do. Between these two poles lies a contentious gray area, where the rights and obligations of patients and physicians are being shaped continuously by the many forces that are at play in a democratic society, including professional guidelines, social advocacy, legislation, and litigation. We provide examples of how this gray area has been and is negotiated around rights to refuse and demand a variety of life-sustaining treatments, and anticipate conflicts likely to arise in the future. Reframing the futility debate in this way reveals that the issue is not a story of intractable failure, but rather, a successful narrative about how democracies balance the legitimate perspectives of patients and physicians against a backdrop of societal constraints and values.",2014,10.1378/chest.14-0513,146,6,1667-1672,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Patient Selection and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Medical Futility/*ethics/psychology and Resource Allocation/*ethics and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*ethics",NA,NA,2014/12//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared terminal withdrawal of MV at an LTACH with that in a medical ICU (MICU). METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review was done of all patients undergoing terminal withdrawal of MV in an LTACH (n = 30) and in a MICU (n = 74) over a 2-year period. RESULTS: The decision to withdraw MV was more likely initiated by patient or family in the LTACH and by medical staff in the MICU (p < 0.0001). Social workers, pastoral care, and hospital administration were more likely to participate in the withdrawal process at the LTACH compared with the MICU (p < 0.05). Time from initiation of MV to orders for do not resuscitate, comfort measures only, or withdrawal of MV was significantly greater in the LTACH (weeks) compared with the MICU (days) (p < 0.05). The dose of benzodiazepines given during the final 24 h of life was greater in the MICU as compared with the LTACH (p < 0.05). Narcotic and benzodiazepine use in the hour before or after withdrawal of MV did not differ between the two groups. COPD and pneumonia were the most common causes of death among patients undergoing withdrawal of MV at the LTACH, as opposed to septic shock in the MICU (p < 0.05).

Although the importance and impact of lung-protective ventilation is widely appreciated and well established, the concept of diaphragm-protective ventilation has recently emerged as a potential complementary therapeutic strategy. This Perspective, developed from discussions at a meeting of international experts convened by PLUG (the Pleural Pressure Working Group) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, outlines a conceptual framework for an integrated lung- and diaphragm-protective approach to mechanical ventilation on the basis of growing evidence about mechanisms of injury. We propose targets for diaphragm protection based on respiratory effort and patient-ventilator synchrony. The potential for conflict between diaphragm protection and lung protection under certain conditions is discussed; we emphasize that when conflicts arise, lung protection must be prioritized over diaphragm protection. Monitoring respiratory effort is essential to concomitantly protect both the diaphragm and the lung during mechanical ventilation. To implement lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation, new approaches to monitoring, to setting the ventilator, and to titrating sedation will be required. Adjunctive interventions, including extracorporeal life support techniques, phrenic nerve stimulation, and clinical decision-support systems, may also play an important role in selected patients in the future. Evaluating the clinical impact of this new paradigm will be challenging, owing to the complexity of the intervention.

Dingfield_2017_Ches,JOUR,Integrating Advance Care Planning Into Practice,"Dingfield, Laura E. and Kayser, Joshua B.",Chest,"Advanced respiratory diseases progress over time and often lead to death. As the condition worsens, patients may lose medical decision-making ability. Advance care planning (ACP) is a process in which patients receive information about their diagnosis and prognosis; discuss values, goals, and fears; articulate preferences about life-sustaining treatments and end-of-life care; and appoint a surrogate medical decision maker. This process may result in written documentation of patient preferences or the appointment of a health-care power of attorney (HCPOA). ACP discussions have multiple benefits for patients and their surrogate decision makers, including ensuring that the care provided is aligned with the patient's goals and preferences and decreasing stress, anxiety, and burden in surrogates. Time and provider comfort are often cited barriers to ACP, so it may be necessary for clinicians to gain experience in conversations and identify the patients most likely to benefit from ACP discussions. Two new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, 99497 and 99498, have been recognized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as of January 1, 2016 and are intended to incentivize clinicians to engage in ACP discussions with their patients earlier and with more frequency.

F. and Bogaert, Debby",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"RATIONALE: Many bacterial pathogens causing respiratory infections in children are common residents of the respiratory tract. Insight into bacterial colonization patterns and microbiota stability at a young age might elucidate healthy or susceptible conditions for development of respiratory disease. OBJECTIVES: To study bacterial succession of the respiratory microbiota in the first 2 years of life and its relation to respiratory health characteristics. METHODS: Upper respiratory microbiota profiles of 60 healthy children at the ages of 1.5, 6, 12, and 24 months were characterized by 16S-based pyrosequencing. We determined consecutive microbiota profiles by machine-learning algorithms and validated the findings cross-sectionally in an additional cohort of 140 children per age group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we identified eight distinct microbiota profiles in the upper respiratory tract of healthy infants. Profiles could already be identified at 1.5 months of age and were associated with microbiota stability and change over the first 2 years of life. More stable patterns were marked by early presence and high abundance of Moraxella and Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum and were positively associated with breastfeeding in the first period of life and with lower rates of parental-reported respiratory infections in the consecutive periods. Less stable profiles were marked by high abundance of Haemophilus or Streptococcus.

The resultant civil unrest and demands for racial justice have spawned a global call for change. As a subset of a society that struggles with racism and other explicit biases, it is inescapable that some physicians and health-care employees will have the same explicit biases as the general population. Patients who receive care at academic medical centers interact with multiple individuals, some of whom may have explicit and implicit biases that influence patient care. In fact, multiple reports have documented that some physicians, health-care workers, and health professional students have negative biases based on race, ethnicity, obesity, religion, and sexual identity, among others. These biases can influence decision-making and aggravate health-care disparities and patient-physician mistrust. We review four actual cases from academic medical centers that illustrate how well-intended physicians and health-care workers can be influenced by bias and how this can put patients at risk. Strategies to mitigate bias are discussed and recommended.

To address these limitations, we have--in our innovative research program and nonprofit organization, MAGIC (Making GRADE the Irresistible Choice)--constructed a conceptual framework and tools to facilitate the creation, dissemination, and dynamic updating of trustworthy guidelines.

Modifications in guidelines, such as recommendation updates, will lead to automatic alterations in these outputs with minimal additional labor for guideline authors and publishers, greatly facilitating dynamic updating of guidelines. Semiautomated creation of a new generation of decision aids linked to guideline recommendations should facilitate face-to-face shared decision-making in the clinical encounter.

P. and Innes, Cameron and Pinto, Ruxandra and Rubenfeld, Gordon D.",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"RATIONALE: Cross-coverage is associated with medical errors caused by miscommunication during handoffs. However, no direct evidence links handoffs to outcomes, or explains the mechanisms leading to outcomes. Furthermore, the previous literature may overestimate the impact of handoffs because of hindsight bias. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of nighttime cross-coverage on mortality and decision making in critically ill patients. METHODS: Observational cohort of 629 consecutive critically ill admissions, admitted for at least 48 hours, and critical care fellows in an academic hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and nighttime decisions. Our exposure variable was cross-covering status of fellows. We observed a decrease in ICU mortality (odds ratio, 0.77 per 1 d; 0.60-0.99; P = 0.04), a higher number of nighttime decisions (19.3 vs. 10.4%; odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.95; P = 0.04), an increase in fentanyl equivalents administered to patients at night (difference, +10.2 <ce><bc>g/h; 95% CI, +1.4 to +19.0; P = 0.02), and an increase in transfusions at night (difference, +465 ml; 95% CI, +98 to +832; P = 0.01) when fellows were cross-covering. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study exposure to cross-covering fellows was associated with a decrease in ICU mortality and with more nighttime decisions.

Decisions to limit life-sustaining therapies are strongly associated with high risks for death in ways that are unaccounted for by routine measures of illness severity. However, this essential information is generally unavailable to researchers, with the potential for spurious inferences. This may lead to ""confounding by unmeasured patient preferences"" (a type of confounding by indication) and has implications for assessments of treatment effectiveness and healthcare quality, especially in acute and critical care settings in which risk for death and adverse events are high. Through a collection of case studies, we explore the effect of unmeasured patient resuscitation preferences on issues critical for researchers and research consumers to understand. We then propose strategies to more consistently elicit, record, and harmonize documentation of patient preferences that can be used to attenuate confounding by unmeasured patient preferences and provide novel opportunities to improve the patient centeredness of medical care for serious illness.",2017,10.1164/rccm.201701-0165CP,196,8,958-963,eng,1535-4970 1073-449X,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Treatment Outcome and Aged, 80 and over and Quality of Life/*psychology and quality of healthcare and Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data and Patient Preference/*psychology and Quality of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data and end-of-life care and Advance Care Planning/*standards/*statistics & numerical data and epidemiologic biases",NA,NA,2017/10/15/,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schnapp_2020_Ches,JOUR,Basic Primer for Finances in Academic Adult and Pediatric Pulmonary Divisions,"Schnapp, Lynn M. and Steiner, Michael J. and Davis, Stephanie D.",Chest,"The finances of academic medical centers (AMCs) are complex and rapidly evolving. This financial environment can have important effects on faculty expectations, compensation, and the work environment. This article describes the commonly used concepts and models related to financial decision-making in Pulmonology and Critical Care divisions across AMCs in the United States. Faculty clinical productivity is often measured by work relative value units, which are set nationally for a discrete piece of physician work and attempt to equilibrate aspects of care across specialties. The expected clinical productivity and salary for a given faculty member are often determined relative to one or more national benchmarks developed from data submitted by departments and schools across the country. The most commonly used benchmarks include those from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Medical Group Management Association. Changes to the paradigm of fee for service reimbursement are beginning to change physician compensation and incentive structures. In addition, research and education are key academic missions for faculty. It is important to understand the limitations of extramural research funding and implications for the support of research infrastructure. Measurements of productivity within education have been less codified, but some centers are attempting to create educational relative value units similar to those used in clinical productivity. In summary, faculty should understand basic concepts of finances. This knowledge includes a common set of terms and concepts that can help all faculty understand basic financial considerations in their work and lead to success for their divisions.",2020,10.1016/j.chest.2019.09.019,157,2,363-368,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"United States and Humans and Reimbursement, Incentive and Adult and Efficiency and Child and Fee-for-Service Plans and Research Support as Topic and Faculty, Medical and Reimbursement Mechanisms and *Financial Management and clinical practice and Salaries and Fringe Benefits and Relative Value Scales and Academic Medical Centers/*economics and Critical Care/*economics and finance and Pediatrics/economics and pulmonary division and Pulmonary Medicine/*economics",NA,NA,2020/02//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6 to 18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFT, which includes spirometry, lung volume, and diffusion capacity measurement, is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, and novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers and mobile health technologies along with integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options comes important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed.

METHODS: We conducted an observational survey study of a prospectively defined cohort of family members, spouses, and partners of patients admitted to surgical, medical, and trauma ICUs at a large academic medical center. Two validated instruments, the Learned Helplessness Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale, were used, and self-report of patient clinical characteristics and subject demographics were collected. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-nine family members were assessed. Of these, 238 of 460 (51.7%) had responses consistent with a significant degree of learned helplessness. Among surrogate decision-makers, this proportion was 50% (92 of 184). Characteristics associated with significant learned helplessness included grade or high school education (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.29-8.27; P = .01) and Perceived Stress Scale score > 18 (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.65-6.50; P < .001).

For most, death occurs following the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatments. The integration of palliative care is essential for high-quality critical care. Although palliative care specialists are becoming increasingly available, intensivists and other physicians are also expected to provide basic palliative care, including symptom treatment and communication about goals of care. Patients who are critically ill are often unable to make decisions about their care. In these situations, physicians must meet with family members or other surrogates to determine appropriate medical treatments. These meetings require clinical expertise to ensure that patient values are explored for medical decision making about therapeutic options, including palliative care. Meetings with families take time. Issues related to the disease process, prognosis, and treatment plan are complex, and decisions about the use or limitation of intensive care therapies have life-or-death implications. Inadequate reimbursement for physician services may be a barrier to the optimal delivery of high-quality palliative care, including effective communication.

Although the relative value of health states to patients should provide the basis for these trade-offs, few guidelines have systematically summarized the relevant evidence. We conducted a systematic review relating to values and preferences of patients considering antithrombotic therapy. METHODS: We included studies examining patient preferences for alternative approaches to antithrombotic prophylaxis and studies that examined, in the context of antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, how patients value alternative health states and experiences with treatment. We conducted a systematic search and compiled structured summaries of the results. Steps in the process that involved judgment were conducted in duplicate. RESULTS: We identified 48 eligible studies. Sixteen dealt with atrial fibrillation, five with VTE, four with stroke or myocardial infarction prophylaxis, six with thrombolysis in acute stroke or myocardial infarction, and 17 with burden of antithrombotic treatment. CONCLUSION: Patient values and preferences regarding thromboprophylaxis treatment appear to be highly variable.

PURPOSE: This multisociety statement provides recommendations to prevent and manage intractable disagreements about the use of such treatments in intensive care units. METHODS: The recommendations were developed using an iterative consensus process, including expert committee development and peer review by designated committees of each of the participating professional societies (American Thoracic Society, American Association for Critical Care Nurses, American College of Chest Physicians, European Society for Intensive Care Medicine, and Society of Critical Care). MAIN RESULTS: The committee recommends: (1) Institutions should implement strategies to prevent intractable treatment conflicts, including proactive communication and early involvement of expert consultants. (2) The term ""potentially inappropriate"" should be used, rather than futile, to describe treatments that have at least some chance of accomplishing the effect sought by the patient, but clinicians believe that competing ethical considerations justify not providing them. Clinicians should explain and advocate for the treatment plan they believe is appropriate. Conflicts regarding potentially inappropriate treatments that remain intractable despite intensive communication and negotiation should be managed by a fair process of conflict resolution; this process should include hospital review, attempts to find a willing provider at another institution, and opportunity for external review of decisions. When time pressures make it infeasible to complete all steps of the conflict-resolution process and clinicians have a high degree of certainty that the requested treatment is outside accepted practice, they should seek procedural oversight to the extent allowed by the clinical situation and need not provide the requested treatment. (3) Use of the term ""futile"" should be restricted to the rare situations in which surrogates request interventions that simply cannot accomplish their intended physiologic goal. Clinicians should not provide futile interventions. (4) The medical profession should lead public engagement efforts and advocate for policies and legislation about when life-prolonging technologies should not be used.

Luce_2013_Ches,JOUR,"Chronic disorders of consciousness following coma: Part two: ethical, legal, and social issues","Luce, John M.",Chest,"Increasing numbers of patients survive traumatic brain injury and cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation and are admitted to the ICU while in coma. Some of these patients become brain dead; others regain consciousness. Still others become vegetative or minimally conscious, conditions called chronic disorders of consciousness and ultimately can be cared for outside the ICU. Whether these patients would want life-sustaining therapy is difficult to determine because most have not articulated their wishes before becoming comatose. Ethics and law recognize that patients with decision-making capacity have a right to refuse such therapy and that surrogates can exercise this right for them through the principle of substituted judgment as was established by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan. In its decision regarding Nancy Cruzan, the US Supreme Court determined that states may require clear and convincing evidence of a vegetative patient's prior wishes before life-sustaining therapy may be withdrawn; this standard has been applied to minimally conscious patients by state supreme courts in some cases. Nevertheless, cases such as these only come to the legal system because end-of-life decisions are contested, which is unusual, and most end-of-life decisions for specific patients with chronic disorders of consciousness are made by surrogates with recommendations from physicians without court involvement. Recent advances in neuroimaging may influence both end-of-life decision-making and legal deliberations.

Aulisio_2008_Ches,JOUR,Role of the ethics committee: helping to address value conflicts or uncertainties,"Aulisio, Mark P. and Arnold, Robert M.",Chest,"This article addresses two basic questions about ethics committees: why we have them, and how they might be helpful to clinicians. Our answer to the first question is twofold. First, we suggest that legal, regulatory, and professional forces drove the development of ethics committees, particularly as an alternative to litigation. Second, we argue that ethics committees arose in response to a clinical need for a formal mechanism to address some of the value conflicts and uncertainties that arise in contemporary health-care settings. We argue that this need, reflected in early high-profile legal cases, stems partly from the complex value-laden nature of clinical decision making, a pluralistic societal context, a growing recognition of the rights of individuals to live by their values, and the relevance of those values for medical decision making. In answer to the second question, we draw out three ways ethics committees might be helpful to clinicians: education, policy formation or review, and consultation. We devote the majority of our discussion to ethics consultation and its relation to the emerging area of palliative care. In so doing, we highlight three important differences: (1) the scope or range of cases for which they may be appropriate, (2) focus in any particular case, and (3) general orientation-between ethics consultation and palliative care that clinicians should take into account in deciding to seek the assistance of either or both.",2008,10.1378/chest.08-0136,134,2,417-424,eng,0012-3692,"Humans and Policy Making and Ethics Consultation and Ethics, Clinical/education and Dissent and Disputes/legislation & jurisprudence and Ethics Committees, Clinical/*organization & administration and Professional Misconduct/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2008/08//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined patient outcomes before and after implementation of an intensive communication system (ICS) to test the effect of regular, structured formal family meetings on patient outcomes among long-stay ICU patients. METHODS: One hundred thirty-five patients receiving usual care and communication were enrolled as the control group, followed by enrollment of intervention patients (n = 346), from five ICUs. The ICS included a family meeting within 5 days of ICU admission and weekly thereafter. Each meeting discussed medical update, values and preferences, and goals of care; treatment plan; and milestones for judging effectiveness of treatment. RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences between control and intervention patients in length of stay (LOS), the primary end point. Similarly, there were no significant differences in indicators of aggressiveness of care or treatment limitation decisions (ICU mortality, LOS, duration of ventilation, treatment limitation orders, or use of tracheostomy or percutaneous gastrostomy). Exploratory analysis suggested that in the medical ICUs, the intervention was associated with a lower prevalence of tracheostomy among patients who died or had do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders in place. CONCLUSIONS: The negative findings of the main analysis, in combination with preliminary evidence of differences among types of unit, suggest that further examination of the influence of patient, family, and unit characteristics on the effects of a system of regular family meetings may be warranted. Despite the lack of influence on patient outcomes, structured family meetings may be an effective approach to meeting information and support needs.

These circumstances increase provider uncertainty as well as patients' vulnerability and may, therefore, jeopardize disciplined, ethical decision-making. Planning for pandemics and disasters should incorporate ethics guidance to support providers who may otherwise make ad hoc patient care decisions that overstep ethical boundaries. This article provides consensus-developed suggestions about ethical challenges in caring for the critically ill or injured during pandemics or disasters. The suggestions in this article are important for all of those involved in any pandemic or disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS: We adapted the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines Oversight Committee's methodology to develop suggestions. Twenty-four key questions were developed, and literature searches were conducted to identify evidence for suggestions. The detailed literature reviews produced 144 articles. Based on their expertise within this domain, panel members also supplemented the literature search with governmental publications, interdisciplinary workgroup consensus documents, and other information not retrieved through PubMed. The literature in this field is not suitable to support evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS: We report the suggestions that focus on five essential domains: triage and allocation, ethical concerns of patients and families, ethical responsibilities to providers, conduct of research, and international concerns.

Q. and Meyer, Elaine C. and Scoppettuolo, Lisa A. and McGann, Elizabeth A. and Trainor, Bethany P. and Rachwal, Christine M. and Hickey, Patricia A.",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"RATIONALE: Parent presence during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation is a relatively underdeveloped and controversial practice. Much of the concern stems from the apprehension of the medical community. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether implementation of formal practice guidelines and corresponding interprofessional education would improve clinicians' sense of preparation and comfort in providing parents with options during their children's procedures. METHODS: Multiphase pre-post survey of (1) clinician perceptions and (2) practice from the perspective of clinicians and parents experiencing the same procedure. Data were collected over 4 years from a cardiovascular and critical care program in one U.S. children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More than 70% of clinicians participated in the perception surveys (n = 782) and 538 clinicians and 274 parents participated in the practice surveys. After the intervention, clinicians reported that parents were present during more invasive procedures and reported higher levels of comfort with the practice of providing options to parents during resuscitative events. Levels of comfort were higher in clinicians who had practiced skills in a simulated learning environment. During both phases, few clinicians reported that parent presence affected their technical performance (4%), therapeutic decision-making (5%), or ability to teach (9%). During the post phase, clinicians reported more active parent behaviors during procedures. Parents who reported receiving information to help them prepare for their children's procedures reported higher levels of procedural understanding and emotional support.

Will_2011_Ches_1,JOUR,A brief historical and theoretical perspective on patient autonomy and medical decision making: Part II: The autonomy model,"Will, Jonathan F.",Chest,"As part of a larger series addressing the intersection of law and medicine, this essay is the second of two introductory pieces. Beginning with the Hippocratic tradition and lasting for the next 2,400 years, the physician-patient relationship remained relatively unchanged under the beneficence model, a paternalistic framework characterized by the authoritative physician being afforded maximum discretion by the trusting, obedient patient. Over the last 100 years or so, in response to certain changes taking place in both research and clinical practice, the bioethics movement ushered in the autonomy model, and with it, a profoundly different way of approaching decision making in medicine. The shift from the beneficence model to the autonomy model is governed legally by the informed consent doctrine, which emphasizes disclosure to patients of information sufficient to permit them to make intelligent choices regarding treatment alternatives. As this legal doctrine became established, philosophers identified an inherent value in respecting patients as autonomous agents, even where patient choice seems to conflict with the physician's duty to act in the patient's best interests. Whereas the beneficence model presumed that the physician knew what was in the patient's best interests, the autonomy model starts from the premise that the patient knows what treatment decision is in line with his or her true sense of well-being, even where that decision is the refusal of treatment and the result is the patient's death.",2011,10.1378/chest.11-0516,139,6,1491-1497,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"United States and Humans and History, 20th Century and *Personal Autonomy and History, 19th Century and Patient Rights/ethics/*history/legislation & jurisprudence and Informed Consent/ethics/*history/legislation & jurisprudence and Patient Participation/*history/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

We hypothesized that the respiratory microbiota composition and development in infancy is affecting microbiota stability and thereby resistance against respiratory tract infections (RTIs) over time. OBJECTIVES: To investigate common environmental drivers, including birth mode, feeding type, antibiotic exposure, and crowding conditions, in relation to respiratory tract microbiota maturation and stability, and consecutive risk of RTIs over the first year of life. METHODS: In a prospectively followed cohort of 112 infants, we characterized the nasopharyngeal microbiota longitudinally from birth on (11 consecutive sample moments and the maximum three RTI samples per subject; in total, n = 1,121 samples) by 16S-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using a microbiota-based machine-learning algorithm, we found that children experiencing a higher number of RTIs in the first year of life already demonstrate an aberrant microbial developmental trajectory from the first month of life on as compared with the reference group (0-2 RTIs/yr). The altered microbiota maturation process coincided with decreased microbial community stability, prolonged reduction of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum, enrichment of Moraxella very early in life, followed by later enrichment of Neisseria and Prevotella spp. Independent drivers of these aberrant developmental trajectories of respiratory microbiota members were mode of delivery, infant feeding, crowding, and recent antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that environmental drivers impact microbiota development and, consequently, resistance against development of RTIs. This supports the idea that microbiota form the mediator between early-life environmental risk factors for and susceptibility to RTIs over the first year of life.",2017,10.1164/rccm.201703-0554OC,196,12,1582-1590,eng,1535-4970 1073-449X,"Humans and Female and Male and Child and Infant and Longitudinal Studies and Cohort Studies and Prospective Studies and development and risk factors and Microbiota/*physiology and Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use and Netherlands/epidemiology and Delivery, Obstetric/statistics & numerical data and *Environment and Nasopharynx/*microbiology and Breast Feeding/statistics & numerical data and Infant Food/statistics & numerical data and nasopharynx and respiratory microbiota and respiratory tract infections and Respiratory Tract Infections/*epidemiology",NA,NA,2017/12/15/,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jr and Toner, Eric S. and Roxland, Beth E. and Penn, Matthew S. and Devereaux, Asha V. and Dichter, Jeffrey R. and Kissoon, Niranjan and Christian, Michael D. and Powell, Tia",Chest,"BACKGROUND: Significant legal challenges arise when health-care resources become scarce and population-based approaches to care are implemented during severe disasters and pandemics. Recent emergencies highlight the serious legal, economic, and health impacts that can be associated with responding in austere conditions and the critical importance of comprehensive, collaborative health response system planning. This article discusses legal suggestions developed by the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Task Force for Mass Critical Care to support planning and response efforts for mass casualty incidents involving critically ill or injured patients. The suggestions in this chapter are important for all of those involved in a pandemic or disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS: Following the CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee's methodology, the Legal Panel developed 35 key questions for which specific literature searches were then conducted. The literature in this field is not suitable to provide support for evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process resulting in seven final suggestions. RESULTS: Acceptance is widespread for the health-care community's duty to appropriately plan for and respond to severe disasters and pandemics. Hospitals, public health entities, and clinicians have an obligation to develop comprehensive, vetted plans for mass casualty incidents involving critically ill or injured patients. Such plans should address processes for evacuation and limited appeals and reviews of care decisions. To legitimize responses, deter independent actions, and trigger liability protections, mass critical care (MCC) plans should be formally activated when facilities and practitioners shift to providing MCC. Adherence to official MCC plans should contribute to protecting hospitals and practitioners who act in good faith from liability. Finally, to address anticipated staffing shortages during severe and prolonged disasters and pandemics, governments should develop approaches to formally expand the availability of qualified health-care workers, such as through using official foreign medical teams. CONCLUSIONS: As a fundamental element of health-care and public health emergency planning and preparedness, the law underlies critical aspects of disaster and pandemic responses. Effective responses require comprehensive advance planning efforts that include assessments of complex legal issues and authorities. Recent disasters have shown that although law is a critical response tool, it can also be used to hold health-care stakeholders who fail to appropriately plan for or respond to disasters and pandemics accountable for resulting patient or staff harm. Claims of liability from harms allegedly suffered during disasters and pandemics cannot be avoided altogether. However, appropriate planning and legal protections can help facilitate sound, consistent decision-making and support response participation among health-care entities and practitioners.",2014,10.1378/chest.14-0741,146,4 Suppl,44S-e134S,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,Humans and Decision Making and *Consensus and *Pandemics and Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration and Critical Illness/*therapy and *Disasters and Wounds and Injuries/*therapy and Critical Care/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2014/10//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Randall",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"RATIONALE: Most deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) involve withholding or withdrawing multiple life-sustaining therapies, but little is known about how to proceed practically and how this process affects family satisfaction. OBJECTIVES: To examine the duration of life-support withdrawal and its association with overall family satisfaction with care in the ICU. METHODS: We studied family members of 584 patients who died in an ICU at 1 of 14 hospitals after withdrawal of life support and for whom complete medical chart and family questionnaires were available. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data concerning six life-sustaining interventions administered during the last 5 days of life were collected. Families were asked to rate their satisfaction with care using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU questionnaire. For nearly half of the patients (271/584), withdrawal of all life-sustaining interventions took more than 1 day. Patients with a prolonged (>1 d) life-support withdrawal were younger, stayed longer in the ICU, had more life-sustaining interventions, had less often a diagnosis of cancer, and had more decision makers involved. Among patients with longer ICU stays, a longer duration in life-support withdrawal was associated with an increase in family satisfaction with care (P = 0.037). Extubation before death was associated with higher family satisfaction with care (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of life support is a complex process that depends on patient and family characteristics. Stuttering withdrawal is a frequent phenomenon that seems to be associated with family satisfaction.

M. and Koopmans, Matty and van der Woude, Meta and Bormans, Laura and Hovingh, Aly and Spronk, Peter E.",Chest,"OBJECTIVE: Admission to the ICU is a major event in a patient's life and also for family members. We tried to elucidate how family members and ICU caregivers experience the dying process of their patients. METHODS: The prospective study took place in three Dutch ICUs. Patients who had stayed . 48 h and died in the ICU were eligible. The Quality of Dying and Death (QODD) questionnaire was used, with addition of items pertaining to the patient's autonomy. Values indicate median and interquartile range. RESULTS: We included 100 consecutive patients. ICU stay before death was 8 (3-16) days. APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score at admission was 24 (19-31). Family response rate was 89%. Families were satisfied with overall QODD (score, 8 [7-9]) and felt supported by the ICU caregivers (8 [7-9]). Pain control was scored lower by family members (8 [5.75- 8.25]) than by nurses and physicians (9 [8-10], P 5 .024) Almost always, physicians discussed the patient's end-of-life wishes with family members, although families rated the quality of the discussion lower (7 [5.5-8.5]) than physicians (9 [6.5-10]) ( P 5 .045). The majority of the families (89%) felt included in the decision-making process. More than one-half of the family members (57%) believed that the physician made the fi nal decision alone after giving information, whereas 36.8% believed they had participated in making the decision. Family members rated the QODD questionnaire as difficult (6 [5-8]), and several items were not answered by a majority of family members.

Curtis_2008_Ches,JOUR,Practical guidance for evidence-based ICU family conferences,"Curtis, J.

Therefore, clinician-family communication is a central component of medical decision making in the ICU, and the quality of this communication has direct bearing on decisions made regarding care for critically ill patients. In addition, studies suggest that clinician-family communication can also have profound effects on the experiences and long-term mental health of family members. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a context and rationale for improving the quality of communication with family members and to provide practical, evidence-based guidance on how to conduct this communication in the ICU setting. We emphasize the importance of discussing prognosis effectively, the key role of the integrated interdisciplinary team in this communication, and the importance of assessing spiritual needs and addressing barriers that can be raised by cross-cultural communication. We also discuss the potential value of protocols to encourage communication and the potential role of quality improvement for enhancing communication with family members. Last, we review issues regarding physician reimbursement for communication with family members within the context of the US health-care system.

The objective of this study was to document the characteristics of ICU patients with a decision to withhold/withdraw life-sustaining treatment, including the types of supportive treatments used, patterns of organ dysfunction, and international differences, including gross national income (GNI). METHODS: In this observational cohort study conducted in 730 ICUs in 84 countries, all adult patients admitted between May 8, 2012, and May 18, 2012 (except admissions for routine postoperative surveillance), were included. RESULTS: The analysis included 9,524 patients, with a hospital mortality of 24%.

OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) what degree of decisional authority surrogates prefer for value-sensitive life support decisions compared with more technical biomedical decisions, and (2) what predicts surrogates' preferences for more control over life support decisions. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 230 surrogate decision makers for incapacitated, mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of death. Surrogates reported their preferred degree of decisional authority using the Degner Control Preferences Scale for two types of decisions: a value-sensitive decision about whether to discontinue life support and a decision regarding which antibiotic to prescribe for an infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority of surrogates (55%, 127/230; 95% confidence interval, 49-62%) preferred to have final control over the value-sensitive life support decision; 40% (91/230) wished to share control equally with the physician; 5% (12/230) of surrogates wanted the physician to make the decision. Surrogates preferred significantly more control over the value-sensitive life support decision compared with the technical decision about choice of antibiotics (P < 0.0001). Factors independently associated with surrogates' preference for more control over the life support decision were: less trust in the intensive care unit physician, male sex, and non-Catholic religious affiliation.

We sought to determine the attitudes of surrogates of patients who are critically ill toward whether physicians can predict futility and whether these attitudes predict surrogates' willingness to discontinue life support when faced with predictions of futility. METHODS: This multicenter, mixed qualitative and quantitative study took place at three hospitals in California from 2006 to 2007. We conducted semistructured interviews with surrogate decision makers for 50 patients who were critically ill and incapacitated that addressed their beliefs about medical futility and inductively developed an organizing framework to describe these beliefs. We used a hypothetical scenario with a modified time-trade-off design to examine the relationship between a patient's prognosis and a surrogate's willingness to withdraw life support. We used a mixed-effects regression model to examine the association between surrogates' attitudes about futility and their willingness to limit life support in the face of a very poor prognosis. Validation methods included the use and integration of multiple data sources, multidisciplinary analysis, and member checking. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of surrogates (n = 32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 77%) expressed doubt about the accuracy of physicians' futility predictions, 32% of surrogates (n = 16; 95% CI, 20 to 47%) elected to continue life support with a < 1% survival estimate, and 18% of surrogates (n = 9; 95% CI, 9 to 31%) elected to continue treatment when the physician believed that the patient had no chance of survival. Surrogates with religious objections to the futility rationale (n = 18) were more likely to request continued life support (odds ratio, 4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 14.0; p = 0.03) than those with secular or experiential objections (n = 15; odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.4; p = 0.90).

We developed guidelines to optimize ABG use in the ICU. METHODS: ABG use guidelines were implemented in all adult ICUs in our institution: three medical, two trauma-surgery, one cardiovascular, and one neurosurgical ICU. Although relying on pulse oximetry, we encouraged the use of ABG determination after an acute respiratory event or for a rational clinical concern and discouraged obtaining ABG measurements for routine surveillance, after planned changes of positive end-expiratory pressure or Fio(2) on the mechanical ventilator, for spontaneous breathing trials, or when a disorder was not suspected. ABG measurements and global ICU metrics were collected before (year 2014) and after (year 2015) the intervention. RESULTS: We saw a reduction of 821.5 <c2><b1> 257.4 ABG determinations per month (41.5%), or approximately one ABG determination per patient per mechanical ventilation (MV) day for each month (43.1%), after introducing the guidelines (P < .001). This represented 49 L of saved blood, a reduction of $39,432 in the costs of ICU care, and 1,643 staff work hours freed for other tasks. Appropriately indicated tests rose to 83.4% from a baseline 67.5% (P = .002). Less than 5% of inappropriately indicated ABG determinations changed patient management in the postintervention period.

Schuetz_2012_Ches,JOUR,Role of procalcitonin in managing adult patients with respiratory tract infections,"Schuetz, Philipp and Amin, Devendra N. and Greenwald, Jeffrey L.",Chest,"Respiratory infections remain the most common reason why patients seek medical care in ambulatory and hospital settings, and they are the most frequent precursor of sepsis. In light of the limitations of clinical signs and symptoms and traditional microbiologic diagnostics for respiratory infections, blood biomarkers that correlate with the presence and extent of bacterial infections may provide additional useful information to improve diagnostic and prognostic efforts and help with therapeutic decisions in individual patients. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate bacterial from viral respiratory diagnoses, to help risk stratify patients, and to guide antibiotic therapy decisions about initial need for, and optimal duration of, therapy. Although still relatively new on the clinical frontier, a series of randomized controlled trials have evaluated PCT protocols for antibiotic-related decision making and have included patients from different clinical settings and with different severities of respiratory infection. In these trials, initial PCT levels were effective in guiding decisions about the initiation of antibiotic therapy in lower-acuity patients, and subsequent measurements were effective for guiding duration of therapy in higher-acuity patients, without apparent harmful effects. Recent European respiratory infection guidelines now also recognize this concept. As with any other laboratory test, PCT should not be used on a stand-alone basis. Rather, it must be integrated into clinical protocols, together with clinical, microbiologic data and with results from clinical risk scores.

Mark and Ng, Raymond and Zafari, Zafar and McManus, Bruce and Hollander, Zsuzsanna and Marra, Carlo A. and Sadatsafavi, Mohsen",Chest,"BACKGROUND: Up-to-date estimates of burden of diseases are required for evidence-based decision-making. The objectives of this study were to determine the excess costs of COPD and its trend from 2001 to 2010 in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: We used British Columbia's administrative health data to construct a cohort of patients with COPD and a matched comparison cohort of subjects without COPD. We followed each patient from the time of first COPD-related health-care event (or equivalent time for the comparison cohort). Direct medical costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars [$]) were calculated based on billing records pertaining to hospital admissions, outpatient services use, medication dispensations, and community care services. We determined the excess medical costs of COPD by calculating the difference in overall medical costs between the COPD and the comparison cohorts. RESULTS: The COPD and comparison cohorts comprised 153,570 and 246,801 people, respectively (for both cohorts, mean age at entry was 66.9 years; 47.2% female patients). The excess costs of COPD during the study period were $5,452 per patient-year. Inpatient, outpatient, medication, and community care costs were responsible for 57%, 16%, 22%, and 5% of the excess costs, respectively. Excess costs increased by $296/person-y (P < .01), with hospital costs demonstrating the largest increase over time ($258/person-y; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The direct economic burden of COPD is high and has increased significantly between 2001 and 2010 over and above the increase in the health-care costs of the general population. Further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying reasons for the temporal increase in COPD direct costs.",2015,10.1378/chest.15-0721,148,3,640-646,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Time Factors and Cohort Studies and Health Care Costs/*trends and British Columbia/epidemiology and Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*economics/epidemiology",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA
Meyer_2015_Ches,JOUR,Management of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in the Elderly Patient: Addressing Key Questions,"Meyer, Keith C. and Danoff, Sonye K. and Lancaster, Lisa H. and Nathan, Steven D.",Chest,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is strongly associated with advanced age. Making an accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical, as it remains only one of many potential diagnoses for an elderly patient with newly recognized interstitial lung disease. Optimal management of IPF, especially in older-aged patients, hinges on such factors as balancing the application of standard-of-care measures with the patient's overall health status (robustness vs frailty) and considering the patient's wishes, desires, and expectations. IPF is known to be associated with certain comorbidities that tend to be more prevalent in the elderly population. Until recently, options for the pharmacologic management of IPF were limited and included therapies such as immunosuppressive agents, which may pose substantial risk to the elderly patient. However, the antifibrotic agents pirfenidone and nintedanib have now become commercially available in the United States for the treatment of IPF. The monitoring and treatment of patients with IPF, especially elderly patients with comorbid medical conditions, require consideration of adverse side effects, the avoidance of potential drug-drug interactions, treatment of comorbidities, and the timely implementation of supportive and palliative measures. Individualized counseling to guide decision-making and enhance quality of life is also integral to optimal management of the elderly patient with IPF.",2015,10.1378/chest.14-2475,148,1,242-252,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,Humans and Patient-Centered Care and Aged and Prognosis and Age Factors and Precision Medicine and Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use and *Disease Management and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/complications/*diagnosis/*therapy and Indoles/therapeutic use and Pyridones/therapeutic use,NA,NA,2015/07//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 associated with differential response to corticosteroid therapy? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital treated between January and February 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was the administration of IV corticosteroids. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Marginal structural modeling was used to account for baseline and time-dependent confounders. An unsupervised machine learning approach was carried out to identify phenotypes of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included; 280 of 428 patients (65.4%) received corticosteroid therapy. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid therapy than in those who did not (53.9% vs 19.6%; P < .0001). After marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not associated significantly with 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.54-1.18; P = .26). Our analysis identified two phenotypes of COVID-19, and compared with the hypoinflammatory phenotype, the hyperinflammatory phenotype was characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher rates of complications. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.80; P = .0062) in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype.

Christine and Diaz-Mendoza, Javier and Musani, Ali and Murgu, Septimiu",Chest,"BACKGROUND: The role of tracheostomy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains unknown. The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing in patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCWs, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment.

Practice guidelines attempt to balance the benefit of early detection of lung cancer with the risks of diagnostic testing, but adherence to guidelines is low. The goal of this study was to determine guideline adherence rates in the setting of a multidisciplinary nodule clinic and describe reasons for nonadherence as well as associated outcomes. METHODS: This cohort study included 3 years of follow-up of patients aged <e2><89><a5> 35 years with an incidentally detected lung nodule evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic that used the 2005 Fleischner Society Guidelines. RESULTS: Among 113 patients, 67% (95% CI, 58-76) were recommended a guideline-concordant nodule evaluation; 7.1% (95% CI, 3.1-13) and 26% (95% CI, 18-25) were recommended less or more intense evaluation, respectively. In contrast, 58% (95% CI, 48-67), 22% (95% CI, 18-25), and 23% (95% CI, 16-32) received a guideline-concordant, less intense, or more intense evaluation. The most common reason for recommending guideline-discordant care was concern for two different diagnoses that would each benefit from early detection and treatment. A majority of lung cancer diagnoses (88%) occurred in patients who received guideline-concordant care. There were no lung cancer cases in those who received less intense nodule care.

Chen_2008_Ches,JOUR,Effect of decisions to withhold life support on prolonged survival,"Chen, Yen-Yuan and Connors, Alfred F. Jr and Garland, Allan",Chest,"BACKGROUND: The effect on long-term mortality of decisions made to withhold life-supporting therapies (LST) for critically ill patients is unclear. We hypothesized that mortality 60 days after ICU admission is not influenced by a decision to withhold use of LST in the context of otherwise providing all indicated care. METHODS: We studied 2,211 consecutive, initial admissions to the adult, medical ICU of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. To achieve balanced groups for comparing outcomes, we created a multivariable regression model for the probability (propensity score [PS]) of having an order initiated in the ICU to withhold LST. Each of the 201 patients with such an order was matched to the patient without such an order having the closest PS; mortality rates were compared between the matched pairs. Cox survival analysis was performed to extend the main analysis. RESULTS: The matched pairs were well balanced with respect to all of the potentially confounding variables. Sixty days after ICU admission, 50.5% of patients who had an order initiated in the ICU to withhold life support had died, compared to 25.8% of those lacking such orders (risk ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.6). Survival analysis indicated that the difference in mortality between the two groups continued to increase for approximately 1 year. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, decisions made in the ICU to withhold LST were associated with increased mortality rate to at least 60 days after ICU admission.",2008,10.1378/chest.07-1500,133,6,1312-1318,eng,0012-3692,Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data and APACHE and *Decision Making and *Survival Analysis and Glasgow Coma Scale and Resuscitation Orders and Withholding Treatment/*statistics & numerical data and *Life Support Care and Critical Illness/classification/*mortality,NA,NA,2008/06//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study was designed to further examine the association between IMOP and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Prospective observational study of three different cohorts of acutely ill patients admitted to hospitals in Esbjerg, Denmark (998 patients), Basel, Switzerland (743 patients), and Kitovu, Uganda (1,622 patients). RESULTS: There were significant differences in age, sex, length of stay, proportion of medical and surgical patients, and in-hospital mortality between the three cohorts. Yet in all three cohorts a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) <e2><89><a5> 3 when first recorded and IMOP increased the risk of in-hospital mortality to approximately the same extent. IMOP and NEWS <e2><89><a5> 3 when first recorded were, therefore, used for risk categorization: patients with a NEWS < 3 when first recorded and normal mobility on presentation had the lowest in-hospital mortality risk and those with NEWS <e2><89><a5> 3 when first recorded and IMOP had the highest risk. The number of these low risk patients ranged from 26% in Kitovu to 42% in Esbjerg, and their in-hospital mortality rates did not significantly differ in all three cohorts, ranging from 0.2% in Esbjerg to 0.4% in Basel. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective multicenter study IMOP enhanced the risk categorization of acutely ill patients from very different clinical settings. The combination normal mobility on presentation and first recorded NEWS identified a substantial proportion of patients in all cohorts with a low risk of dying while in hospital.

Primary care clinicians care for the vast majority of these patients, but their experiences with communication and managing distress in this population are not well understood. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews of 15 primary care providers (PCPs) at two academic medical centers who care for patients with pulmonary nodules. We used qualitative description analysis, focusing on clinicians' information exchange and other communication behaviors. RESULTS: Most PCPs believed they had inadequate information to counsel patients regarding lung nodules, although this information is desired. PCPs were concerned patients could ""fall through the cracks"" but did not have access to a reliable system to ensure follow-up adherence. They were limited by time, knowledge, and resources in providing the preferred level of care. Most PCPs did not discuss the specific risk a nodule was lung cancer, in part because they did not have ready access to this information. PCPs believed most patients did not have substantial distress as a result of nodule detection. Most PCPs did not include patients when making decisions about the follow-up plan. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs often lack systemic resources to optimize patient-centered approaches when discussing incidental pulmonary nodules with patients. With the advent of lung cancer screening, pulmonologists can assist primary care colleagues by providing accurate information to counsel patients and assisting in managing conversations about the risk of cancer.

H.",Chest,"BACKGROUND: When oral anticoagulation with adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is used, the quality of anticoagulation control (as reflected by the time in therapeutic range [TTR] of the international normalized ratio [INR]) is an important determinant of thromboembolism and bleeding. Our objective was to derive a validated scheme using patient-related clinical parameters to assess the likelihood of poor INR control among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on VKA therapy. METHODS: The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial population was randomly divided into derivation and internal validation cohorts using a 1:1 ratio. We used linear regression analysis to detect the clinical factors associated with TTR and binary logistic regression to evaluate the predictive performance of a model incorporating these factors for different cutoff values of TTR. The derived model was validated externally in a cohort of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy who were recruited prospectively. RESULTS: In the linear regression model, nine variables emerged as independent predictors of TTR: female sex (P < .0001), age < 50 years (P < .0001), age 50 to 60 years (P = .02), ethnic minority status (P < .0001), smoking (P = .03), more than two comorbidities (P < .0001), and being treated with a <ce><b2>-blocker (P = .02), verapamil (P = .02), or, inversely, with amiodarone (P = .05). We incorporated these factors into a simple clinical prediction scheme with the acronym SAMe-TT<e2><82><82>R (sex female, age < 60 years, medical history [more than two comorbidities], treatment [interacting drugs, eg, amiodarone for rhythm control], tobacco use [doubled], race [doubled]).

CONCLUSIONS: Common clinical and demographic factors can influence the quality of oral anticoagulation. We incorporated these factors into a simple score (SAMe-TT<e2><82><82>R<e2><82><82>) that can predict poor INR control and aid decision-making by identifying those patients with AF who would do well on VKA (SAMe-TT<e2><82><82>R<e2><82><82> score = 0-1), or conversely, those who require additional interventions to achieve acceptable anticoagulation control (SAMe-TT<e2><82><82>R<e2><82><82> score <e2><89><a5> 2).",2013,10.1378/chest.13-0054,144,5,1555-1563,eng,1931-3543 0012-3692,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Treatment Outcome and Follow-Up Studies and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Administration, Oral and Electrocardiography and *Quality Indicators, Health Care and Anticoagulants/administration & dosage and Atrial Fibrillation/*complications/physiopathology and Blood Coagulation/drug effects and Stroke/blood/etiology/*prevention & control and Warfarin/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,2013/11//undefined,Chest,NA,NA,NA,NA
