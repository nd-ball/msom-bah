Regional air quality in Southeast Asia has been seasonally affected by the transboundary haze problem, which has often been the result of forest fires from ""slash-and-burn"" farming methods. In light of growing public health concerns, recent studies have begun to examine the health effects of this seasonal haze problem in Southeast Asia. This review paper aims to synthesize current research efforts on the impact of the Southeast Asian transboundary haze on acute aspects of public health. Existing studies conducted in countries affected by transboundary haze indicate consistent links between haze exposure and acute psychological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological morbidity and mortality. Future prospective and longitudinal studies are warranted to quantify the long-term health effects of recurrent, but intermittent, exposure to high levels of seasonal haze. The mechanism, toxicology and pathophysiology by which these toxic particles contribute to disease and mortality should be further investigated. Epidemiological studies on the disease burden and socioeconomic cost of haze exposure would also be useful to guide policy-making and international strategy in minimizing the impact of seasonal haze in Southeast Asia.",2019,10.3390/ijerph16183286,16,18,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and data analytics and Big Data and Big data and public health and healthcare and Cardiovascular Diseases and *Public Health and Air Pollution/*adverse effects and air pollution and *Acute Disease and Air Pollutants/analysis and Asia, Southeastern and environmental epidemiology and fire and haze and Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology and transboundary",NA,NA,2019/09/06/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hulsen_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Sharing Is Caring-Data Sharing Initiatives in Healthcare,"Hulsen, Tim",International journal of environmental research and public health,"In recent years, more and more health data are being generated. These data come not only from professional health systems, but also from wearable devices. All these 'big data' put together can be utilized to optimize treatments for each unique patient ('precision medicine'). For this to be possible, it is necessary that hospitals, academia and industry work together to bridge the 'valley of death' of translational medicine. However, hospitals and academia often are reluctant to share their data with other parties, even though the patient is actually the owner of his/her own health data. Academic hospitals usually invest a lot of time in setting up clinical trials and collecting data, and want to be the first ones to publish papers on this data. There are some publicly available datasets, but these are usually only shared after study (and publication) completion, which means a severe delay of months or even years before others can analyse the data. One solution is to incentivize the hospitals to share their data with (other) academic institutes and the industry. Here, we show an analysis of the current literature around data sharing, and we discuss five aspects of data sharing in the medical domain: publisher requirements, data ownership, growing support for data sharing, data sharing initiatives and how the use of federated data might be a solution. We also discuss some potential future developments around data sharing, such as medical crowdsourcing and data generalists.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17093046,17,9,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,data sharing and data science and Hospitals and Humans and Female and Male and big data and Ownership and healthcare and Publishing and *Information Dissemination and *Delivery of Health Care and data management,NA,NA,2020/04/27/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Faust_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,A Smart Service Platform for Cost Efficient Cardiac Health Monitoring,"Faust, Oliver and Lei, Ningrong and Chew, Eng and Ciaccio, Edward J. and Acharya, U. Rajendra",International journal of environmental research and public health,"AIM: In this study we have investigated the problem of cost effective wireless heart health monitoring from a service design perspective. SUBJECT AND METHODS: There is a great medical and economic need to support the diagnosis of a wide range of debilitating and indeed fatal non-communicable diseases, like Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), Atrial Fibrillation (AF), diabetes, and sleep disorders. To address this need, we put forward the idea that the combination of Heart Rate (HR) measurements, Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), forms a Heart Health Monitoring Service Platform (HHMSP). This service platform can be used for multi-disease monitoring, where a distinct service meets the needs of patients having a specific disease. The service functionality is realized by combining common and distinct modules. This forms the technological basis which facilitates a hybrid diagnosis process where machines and practitioners work cooperatively to improve outcomes for patients. RESULTS: Human checks and balances on independent machine decisions maintain safety and reliability of the diagnosis. Cost efficiency comes from efficient signal processing and replacing manual analysis with AI based machine classification. To show the practicality of the proposed service platform, we have implemented an AF monitoring service. CONCLUSION: Having common modules allows us to harvest the economies of scale. That is an advantage, because the fixed cost for the infrastructure is shared among a large group of customers. Distinct modules define which AI models are used and how the communication with practitioners, caregivers and patients is handled. That makes the proposed HHMSP agile enough to address safety, reliability and functionality needs from healthcare providers.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17176313,17,17,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"deep learning and Humans and Information Systems and Reproducibility of Results and heart rate and e-health and Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted and *Artificial Intelligence and *Heart Rate and *Computer Communication Networks and *Atrial Fibrillation/complications/diagnosis/economics/physiopathology and *Monitoring, Ambulatory/economics/methods and Efficiency, Organizational/economics and internet of things and Monitoring, Physiologic/*economics/methods and service platform",NA,NA,2020/08/30/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. RESULTS: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.",2017,10.1186/s12889-017-4914-3,17,1,907,eng,1471-2458,Machine learning and Exposure and Epidemiology and Humans and Data mining and Big data and Air pollution and Machine Learning/*statistics & numerical data and Data Mining/methods/*statistics & numerical data and *Air Pollution and *Epidemiologic Studies and Association mining,NA,NA,2017/11/28/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

E. and Shaban, Ibrahim Abdelfadeel and Chan, Felix T. S. and Abdel-Aal, Mohammad A. M.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely affected many countries in the world. The unexpected large number of COVID-19 cases has disrupted the healthcare system in many countries and resulted in a shortage of bed spaces in the hospitals. Consequently, predicting the number of COVID-19 cases is imperative for governments to take appropriate actions. The number of COVID-19 cases can be accurately predicted by considering historical data of reported cases alongside some external factors that affect the spread of the virus. In the literature, most of the existing prediction methods focus only on the historical data and overlook most of the external factors. Hence, the number of COVID-19 cases is inaccurately predicted. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to simultaneously consider historical data and the external factors. This can be accomplished by adopting data analytics, which include developing a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous input (NARX) neural network-based algorithm. The viability and superiority of the developed algorithm are demonstrated by conducting experiments using data collected for top five affected countries in each continent. The results show an improved accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the experiments are extended to make future prediction for the number of patients afflicted with COVID-19 during the period from August 2020 until September 2020.

It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19's cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic.

First, we gathered Twitter threads quoting BD and alcohol-related behaviours, by considering unequivocal keywords, identified by experts, from previous evidence on BD. Subsequently, a random sample of the gathered tweets was manually labelled, and two supervised learning classifiers were trained on both linguistic and metadata features, to classify tweets of genuine unique users with respect to media, bot, and commercial accounts. Based on this classification, we observed that approximately 55% of the 1 million alcohol-related collected tweets was automatically identified as belonging to non-genuine users. A third classifier was then trained on a subset of manually labelled tweets among those previously identified as belonging to genuine accounts, to automatically identify potential binge drinkers based only on linguistic features.

New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation). The performance of the various combinations was measured in terms of precision, sensitivity, F-value and the ROC curve. Results: The best-trained algorithms are generally effective, proving themselves to be more robust when approximating the two binary variables ""avoiding the need of a face-to-face visit"" and ""increased demand"" (precision = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively) rather than the variable ""type of query"" (precision = 0.48).

We aimed to address two unknowns about risk adjustment: whether machine learning (ML) and inclusion of social determinants of health (SDH) indicators improve prospective risk adjustment for health plan payments. METHODS: We employed a 2-by-2 factorial design comparing: (i) linear regression versus ML (gradient boosting) and (ii) demographics and diagnostic codes alone, versus additional ZIP code-level SDH indicators. Healthcare claims from privately-insured US adults (2016-2017), and Census data were used for analysis. Data from 1.02 million adults were used for derivation, and data from 0.26 million to assess performance. Model performance was measured using coefficient of determination (R(2)), discrimination (C-statistic), and mean absolute error (MAE) for the overall population, and predictive ratio and net compensation for vulnerable subgroups. We provide 95% confidence intervals (CI) around each performance measure. RESULTS: Linear regression without SDH indicators achieved moderate determination (R(2) 0.327, 95% CI: 0.300, 0.353), error ($6992; 95% CI: $6889, $7094), and discrimination (C-statistic 0.703; 95% CI: 0.701, 0.705).

Gao_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Medical Named Entity Extraction from Chinese Resident Admit Notes Using Character and Word Attention-Enhanced Neural Network,"Gao, Yan and Wang, Yandong and Wang, Patrick and Gu, Lei",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The resident admit notes (RANs) in electronic medical records (EMRs) is first-hand information to study the patient's condition. Medical entity extraction of RANs is an important task to get disease information for medical decision-making. For Chinese electronic medical records, each medical entity contains not only word information but also rich character information. Effective combination of words and characters is very important for medical entity extraction. We propose a medical entity recognition model based on a character and word attention-enhanced (CWAE) neural network for Chinese RANs. In our model, word embeddings and character-based embeddings are obtained through character-enhanced word embedding (CWE) model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Then attention mechanism combines the character-based embeddings and word embeddings together, which significantly improves the expression ability of words. The new word embeddings obtained by the attention mechanism are taken as the input to bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) and conditional random field (CRF) to extract entities. We extracted nine types of key medical entities from Chinese RANs and evaluated our model. The proposed method was compared with two traditional machine learning methods CRF, support vector machine (SVM), and the related deep learning models. The result shows that our model has better performance, and the result of our model reaches 94.44% in the F1-score.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17051614,17,5,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"China and Humans and Machine Learning and neural network and named entity recognition and *Electronic Health Records and *Neural Networks, Computer and *Data Mining/methods and attention mechanism and Chinese electronic medical record and resident admit notes",NA,NA,2020/03/02/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

C. and Nichols, Gordon and Iacono, Gianni Lo and Sarran, Christophe and Hajat, Shakoor and Fleming, Lora E.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Many infectious diseases of public health importance display annual seasonal patterns in their incidence. We aimed to systematically document the seasonality of several human infectious disease pathogens in England and Wales, highlighting those organisms that appear weather-sensitive and therefore may be influenced by climate change in the future. METHODS: Data on infections in England and Wales from 1989 to 2014 were extracted from the Public Health England (PHE) SGSS surveillance database. We conducted a weekly, monthly and quarterly time series analysis of 277 pathogen serotypes. Each organism's time series was forecasted using the TBATS package in R, with seasonality detected using model fit statistics. Meteorological data hosted on the MEDMI Platform were extracted at a monthly resolution for 2001-2011. The organisms were then clustered by K-means into two groups based on cross correlation coefficients with the weather variables. RESULTS: Examination of 12.9 million infection episodes found seasonal components in 91/277 (33%) organism serotypes. Salmonella showed seasonal and non-seasonal serotypes. These results were visualised in an online Rshiny application. Seasonal organisms were then clustered into two groups based on their correlations with weather. Group 1 had positive correlations with temperature (max, mean and min), sunshine and vapour pressure and inverse correlations with mean wind speed, relative humidity, ground frost and air frost. Group 2 had the opposite but also slight positive correlations with rainfall (mm, > 1 mm, > 10 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of seasonality in pathogen time series data and the identification of relevant weather predictors can improve forecasting and public health planning.

Lake_2019_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Machine learning to refine decision making within a syndromic surveillance service,"Lake, I. R. and Colon-Gonzalez, F. J. and Barker, G. C. and Morbey, R. A. and Smith, G. E. and Elliot, A. J.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, syndromic surveillance is increasingly used for improved and timely situational awareness and early identification of public health threats. Syndromic data streams are fed into detection algorithms, which produce statistical alarms highlighting potential activity of public health importance. All alarms must be assessed to confirm whether they are of public health importance. In England, approximately 100 alarms are generated daily and, although their analysis is formalised through a risk assessment process, the process requires notable time, training, and maintenance of an expertise base to determine which alarms are of public health importance. The process is made more complicated by the observation that only 0.1% of statistical alarms are deemed to be of public health importance. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate machine learning as a tool for computer-assisted human decision-making when assessing statistical alarms. METHODS: A record of the risk assessment process was obtained from Public Health England for all 67,505 statistical alarms between August 2013 and October 2015. This record contained information on the characteristics of the alarm (e.g. size, location). We used three Bayesian classifiers- naive Bayes, tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets - to examine the risk assessment record in England with respect to the final 'Decision' outcome made by an epidemiologist of 'Alert', 'Monitor' or 'No-action'. Two further classifications based upon tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets were implemented to account for the predominance of 'No-action' outcomes. RESULTS: The attributes of each individual risk assessment were linked to the final decision made by an epidemiologist, providing confidence in the current process. The naive Bayesian classifier performed best, correctly classifying 51.5% of 'Alert' outcomes. If the 'Alert' and 'Monitor' actions are combined then performance increases to 82.6% correctly classified. We demonstrate how a decision support system based upon a naive Bayes classifier could be operationalised within an operational syndromic surveillance system. CONCLUSIONS: Within syndromic surveillance systems, machine learning techniques have the potential to make risk assessment following statistical alarms more automated, robust, and rigorous. However, our results also highlight the importance of specialist human input to the process.",2019,10.1186/s12889-019-6916-9,19,1,559,eng,1471-2458,Machine learning and Artificial intelligence and Decision making and Public health and England and Humans and Algorithms and Bayes Theorem and *Decision Making and *Machine Learning and Public Health/*methods and Risk Assessment/*methods and *Sentinel Surveillance and Bayes' theorem and Syndromic surveillance,NA,NA,2019/05/14/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

These tasks are important challenges in healthcare. Analyzing user messages in social media networks such as Twitter can provide opportunities to detect and manage public health events. Twitter provides a broad range of short messages that contain interesting information for information extraction. In this paper, we present a Health-Related Named Entity Recognition (HNER) task using healthcare-domain ontology that can recognize health-related entities from large numbers of user messages from Twitter. For this task, we employ a deep learning architecture which is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with little feature engineering. To achieve our goal, we collected a large number of Twitter messages containing health-related information, and detected biomedical entities from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). A bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model learned rich context information, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to produce character-level features. The conditional random field (CRF) model predicted a sequence of labels that corresponded to a sequence of inputs, and the Viterbi algorithm was used to detect health-related entities from Twitter messages. We provide comprehensive results giving valuable insights for identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications.

Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. ""Digital"" savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected.

Shaham_2020_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Personal and social patterns predict influenza vaccination decision,"Shaham, Adir and Chodick, Gabriel and Shalev, Varda and Yamin, Dan",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage remains suboptimal in most developed countries, despite longstanding recommendations of public health organizations. The individual's decision regarding vaccination is located at the core of non-adherence. We analyzed large-scale data to identify personal and social behavioral patterns for influenza vaccination uptake, and develop a model to predict vaccination decision of individuals in an upcoming influenza season. METHODS: We analyzed primary data from the electronic medical records of a retrospective cohort of 250,000 individuals between the years 2007 and 2017, collected from 137 clinics. Individuals were randomly sampled from the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services. Maccabi's clients are representative of the Israeli population, reflect all demographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and levels. We used several machine-learning models to predict whether a patient would get vaccinated in the future. Models' performance was evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: The vaccination decision of an individual can be explained in two dimensions, Personal and social. The personal dimension is strongly shaped by a ""default"" behavior, such as vaccination timing in previous seasons and general health consumption, but can also be affected by temporal factors such as respiratory illness in the prior year. In the social dimension, a patient is more likely to become vaccinated in a given season if at least one member of his family also became vaccinated in the same season. Vaccination uptake was highly assertive with age, socioeconomic score, and geographic location. An XGBoost-based predictive model achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.91 with accuracy and recall rates of 90% on the test set. Prediction relied mainly on the patient's individual and household vaccination status in the past, age, number of encounters with the healthcare system, number of prescribed medications, and indicators of chronic illnesses.

Kim_2018_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Wave2Vec: Vectorizing Electroencephalography Bio-Signal for Prediction of Brain Disease,"Kim, Seonho and Kim, Jungjoon and Chun, Hong-Woo",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Interest in research involving health-medical information analysis based on artificial intelligence, especially for deep learning techniques, has recently been increasing. Most of the research in this field has been focused on searching for new knowledge for predicting and diagnosing disease by revealing the relation between disease and various information features of data. These features are extracted by analyzing various clinical pathology data, such as EHR (electronic health records), and academic literature using the techniques of data analysis, natural language processing, etc. However, still needed are more research and interest in applying the latest advanced artificial intelligence-based data analysis technique to bio-signal data, which are continuous physiological records, such as EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Unlike the other types of data, applying deep learning to bio-signal data, which is in the form of time series of real numbers, has many issues that need to be resolved in preprocessing, learning, and analysis. Such issues include leaving feature selection, learning parts that are black boxes, difficulties in recognizing and identifying effective features, high computational complexities, etc. In this paper, to solve these issues, we provide an encoding-based Wave2vec time series classifier model, which combines signal-processing and deep learning-based natural language processing techniques. To demonstrate its advantages, we provide the results of three experiments conducted with EEG data of the University of California Irvine, which are a real-world benchmark bio-signal dataset. After converting the bio-signals (in the form of waves), which are a real number time series, into a sequence of symbols or a sequence of wavelet patterns that are converted into symbols, through encoding, the proposed model vectorizes the symbols by learning the sequence using deep learning-based natural language processing. The models of each class can be constructed through learning from the vectorized wavelet patterns and training data. The implemented models can be used for prediction and diagnosis of diseases by classifying the new data. The proposed method enhanced data readability and intuition of feature selection and learning processes by converting the time series of real number data into sequences of symbols. In addition, it facilitates intuitive and easy recognition, and identification of influential patterns. Furthermore, real-time large-capacity data analysis is facilitated, which is essential in the development of real-time analysis diagnosis systems, by drastically reducing the complexity of calculation without deterioration of analysis performance by data simplification through the encoding process.",2018,10.3390/ijerph15081750,15,8,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"deep learning and Humans and Algorithms and electroencephalography (EEG) and Artificial Intelligence and dementia and sequence classification and *Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted and *Electroencephalography and alcoholism and bio-signal and Brain Diseases/*diagnosis and prediction of brain disease and Wave2vec",NA,NA,2018/08/15/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural experiment studies can advance our understanding of causal effects and processes related to urban form interventions. The INTErventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team (INTERACT) is a pan-Canadian collaboration of interdisciplinary scientists, urban planners, and public health decision makers advancing research on the design of healthy and sustainable cities for all. Our objectives are to use natural experiment studies to deliver timely evidence about how urban form interventions influence health, and to develop methods and tools to facilitate such studies going forward. METHODS: INTERACT will evaluate natural experiments in four Canadian cities: the Arbutus Greenway in Vancouver, British Columbia; the All Ages and Abilities Cycling Network in Victoria, BC; a new Bus Rapid Transit system in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; and components of the Sustainable Development Plan 2016-2020 in Montreal, Quebec, a plan that includes urban form changes initiated by the city and approximately 230 partnering organizations. We will recruit a cohort of between 300 and 3000 adult participants, age 18 or older, in each city and collect data at three time points. Participants will complete health and activity space surveys and provide sensor-based location and physical activity data. We will conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants in each city. Our analysis methods will combine machine learning methods for detecting transportation mode use and physical activity, use temporal Geographic Information Systems to quantify changes to urban intervention exposure, and apply analytic methods for natural experiment studies including interrupted time series analysis.

Healthcare portals have revolutionalized access to health information and knowledge using the Internet and related technologies, but their usage is far from satisfactory in India. This article describes a health portal developed in India aimed at providing one-stop access to efficiently search, organize and share maternal child health information relevant from public health perspective in the country. METHODS: The portal 'Repository on Maternal Child Health' was developed using an open source content management system and standardized processes were followed for collection, selection, categorization and presentation of resource materials. Its usage is evaluated using key performance indicators obtained from Google Analytics, and quality assessed using a standardized checklist of knowledge management. The results are discussed in relation to improving quality and access to health information. RESULTS: The portal was launched in July 2010 and provides free access to full-text of 900 resource materials categorized under specific topics and themes. During the subsequent 18 months, 52,798 visits were registered from 174 countries across the world, and more than three-fourth visits were from India alone. Nearly 44,000 unique visitors visited the website and spent an average time of 4 minutes 26 seconds. The overall bounce rate was 27.6%. An increase in the number of unique visitors was found to be significantly associated with an increase in the average time on site (p-value 0.01), increase in the web traffic through search engines (p-value 0.00), and decrease in the bounce rate (p-value 0.03). There was a high degree of agreement between the two experts regarding quality assessment carried out under the three domains of knowledge access, knowledge creation and knowledge transfer (Kappa statistic 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Efficient management of health information is imperative for informed decision making, and digital repositories have now-a-days become the preferred source of information management.

L.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of retirees continue to work beyond retirement despite being eligible to retire. As the prevalence of chronic disease increases with age, working beyond retirement may go along with having a chronic disease. Working beyond retirement may be different for retirees with and without chronic disease. We aim to investigate whether demographic, socioeconomic and work characteristics, health and social factors predict working beyond retirement, in workers with and without a chronic disease. METHODS: Employees aged 56-64 years were selected from the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (N = 1125). Questionnaire data on demographic and work characteristics, health, social factors, and working beyond retirement were linked to registry data from Statistics Netherlands on socioeconomic characteristics. Separate prediction models were built for retirees with and without chronic disease using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Workers without chronic disease were more likely to work beyond retirement compared to workers with chronic disease (27% vs 23%). In retirees with chronic disease, work and health factors predicted working beyond retirement, while in retirees without a chronic disease, work, health and social factors predicted working beyond retirement. In the final model for workers with chronic disease, healthcare work, better physical health, higher body height, lower physical load and no permanent contract were positively predictive of working beyond retirement. In the final model for workers without chronic disease, feeling full of life and being intensively physically active for > = 2 days per week were positively predictive of working beyond retirement; while manual labor, better recovery, and a partner who did not support working until the statutory retirement age, were negatively predictive of working beyond retirement. CONCLUSIONS: Work and health factors independently predicted working beyond retirement in workers with and without chronic disease, whereas social factors only did so among workers without chronic disease. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics did not independently contribute to prediction of working beyond retirement in any group.

Yedla_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Predictive Modeling for Occupational Safety Outcomes and Days Away from Work Analysis in Mining Operations,"Yedla, Anurag and Kakhki, Fatemeh Davoudi and Jannesari, Ali",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Mining is known to be one of the most hazardous occupations in the world. Many serious accidents have occurred worldwide over the years in mining. Although there have been efforts to create a safer work environment for miners, the number of accidents occurring at the mining sites is still significant. Machine learning techniques and predictive analytics are becoming one of the leading resources to create safer work environments in the manufacturing and construction industries. These techniques are leveraged to generate actionable insights to improve decision-making. A large amount of mining safety-related data are available, and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the data. The use of machine learning techniques can significantly benefit the mining industry. Decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural networks were implemented to analyze the outcomes of mining accidents. These machine learning models were also used to predict days away from work. An accidents dataset provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was used to train the models. The models were trained separately on tabular data and narratives. The use of a synthetic data augmentation technique using word embedding was also investigated to tackle the data imbalance problem. Performance of all the models was compared with the performance of the traditional logistic regression model. The results show that models trained on narratives performed better than the models trained on structured/tabular data in predicting the outcome of the accident. The higher predictive power of the models trained on narratives led to the conclusion that the narratives have additional information relevant to the outcome of injury compared to the tabular entries. The models trained on tabular data had a lower mean squared error compared to the models trained on narratives while predicting the days away from work. The results highlight the importance of predictors, like shift start time, accident time, and mining experience in predicting the days away from work. It was found that the F1 score of all the underrepresented classes except one improved after the use of the data augmentation technique. This approach gave greater insight into the factors influencing the outcome of the accident and days away from work.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17197054,17,19,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"machine learning and Logistic Models and Machine Learning and neural networks and Data Mining and word embedding and Neural Networks, Computer and *Occupational Health",NA,NA,2020/09/27/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this paper is to describe the development of a state-based self-harm monitoring system in Victoria, Australia. In this system, data on all self-harm presentations are collected from eight hospital emergency departments in Victoria. A natural language processing classifier that uses machine learning to identify episodes of self-harm is currently being developed. This uses the free-text triage case notes, together with certain structured data fields, contained within the metadata of the incoming records. Post-processing is undertaken to identify primary mechanism of injury, substances consumed (including alcohol, illicit drugs and pharmaceutical preparations) and presence of psychiatric disorders. This system will ultimately leverage routinely collected data in combination with advanced artificial intelligence methods to support robust community-wide monitoring of self-harm.

Few population-based surveys have stated the cost-effectiveness related to this treatment. We, therefore, performed a nationwide retrospective study using National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) data from 2001-2012 in Taiwan. The incidence of PSVT-related admissions was computed from patients' first admission for a primary PSVT diagnosis. There were 21,086 patients hospitalized due to first-time PSVT, of whom 13,075 underwent RFCA, with 374 recurrences (2.86%). In contrast, 1751 (21.86%) of the remaining 8011 patients who did not receive RFCA, most of whom had financial concerns, experienced PSVT recurrence. The relative PSVT recurrence risk in those who did not receive RFCA was 7.6 times (95%CI: 6.67-8.33) that of those who did undergo RFCA. In conclusion, the PSVT recurrence rate was much higher in patients who did not receive RFCA at their first admission. Furthermore, RFCA proved cost-effective, with the ratio of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and gross domestic product (GDP) being only 1.15. To prevent readmission and avoid incremental cost, the authority could provide a financial supplement for every patient so that the procedure is performed, reducing the PSVT-recurrence life-years (disease-specific DALY).",2020,10.3390/ijerph17072334,17,7,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and big data analytics and Aged, 80 and over and cost-effectiveness and Taiwan and *Big Data and *Cost-Benefit Analysis and Catheter Ablation/*economics and DALY and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and Patient Readmission/*economics and radiofrequency catheter ablation and Tachycardia, Supraventricular/*surgery",NA,NA,2020/03/30/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hays_2015_BMCpubhea,JOUR,The care.data consensus? A qualitative analysis of opinions expressed on Twitter,"Hays, Rebecca and Daker-White, Gavin",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Large, integrated datasets can be used to improve the identification and management of health conditions. However, big data initiatives are controversial because of risks to privacy. In 2014, NHS England launched a public awareness campaign about the care.data project, whereby data from patients' medical records would be regularly uploaded to a central database. Details of the project sparked intense debate across a number of platforms, including social media sites such as Twitter. Twitter is increasingly being used to educate and inform patients and care providers, and as a source of data for health services research. The aim of the study was to identify and describe the range of opinions expressed about care.data on Twitter for the period during which a delay to this project was announced, and provide insight into the strengths and flaws of the project. METHODS: Tweets with the hashtag #caredata were collected using the NCapture tool for NVivo. Methods of qualitative data analysis were used to identify emerging themes. Tweets were coded and analysed in-depth within and across themes. RESULTS: The dataset consisted of 9895 tweets, captured over 18 days during February and March 2014. Retweets (6118, 62%) and spam (240, 2%) were excluded. The remaining 3537 tweets were posted by 904 contributors, and coded into one or more of 50 sub-themes, which were organised into 9 key themes. These were: informed consent and the default 'opt-in', trust, privacy and data security, involvement of private companies, legal issues and GPs' concerns, communication failure and confusion about care.data, delayed implementation, patient-centeredness, and potential of care.data and the ideal model of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Various concerns were raised about care.data that appeared to be shared by those both for and against the project. Qualitatively analysing tweets enabled us to identify a range of concerns about care.data and how these might be overcome, for example, by increasing the involvement of stakeholders and those with expert knowledge. Our findings also highlight the risks of not considering public opinion, such as the potential for patient safety failures resulting from a lack of trust in the healthcare system. However, caution is advised if using Twitter as a stand-alone data source, as contributors may lie more heavily on one side of a debate than another. A mixed-methods approach would have enabled us to complement this data with a more representative overview.",2015,10.1186/s12889-015-2180-9,15,NA,838,eng,1471-2458,England and Humans and Internet and Evaluation Studies as Topic and Consensus and Social Media and Public Opinion and Blogging/*statistics & numerical data and Information Dissemination/*methods and Consumer Health Information/*methods and *Datasets as Topic/ethics/statistics & numerical data and Health Promotion/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2015/09/02/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, a group of automated actors known as social bots have been found to coexist with human users in discussions regarding the coronavirus crisis, which may pose threats to public health. To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity-positive or negative-for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans' emotions, rather than to trigger humans' amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission.

Thanks to the Internet, today, we have a huge amount of health data and fire occurrence reports at our disposal. The challenge, therefore, is how to deal with 4 Vs (volume, variety, velocity and veracity) associated with these data. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a method that combines techniques based on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) to discover spatial and temporal association between diseases and the fire occurrences. Here, the case study was addressed to Malaria, Leishmaniasis and respiratory diseases in Brazil. Instead of losing a lot of time verifying the consistency of the database, the proposed method uses Decision Tree, a machine learning-based supervised classification, to perform a fast management and extract only relevant and strategic information, with the knowledge of how reliable the database is. Namely, States, Biomes and period of the year (months) with the highest rate of fires could be identified with great success rates and in few seconds. Then, the K-means, an unsupervised learning algorithms that solves the well-known clustering problem, is employed to identify the groups of cities where the fire occurrences is more expressive. Finally, the steps associated with KDD is perfomed to extract useful information from mined data. In that case, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, a nonparametric measure of rank correlation, is computed to infer the statistical dependence between fire occurrences and those diseases. Moreover, maps are also generated to represent the distribution of the mined data. From the results, it was possible to identify that each region showed a susceptible behaviour to some disease as well as some degree of correlation with fire outbreak, mainly in the drought period.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17103718,17,10,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,machine learning and Humans and big data and Data Mining and health and Knowledge Discovery and Brazil/epidemiology and *Data Mining and fire and *Fires and *Leishmaniasis/epidemiology and *Malaria/epidemiology and *Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology and Knowledge Discovery from Databases,NA,NA,2020/05/25/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article describes the development, promotion and initial evaluation of a national website to increase access to information and resources about prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) among healthcare workers and PMTCT stakeholders in Tanzania. METHODS: A participatory approach, involving the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) and key PMTCT stakeholders, was used to develop and manage the online PMTCT National Resource Center (NRC), http://pmtct.or.tz/ . The website was created with a content management system software system that does not require advanced computer skills and facilitates content updates and site management. The PMTCT NRC hosts related regularly updated PMTCT-related news, resources and publications. Website implementation, access and performance were evaluated over two years using Google Analytics data about visits, page views, downloads, bounce rates and location of visitors, supplemented by anecdotal feedback. RESULTS: Following its launch in July 2013, the PMTCT NRC website received a total of 28,400 visits, with 66,463 page views, over 2 years; 30 % of visits were from returning visitors. During year 1, visits increased by 80 % from the first to second 6 month period and then declined slightly (9-11 %) but remained stable in Year 2. Monthly visits spiked by about 70 % during October 2013 and January 2014 in response to the release and promotion of revised national PMTCT guidelines and training manuals. The majority of visitors came from primarily urban areas in Tanzania (50 %) and from other African countries (16 %). By year 2, over one-third of visitors used mobile devices to access the site. CONCLUSIONS: The successfully implemented PMTCT NRC website provides centralized, easily accessed information designed to address the needs of clinicians, educators and program partners in Tanzania.

However, dementia still has no fundamental cure. Therefore, it is important to predict and prevent dementia early. For early prediction of dementia, it is crucial to find dementia risk factors that increase a person's risk of developing dementia. In this paper, the subject of dementia risk factor analysis and discovery studies were limited to gender, because it is assumed that the difference in the prevalence of dementia in men and women will lead to differences in the risk factors for dementia among men and women. This study analyzed the Korean National Health Information System-Senior Cohort using machine-learning techniques. By using the machine-learning technique, it was possible to reveal a very small causal relationship between data that are ignored using existing statistical techniques. By using the senior cohort, it was possible to analyze 6000 data that matched the experimental conditions out of 558,147 sample subjects over 14 years. In order to analyze the difference in dementia risk factors between men and women, three machine-learning-based dementia risk factor analysis models were constructed and compared. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the risk factors for dementia in men and women are different.

Studying the effects of environmental exposures on fetal growth is essential for understanding the causal pathway between prenatal exposures and pregnancy outcomes. Here we describe the Haifa Pregnancy Cohort Study (HPCS) and discuss challenges and opportunities in applying ""big data"" paradigm. METHODS: Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), is the second largest Israeli health maintenance organization (HMO) providing care services to two million beneficiaries. The HPCS cohort potentially includes ~750,000 newborns born between 1998 and 2017. We will estimate daily exposures to air pollutants, temperature and greenness, using satellite-based data and models. We hypothesize that residents of Haifa have higher exposures to environmental pollutants and that in pregnant women this higher exposure is associated with poorer fetal growth. We will evaluate outcomes such as birth-weight, head-circumference and gestational age at birth. We will adjust for pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes and parental variables, such as maternal weight, age and smoking habits as potential confounders. In addition, we will conduct a multi-tiered field study, nested within this population, among 150 pregnant women residing in two geographical regions-one in the polluted Haifa area, and one in a relatively unpolluted area in central Israel. Blood and urinary samples will be collected, as well as personal and indoor exposure to air pollution. DISCUSSION: Evaluating environmental exposures of pregnant women and assessing in utero growth over the course of the pregnancy during different exposure windows, is of great scientific and public health interest. Recent advances in data collection and analysis pose great promise to provide insights into contribution of environment to the health of the developing fetus, but also pose major challenges and pitfalls, such as data management, proper statistical framework and integration of data in the population-based study and selectiveness in the nested field study. Yet the continuing follow-up of the study cohort, integrating data from different services, health-promotion, and eventually, application later in real life of our main promises.

We examined the associations between select neighborhood built environment indicators (crosswalks, non-single family home buildings, single-lane roads, and visible wires), and health outcomes, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, at the state level. We utilized 31,247,167 images collected from Google Street View to create indicators for neighborhood built environment characteristics using deep learning techniques. Adjusted linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between aggregated built environment indicators and state-level health outcomes. Our results indicated that the presence of a crosswalk was associated with reductions in obesity and premature mortality. Visible wires were associated with increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and increases in premature mortality, diabetes mortality, and cardiovascular mortality (however, these results were not significant).

Specifically, the Office focuses on research in humans involving primary and secondary prevention, and prevention-related methods. Currently, the NIH uses the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization system to report agency funding in prevention research. However, this system defines prevention research broadly to include primary and secondary prevention, studies on prevention methods, and basic and preclinical studies for prevention. A new methodology was needed to quantify NIH funding in applied prevention research. METHODS: A novel machine learning approach was developed and evaluated for its ability to characterize NIH-funded applied prevention research during fiscal years 2012-2015. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy, and F1 score of the machine learning method; the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization system; and a combined approach were estimated. Analyses were completed during June-August 2017. RESULTS: Because the machine learning method was trained to recognize applied prevention research, it more accurately identified applied prevention grants (F1<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>72.7%) than the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization system (F1<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>54.4%) and a combined approach (F1<e2><80><af>=<e2><80><af>63.5%) with p<0.001.

Hu_2016_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Utilizing Chinese Admission Records for MACE Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome,"Hu, Danqing and Huang, Zhengxing and Chan, Tak-Ming and Dong, Wei and Lu, Xudong and Duan, Huilong",International journal of environmental research and public health,"BACKGROUND: Clinical major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) prediction of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is important for a number of applications including physician decision support, quality of care assessment, and efficient healthcare service delivery on ACS patients. Admission records, as typical media to contain clinical information of patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations, provide significant potential to be explored for MACE prediction in a proactive manner. METHODS: We propose a hybrid approach for MACE prediction by utilizing a large volume of admission records. Firstly, both a rule-based medical language processing method and a machine learning method (i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)) are developed to extract essential patient features from unstructured admission records. After that, state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms are applied to construct MACE prediction models from data. RESULTS: We comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 2930 ACS patient samples collected from a Chinese hospital. Our best model achieved 72% AUC in MACE prediction. In comparison of the performance between our models and two well-known ACS risk score tools, i.e., GRACE and TIMI, our learned models obtain better performances with a significant margin. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results reveal that our approach can obtain competitive performance in MACE prediction. The comparison of classifiers indicates the proposed approach has a competitive generality with datasets extracted by different feature extraction methods. Furthermore, our MACE prediction model obtained a significant improvement by comparison with both GRACE and TIMI. It indicates that using admission records can effectively provide MACE prediction service for ACS patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations.",2016,10.3390/ijerph13090912,13,9,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Risk Assessment and Aged and Prognosis and *Algorithms and hybrid model and Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data and *Health Status Indicators and acute coronary syndrome and Acute Coronary Syndrome/*epidemiology/*physiopathology and admission record and MACE prediction and risk factor identification,NA,NA,2016/09/13/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wicked problems refer to ill-structured and dynamic problems that combine multidimensional elements, which often preclude the conventional problem solving approach. This pilot study introduces visual analytics (VA) methods to multi-stakeholder decision-making sessions about child injury prevention; Methods: Inspired by the Delphi method, we introduced a novel methodology-group analytics (GA). GA was pilot-tested to evaluate the impact of collaborative visual analytics on facilitating problem solving and supporting decision-making. We conducted two GA sessions. Collected data included stakeholders' observations, audio and video recordings, questionnaires, and follow up interviews. The GA sessions were analyzed using the Joint Activity Theory protocol analysis methods; Results: The GA methodology triggered the emergence of 'common ground' among stakeholders. This common ground evolved throughout the sessions to enhance stakeholders' verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as coordination of joint activities and ultimately collaboration on problem solving and decision-making; Conclusions: Understanding complex health data is necessary for informed decisions.

In prior literature, little effort has been made to detect and resolve the uncertainty about whether the address provided by a physician in the survey is a practice address or a home address. This paper introduces how to identify the uncertainty in a physician's practice location through spatial analytics, text mining, and visual examination. While land use and zoning code, embedded within the parcel datasets, help to differentiate resident areas from other types, spatial analytics may have certain limitations in matching and comparing physician and parcel datasets with different uncertainty issues, which may lead to unforeseen results. Handling and matching the string components between physicians' addresses and the addresses of the parcels could identify the spatial uncertainty and instability to derive a more reasonable relationship between different datasets. Visual analytics and examination further help to clarify the undetectable patterns. This research will have a broader impact over federal and state initiatives and policies to address both insufficiency and maldistribution of a health care workforce to improve the accessibility to public health services.",2016,10.3390/ijerph13090930,13,9,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,text mining and physician distribution and spatial analytics and spatial uncertainty and visual examination,NA,NA,2016/09/21/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Public health,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health-care systems. Frailty is being used in clinical decision making for patients with COVID-19, yet the prevalence and effect of frailty in people with COVID-19 is not known. In the COVID-19 in Older PEople (COPE) study we aimed to establish the prevalence of frailty in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and investigate its association with mortality and duration of hospital stay. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study conducted at ten hospitals in the UK and one in Italy. All adults (<e2><89><a5>18 years) admitted to participating hospitals with COVID-19 were included. Patients with incomplete hospital records were excluded. The study analysed routinely generated hospital data for patients with COVID-19. Frailty was assessed by specialist COVID-19 teams using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) and patients were grouped according to their score (1-2=fit; 3-4=vulnerable, but not frail; 5-6=initial signs of frailty but with some degree of independence; and 7-9=severe or very severe frailty). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (time from hospital admission to mortality and day-7 mortality). FINDINGS: Between Feb 27, and April 28, 2020, we enrolled 1564 patients with COVID-19. The median age was 74 years (IQR 61-83); 903 (57<c2><b7>7%) were men and 661 (42<c2><b7>3%) were women; 425 (27<c2><b7>2%) had died at data cutoff (April 28, 2020). 772 (49<c2><b7>4%) were classed as frail (CFS 5-8) and 27 (1<c2><b7>7%) were classed as terminally ill (CFS 9). Compared with CFS 1-2, the adjusted hazard ratios for time from hospital admission to death were 1<c2><b7>55 (95% CI 1<c2><b7>00-2<c2><b7>41) for CFS 3-4, 1<c2><b7>83 (1<c2><b7>15-2<c2><b7>91) for CFS 5-6, and 2<c2><b7>39 (1<c2><b7>50-3<c2><b7>81) for CFS 7-9, and adjusted odds ratios for day-7 mortality were 1<c2><b7>22 (95% CI 0<c2><b7>63-2<c2><b7>38) for CFS 3-4, 1<c2><b7>62 (0<c2><b7>81-3<c2><b7>26) for CFS 5-6, and 3<c2><b7>12 (1<c2><b7>56-6<c2><b7>24) for CFS 7-9. INTERPRETATION: In a large population of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, disease outcomes were better predicted by frailty than either age or comorbidity.

When scoring sleep epochs, experts pay attention to find specific signal characteristics (e.g., K-complexes and spindles), and sometimes need to integrate information from preceding and subsequent epochs in order to make a decision. To imitate this process and to build a more interpretable deep learning model, we propose a neural network based on a convolutional network (CNN) and attention mechanism to perform automatic sleep staging. The CNN learns local signal characteristics, and the attention mechanism excels in learning inter- and intra-epoch features.

In this study, four data mining algorithms, including a classification and regression tree, a C4.5 decision tree, a linear discriminant analysis, and an extreme learning machine, are used to predict early CKD. The study includes datasets from 19,270 patients, provided by an adult health examination program from 32 chain clinics and three special physical examination centers, between 2015 and 2019. There were 11 independent variables, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was used as the predictive variable. The C4.5 decision tree algorithm outperformed the three comparison models for predicting early CKD based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve metrics. It is, therefore, a promising method for early CKD prediction.

This paper describes a systematic, data-driven, injury prevention-decision making process to rank potential injury prevention targets. METHODS: Medical surveillance and safety report data on injuries for 2004 were reviewed. Nonfatal injury diagnoses (ICD-9-CM codes) obtained from the Defense Medical Surveillance System were ranked according to incident visit frequency and estimated limited duty days. Data on the top five injury types resulting in the greatest estimated limited duty days were matched with hospitalization and Service Safety Centers' accident investigation data to identify leading causes. Experts scored and ranked the causes using predetermined criteria that considered the importance of the problem, preventability, feasibility, timeliness of intervention establishment/results, and ability to evaluate. Department of Defense (DoD) and Service-specific injury prevention priorities were identified. RESULTS: Unintentional injuries lead all other medical conditions for number of medical encounters, individuals affected, and hospital bed days. The top ten injuries resulted in an estimated 25 million days of limited duty. Injury-related musculoskeletal conditions were a leading contributor to days of limited duty. Sports and physical training were the leading cause, followed by falls.

Despite these efforts, the participation rate of physical activity in Korean adolescents keeps decreasing. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze the perception of sports and physical activity in Korean adolescents through big data analysis of the last 10 years and to provide research data and statistical direction with regard to sports and physical activity participation in Korean adolescents. For data collection, data from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019 were collected from Naver (NAVER Corp., Seongnam, Korea), Daum (Kakao Corp., Jeju, Korea), and Google (Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), which are the most widely used search engines in Korea, using TEXTOM 4.0 (The Imc Inc., Daegu, Korea), a big data collection and analysis solution. Keywords such as ""adolescent + sports + physical activity"" were used. TEXTOM 4.0 can generate various collection lists at once using keywords. Collected data were processed through text mining (frequency analysis, term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis) and social network analysis (SNA) (degree centrality, convergence of iterated correlations analysis) by using TEXTOM 4.0 and UCINET 6 social network analysis software (Analytic Technologies Corp., Lexington, KY, USA). A total of 9278 big data (10.36 MB) were analyzed. Frequency analysis of the top 50 terms through text mining showed exercise (872), mind (851), health (824), program (782), and burden (744) in a descending order.

To further understand the driving factors of PM(2.5) pollution, the relationship between PM(2.5) concentration and POI data has been quantitatively analyzed using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show the time series coefficients of monthly PM(2.5) concentrations distributed with a U-shape, i.e., with a decrease followed by an increase from January to December. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM(2.5) concentration shows a noteworthy decline over the Central and North China. The LBS-based population density distribution indicates that the health risk of PM(2.5) in the west is significantly lower than that in the Middle East.

Studies assessing how to promote PSA informed decision-making (IDM) have been conducted almost exclusively in healthcare settings; there is a need for similar research in community settings. METHODS: This paper describes the results of a 5-year study (2002--2007) in which two community-level interventions were developed, implemented, and evaluated in matched upper- and lower-SES comparison communities in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina. Both interventions promoted PSA informed decision-making. One intervention (PSA-Only) consisted of educational information about prostate cancer and the PSA test, and the other (Men's Health) included additional information about recognizing and preventing heart attack, stroke, and colon cancer. Structured survey, semistructured interview, and structured observational data were combined to compare participating community residents' pre/post changes in knowledge, intentions, and behaviors related to PSA IDM. RESULTS: The community-level interventions successfully engaged community participants in discussions, educated individuals, encouraged deliberation of information, and facilitated PSA test discussions with physicians. Men who participated in the PSA-Only educational sessions were more likely than those who attended the Men's Health educational sessions to discuss the PSA test with their physician (p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: When prospective SES-related confounding factors are matched across comparison communities, PSA IDM interventions can be shown to promote IDM.

Such beliefs should be a target of increased research interest because they influence how people handle medical information, for example in shared decision making. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 284 participants. Items assessed different aspects of laypeople's epistemic beliefs about medicine and explicitly focused on the appearance of medical knowledge in everyday life and the evaluation of different sources as a way to justify knowledge. RESULTS: Factor analysis yielded a five-factor solution for the instrument. Dimensions covered by the instrument are certainty of medical knowledge, credibility of medical textbooks, credibility of medical information on the Internet, justification of medical knowledge, and preliminarity of medical knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that laypeople have meaningful beliefs about the nature of medical knowledge and the trustworthiness of different sources. The instrument developed seems promising for measuring laypeople's epistemic beliefs about medicine, which may help to increase patients' compliance in medical decision making.",2012,10.1186/1471-2458-12-759,12,NA,759,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Factor Analysis, Statistical and Germany and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and *Public Opinion and *Medicine",NA,NA,2012/09/10/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Li_2015_Amjoofprme,JOUR,Pre-screening Discussions and Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing for Prostate Cancer Screening,"Li, Jun and Zhao, Guixiang and Hall, Ingrid J.",American journal of preventive medicine,"INTRODUCTION: For many men, the net benefit of prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests may be small. Many major medical organizations have issued recommendations for prostate cancer screening, stressing the need for shared decision making before ordering a test. The purpose of this study is to better understand associations between discussions about benefits and harms of PSA testing and uptake of the test among men aged <e2><89><a5>40 years. METHODS: Associations between pre-screening discussions and PSA testing were examined using self-reported data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Unadjusted prevalence of PSA testing was estimated and AORs were calculated using logistic regression in 2014. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis showed that men who had ever discussed advantages of PSA testing only or discussed both advantages and disadvantages were more likely, respectively, to report having had a test within the past year than men who had no discussions (p<0.001). In addition, men who had only discussed the disadvantages of PSA testing with their healthcare providers were more likely (AOR=2.75, 95% CI=2.00, 3.79) to report getting tested than men who had no discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Discussions of the benefits or harms of PSA testing are positively associated with increased uptake of the test. Given the conflicting recommendations for prostate cancer screening and increasing importance of shared decision making, this study points to the need for understanding how pre-screening discussions are being conducted in clinical practice and the role played by patients' values and preferences in decisions about PSA testing.",2015,10.1016/j.amepre.2015.02.007,49,2,259-263,eng,1873-2607 0749-3797,Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Logistic Models and Multivariate Analysis and *Decision Making and Mass Screening/methods and Prostate-Specific Antigen/*analysis and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis and Early Detection of Cancer/*methods and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,Am J Prev Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sarcopenia is a prevalent pathology in adults of around 50 years of age, whereby the muscle mass decreases by 1 to 2% a year, and muscle strength experiences an annual decrease of 1.5% between 50 and 60 years of age, subsequently increasing by 3% each year. The World Health Organisation estimates that 5-13% of individuals of between 60 and 70 years of age and 11-50% of persons of 80 years of age or over have sarcopenia. This study was conducted with 166 patients and 99 variables. Demographic data was compiled including age, gender, place of residence, schooling, marital status, level of education, income, profession, and financial support from the State of Baja California, and biochemical parameters such as glycemia, cholesterolemia, and triglyceridemia were determined. A total of 166 patients took part in the study, with an average age of 77.24 years. The purpose of the study was to provide an automatic classifier of sarcopenia level in older adults using artificial intelligence in addition to identifying the weight of each variable used in the study. We used machine learning techniques in this work, in which 10 classifiers were employed to assess the variables and determine which would provide the best results, namely, Nearest Neighbors (3), Linear SVM (Support Vector Machines) (C = 0.025), RBF (Radial Basis Function) SVM (gamma = 2, C = 1), Gaussian Process (RBF (1.0)), Decision Tree (max_depth = 3), Random Forest (max_depth=3, n_estimators = 10), MPL (Multilayer Perceptron) (alpha = 1), AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis). Feature selection determined by the mean for the variable ranking suggests that Age, Systolic Arterial Hypertension (HAS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Number of chronic diseases (ECNumber), and Sodium are the five most important variables in determining the sarcopenia level, and are thus of great importance prior to establishing any treatment or preventive measure. Analysis of the relationships existing between the presence of the variables and classifiers used in moderate and severe sarcopenia revealed that the sarcopenia level using the RBF SVM classifier with Age, HAS, MNA, ECNumber, and Sodium variables has 82'5 accuracy, a 90'2 F1, and 82'8 precision.",2019,10.3390/ijerph16183275,16,18,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Machine Learning and diagnosis and Mexico and Discriminant Analysis and Bayes Theorem and Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees and Neural Networks, Computer and *Hospitals, General and sarcopenia and Sarcopenia/*classification",NA,NA,2019/09/06/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ji_2020_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Identifying and assessing the impact of key neighborhood-level determinants on geographic variation in stroke: a machine learning and multilevel modeling approach,"Ji, Jiayi and Hu, Liangyuan and Liu, Bian and Li, Yan",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a chronic cardiovascular disease that puts major stresses on U.S. health and economy. The prevalence of stroke exhibits a strong geographical pattern at the state-level, where a cluster of southern states with a substantially higher prevalence of stroke has been called the stroke belt of the nation. Despite this recognition, the extent to which key neighborhood characteristics affect stroke prevalence remains to be further clarified. METHODS: We generated a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level on nearly 27,000 tracts by pooling information from multiple data sources including the CDC's 500 Cities Project 2017 data release. We employed a two-stage modeling approach to understand how key neighborhood-level risk factors affect the neighborhood-level stroke prevalence in each state of the US. The first stage used a state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning algorithm to identify key neighborhood-level determinants. The second stage applied a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach to describe how these key determinants explain the variability in stroke prevalence in each state. RESULTS: Neighborhoods with a larger proportion of older adults and non-Hispanic blacks were associated with neighborhoods with a higher prevalence of stroke. Higher median household income was linked to lower stroke prevalence. Ozone was found to be positively associated with stroke prevalence in 10 states, while negatively associated with stroke in five states. There was substantial variation in both the direction and magnitude of the associations between these four key factors with stroke prevalence across the states. CONCLUSIONS: When used in a principled variable selection framework, high-performance machine learning can identify key factors of neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke from wide-ranging information in a data-driven way. The Bayesian multilevel modeling approach provides a detailed view of the impact of key factors across the states. The identified major factors and their effect mechanisms can potentially aid policy makers in developing area-based stroke prevention strategies.",2020,10.1186/s12889-020-09766-3,20,1,1666,eng,1471-2458,Prevention and Humans and Aged and Machine Learning and Socioeconomic Factors and Bayes Theorem and *Residence Characteristics and *Stroke/epidemiology and Bayesian machine learning and Bayesian multilevel modeling and Neighborhood,NA,NA,2020/11/07/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Five main categories of variables are studied, namely chronic disease conditions, behavioral health, mental health, demographics, and overarching conditions. These are analyzed in the context of regions and states within the U.S. to discover possible correlations between variables in several categories. There are widespread variations in the prevalence of diverse chronic diseases, the number of hospitalizations for specific diseases, and the diagnosis and mortality rates for different states. Identifying such correlations is fundamental to developing insights that will help in the creation of targeted management, mitigation, and preventive policies, ultimately minimizing the risks and costs of chronic diseases.

METHODS: We examined 2013 de-identified patient data from Truven Analytics Health MarketScan database for an assault that occurred by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code E960.1. RESULTS: Analysis of insurance providers' payment patterns for 1355 incident events to female victims aged between 16 and 61 years revealed that victims remit, on average, 14% or $948 of the rape cost, whereas insurance providers pay 86% or $5789 of the total cost. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital billing procedures for privately insured victims of rape across the United States are not separate from billing procedures for privately insured nonrape patients. This standardized procedure leads hospitals to bill victims directly for services not paid under the victims' insurance policy. Public Health Implications.

Rossi_2018_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Patterns and correlates of physical activity in adult Norwegians: a forecasted evolution up to 2025 based on machine learning approach,"Rossi, Alessio and Calogiuri, Giovanna",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: As other westerns countries, a large portion of Norwegians do not meet the minimum recommendations for weekly physical activity (PA). One of the primary targets of the WHO's Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases is to reduce insufficient PA by 10% within 2025. In order to effectively increase the PA levels in the population, an in-depth understanding of PA habits within different sub-groups is therefore vital. Using a machine learning (ML) approach, the aim of this study was to investigate patterns and correlates of PA in adult Norwegians, as well as to construct a predictive model of future PA. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Norsk Monitor survey, which consists of about 3000 items on individual characteristics and sociocultural factors. The dataset contained information about 52,477 adult Norwegians, collected between 1985 and 2013. Past patterns and changes of three PA components (Frequency, Duration, and Intensity) were initially assessed using a series of ANOVAs. A Conditional Mutual Information Maximization Method and a recursive feature elimination with cross-validation were then used to examine the factors associated with such patterns and changes. Finally, the future evolution of the three PA components up to 2025 was predicted using an autoregressive model. RESULTS: In line with previous literature, the analysis of the PA patterns showed a progressive increment of the PA Frequency (which was greater in women), while the PA Duration and Intensity (which were in general higher among men) resulted fairly stable. The PA correlates identified by the ML analysis, which include men and women of different age groups, are presented and discussed. The autoregressive model predicted a general increment of the PA Frequency and PA Intensity by 2025, while the PA Duration is predicted to reduce. Different patterns emerged among the different sub-groups, overall suggesting smaller increments of PA in men and older individuals, as compared to women and younger individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study can inform public health efforts that aim at increasing PA levels in specific target groups.

Kan_2018_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Estimating Vehicle Fuel Consumption and Emissions Using GPS Big Data,"Kan, Zihan and Tang, Luliang and Kwan, Mei-Po and Zhang, Xia",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The energy consumption and emissions from vehicles adversely affect human health and urban sustainability. Analysis of GPS big data collected from vehicles can provide useful insights about the quantity and distribution of such energy consumption and emissions. Previous studies, which estimated fuel consumption/emissions from traffic based on GPS sampled data, have not sufficiently considered vehicle activities and may have led to erroneous estimations. By adopting the analytical construct of the space-time path in time geography, this study proposes methods that more accurately estimate and visualize vehicle energy consumption/emissions based on analysis of vehicles' mobile activities (MA) and stationary activities (SA). First, we build space-time paths of individual vehicles, extract moving parameters, and identify MA and SA from each space-time path segment (STPS). Then we present an N-Dimensional framework for estimating and visualizing fuel consumption/emissions. For each STPS, fuel consumption, hot emissions, and cold start emissions are estimated based on activity type, i.e., MA, SA with engine-on and SA with engine-off. In the case study, fuel consumption and emissions of a single vehicle and a road network are estimated and visualized with GPS data. The estimation accuracy of the proposed approach is 88.6%. We also analyze the types of activities that produced fuel consumption on each road segment to explore the patterns and mechanisms of fuel consumption in the study area. The results not only show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in estimating fuel consumption/emissions but also indicate their advantages for uncovering the relationships between fuel consumption and vehicles' activities in road networks.",2018,10.3390/ijerph15040566,15,4,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and big data and *Geographic Information Systems and *Big Data and emissions estimation and fuel consumption and GPS trace and Vehicle Emissions/*analysis,NA,NA,2018/03/21/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, no study has estimated medical costs for breast cancer treatment at the national level for women aged 19-44 years enrolled in Medicaid. METHODS: A sample of 5,542 younger women aged 19-44 years enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid with diagnosis codes for breast cancer in 2007 were compared with 4.3 million women aged 19-44 years enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid without breast cancer. Nonlinear regression methods estimated prevalent treatment costs for younger women with breast cancer compared with those without breast cancer. Individual medical costs were estimated by race/ethnicity and by type of services. Analyses were conducted in 2013 and all medical treatment costs were adjusted to 2012 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The estimated monthly direct medical costs for breast cancer treatment among younger women enrolled in Medicaid was $5,711 (95% CI=$5,039, $6,383) per woman. The estimated monthly cost for outpatient services was $4,058 (95% CI=$3,575, $4,541), for inpatient services was $1,003 (95% CI=$708, $1,298), and for prescription drugs was $539 (95% CI=$431, $647). By race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic white women had the highest monthly total medical costs, followed by Hispanic women and non-Hispanic women of other race.

In this retrospective cohort study, adherence to these screening exit guidelines was examined. METHODS: Women who turned age 66 years in 2012-2013 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California were followed through age 68 years for cervical cancer screening uptake. Adequacy of prior screening was assessed between age 56 and 65 years using electronic medical records. Guideline adherence was determined based on screening pattern between age 66 and 68 years. Patient- and physician-level correlates for guideline adherence were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Data collection and analyses were conducted in 2018. RESULTS: A total of 14,778 women were included; 24% did not have adequate prior screening by age 65 years. Among those without adequate prior screening, the proportion screened after age 65 years ranged from 71% (177 of 249) in those whose most recent test was abnormal to 3% (34 of 1,330) in those who did not have any testing in 10 years. Prior screening pattern was the only factor associated with screening after age 65 years. Of those with adequate prior screening, 10% (1,135 of 11,295) continued to receive screening after age 65 years. Frequent office visits and having a male primary care physician were associated with continuing screening after age 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of women did not have adequate prior screening by age 65 years.

Traditional methods of assessing built environment characteristics are time-consuming and difficult to combine or compare. Google Street View (GSV) images represent a large, publicly available data source that can be used to create indicators of characteristics of the physical environment with machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to use GSV images to measure the association of built environment features with health-related behaviors and outcomes at the census tract level. METHODS: We used computer vision techniques to derive built environment indicators from approximately 31 million GSV images at 7.8 million intersections. Associations between derived indicators and health-related behaviors and outcomes on the census-tract level were assessed using multivariate regression models, controlling for demographic factors and socioeconomic position. Statistical significance was assessed at the <ce><b1> = 0.05 level. RESULTS: Single lane roads were associated with increased diabetes and obesity, while non-single-family home buildings were associated with decreased obesity, diabetes and inactivity. Street greenness was associated with decreased prevalence of physical and mental distress, as well as decreased binge drinking, but with increased obesity. Socioeconomic disadvantage was negatively associated with binge drinking prevalence and positively associated with all other health-related behaviors and outcomes.

METHODS: We first collected tweets from the Twitter public application program interface stream filtered for prescription opioid keywords. We then used unsupervised machine learning (specifically, topic modeling) to identify topics associated with illegal online marketing and sales. Finally, we conducted Web forensic analyses to characterize different types of online vendors. We analyzed 619 937 tweets containing the keywords codeine, Percocet, fentanyl, Vicodin, Oxycontin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone over a 5-month period from June to November 2015. RESULTS: A total of 1778 tweets (< 1%) were identified as marketing the sale of controlled substances online; 90% had imbedded hyperlinks, but only 46 were ""live"" at the time of the evaluation. Seven distinct URLs linked to Web sites marketing or illegally selling controlled substances online.

Our aim was to understand how these kinds of information exchanges can be made viable. METHODS: We used semistructured interviews to assess health care providers' decision-making processes in selecting technical architectures and vendors for the pilot projects to uncover their needs, expectations, and motivations. RESULTS: Our interviews indicated that, after extensive evaluations, health care providers in all 3 communities eventually selected a hybrid architecture that included a central data repository. However, the reasons for selecting this architecture varied considerably among the 3 communities, reflecting their particular values. Plans to create a community patient portal also differed across communities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, to become established, health information exchange efforts must foster trust, appeal to strategic interests of the medical community as a whole, and meet stakeholder expectations of benefits from quality measurements and population health interventions.

Information technology can improve awareness by providing access to numerous sources of trustworthy information. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: To estimate what a patient interested in palliation might find online, online resources were searched in July 2010, using terms relevant to palliation. PubMed was searched for publications relevant to discussed topics. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Search engines returned vast numbers of hits, and identifying trustworthy sites was difficult. Products judged as trustworthy were classified as information, decision tool, or extended interaction tool. Sites with useful educational material were relatively plentiful; decision guides or interactive tools were much rarer. Available consumer informatics did not address some terminal illnesses very well, and some subpopulations such as children, nor was there sufficient attention to literacy levels or principles of instructional design. Online or published information about usage numbers, effectiveness, and cost/benefit considerations was scant. Many sectors, including commercial, government, healthcare, research, and wellness/advocacy groups, have created consumer informatics for palliation. CONCLUSIONS: Online information about palliation is available, although identifying trustworthy sources can be problematic. General information sites are relatively plentiful, but more tools for decision making, and interaction would increase value of web resources. More attention to literacy levels, instructional principles, and needs of special populations would improve products.

Nature-deficit disorder, a journalistic term proposed to describe the ill effects of people's alienation from nature, is not yet formally recognized as a medical diagnosis. However, over the past decade, the phrase has been enthusiastically taken up by some segments of the lay public. Social media, such as Twitter, with its opportunities to gather ""big data"" related to public opinions, offers a medium for exploring the discourse and dissemination around nature-deficit disorder and other nature-health concepts. In this paper, we report our experience of collecting more than 175,000 tweets, applying sentiment analysis to measure positive, neutral or negative feelings, and preliminarily mapping the impact on dissemination. Sentiment analysis is currently used to investigate the repercussions of events in social networks, scrutinize opinions about products and services, and understand various aspects of the communication in Web-based communities. Based on a comparison of nature-deficit-disorder ""hashtags"" and more generic nature hashtags, we make recommendations for the better dissemination of public health messages through changes to the framing of messages.

It supports the rational and dynamic allocation of ambulances and hospital staffing, and ensures patients have timely access to such resources. However, this task has been challenging due to complex multi-nature dependencies and nonlinear dynamics within ambulance demand, such as spatial characteristics involving the region of the city at which the demand is estimated, short and long-term historical demands, as well as the demographics of a region. Machine learning techniques are thus useful to quantify these characteristics of ambulance demand. However, there is generally a lack of studies that use machine learning tools for a comprehensive modeling of the important demand dependencies to predict ambulance demands. In this paper, an original and novel approach that leverages machine learning tools and extraction of features based on the multi-nature insights of ambulance demands is proposed.

Decision aids (DAs) can increase patient knowledge, intent, and CRCS rates compared with ""usual care,"" but whether interactivity further increases CRCS rate remains unknown. STUDY DESIGN: A two-armed RCT compared the effect of a web-based DA that interactively assessed patient CRC risk and clarified patient preference for specific CRCS test to a web-based DA with the same content but without the interactive tools. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study sites were 12 community- and three university-based primary care practices (56 physicians) in southeastern Michigan. Participants were men and women aged 50-75 years not current on CRCS. INTERVENTION: Random allocation to interactive DA (interactive arm) or non-interactive DA (non-interactive arm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was medical record documentation of CRCS 6 months after the intervention. Secondary outcome was patient decision quality (i.e., knowledge, preference clarification, and intent) measured immediately before and after DA use, and immediately after the office visit. To determine that either DA had a positive effect on CRCS adherence, usual care CRCS rates were determined from the three university-based practices among patients eligible for but not participating in the study. RESULTS: Data were collected between 2012 and 2014; analysis began in 2015. At 6 months, CRCS rate was 36.1% (95% CI=30.5%, 42.2%) in the interactive arm (n=284) and 40.5% (95% CI=34.7%, 46.6%) in the non-interactive arm (n=286, p=0.29). Usual care CRCS rate (n=440) was 18.6% (95% CI=15.2%, 22.7%), significantly lower than both arms (p<0.001). Knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, test preference, and intent increased significantly within each arm versus baseline, but the rate was not significantly different between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: The interactive DA did not improve the outcome compared to the non-interactive DA. This suggests that the resources needed to create and maintain the interactive components are not justifiable.

The objectives of this study are to use robust statistical methods to research the impact of at home telemonitoring on health care outcomes, acceptability of telemonitoring to patients, carers and clinicians and to identify workplace cultural factors and capacity for organisational change management that will impact on large scale national deployment of telehealth services. Additionally, to develop advanced modelling and data analytics tools to risk stratify patients on a daily basis to automatically identify exacerbations of their chronic conditions. METHODS/DESIGN: A clinical trial is proposed at five locations in five states and territories along the Eastern Seaboard of Australia. Each site will have 25 Test patients and 50 case matched control patients. All participants will be selected based on clinical criteria of at least two hospitalisations in the previous year or four or more admissions over the last five years for a range of one or more chronic conditions. Control patients are matched according to age, sex, major diagnosis and their Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). The Trial Design is an Intervention control study based on the Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary data indicates that most outcome variables before and after the intervention are not stationary, and accordingly we model this behaviour using linear mixed-effects (lme) models which can flexibly model within-group correlation often present in longitudinal data with repeated measures. We expect reduced incidence of unscheduled hospitalisation as well as improvement in the management of chronically ill patients, leading to better and more cost effective care. Advanced data analytics together with clinical decision support will allow telehealth to be deployed in very large numbers nationally without placing an excessive workload on the monitoring facility or the patient's own clinicians.

Genetic factors were 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); environmental factors-13 stressful life events (SLEs), plus a composite proportion of SLEs index; and sociobehavioral factors-18 personality, intelligence, and other health or behavioral measures. We performed traditional SNP associations via logistic regression likelihood ratio testing and explored interactions with support vector machines and Bayesian networks. RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant single genotypic associations with depressive symptoms. Machine learning algorithms showed no evidence of interactions. Naive Bayes produced the best models in both subsets and included only environmental and sociobehavioral factors. CONCLUSIONS: We found no single or interactive associations with genetic factors and depressive symptoms.

Currently, compared to questionnaires, social media as a sensor provides low-cost and easy-to-access data sources, providing new opportunities for obtaining human daily activity category data. However, there are still some challenges to accurately recognizing posts because existing studies ignore contextual information or word order in posts and remain unsatisfactory for capturing the activity semantics of words. To address this problem, we propose a general model for recognizing the human activity category based on deep learning. This model not only describes how to extract a sequence of higher-level word phrase representations in posts based on the deep learning sequence model but also how to integrate temporal information and external knowledge to capture the activity semantics in posts. Considering that no benchmark dataset is available in such studies, we built a dataset that was used for training and evaluating the model.

Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed.

Shangguan_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,What Caused the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: From the Perspective of Crisis Management,"Shangguan, Ziheng and Wang, Mark Yaolin and Sun, Wen",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Since the first known case of a COVID-19 infected patient in Wuhan, China on 8 December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries, causing a worldwide public health crisis. The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China's current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17093279,17,9,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"SARS-CoV-2 and China and crisis management and Public Health and COVID-19 and Humans and Public Policy and public health and big data and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Disease Outbreaks and Social Media and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology and *Pandemics and Betacoronavirus and *Politics and China/epidemiology and Health Information Management/*organization & administration and *Public Health Administration",NA,NA,2020/05/08/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study estimates health and economic impacts associated with PulseNet. The staggered adoption of PulseNet across the states offers a natural experiment to evaluate its effectiveness, which is measured as reduction of reported illnesses due to improved information, enhanced industry accountability, and more-rapid recalls. Economic impacts attributable to PulseNet include medical costs and productivity losses averted due to reduced illness. Program costs are also reported. Better information and accountability from enhanced surveillance is associated with large reductions of reported illnesses. Data collected between 1994 and 2009 were assembled and analyzed between 2010 and 2015. Conservatively, accounting for underreporting and underdiagnosis, 266,522 illnesses from Salmonella, 9,489 illnesses from Escherichia coli (E. coli), and 56 illnesses due to Listeria monocytogenes are avoided annually. This reduces medical and productivity costs by $507 million. Additionally, direct effects from improved recalls reduce illnesses from E. coli by 2,819 and Salmonella by 16,994, leading to $37 million in costs averted. Annual costs to public health agencies are $7.3 million. The PulseNet system makes possible the identification of food safety risks by detecting widespread or non-focal outbreaks.

Zhang_2018_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,A Novel Multiattribute Decision-Making Method Based on Pointâ»Choquet Aggregation Operators and Its Application in Supporting the Hierarchical Medical Treatment System in China,"Zhang, Runtong and Xing, Yuping and Wang, Jun and Shang, Xiaopu and Zhu, Xiaomin",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The hierarchical medical treatment system is an efficient way to solve the problem of insufficient and unbalanced medical resources in China. Essentially, classifying the different degrees of diseases according to the doctor's diagnosis is a key step in pushing forward the hierarchical medical treatment system. This paper proposes a framework to solve the problem where diagnosis values are given as picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs). Point operators can reduce the uncertainty of doctor's diagnosis and get intensive information in the process of decision making, and the Choquet integral operator can consider correlations among symptoms. In order to take full advantage of these two kinds of operators, in this paper, we firstly define some point operators under the picture fuzzy environment, and further propose a new class of picture fuzzy pointâ»Choquet integral aggregation operators. Moreover, some desirable properties of these operators are also investigated in detail.

Cohen_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,A Feasibility Study Using a Machine Learning Suicide Risk Prediction Model Based on Open-Ended Interview Language in Adolescent Therapy Sessions,"Cohen, Joshua and Wright-Berryman, Jennifer and Rohlfs, Lesley and Wright, Donald and Campbell, Marci and Gingrich, Debbie and Santel, Daniel and Pestian, John",International journal of environmental research and public health,"BACKGROUND: As adolescent suicide rates continue to rise, innovation in risk identification is warranted. Machine learning can identify suicidal individuals based on their language samples. This feasibility pilot was conducted to explore this technology's use in adolescent therapy sessions and assess machine learning model performance. METHOD: Natural language processing machine learning models to identify level of suicide risk using a smartphone app were tested in outpatient therapy sessions. Data collection included language samples, depression and suicidality standardized scale scores, and therapist impression of the client's mental state. Previously developed models were used to predict suicidal risk. RESULTS: 267 interviews were collected from 60 students in eight schools by ten therapists, with 29 students indicating suicide or self-harm risk. During external validation, models were trained on suicidal speech samples collected from two separate studies. We found that support vector machines (AUC: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.69-0.81) and logistic regression (AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70-0.82) lead to good discriminative ability, with an extreme gradient boosting model performing the best (AUC: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.84).

METHODS: We conducted 45 semistructured interviews with public health practitioners across a range of occupations (e.g., health officers, medical directors, sanitarians, nurses) at 13 health departments in Michigan. RESULTS: Through qualitative analysis, we identified 5 broad categories of ethical issues common across occupations and locations: (1) determining appropriate use of public health authority, (2) making decisions related to resource allocation, (3) negotiating political interference in public health practice, (4) ensuring standards of quality of care, and (5) questioning the role or scope of public health. Participants cited a variety of values guiding their decision-making that did not coalesce around core values often associated with public health, such as social justice or utilitarianism.

Fred and Bell, Brooke M. and Intille, Stephen and Huang, Jeannie S. and Baranowski, Tom",American journal of preventive medicine,"Technological advancements in the past decades have improved dietary intake and physical activity measurements. This report reviews current developments in dietary intake and physical activity assessment in youth. Dietary intake assessment has relied predominantly on self-report or image-based methods to measure key aspects of dietary intake (e.g., food types, portion size, eating occasion), which are prone to notable methodologic (e.g., recall bias) and logistic (e.g., participant and researcher burden) challenges. Although there have been improvements in automatic eating detection, artificial intelligence, and sensor-based technologies, participant input is often needed to verify food categories and portions. Current physical activity assessment methods, including self-report, direct observation, and wearable devices, provide researchers with reliable estimations for energy expenditure and bodily movement. Recent developments in algorithms that incorporate signals from multiple sensors and technology-augmented self-reporting methods have shown preliminary efficacy in measuring specific types of activity patterns and relevant contextual information. However, challenges in detecting resistance (e.g., in resistance training, weight lifting), prolonged physical activity monitoring, and algorithm (non)equivalence remain to be addressed. In summary, although dietary intake assessment methods have yet to achieve the same validity and reliability as physical activity measurement, recent developments in wearable technologies in both arenas have the potential to improve current assessment methods.

Craig_2018_BMCpubhea,JOUR,"Altruism, Scepticism, and collective decision-making in foreign-born U.S. residents in a tuberculosis vaccine trial","Craig, Sienna R. and Lahey, Timothy and Dixit, Apoorva and Fordham von Reyn, C.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The current vaccine against tuberculosis, BCG, is effective when given in most TB-endemic countries at birth but has diminished efficacy against pulmonary TB after 15-20 years. As a result, new booster vaccines for adolescents and adults are being developed to realize the World Health Organization target of global elimination of TB by 2035. Multiple TB candidates thus are in active clinical development. METHODS: One of these, DAR-901, is advancing in human clinical trials. These clinical trials are conducted in BCG immunized adults with and without HIV infection in order to assess safety and efficacy among the people most in need of a new vaccine. A Phase I dose escalation trial of DAR-901 in BCG-immunized adults with or without HIV infection was conducted between 2014 and 2016. This offered an unusual opportunity to qualitatively examine why foreign-born adults living in the United States - a poorly studied population - decide to participate, or not, in clinical trials. RESULTS: We conducted a qualitative study of individuals who were recruited to participate in this Phase I vaccine trial, interviewing those who agreed and declined to participate. We found diverse motivations for participation or refusal; varied understandings of tuberculosis and vaccines; and complex views about how 'informed consent' can be at odds with cultural understandings of power, authority, and medical decision-making. These dynamics included: knowledge (direct or indirect) of tuberculosis, a desire to be altruistic and simultaneous hopes for personal gain as well as concerns over what remuneration for participation could mean, the importance of personal relationships with care providers in shaping volunteerism, concerns over privacy, and evidence of how culture and history shape medical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This US-based trial, aimed at addressing a crucible global health issue, raises productive questions about the interface between altruism and scepticism regarding clinical research participation.

In China, some studies suggest that the number of individuals opting to self-treat has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the trends of and factors related to self-treatment in China. METHODS: Self-treatment was measured based the concept and data of the China National Health Survey (CNHS), which covers 802,454 individuals. We used CNHS data from 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008, and a Multinomial Logit Selection Model to estimate the factors influencing the decision to self-treat. RESULTS: The prevalences of self-treatment with a recall period of two-weeks were significantly higher in urban compared with rural areas (31.2% vs 14.9% in 1993, 43.5% vs 21.4% in 1998, 47.2% vs 31.4% in 2003, 31.0% vs 25.3% in 2008) in China. Economic (per capita income, TV, sanitary water) and individual (education, profession, family members, exercise) factors, as well as accessibility to drugs had a positive association with the probability of self-treating. Different illness symptoms, severity, and duration show a negative association with the probability of self-treating, showing a degree of rationality in decision-making. Different insurance systems were also found to have an effect on self-treatment decision-making.

Joseph and Wiener, Renda S. and Fagerlin, Angela and Hayward, Rodney A. and Lowery, Julie and Caverly, Tanner J.",American journal of preventive medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about how clinicians make low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening decisions in practice. Investigators assessed the factors associated with real-world decision making, hypothesizing that lung cancer risk and comorbidity would not be associated with agreeing to or receiving screening. Though these factors are key determinants of the benefit of lung cancer screening, they are often difficult to incorporate into decisions without the aid of decision tools. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients meeting current national eligibility criteria and deemed appropriate candidates for lung cancer screening on the basis of clinical reminders completed over a 2-year period (2013-2015) at 8 Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models (conducted in 2019-2020) assessed predictors (age, sex, lung cancer risk, Charlson Comorbidity Index, travel distance to facility, and central versus outlying decision-making location) of primary outcomes of agreeing to and receiving lung cancer screening. RESULTS: Of 5,551 patients (mean age=67 years, 97% male, mean lung cancer risk=0.7%, mean Charlson Comorbidity Index=1.14, median travel distance=24.2 miles), 3,720 (67%) agreed to lung cancer screening and 2,398 (43%) received screening. Lung cancer risk and comorbidity score were not strong predictors of agreeing to or receiving screening. Empirical Bayes adjusted rates of agreeing to and receiving screening ranged from 22% to 84% across facilities and from 19% to 85% across clinicians. A total of 33.7% of the variance in agreeing to and 34.2% of the variance in receiving screening was associated with the facility or the clinician offering screening. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variation was found in Veterans agreeing to and receiving lung cancer screening during the Veterans Affairs Lung Cancer Screening Demonstration Project. This variation was not explained by differences in key determinants of patient benefit, whereas the facility and clinician advising the patient had a large impact on lung cancer screening decisions.",2021,10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.014,60,4,520-528,eng,1873-2607 0749-3797,Humans and Female and Male and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Cohort Studies and Mass Screening and Bayes Theorem and *Early Detection of Cancer and *Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology,NA,NA,2021/04//undefined,Am J Prev Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

A correct prediction of osteoarthritis is an essential step to effectively diagnose and prevent severe osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is commonly diagnosed by experts through manual inspection of patients' medical images, which are usually collected in hospitals. Checking the occurrence of osteoarthritis is somewhat time-consuming for patients. In addition, the current studies are focused on automatically detecting osteoarthritis through image-based deep learning algorithms. This needs patients' medical images, which requires patients to visit the hospital. However, medical utilization and health behavior information as statistical data are easier to collect and access than medical images. Using indirect statistical data without any medical images to predict the occurrence of diverse forms of OA can have significant impacts on pro-active and preventive medical care. In this study, we used a deep neural network for detecting the occurrence of osteoarthritis using patient's statistical data of medical utilization and health behavior information. The study was based on 5749 subjects. Principal component analysis with quantile transformer scaling was employed to generate features from the patients' simple background medical records and identify the occurrence of osteoarthritis. Our experiments showed that the proposed method using deep neural network with scaled PCA resulted in 76.8% of area under the curve (AUC) and minimized the effort to generate features. Hence, this methos can be a promising tool for patients and doctors to prescreen for possible osteoarthritis to reduce health costs and patients' time in hospitals.",2019,10.3390/ijerph16071281,16,7,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,deep learning and feature extraction and prediction and Humans and Middle Aged and Algorithms and Area Under Curve and Early Diagnosis and *Deep Learning and osteoarthritis and Osteoarthritis/*diagnosis,NA,NA,2019/04/10/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet most studies assess urban greenness with overhead-view measures, such as park area or tree count, which often differs from the amount of greenness perceived by a person at eye-level on the ground. Furthermore, those studies are often criticized for the limitation of residential self-selection bias. In this study, urban greenness was extracted and assessed from profile view of streetscape images by Google Street View (GSV), in conjunction with deep learning techniques. We also explored a unique research opportunity arising in a citywide residential reallocation scheme of Hong Kong to reduce residential self-selection bias. Two multilevel regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between urban greenness and (1) the odds of walking for 24,773 public housing residents in Hong Kong, (2) total walking time of 1994 residents, while controlling for potential confounders. The results suggested that eye-level greenness was significantly related to higher odds of walking and longer walking time in both 400 m and 800 m buffers. Distance to the closest Mass Transit Rail (MTR) station was also associated with higher odds of walking. Number of shops was related to higher odds of walking in the 800 m buffer, but not in 400 m.

Tirilis_2011_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Missing and accounted for: gaps and areas of wealth in the public health review literature,"Tirilis, Daiva and Husson, Heather and DeCorby, Kara and Dobbins, Maureen",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: High-quality review evidence is useful for informing and influencing public health policy and practice decisions. However, certain topic areas lack representation in terms of the quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers. METHODS: Searches conducted on http://www.health-evidence.ca produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for registered users and visitors of http://www.health-evidence.ca were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics. RESULTS: Registered users' top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301+) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (<e2><89><a4> 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users' and visitors' topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating. CONCLUSIONS: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on http://www.health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-757,11,NA,757,eng,1471-2458,Humans and Evidence-Based Practice and Public Health Practice/*standards and *Public Health and *Social Class and *Review Literature as Topic,NA,NA,2011/10/03/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Efforts to understand and prevent these types of injuries have largely been dominated by epidemiological research and safety science, which has focused on identifying risk at the level of the individual worker, population group, or organizational sector. Limited research has focused on the perspectives of the workers, a key stakeholder group for informing understanding of vulnerability to work-related head injury. This study explored workers' perspectives to better understand their decision-making and how and why their injuries occurred. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews with thirty-two adult workers who had sustained a work-related head injury. Workers were recruited from an urban clinic in central Ontario, Canada. Labour Process Theory informed the thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three hazardous work conditions were identified: insufficient training; inadequate staffing; and inattention to the physical environment. In addition, professional and organizational norms were implicated in vulnerability to head injury including putting the client before the worker and the pressure to work unsafely. The findings also highlight a complex interrelationship between workers' decision-making and professional and organizational norms that produces vulnerability to head injury, a vulnerability which oftentimes is reproduced by workers' decisions to work despite hazardous conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, beyond the need to redress the inattention to hazards in the physical environment, there is a need to address norms that influence worker decision-making to improve the safety of workers. Using Labour Process Theory highlights an important social dynamic within workplace sectors that could inform future development and implementation of multi-level and integrated public health strategies to reduce work-related head injury.",2017,10.1186/s12889-017-4823-5,17,1,824,eng,1471-2458,Organizational Culture and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Risk Factors and Qualitative Research and Ontario/epidemiology and Workplace/organization & administration and Craniocerebral Trauma/*epidemiology and Occupational Injuries/*epidemiology,NA,NA,2017/10/18/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biases are complex but systematic, differing by racial/ethnic group and not limited to love-hate polarities. Group images on the universal social cognitive dimensions of competence and warmth determine the content of each group's overall stereotype, distinct emotional prejudices (pity, envy, disgust, pride), and discriminatory tendencies. These biases are often unconscious and occur despite the best intentions. Such ambivalent and automatic biases can influence medical decisions and interactions, systematically producing discrimination in health care and ultimately disparities in health. Understanding how these processes may contribute to bias in health care can help guide interventions to address racial and ethnic disparities in health.",2012,10.2105/AJPH.2011.300601,102,5,945-952,eng,1541-0048 0090-0036,Humans and Physician-Patient Relations and Attitude to Health and Health Status Disparities and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology and *Prejudice and Stereotyping,NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,Am J Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study was to explore decision-making processes in surrogates of cancer patients in a Taiwan intensive care unit (ICU). This qualitative study surveyed a purposive sample of surrogates (n = 8; average age, 48 years) of cancer patients in the ICU of a medical center in Taiwan. A phenomenological methodology was used, and a purposive sample of surrogates of cancer patients were recruited and interviewed during the first three days of the ICU stay. Results: Based on the interview results, four themes were generalized through text progression: (1) Use love to resist: internal angst. This theme was related to the reflexive self -blame, the feelings of inner conflict, and the reluctance to make healthcare decisions, which surrogates experienced when they perceived suffering by the patient. (2) Allow an angel to spread love among us: memories and emotional entanglements. Memories of the patient caused the surrogate to experience emotional entanglements ranging from happiness to sadness and from cheerfulness to anger. (3) Dilemmas of love: anxiety about ICU visitor restrictions. The confined space and restricted visiting hours of the ICU limited the ability of surrogates to provide emotional support and to share their emotions with the patient. (4) Suffocating love: entanglement in decision-making. Emotional entanglements among family members with different opinions on medical care and their struggles to influence decision-making often prevented surrogates from thinking logically. Conclusions: Expression of emotions by ICU surrogates is often restrained and implicit, particularly in Asian populations. These results can help health professionals understand the psychological shock and inner conflict experienced by surrogates and provide a useful reference for improving their communications with surrogates.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17124443,17,12,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Asia and Intensive Care Units and *Decision Making and Taiwan and decision-making process and *Proxy and surrogates and *Neoplasms/nursing and cancer patients and intensive care unit (ICU),NA,NA,2020/06/20/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The translation to Spanish of a questionnaire that measures the patient perception of SDM will allow enlarging the range of its application. However, the essence of the questionnaire can be altered during its translation, which could curb the appreciation of the question and what the question originally asked for. The objective of this study is to evaluate the application of SDM-Q-9 in its psychometric properties, to a Spanish speaking population after its translation process. METHOD: The questionnaire was given to 76 outpatients who attended a medical control at the hospital. The informed consent process was developed before the patient underwent the physician's evaluation, and the SDM-Q-9 was applied when the patient finished the medical evaluation. The reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated and its structural validity was verified by the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The SDM-Q-9 presented reliability and validity according to the following indicators. The internal consistency, measured by Cronbach's alpha, was 0.839 for the whole scale.

Among U.S. states, Tennessee has one of the highest rates of child obesity. Emerging communication technologies can help to deliver highly disseminable population-level interventions to improve health behavior. The aim of this paper is to report the implementation and the evaluation of the reach of Memphis FitKids, a web-based application, intended to promote healthy behaviors for families and children. METHODS: A community-level demonstration project, Memphis FitKids, was developed and implemented in Tennessee's Greater Memphis Area. This application ( www.memphisfitkids.org ) was designed for parents to assess their children's obesity risk through determinants such as weight, diet, physical activity, screen time, and sleep adequacy. A built-in ""FitCheck"" tool used this collected information to create a report with tailored recommendations on how to make healthy changes. A Geographic Information Systems component was implemented to suggest low-cost neighborhood resources that support a healthy lifestyle. A social marketing framework was used to develop and implement FitKids, and a Community Advisory Board with representatives from community partners (e.g., the YMCA of Memphis, the Pink Palace Family of Museums, and the Memphis Public Library) supported the implementation of the project. Five kiosks distributed in the community served as public access points to provide a broad reach across socioeconomic strata. Presentations at community events and the use of Facebook facilitated the promotion of FitKids. Website traffic and Facebook usage were evaluated with Google Analytics and Facebook Insights, respectively. RESULTS: In Tennessee, 33,505 users completed 38,429 FitCheck sessions between July 2014 and December 2016. Among these, 6763 sessions were completed at the five kiosks in the community. FitKids was presented at 112 community events and the social media posts reached 23,767 unique Facebook users.

Talat and Shen, Huizhong",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Large wildfires are an increasing threat to the western U.S. In the 2017 fire season, extensive wildfires occurred across the Pacific Northwest (PNW). To evaluate public health impacts of wildfire smoke, we integrated numerical simulations and observations for regional fire events during August-September of 2017. A one-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system was used to simulate fire smoke transport and dispersion. To reduce modeling bias in fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and to optimize smoke exposure estimates, we integrated modeling results with the high-resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction satellite aerosol optical depth and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency AirNow ground-level monitoring PM(2.5) concentrations. Three machine learning-based data fusion algorithms were applied: An ordinary multi-linear regression method, a generalized boosting method, and a random forest (RF) method. 10-Fold cross-validation found improved surface PM(2.5) estimation after data integration and bias correction, especially with the RF method. Lastly, to assess transient health effects of fire smoke, we applied the optimized high-resolution PM(2.5) exposure estimate in a short-term exposure-response function. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM(2.5) exposure during the smoke episode was 183 (95% confidence interval: 0, 432), with 85% of the PM(2.5) pollution and 95% of the consequent multiple-cause mortality contributed by fire emissions.

Tailored safety information and safety planning, typically provided by domestic violence service providers, can prevent repeat IPV exposure and associated adverse health outcomes; however, few abused women access these services. The Internet represents a potentially innovative way to connect abused women with tailored safety planning resources and information. The purpose of this study was to compare safety and mental health outcomes at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months among abused women randomized to: (1) a tailored, Internet-based safety decision aid; or (2) control website (typical safety information available online). DESIGN: Multistate, community-based longitudinal RCT with one-to-one allocation ratio and blocked randomization. Data were collected March 2011-May 2013 and analyzed June-July 2015. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Currently abused Spanish- or English-speaking women (N=720). INTERVENTION: A tailored Internet-based safety decision aid included priority-setting activities, risk assessment, and tailored feedback and safety plans. A control website offered typical safety information available online. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were decisional conflict, safety behaviors, and repeat IPV; secondary outcomes included depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: At 12 months, there were no significant group differences in IPV, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Intervention women experienced significantly less decisional conflict after one use (<ce><b2>= -2.68, p=0.042) and greater increase in safety behaviors they rated as helpful from baseline to 12 months (12% vs 9%, p=0.033) and were more likely to have left the abuser (63% vs 53%, p=0.008). Women who left had higher baseline risk (14.9 vs 13.1, p=0.003) found more of the safety behaviors they tried helpful (61.1% vs 47.5%, p<0.001), and had greater reductions in psychological IPV ((11.69 vs 7.5, p=0.001) and sexual IPV (2.41 vs 1.25, p=0.001) than women who stayed.

McDonald_2011_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Maternal bodies and medicines: a commentary on risk and decision-making of pregnant and breastfeeding women and health professionals,"McDonald, Karalyn and Amir, Lisa H. and Davey, Mary-Ann",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The perceived risk/benefit balance of prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, as well as complementary therapies, will significantly impact on an individual's decision-making to use medicine. For women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, this weighing of risks and benefits becomes immensely more complex because they are considering the effect on two bodies rather than one. Indeed the balance may lie in opposite directions for the mother and baby/fetus. The aim of this paper is to generate a discussion that focuses on the complexity around risk, responsibility and decision-making of medicine use by pregnant and breastfeeding women. We will also consider the competing discourses that pregnant and breastfeeding women encounter when making decisions about medicine. DISCUSSION: Women rely not only on biomedical information and the expert knowledge of their health care professionals but on their own experiences and cultural understandings as well. When making decisions about medicines, pregnant and breastfeeding women are influenced by their families, partners and their cultural societal norms and expectations. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are influenced by a number of competing discourses. ""Good"" mothers should manage and avoid any risks, thereby protecting their babies from harm and put their children's needs before their own - they should not allow toxins to enter the body. On the other hand, ""responsible"" women take and act on medical advice - they should take the medicine as directed by their health professional. This is the inherent conflict in medicine use for maternal bodies. SUMMARY: The increased complexity involved when one body's actions impact the body of another - as in the pregnant and lactating body - has received little acknowledgment. We consider possibilities for future research and methodologies. We argue that considering the complexity of issues for maternal bodies can improve our understanding of risk and public health education.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-S5-S5,11 Suppl 5,Suppl 5,S5,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Female and Health Services Research and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and Attitude to Health and Consumer Product Safety and *Decision Making and Pregnant Women/*psychology and *Breast Feeding and *Complementary Therapies/adverse effects and *Nonprescription Drugs/adverse effects and Drug Information Services/standards and Lactation/drug effects/physiology and Maternal Exposure and Maternal Welfare/*psychology and Maternal-Fetal Exchange/drug effects and Milk, Human/drug effects and Public Health/education and Women's Health/education",NA,NA,2011/11/25/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Johnston_2011_BMCpubhea,JOUR,An industry perspective on Canadian patients' involvement in medical tourism: implications for public health,"Johnston, Rory and Crooks, Valorie A. and Adams, Krystyna and Snyder, Jeremy and Kingsbury, Paul",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The medical tourism industry, which assists patients with accessing non-emergency medical care abroad, has grown rapidly in recent years. A lack of reliable data about medical tourism makes it difficult to create policy, health system, and public health responses to address the associated risks and shortcomings, such as spread of infectious diseases, associated with this industry. This article addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing interviews conducted with Canadian medical tourism facilitators in order to understand Canadian patients' involvement in medical tourism and the implications of this involvement for public health. METHODS: Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with 12 medical facilitators from 10 companies in 2010. An exhaustive recruitment strategy was used to identify interviewees. Questions focused on business dimensions, information exchange, medical tourists' decision-making, and facilitators' roles in medical tourism. Thematic analysis was undertaken following data collection. RESULTS: Facilitators helped their Canadian clients travel to 11 different countries. Estimates of the number of clients sent abroad annually varied due to demand factors. Facilitators commonly worked with medical tourists aged between 40 and 60 from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds who faced a number of potential barriers including affordability, fear of the unfamiliar, and lack of confidence. Medical tourists who chose not to use facilitators' services were thought to be interested in saving money or have cultural/familial connections to the destination country. Canadian doctors were commonly identified as barriers to securing clients. CONCLUSIONS: No effective Canadian public health response to medical tourism can treat medical tourists as a unified group with similar motivations for engaging in medical tourism and choosing similar mechanisms for doing so. This situation may be echoed in other countries with patients seeking care abroad. Therefore, a call for a comprehensive public health response to medical tourism and its effects should be coupled with a clear understanding that medical tourism is a highly diverse practice. This response must also acknowledge facilitators as important stakeholders in medical tourism.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-416,11,NA,416,eng,1471-2458,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Canada and Interviews as Topic and *Public Health and *Patient Participation and *Medical Tourism and *Industry,NA,NA,2011/05/31/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current review evaluated the extent to which information on key external validity dimensions, participants, settings, interventions, outcomes, and maintenance of effects, was included in research studies on behavioral treatments for childhood obesity. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Peer-reviewed studies of behavioral childhood obesity treatments published between 1980 and 2008 were identified from (1) electronic searches of social science and medical databases; (2) research reviews of childhood obesity interventions; and (3) reference lists cited in these reviews. Included studies reported on a controlled obesity intervention trial, targeted overweight or obese children aged 2-18 years, included a primary or secondary anthropometric outcome, and targeted change in dietary intake or physical activity behaviors. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 1071 publications were identified and 77 met selection criteria. Studies were coded on established review criteria for external validity elements. All studies lacked full reporting of generalizability elements. Across criteria, the average reporting was 23.9% (range=0%-100%). Infrequently reported were setting-level selection criteria and representativeness, characteristics regarding intervention staff, implementation of the intervention content, costs, and program sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced reporting of relevant and pragmatic information in behavioral investigations of childhood obesity interventions is needed to improve the ability to evaluate the applicability of results to practice implementation.

We used boosted regressions (a machine-learning technique) to identify unusual patterns of responses to 7 screener items presumably unrelated to LGBQ identification, which generated an index of suspected mischievousness. We estimated LGBQ-heterosexual youth disparities on 20 health outcomes; then we removed 1% of suspected mischievous responders at a time and re-estimated disparities to assess the robustness of original estimates. RESULTS: Accounting for suspected mischievousness reduced estimates of the average LGBQ-heterosexual youth health disparity by up to 46% for boys and 23% for girls; however, screening did not affect all outcomes equally.

To report on vaccine opposition and misinformation promoted on Twitter, highlighting Twitter accounts that drive conversation.Methods. We used supervised machine learning to code all Twitter posts. We first identified codes and themes manually by using a grounded theoretical approach and then applied them to the full data set algorithmically. We identified the top 50 authors month-over-month to determine influential sources of information related to vaccine opposition.Results. The data collection period was June 1 to December 1, 2019, resulting in 356 594 mentions of vaccine opposition. A total of 129 Twitter authors met the qualification of a top author in at least 1 month. Top authors were responsible for 59.5% of vaccine-opposition messages. We identified 10 conversation themes.

Evidence-informed decision making involves translation of the best available evidence from a systematically collected, appraised, and analyzed body of knowledge. Knowledge management (KM) is emerging as a key factor contributing to the realization of evidence-informed public health decision making. The goal of health-evidence.ca is to promote evidence-informed public health decision making through facilitation of decision maker access to, retrieval, and use of the best available synthesized research evidence evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions. METHODS: The systematic reviews that populate health evidence.ca are identified through an extensive search (1985-present) of 7 electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, BIOSIS, and SportDiscus; handsearching of over 20 journals; and reference list searches of all relevant reviews. Reviews are assessed for relevance and quality by two independent reviewers. Commonly-used public health terms are used to assign key words to each review, and project staff members compose short summaries highlighting results and implications for policy and practice. RESULTS: As of June 2010, there are 1913 reviews in the health-evidence.ca registry in 21 public health and health promotion topic areas. Of these, 78% have been assessed as being of strong or moderate methodological quality. Health-evidence.ca receives approximately 35,000 visits per year, 20,596 of which are unique visitors, representing approximately 100 visits per day. Just under half of all visitors return to the site, with the average user spending six minutes and visiting seven pages per visit. Public health nurses, program managers, health promotion workers, researchers, and program coordinators are among the largest groups of registered users, followed by librarians, dieticians, medical officers of health, and nutritionists. The majority of users (67%) access the website from direct traffic (e.g., have the health-evidence.ca webpage bookmarked, or type it directly into their browser).

The present study aimed at examining psychological and psychosocial variables that could predict behavioral compliance. An online survey was administered from 18-22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Paired sample t-tests were run to compare efficacy perception with behavioral compliance. Mediation and moderated mediation models were constructed to explore the association between perceived efficacy and compliance, mediated by self-efficacy and moderated by risk perception and civic attitudes. Machine learning algorithms were trained to predict which individuals would be more likely to comply with protective measures. Results indicated significantly lower scores in behavioral compliance than efficacy perception. Risk perception and civic attitudes as moderators rendered the mediating effect of self-efficacy insignificant. Perceived efficacy on the adoption of recommended behaviors varied in accordance with risk perception and civic engagement. The 14 collected variables, entered as predictors in machine learning models, produced an ROC area in the range of 0.82-0.91 classifying individuals as high versus low compliance.

However, both the diversity and the complex nonlinear relationships of PM(2.5) influencing factors pose challenges for accurate mapping. To address these issues, we innovatively combined social sensing data with remote sensing data and other auxiliary variables, which can bring both natural and social factors into the modeling; meanwhile, we used a deep learning method to learn the nonlinear relationships. The geospatial analysis methods were applied to realize effective feature extraction of the social sensing data and a grid matching process was carried out to integrate the spatiotemporal multi-source heterogeneous data.

A Qualitative Study of Caregivers of Disabled Patients,"Chiang, Fu-Ming and Hsieh, Jyh-Gang and Fan, Sheng-Yu and Wang, Ying-Wei and Wang, Shu-Chen",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The aging of the Taiwanese population has become a major issue. Previous research has focused on the burden and stress faced by caregivers, but has not explored how the experience of these caregivers influences decisions of advance care planning (ACP). Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify important themes. Five themes and fourteen sub-themes were identified: (1) Past experiences: patient wishes, professional recommendations, and expectation about disease progress; (2) Impact of care on family members: positive affirmation, open-minded life, social isolation and health effects, and financial and life planning effects; (3) Attitude toward life: not forcing to stay, and not becoming a burden, (4) Expected proxy dilemmas: torment between doing or not, seeing the extension of suffering and toil, and remorse and self-blame; (5) Expectation of end of life (EOL) care: caregiver's experience and EOL care decisions, and practicality of EOL decision making. After making multiple medical decisions for their disabled relatives, caregivers are able to calmly face their own medical decisions, and ""not becoming a burden"" is their primary consideration.

Steenaart_2020_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Implementation of an interactive organ donation education program for Dutch lower-educated students: a process evaluation,"Steenaart, Esther and Crutzen, Rik and de Vries, Nanne K.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: As organ donation registration rates remain low, especially among lower-educated people, it is important to support this group in making their registration decision. To prepare lower-educated students in the Netherlands for making a well-informed decision, an interactive educational program was developed. We aim to understand both the (quality of) implementation as well as to contextualize the effects of this program in a lower-educated school setting. METHODS: The process evaluation was part of a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial, in which 11 schools for Intermediate Vocational Education throughout the Netherlands participated. Teachers who taught a course on Citizenship delivered three intervention elements (i.e. video fragments and discussion, quizzes with tailored feedback and an exercise filling out a registration form) to their students. Implementation was assessed by interviews with teachers, questionnaires from students, logbooks from teachers and user data from Google Analytics. RESULTS: The program was well received and implemented, but on-the-spot adaptations were made by teachers to fit their students better. Within the lower-educated target group, differences between students are high in terms of active participation, reading abilities, knowledge and attention span. The program fit well within their regular teaching activities, but the topic of organ donation is not always prioritized by teachers. CONCLUSIONS: We see opportunities to disseminate the program on a larger scale and reach a group that has been neglected in organ donation education before. Within the program, there are possibilities to increase the effectiveness of the program, such as alternative delivery methods for the elements with a lot of text, the addition of booster sessions and guidelines for teachers to adapt the program to students of different levels within Intermediate Vocational Education. Moreover, in order to have an impact on a national level, strategies need to be employed to reach high numbers of students and, therefore, support on a higher level is needed (both within schools and at policy level).

Data are needed regarding physician and patient characteristics associated with opioid analgesic and opioid analgesic-gabapentinoid co-prescriptions to elucidate targets for reducing preventable harm. METHODS: Multiple logistic regression was utilized to examine patient and physician predictors of opioid analgesic prescriptions and opioid analgesic-gabapentinoid co-prescriptions in adult noncancer patients using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2015 public use data set. Potential predictors were selected based on literature review, clinical relevance, and random forest machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Among the 11.8% (95% CI=9.8%, 13.9%) of medical encounters with an opioid prescription, 16.2% (95% CI=12.6%, 19.8%) had a gabapentinoid co-prescription. Among all gabapentinoid encounters, 40.7% (95% CI=32.6%, 48.7%) had an opioid co-prescription. Predictors of opioid prescription included arthritis (OR=1.87, 95% CI=1.30, 2.69). Predictors of new opioid prescription included physician status as an independent contractor (OR=3.67, 95% CI=1.38, 9.81) or part owner of the practice (OR=3.34, 95% CI=1.74, 6.42). Predictors of opioid-gabapentinoid co-prescription included patient age (peaking at age 55-64 years; OR=35.67, 95% CI=4.32, 294.43). CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of opioid analgesic prescriptions with and without gabapentinoid co-prescriptions were identified. These predictors can help inform and reinforce (e.g., educational) interventions seeking to reduce preventable harm, help identify populations for elucidating opioid-gabapentinoid risk-benefit profiles, and provide a baseline for evaluating subsequent public health measures.",2020,10.1016/j.amepre.2019.08.029,58,1,e11-e19,eng,1873-2607 0749-3797,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Health Care Surveys and Aged, 80 and over and Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Drug Prescriptions/statistics & numerical data and Outpatients/*statistics & numerical data and Analgesics/*adverse effects and Gabapentin/*adverse effects",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,Am J Prev Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

Renewed attention has recently been paid to the best approaches for tackling the health inequalities which remain entrenched within British society and across the globe. In order to consider the opportunities and challenges facing the new public health system in England, we explored the current experiences of those involved in decision making to reduce health inequalities, taking cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a case study. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth qualitative study employing 40 semi-structured interviews and three focus group discussions. Participants were public health policy makers and planners in CVD in the UK, including: Primary Care Trust and Local Authority staff (in various roles); General Practice commissioners; public health academics; consultant cardiologists; national guideline managers; members of guideline development groups, civil servants; and CVD third sector staff. RESULTS: The short term target- and outcome-led culture of the NHS and the drive to achieve ""more for less"", combined with the need to address public demand for acute services often lead to investment in ""downstream"" public health intervention, rather than the ""upstream"" approaches that are most effective at reducing inequalities. Despite most public health decision makers wishing to redress this imbalance, they felt constrained due to difficulties in partnership working and the over-riding influence of other stakeholders in decision making processes. The proposed public health reforms in England present an opportunity for public health to move away from the medical paradigm of the NHS. However, they also reveal a reluctance of central government to contribute to shifting social norms. CONCLUSIONS: It is vital that the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of all new and existing policies and services affecting public health are measured in terms of their impact on the social determinants of health and health inequalities. Researchers have a vital role to play in providing the complex evidence required to compare different models of prevention and service delivery. Those working in public health must develop leadership to raise the profile of health inequalities as an issue that merits attention, resources and workforce capacity; and advocate for central government to play a key role in shifting social norms.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-821,11,NA,821,eng,1471-2458,Humans and United Kingdom and Health Care Reform and Public-Private Sector Partnerships and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and *Decision Making and *Public Health and *Health Personnel and Health Workforce and *Healthcare Disparities and *Health Priorities and Cardiovascular Diseases/therapy,NA,NA,2011/10/20/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Even so, doctors may still be overconfident. A survey was here conducted to test how medical experience and self-confidence can affect physicians working in the specific clinical area. Potential participants were contacted through personalized emails and invited to contribute to the survey. The ""risk-intelligence"" test consists of 50 statements about general knowledge in which participants were asked to indicate how likely they thought that each statement was true or false. The risk-intelligence quotient (RQ), a measure of self-confidence, varies between 0 and 100. The higher the RQ score, the better the confidence in personal knowledge. To allow for a representation of 1000 physicians, the sample size was calculated as 278 respondents. A total of 1334 individual emails were sent to reach 278 respondents. A control group of 198 medical students were also invited, of them, 54 responded to the survey. The mean RQ (SD)of physicians was 61.1 (11.4) and that of students was 52.6 (9.9).

Gowda_2012_BMCpubhea,JOUR,"Understanding attitudes toward adolescent vaccination and the decision-making dynamic among adolescents, parents and providers","Gowda, Charitha and Schaffer, Sarah E. and Dombkowski, Kevin J. and Dempsey, Amanda F.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: With several new vaccine recommendations specifically targeting adolescents, improving adolescent vaccination rates has become a major health priority. Vaccination attitudes are an important, modifiable target for new interventions. Prior research has examined primarily the attitudes and beliefs of adolescents, parents or healthcare providers separately without exploring the decision-making dynamic among these stakeholders. We sought to identify potentially modifiable barriers in the vaccine decision process among adolescents, parents and healthcare providers that could be addressed through interventions implemented within the adolescent's medical home. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study of adolescents, their parents and healthcare providers, recruited from four primary care practices in Michigan. For each practice, three separate focus group discussions (adolescents, parents and healthcare providers, for a total of 12 focus groups) were conducted to explore vaccination attitudes, possible interventions to improve vaccine uptake and access to and use of technology for vaccination interventions. Themes that emerged from the focus group discussions were categorized using an inductive, iterative process, and analysis focused on highlighting similarities and differences among the three perspectives. RESULTS: Participants included 32 adolescents, 33 parents and 28 providers. The majority of parents and adolescents were female. Lack of knowledge about recommended adolescent vaccinations was universally recognized among the three groups and was perceived to be the underlying driver of low immunization rates. Notably, each group did not appear to fully appreciate the challenges faced by the other stakeholders with respect to adolescent vaccination. Adolescents were seen as having a greater role in the vaccine decision-making dynamic than previously suggested. Provider-based interventions such as educational tools and reminder-recall notices were identified as important components of any immunization program. Overall, there was high receptivity among all stakeholders toward integrating technology such as email and Internet into new vaccination interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We identified potentially modifiable attitudinal barriers to adolescent vaccination among the three key stakeholders. However, there were notable differences in attitudes and preferences across the three perspectives, indicating that for an intervention to be successful it will require a dynamic partnership with the target audiences.",2012,10.1186/1471-2458-12-509,12,NA,509,eng,1471-2458,"Michigan and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Child and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Focus Groups and *Decision Making and *Attitude to Health and *Vaccination and Health Personnel/*psychology and Parents/*psychology",NA,NA,2012/07/07/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

While traveling abroad, medical tourists' caregiver-companions can find themselves confronted with challenging communication barriers, financial pressures, emotional strain, and unsafe environments. METHODS: To better understand what actions and activities medical tourists' informal caregivers can undertake to protect their health and safety, 20 interviews were conducted with Canadians who had experienced accompanying a medical tourist to an international health care facility for surgery. Interview transcripts were subsequently used to identify inductive and deductive themes central to the advice research participants offered to prospective caregiver-companions. RESULTS: Advice offered to future caregiver-companions spanned the following actions and activities to protect health and safety: become an informed health care consumer; assess and avoid exposure to identifiable risks; anticipate the care needs of medical tourists and thereby attempt to guard against caregiver burden; become familiar with important logistics related to travel and anticipated recovery timelines; and take practical measures to protect one's own health. CONCLUSION: Given that a key feature of public health is to use research findings to develop interventions and policies intended to promote health and reduce risks to individuals and populations, the paper draws upon major points of advice offered by study participants to take the first steps toward the development of an informational intervention designed specifically for the health and safety needs of medical tourists' caregiver companions. While additional research is required to finalize the content and form of such an intervention, this study provides insight into what practical advice former caregiver-companions state should be shared with individuals considering assuming these roles and responsibilities in the future. In addition, this research draws attention to the importance of ensuring that such an intervention is web-based and readily accessible by prospective caregiver-companions.",2017,10.1186/s12889-017-4442-1,17,1,487,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Prospective Studies and Risk Factors and Canada and Aged, 80 and over and Caregivers/*psychology and Family/*psychology and *Safety Management and *Medical Tourism and Qualitative and Caregiver burden and Informal caregiving and Informational intervention and Medical tourism and Transnational care",NA,NA,2017/05/22/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lim_2008_Amjoofprme,JOUR,Screening for prostate cancer in U.S. men ACPM position statement on preventive practice,"Lim, Lionel S. and Sherin, Kevin",American journal of preventive medicine,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the leading cancer in U.S. men, and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Principal screening tests for detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer include digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of the serum tumor marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). There are risks and benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Randomized controlled trials of screening by DRE and PSA are limited to two previously published studies. Two other large-scale randomized controlled trials are currently in progress. METHODS: This study reviewed the efficacy of DRE and PSA for prostate cancer screening found in the medical literature prior to July 2007. RESULTS: Applications of PSA screening tests used in clinical practice include (1) a PSA cutoff of 4 ng/ml, (2) age-specific PSA, (3) PSA velocity, (4) PSA density, and (5) percent free PSA. Prostate cancer screening can detect early disease and offers the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. Prostate cancer screening benefits, however, remain unproven, pending results of ongoing trials. There is currently no convincing evidence that early screening, detection, and treatment improves mortality. Limitations of prostate cancer screening include potential adverse health effects associated with false-positive and negative results, and treatment side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The American College of Preventive Medicine concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine population screening with DRE or PSA. Clinicians caring for men, especially African-American men and those with positive family histories, should provide information about potential benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, and the limitations of current evidence for screening, in order to maximize informed decision making.",2008,10.1016/j.amepre.2007.10.003,34,2,164-170,eng,0749-3797,"Humans and Evidence-Based Medicine and Male and Preventive Medicine and United States/epidemiology and *Consensus and *Practice Patterns, Physicians' and *Mass Screening and Digital Rectal Examination and Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis and Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality",NA,NA,2008/02//undefined,Am J Prev Med,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this manuscript, the key innovation is to combine the traditional VIKOR model with q-RIVOFS to develop the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy VIKOR model. In the new developed model, to express more information, the attribute's values in MAGDM problems are depicted by q-RIVOFNs. First of all, some basic theories and aggregation operators of q-RIVOFNs are simply introduced.

The objective was to conduct an RCT of a bicycle train program to assess impact on students' school travel mode and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). STUDY DESIGN: Pilot cluster RCT with randomization at the school level and N=54 participants. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Fourth-fifth graders from four public schools serving low-income families in Seattle, WA in 2014 with analyses in 2015-2016. All participants were provided and fitted with bicycles, safety equipment (helmets, locks, and lights), and a 2- to 3-hour bicycle safety course. INTERVENTION: The intervention was a bicycle train offered daily (i.e., students volunteered to cycle with study staff to and from school). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time 1 assessments occurred prior to randomization. Time 2 assessments occurred after 3-5 weeks of the intervention (i.e., during Weeks 4-6 of the intervention period). The primary outcome was the percentage of daily commutes to school by cycling measured by validated survey. MVPA, measured by accelerometry and GPS units and processed by machine learning algorithms, was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: For two separate adjusted repeated measures linear mixed effects models in which students (N=54) were nested within schools (N=4), intervention participants had: (1) an absolute increase in mean percentage of daily commutes by cycling of 44.9%, (95% CI=26.8, 63.0) and (2) an increase in mean MVPA of 21.6 minutes/day, (95% CI=8.7, 34.6) from Time 1 to Time 2 compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: A pilot bicycle train intervention increased cycling to school and daily MVPA in the short term among diverse, inner-city elementary school students. The bicycle train intervention appears promising and warrants further experimental trials among large, diverse samples with longer follow-up.

With the migration of people, the epidemic has rapidly spread within China and throughout the world. Due to the severity of the epidemic, undiscovered transmission of COVID-19 deserves further investigation. The aim of our study hypothesized possible modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how the virus may have spread between two family clusters within a residential building in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we monitored and traced confirmed patients and their close contacts from January 11 to February 5, 2020 in Guangzhou, China, including 2 family cluster cases and 61 residents within one residential building. The environmental samples of the building and the throat swabs from the patients and from their related individuals were collected for SARS-CoV-2 and tested with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relevant information was collected and reported using big data tools. RESULTS: There were two notable family cluster cases in Guangzhou, which included 3 confirmed patients (family No.1: patient A, B, C) and 2 confirmed patients (family No.2: patient D, E), respectively. None of patients had contact with other confirmed patients before the onset of symptoms, and only patient A and patient B made a short stop in Wuhan by train. Home environment inspection results showed that the door handle of family No.1 was positive of SARS-CoV-2. The close contacts of the 5 patients all tested negative of SARS-CoV-2 and in good health, and therefore were released after the official medical observation period of 14-days. Finally, according to the traceability investigation through applying big data analysis, we found an epidemiological association between family No.1 and family No.2, in which patient D (family No.2) was infected through touching an elevator button contaminated by snot with virus from patient A (family No.1) on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminants with virus from confirmed patients can pollute the environment of public places, and the virus can survive on the surface of objects for a short period of time. Therefore, in addition to the conventional droplet transmission, there is also indirect contact transmission such as snot-oral transmission that plays a crucial role in community spread of the virus.",2020,10.1186/s12889-020-09296-y,20,1,1202,eng,1471-2458,"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Pandemics and Environmental Microbiology and Residence Characteristics and Cluster Analysis and Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology/*transmission and Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology/*transmission and China/epidemiology and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and *Family and Betacoronavirus/*isolation & purification and Contact Tracing and Indirect transmission and Novel coronavirus disease and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Snot-oral transmission",NA,NA,2020/08/05/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to explore young adults' knowledge, attitudes, and preferences regarding advance care planning (ACP) and medical decision-making. Further, we aimed to understand the potential role of public health to encourage population-based promotion of ACP. METHODS: Between February 2007 and April 2007, we conducted six focus groups comprising 56 young adults ages 18-30. Topics explored included (1) baseline knowledge regarding ACP, (2) preferences for ACP, (3) characteristics of preferred surrogates, and (4) barriers and facilitators to completing ACP specific to age and individuation. We used a qualitative thematic approach to analyze transcripts. RESULTS: All participants desired more information regarding ACP. In addition, participants expressed (1) heterogeneous attitudes regarding triggers to perform ACP, (2) the opinion that ACP is a marker of individuation, (3) the belief that prior exposure to illness plays a role in prompting ACP, and (4) an appreciation that ACP is flexible to changes in preferences and circumstances throughout the life-course.

Seeking SUD treatment involves searching SUD treatment facility types (inpatient, outpatient and intensive outpatient, residential and family residential, and detoxification facilities) that offer specialized SUD treatment depending on individual needs and preferences. Referrals to SUD treatment require innovative strategies that rapidly link individuals to SUD treatment when they are at the critical stage of readiness. The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a user-friendly SUD treatment facility opening availability website called FindHelpNowKY.org. The objectives of the study were to 1) recruit SUD treatment facility and partner participation; 2) develop platform, content, and analytics for the FindHelpNowKY.org website intervention with an information repository; 3) assess barriers and facilitators to implementation; and 4) evaluate the development and implementation of FindHelpNowKY.org. METHODS: Website development stakeholders were identified and the website concept was developed. The logic model for FindHelpNowKY.org outlined resources, activities, and outputs as well as the associated short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives, along with a website evaluation plan. Website usability and focus group testing was conducted. Information repository resource documents were compiled and categorized. An inventory of Kentucky-based SUD treatment facilities was compiled using various state and federal resources. RESULTS: Development/implementation barriers were addressed, facilitators were identified, and the website was implemented; 83% of SUD treatment facilities were indexed on the website, and average website user time was 7 min. From February to October 2018, there were 29,000 visitors, and 30,000 unique searches. The most common website query was a friend or family member seeking long-term residential or outpatient treatment facilities accepting Medicaid or Medicare. CONCLUSIONS: FindHelpNowKY.org has the potential to fill a critical need for timely access to available SUD treatment in the state. The website may be a valuable resource for health professionals that can enhance clinical workflow and reduce staff time conducting phone and website searches for available SUD treatment. The website is a promising tool for assessing current SUD treatment capacity vs. SUD treatment need.

Numerous studies have shown that the food consumption patterns of Chinese residents will bring certain pressure to the environment. Food consumption patterns have individual differences. Therefore, reducing the pressure of food consumption patterns on the environment requires the precise positioning of people with high consumption tendencies. Based on the related concepts of the machine learning method, this paper designs an identification method of the population with a high environmental footprint by using a decision tree as the core and realizes the automatic identification of a large number of users. By using the microdata provided by CHNS(the China Health and Nutrition Survey), we study the relationship between residents' dietary intake and environmental resource consumption. First, we find that the impact of residents' food system on the environment shows a certain logistic normal distribution trend. Then, through the decision tree algorithm, we find that four demographic characteristics of gender, income level, education level, and region have the greatest impact on residents' environmental footprint, where the consumption trends of different characteristics are also significantly different. At the same time, we also use the decision tree to identify the population characteristics with high consumption tendency. This method can effectively improve the identification coverage and accuracy rate and promotes the improvement of residents' food consumption patterns.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17197349,17,19,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,machine learning and China and Humans and Machine Learning and CHNS and *Diet and diet and Asians and *Nutrition Surveys and carbon footprint and ecological footprint and water footprint,NA,NA,2020/10/08/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the public reaction to Ebola in China and identify the primitive correlation between possible influence factors caused by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and Chinese public attention via Internet surveillance. METHODS: Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) were collected from their official websites, and the disease-related data were recorded from the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. National Ministries of Health. The average BDI of Internet users in different regions were calculated to identify the public reaction to the Ebola outbreak. Spearman's rank correlation was used to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation analysis were performed to detect the clustered areas with the high attention to the topic of ""Ebola"". The related news reports were collected from authoritative websites to identify potential patterns. RESULTS: The BDI and the SMI for ""Ebola"" showed a similar fluctuating trend with a correlation coefficient = 0.9 (p < 0.05). The average BDI in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai was higher than other cities. However, the disease-related indicators did not identify potential correlation with both indices above.

Although previous studies have explored ethical issues in priority setting from the perspective of clinicians and policymakers, there has been little investigation into how the public views priority setting during a pandemic influenza, in particular related to intensive care resources. METHODS: To bridge this gap, we conducted three public town hall meetings across Canada to explore Canadian's perspectives on this ethical challenge. Town hall discussions group discussions were digitally recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six interrelated themes emerged from the town hall discussions related to: ethical and empirical starting points for deliberation; criteria for setting priorities; pre-crisis planning; in-crisis decision-making; the need for public deliberation and input; and participants' deliberative struggle with the ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of public consultation in pandemic planning for sustaining public trust in a public health emergency. Participants appreciated the empirical and ethical uncertainty of decision-making in an influenza pandemic and demonstrated nuanced ethical reasoning about priority setting of intensive care resources in an influenza pandemic. Policymakers may benefit from a better understanding the public's empirical and ethical 'starting points' in developing effective pandemic plans.",2012,10.1186/1471-2458-12-241,12,NA,241,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Canada and *Pandemics and *Intensive Care Units and *Health Resources and *Influenza, Human/epidemiology/therapy",NA,NA,2012/03/26/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a strong association between rural background and rural undergraduate training and rural practice, and personal and family factors have been shown to influence workplace location, but the interaction between interest, training availability, and other work-relevant factors has not yet been fully explored. A qualitative study conducted by the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia (RCSWA) and WA Country Health Service (WACHS) explored factors influencing the decision to pursue rural work among junior doctors. Data collection and analysis was iterative. In total, 21 junior doctors were recruited to participate in semi-structured telephone interviews. Two main themes relating to the systems of influence on career decision-making emerged: (1) The importance of place and people, and (2) the broader context. We found that career decision-making among junior doctors is influenced by a complex web of factors operating at different levels.

In the last decade, numerous studies have been proposed using artificial intelligence techniques to predict the risk of developing SiNCDs. However, determining the most significant features and developing interpretable models are rather challenging in such systems. In this study, we propose an efficient extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based framework incorporated with the hybrid feature selection (HFS) method for SiNCDs prediction among the general population in South Korea and the United States. Initially, HFS is performed in three stages: (I) significant features are selected by t-test and chi-square test; (II) multicollinearity analysis serves to obtain dissimilar features; (III) final selection of best representative features is done based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Then, selected features are fed into the XGBoost predictive model. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing baseline models. In addition, the proposed model also provides important features in order to enhance the interpretability of the SiNCDs prediction model. Consequently, the XGBoost based framework is expected to contribute for early diagnosis and prevention of the SiNCDs in public health concerns.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17186513,17,18,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Risk and Humans and Forecasting and feature selection and *Artificial Intelligence and Republic of Korea/epidemiology and smoking and extreme gradient boosting and *Noncommunicable Diseases/epidemiology and *Smoking/adverse effects and noncommunicable disease,NA,NA,2020/09/07/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ydreborg_2007_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Swedish social insurance officers' experiences of difficulties in assessing applications for disability pensions--an interview study,"Ydreborg, Berit and Ekberg, Kerstin and Nilsson, Kerstin",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: In this study the focus is on social insurance officers judging applications for disability pensions. The number of applications for disability pension increased during the late 1990s, which has resulted in an increasing number of disability pensions in Sweden. A more restrictive attitude towards the clients has however evolved, as societal costs have increased and governmental guidelines now focus on reducing costs. As a consequence, the quantitative and qualitative demands on social insurance officers when handling applications for disability pensions may have increased. The aim of this study was therefore to describe the social insurance officers' experiences of assessing applications for disability pensions after the government's introduction of stricter regulations. METHODS: Qualitative methodology was employed and a total of ten social insurance officers representing different experiences and ages were chosen. Open-ended interviews were performed with the ten social insurance officers. Data was analysed with inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes could be identified as problematic in the social insurance officers' descriptions of dealing with the applications in order to reach a decision on whether the issue qualified applicants for a disability pension or not: 1. Clients are heterogeneous. 2. Ineffective and time consuming waiting for medical certificates impede the decision process. 3. Perspectives on the issue of work capacity differed among different stakeholders. The backgrounds of the clients differ considerably, leading to variation in the quality and content of applications. Social insurance officers had to make rapid decisions within a limited time frame, based on limited information, mainly on the basis of medical certificates that were often insufficient to judge work capacity. The role as coordinating actor with other stakeholders in the welfare system was perceived as frustrating, since different stakeholders have different goals and demands. The social insurance officers experience lack of control over the decision process, as regulations and other stakeholders restrict their work. CONCLUSION: A picture emerges of difficulties due to disharmonized systems, stakeholder-bound goals causing some clients to fall between two stools, or leading to unnecessary waiting times, which may limit the clients' ability to take an active part in a constructive process. Increased communication with physicians about how to elaborate the medical certificates might improve the quality of certificates and thereby reduce the clients waiting time.",2007,10.1186/1471-2458-7-128,7,NA,128,eng,1471-2458,"Communication and Problem Solving and Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Time Factors and Workload and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Sweden and Decision Making, Organizational and Operations Research and *Work Capacity Evaluation and *Administrative Personnel/psychology and Certification/organization & administration/standards and Government Agencies/*organization & administration and Insurance, Disability/*organization & administration and Social Security/*organization & administration/standards and Social Welfare/*economics",NA,NA,2007/06/27/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this work, we developed and compared a prototype of a medical data extraction system based on different artificial neural network architectures to process free medical texts in the Russian language. Three classifiers were applied to extract entities from snippets of text. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers showed similar results to all three embedding models.

This article proposes a two-level hierarchical multicriteria decision model to address medical waste disposal method selection (MWDMS), where disposal methods are assessed against different criteria as intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations and criteria weights are furnished as real values. This paper first introduces new operations for a special class of intuitionistic fuzzy values, whose membership and non-membership information is cross ratio based ]0, 1[-values. New score and accuracy functions are defined in order to develop a comparison approach for ]0, 1[-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. A weighted geometric operator is then put forward to aggregate a collection of ]0, 1[-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values. Similar to Saaty's 1-9 scale, this paper proposes a cross-ratio-based bipolar 0.1-0.9 scale to characterize pairwise comparison results. Subsequently, a two-level hierarchical structure is formulated to handle multicriteria decision problems with intuitionistic preference relations.

International research has shown that compensation for injury rehabilitation can have negative impacts on health outcomes. This study examined transport injury compensation policy in the Australian state of Victoria to: determine type and purpose of reference to information sources; and to identify the extent of reference to academic research evidence in transport related injury rehabilitation compensation policy. METHODS: Quantitative content analysis of injury rehabilitation compensation policies (N = 128) from the Victorian state government transport accident compensation authority. RESULTS: The most commonly referenced types of information were Internal Policy (median = 6 references per policy), Clinical/Medical (2.5), and Internal Legislation (1). Academic Research Evidence was the least often referenced source of information. The main purpose of reference to information was to support injury treatment and rehabilitation compensation claims decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Transport injury compensation policy development is complex; with multiple sources of information cited including legislation, internal policy, external policy and clinical/medical evidence. There is limited use of academic research evidence in Victorian state government injury treatment and rehabilitation compensation policies. Decisions regarding compensation for injury treatment and rehabilitation services could benefit from greater use of academic research evidence.

Future doctors need a larger scope of capacities in order to strengthen a patient's autonomy, participation, and self-management abilities.

We assessed whether comprehensive training increased these health literacy competencies, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), with a waiting list condition. Participants were international undergraduate medical students of a Dutch medical faculty (intervention: 39; control: 40). The 11-h-training-intervention encompassed a health literacy lecture and five interactive small-group sessions to practise gathering information and providing comprehensible information, shared decision-making, and enabling of self-management using role-play and videotaped conversations. We assessed self-reported competencies (knowledge and awareness of health literacy, attitude, self-efficacy, and ability to use patient-centred communication techniques) at baseline, after a five and ten-week follow-up. We compared students' competencies using multi-level analysis, adjusted for baseline. As validation, we evaluated demonstrated skills in videotaped consultations for a subsample. The group of students who received the training intervention reported significantly greater health literacy competencies, which persisted up to five weeks afterwards. Increase was greatest for providing comprehensible information (B: 1.50; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.15 to 1.84), shared decision-making (B: 1.08; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.55), and self-management (B: 1.21; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.80). Effects regarding demonstrated skills confirmed self-rated competency improvement. This training enhanced a larger scope of health literacy competences and was well received by medical students.

The process of attempting SM is still unclear. Exploration of SM and its contributing factors would help policymakers design and develop preventive programs. This qualitative study aimed to explore the process of attempting SM among Iranian people. METHODS: This grounded theory (GT) study was conducted among people with the experience of attempting SM (n = 17) and medical staff (n = 9) in Iran selected via semi-structured interviews. The recorded and transcribed interviews were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding based on Strauss and Corbin's (1998) approach. RESULTS: The study results revealed that people sought to deal as simply and quickly as possible with their illnesses/symptoms according to their attitudes towards and perceptions of illnesses/symptoms as well as their economic and social problems. This simple and quick approach was the participants' main concern, resulting in taking decision-making strategies as SM facilitators. SM, in turn, provided short-term improvement and temporary satisfaction as a predominant outcome.

A multilevel design for healthcare decision support,"Di Martino, Mirko and Lallo, Adele and Kirchmayer, Ursula and Davoli, Marina and Fusco, Danilo",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: According to scientific literature, antibacterials are prescribed for common pediatric conditions that do not benefit from antibiotic therapy. The link between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance is well known. Antibiotic overprescribing generates high social costs and severe consequences for children. Our objectives were to analyze antibiotic prescription patterns in pediatric outpatients residing in the Lazio region (Italy), to identify physicians' characteristics associated with increased propensity for prescription, to identify the priority axes for action to improve the rational use of antibiotics. METHODS: We enrolled all children aged 13 years or less in 2014. Antibiotic prescription patterns were analyzed during a one-year follow-up period. The main outcome measures were the antibiotic prescription prevalence, and the geographic variation in antibiotic prescribing. Multilevel models were performed to analyze variation. Variation was expressed as Median Odds Ratios (MORs). If the MOR is 1.00, there is no variation between clusters. If there is considerable between-cluster variation, the MOR will be large. RESULTS: We enrolled 636,911 children. Most of them were aged 6-13 years (57.3%). In 2015, the antibiotic prescription prevalence was 46% in the 0-13, 58% in the 0-5, and 37% in the 6-13 age group. Overall, penicillins were the most prescribed antibiotics, their consumption increased from 43% to 52% during the 2007-2015 period. In 2015, the antibiotic prescription prevalence ranged from 30% to 62% across local health districts (LHDs) of the region. Moreover, a significant (p < 0.001) variation was observed between physicians working in the same LHD: MORs were equal to 1.52 (1.48-1.56) and 1.46 (1.44-1.48) in the 0-5 and 6-13 age groups, respectively. The probability of prescribing antibiotics was significantly (p < 0.001) lower for more-experienced physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric antibiotic use in the Lazio region is much higher than in other European countries. The intra-regional drug prescribing variability underlines the lack of therapeutic protocols shared at regional level and raises equity issues in access to optimal care. Both LHD managers and individual physicians should be involved in training interventions to improve the targeted use of antibiotics and mitigate the effect of contextual variables, such as the spatial-related socioeconomic status of the patient/parent binomial.",2017,10.1186/s12889-017-4905-4,17,1,886,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Geographic variation and Infant, Newborn and Italy and Professional Role and *Pediatrics and Clinical Decision-Making and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and Multilevel models and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and *Ambulatory Care and Local Government and Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data and Antibiotic prescription patterns and Multilevel Analysis and Pediatric outpatients and Physicians, Primary Care/psychology/statistics & numerical data and Preschool children",NA,NA,2017/11/17/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Selecting the best treatment technology for HCW can be regarded as a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue involving a number of alternatives and multiple evaluation criteria.

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to propose a new hybrid decision making approach combining interval 2-tuple induced distance operators with the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) for tackling HCW treatment technology selection problems with linguistic information. The proposed interval 2-tuple induced TOPSIS (ITI-TOPSIS) can not only model the uncertainty and diversity of the assessment information given by decision makers, but also reflect the complex attitudinal characters of decision makers and provide much more complete information for the selection of the optimum disposal alternative.

Both the side effects of treatment and the lack of a demonstrated mortality benefit of routine screening with the prostate-specific antigen test among men in the general population have increased the focus on patient participation in decision making about prostate cancer screening. METHODS: Data on 1075 male respondents to the 2003 Health Information National Trends Study were collected from October 2002 to April 2003 and analyzed in 2008 to examine the associations among race/ethnicity, demographic characteristics, and the perception of the risk of developing prostate cancer for African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white men aged >or=45 years without a history of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Nearly 50% of African-American men, 47.4% of Hispanic men, and 43.3% of non-Hispanic white men perceived their likelihood of getting prostate cancer as somewhat or very low. Nearly 18% of African-American men, 21.6% of Hispanic men, and 12.9% of non-Hispanic white men perceived themselves to be more likely to get prostate cancer than the average man of the same age. CONCLUSIONS: Despite statistics to the contrary, few African-American men perceived themselves to have a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer, while a higher percentage of Hispanic men perceived their risk to be higher than that of the average man of the same age.

Its usage is limited not only by its quantity but also by its quality. Among the most important contaminants of groundwater in India is arsenic, which naturally accumulates in some aquifers. In this study we create a random forest model with over 145,000 arsenic concentration measurements and over two dozen predictor variables of surface environmental parameters to produce hazard and exposure maps of the areas and populations potentially exposed to high arsenic concentrations (>10 <c2><b5>g/L) in groundwater. Statistical relationships found between the predictor variables and arsenic measurements are broadly consistent with major geochemical processes known to mobilize arsenic in aquifers. In addition to known high arsenic areas, such as along the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, we have identified several other areas around the country that have hitherto not been identified as potential arsenic hotspots. Based on recent reported rates of household groundwater use for rural and urban areas, we estimate that between about 18-30 million people in India are currently at risk of high exposure to arsenic through their drinking water supply.

Amirfar_2011_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Developing public health clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for the outpatient community in New York City: our experience,"Amirfar, Sam and Taverna, John and Anane, Sheila and Singer, Jesse",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Developing a clinically relevant set of quality measures that can be effectively used by an electronic health record (EHR) is difficult. Whether it is achieving internal consensus on relevant priority quality measures, communicating to EHR vendors' whose programmers generally lack clinical contextual knowledge, or encouraging implementation of EHR that meaningfully impacts health outcomes, the path is challenging. However, greater transparency of population health, better accountability, and ultimately improved health outcomes is the goal and EHRs afford us a realistic chance of reaching it in a scalable way. METHOD: In this article, we summarize our experience as a public health government agency with developing measures for a public health oriented EHR in New York City in partnership with a commercial EHR vendor. RESULTS: From our experience, there are six key lessons that we share in this article that we believe will dramatically increase the chance of success. First, define the scope and build consensus. Second, get support from executive leadership. Third, find an enthusiastic and competent software partner. Fourth, implement a transparent operational strategy. Fifth, create and test the EHR system with real life scenarios. Last, seek help when you need it. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges, we encourage public health agencies looking to build a similarly focused public health EHR to create one both for improved individual patient as well as the larger population health.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-753,11,NA,753,eng,1471-2458,"Public Health and Humans and Software Design and New York City and Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration and Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*organization & administration and *Outpatients and *Community Health Services",NA,NA,2011/09/30/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

We developed HGBEnviroScreen to identify and prioritize regions of heightened vulnerability, in part to assist communities in understanding risk factors and developing environmental justice action plans. While similar in objectives to existing environmental justice tools, HGBEnviroScreen is unique in its ability to integrate and visualize national and local data to address regional concerns. For the 1090 census tracts in the HGB region, we accrued data into five domains: (i) social vulnerability, (ii) baseline health, (iii) environmental exposures and risks, (iv) environmental sources, and (v) flooding. We then integrated and visualized these data using the Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi). We found that the highest vulnerability census tracts have multifactorial risk factors, with common drivers being flooding, social vulnerability, and proximity to environmental sources.

We aimed to describe physicians' perceptions--infectious diseases specialists/medical microbiologists (IDMM) and public health/preventive medicine specialists (PHPMS)--in regards to issues encountered with the pandemics management at the physician level and highlight suggested improvements for future healthcare emergencies. METHODS: In April 2010, Quebec IDMM and PHPMS physicians were invited to anonymously complete a web-based learning needs assessment. The survey included both open-ended and multiple-choice questions. Descriptive statistics were used to report on the frequency distribution of multiple choice responses whereas thematic content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data generated from the survey and help understand respondents' experience and perceptions with the pandemics. RESULTS: Of the 102 respondents, 85.3% reported difficulties or frustrations in their practice during the pandemic. The thematic analysis revealed two core themes describing the problems experienced in the pandemic management: coordination and resource-related difficulties. Coordination issues included communication, clinical practice guidelines, decision-making, roles and responsibilities, epidemiological investigation, and public health expert advisory committees. Resources issues included laboratory resources, patient management, and vaccination process. CONCLUSION: Together, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest a need for improved coordination, a better definition of roles and responsibilities, increased use of information technologies, merged communications, and transparency in the decisional process.

One major challenge which impedes the progress of attaining sustainable development of the social healthcare system in China is that the number of hospital admissions is disproportionate. Superior hospitals are overcrowded, whereas subordinate hospitals are experiencing low admissions. In this paper, we apply the game theory model to coordinate the healthcare supply chain network, which is composed of the government, medical insurance fund, superior hospitals, subordinate hospitals and patients. Especially by taking the reference price effect into account, this paper analyzes different medical insurance reimbursement strategies and their influence on patient choice and the healthcare supply chain network. The result shows that the reference price effect increases the leverage of medical insurance, guides patients' choice, optimizes the allocation of medical resources and reduces the medical expends.

During an 18-year follow-up, 56 fatal and 316 nonfatal events of acute MI were documented among 7663 employees with no recorded history of cardiovascular disease at baseline (i.e., 1986). RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, psychological distress, prevalent medical conditions, lifestyle risk factors, and socioeconomic characteristics, low decision autonomy (P < .53) and skill discretion (P < .10) were not significantly related to subsequent acute MI. By contrast, low predictability at work was associated with elevated risk of acute MI (P = .02).

A robust influenza immunization program in the U.S. requires ongoing monitoring of potential adverse events associated with vaccination. PURPOSE: To prospectively conduct safety monitoring of H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines during the 2009-2010 season. METHODS: The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project monitors <e2><88><bc>9.2 million members in eight U.S. medical care organizations. Electronic data on vaccines and pre-specified adverse events were updated and analyzed weekly for signal detection from November 2009 to April 2010 using either a self-controlled design or a current versus historical comparison. Statistical signals were further evaluated using alternative approaches to identify temporal clusters and to control for time-varying confounders. RESULTS: As of May 1, 2010, a total of 1,345,663 MIV, 267,715 LAMV, 2,741,150 TIV, and 157,838 LAIV doses were administered in VSD. No significant associations were noted during sequential analyses for Guillain-Barre syndrome, most other neurologic outcomes, and allergic and cardiac events. For MIV, a statistical signal was observed for Bell's palsy for adults aged <e2><89><a5>25 years on March 31, 2010, using the self-controlled approach. Subsequent analyses revealed no significant temporal cluster. Case-centered logistic regression adjusting for seasonality demonstrated an OR for Bell's palsy of 1.26 (95% CI=0.97, 1.63). CONCLUSIONS: No major safety problems following H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccines were detected in the 2009-2010 season in weekly sequential analyses.

However, many previous PM(2.5) exposure assessments have practical limitations, due to the assumption that population distribution or air pollution levels are spatially stationary and temporally constant and people move within regions of generally the same air quality throughout a day or other time periods. To deal with this challenge, we propose a novel method to achieve the real-time estimation of population exposure to PM(2.5) in China by integrating mobile-phone locating-request (MPL) big data and station-based PM(2.5) observations. Nationwide experiments show that the proposed method can yield the estimation of population exposure to PM(2.5) concentrations and cumulative inhaled PM(2.5) masses with a 3-h updating frequency. Compared with the census-based method, it introduced the dynamics of population distribution into the exposure estimation, thereby providing an improved way to better assess the population exposure to PM(2.5) at different temporal scales. Additionally, the proposed method and dataset can be easily extended to estimate other ambient pollutant exposures such as PM(10), O<e2><82><83>, SO<e2><82><82>, and NO<e2><82><82>, and may hold potential utilities in supporting the environmental exposure assessment and related policy-driven environmental actions.",2018,10.3390/ijerph15040573,15,4,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and *Cell Phone and Data Collection/*methods and Environmental Monitoring/*methods and Particulate Matter/*analysis and China/epidemiology and mobile phone data and human mobility and Air Pollutants/*analysis and air pollution exposure and Air Pollution/*analysis/*statistics & numerical data and dynamic assessment and Environmental Exposure/analysis,NA,NA,2018/03/23/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper discusses the limitations of traditional residence-based approaches in examining the association between socioeconomic or racial/ethnic segregation and unequal environmental exposure in environmental justice research. It emphasizes that future research needs to go beyond residential segregation by considering the full spectrum of segregation experienced by people in various geographic and temporal contexts of everyday life. Along with this comprehensive understanding of segregation, the paper also highlights the importance of assessing environmental exposure at a high spatiotemporal resolution in environmental justice research. The successful integration of a comprehensive concept of segregation, high-resolution data and fine-grained spatiotemporal approaches to assessing segregation and environmental exposure would provide more nuanced and robust findings on the associations between segregation and disparities in environmental exposure and their health impacts.

Huang_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Evaluating the Investment Projects of Spinal Medical Device Firms Using the Real Option and DANP-mV Based MCDM Methods,"Huang, Chi-Yo and Hsieh, Hong-Ling and Chen, Hueiling",International journal of environmental research and public health,"In an era of global aging, spinal and other joint degeneration issues have become a major problem for many elders. Bone-related operations have become the largest percentage of surgeries, accounting for 40% of the top 10 operations in the United States. Further, these spine-related operations are now ranked second among all bone-related operations. Due to this enormous and daily increasing market demand, more and more firms have started to pay closer attention to related medical devices and products. The global venture capitalists (VCs) have also started to follow the mega trend and will continue to invest heavily in this industry. Although most VCs recognize that investing in firms that produce innovative spinal products or devices is a must, very few practical managers or research scholars have defined the appropriate evaluation methods for these firms to use. The traditional net present value (NPV) method, which does not consider operation flexibility and changes in strategy, is far from the reality. The real option method can reveal the vagueness and flexibilities of the values being embedded in the investment projects at spinal medical device firms. However, the real option method is strictly quantitative. Usually, the evaluation aspects contain qualitative factors or local criteria which are hard to quantify in monetary terms. Thus, the adoption of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods that can manipulate both quantitative and qualitative factors will be very helpful in evaluating and selecting investment cases like the spinal medical device firms, where both quantitative and qualitative factors should be considered. An analytical framework that consists of hybrid MCDM methods and the real option method will thus be very useful to evaluate the newly established firms producing spinal medical devices. Therefore, the authors propose a real option valuation as well as the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based analytic network process (DANP) and the modified VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method (DANP-mV) based MCDM framework for evaluating the investment projects offered by these firms of spinal medical devices. An empirical study based on three newly established spinal medical device companies specializing in vertebral compression fracture (VCF) surgical devices was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analytical framework.

Recent developments in the fields of systems biology, innovative breakthroughs in biomedical research encompassing the ""-omics"" fields, and advances in mobile sensing, peer-to-peer networks and big data, provide tools that future clinicians can use to assess environmental chemical exposures in their patients. There is also a need for concerted action at all levels, including actions by individual patients, clinicians, medical educators, regulators, government and non-government organisations, corporations and the wider civil society, to understand the ""exposome"" and minimise the extent of toxic exposures on current and future generations.

This study sought to engage patients outside the clinical setting to better understand how they approach cancer screening decisions, including their primary concerns and their preferences for finalizing their decision. METHODS: Twelve primary care practices offering patients an online personal health record invited eligible patients to complete a 17-item online interactive module. Among 11,458 registered users, invitations to complete the module were sent to adults aged 50-74 years who were overdue for colorectal cancer screening and to women aged 40-49 years and men aged 55-69 who had not undergone a recent mammogram or prostate-specific antigen test, respectively. RESULTS: The module was started by 2,355 patients and completed by 903 patients. Most respondents (76.8%) knew they were eligible for screening. Preferred next steps were talking to the clinician (76.6%), reading/research (28.6%), and consulting trusted friends/family (16.4%). Priority topics included how much screening improves life expectancy, comparative test performance, and the prevalence/health risks of the cancer. Leading fears were getting cancer/delayed detection (79.2%), abnormal results (40.5%), and testing complications (39.1%), the last referring to false test results, medical complications, or unnecessary treatments. Men eligible for prostate-specific antigen screening were more likely than women eligible for mammography to express concerns about testing complications and to prioritize weighing pros and cons over gut feelings (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although this sample was predisposed to screening, most patients wanted help in finalizing their decision. Many wanted to weigh the pros and cons and expressed fears of potential harms from screening.

We developed an open-source software for spatial epidemiological analysis and demonstrated its applicability and quality. METHODS: Based on standardized geocode and observational health data, the Application of Epidemiological Geographic Information System (AEGIS) provides two spatial analysis methods: disease mapping and detecting clustered medical conditions and outcomes. The AEGIS assesses the geographical distribution of incidences and health outcomes in Korea and the United States, specifically incidence of cancers and their mortality rates, endemic malarial areas, and heart diseases (only the United States). RESULTS: The AEGIS-generated spatial distribution of incident cancer in Korea was consistent with previous reports. The incidence of liver cancer in women with the highest Moran's I (0.44; p < 0.001) was 17.4 (10.3-26.9). The malarial endemic cluster was identified in Paju-si, Korea (p < 0.001). When the AEGIS was applied to the database of the United States, a heart disease cluster was appropriately identified (p < 0.001).

The study aim is to compare preferences on timing for advance care planning initiatives and life-sustaining treatment withdrawal between terminally-ill cancer patients and their family caregivers in Taiwan. Methods: A prospective study using questionnaire survey was conducted with both terminally-ill cancer patient and their family caregiver dyads independently in inpatient and outpatient palliative care settings in a tertiary hospital in Northern Taiwan. Self-reported questionnaire using clinical scenario of incurable lung cancer was employed. Descriptive analysis was used for data analysis. Results: Fifty-four patients and family dyads were recruited from 1 August 2019 to 15 January 2020. Nearly 80% of patients and caregivers agreed that advance care planning should be conducted when the patient was at a non-frail stage of disease. Patients' frail stage of disease was considered the indicator for life-sustaining treatments withdrawal except for nutrition and fluid supplements, antibiotics or blood transfusions. Patient dyads considered that advance care planning discussions were meaningful without arousing emotional distress. Conclusion: Patient dyads' preferences on the timing of initiating advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments withdrawal were found to be consistent.

If such factors impact on the period of decision making, they should be considered as triggers. Yet, there is no empirical support available.The aim was to investigate whether recent exposure to work-related psychosocial events can trigger the decision to report sick when ill. METHODS: A case-crossover design was applied to 546 sick-leave spells, extracted from a Swedish cohort of 1430 employees with a 3-12 month follow-up of new sick-leave spells. Exposure in a case period corresponding to an induction period of one or two days was compared with exposure during control periods sampled from workdays during a two-week period prior to sick leave for the same individual. This was done according to the matched-pair interval and the usual frequency approaches. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Most sick-leave spells happened in relation to acute, minor illnesses that substantially reduced work ability. The risk of taking sick leave was increased when individuals had recently been exposed to problems in their relationship with a superior (OR 3.63; CI 1.44-9.14) or colleagues (OR 4.68; CI 1.43-15.29). Individuals were also more inclined to report sick on days when they expected a very stressful work situation than on a day when they were not under such stress (OR 2.27; CI 1.40-3.70).

However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people's holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method.

At the same time the number of health care interventions using mobile phones (mHealth interventions) is growing rapidly. We review studies assessing the health-related impacts of mHealth on NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). METHODS: A systematic literature search of three major databases was performed in order to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions. Identified studies were reviewed concerning key characteristics of the trial and the intervention; and the relationship between intervention characteristics and outcomes was qualitatively assessed. RESULTS: The search algorithms retrieved 994 titles. 8 RCTs were included in the review, including a total of 4375 participants. Trials took place mostly in urban areas, tested different interventions (ranging from health promotion over appointment reminders and medication adjustments to clinical decision support systems), and included patients with different diseases (diabetes, asthma, hypertension). Except for one study all showed rather positive effects of mHealth interventions on reported outcome measures. Furthermore, our results suggest that particular types of mHealth interventions that were found to have positive effects on patients with communicable diseases and for improving maternal care are likely to be effective also for NCDs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite rather positive results of included RCTs, a firm conclusion about the effectiveness of mHealth interventions against NCDs is not yet possible because of the limited number of studies, the heterogeneity of evaluated mHealth interventions and the wide variety of reported outcome measures.

The human population subject to seasonal variability in these four diseases activity referred as ""severe seasonal sensitive population"". In India, the estimated burden of these four seasonal diseases is more than 350 million as on the year 2018. It is a growing crisis for India with a projected disease burden of 500 million in the year 2025. This study was aimed to decipher the genuine SCLD seasonal trends in the entire Indian population using GT and validate these trends in Indian climatic zones. METHODS: GT is used to study the temporal trends in web search using weekly Relative Search Volume (RSV) for the period 2004 to 2017. The relative search volume (RSV) of the four-severe seasonal comorbid diseases namely Asthma, Hypertension, Obesity and Fibrosis were collected with and without obesity as the reference. The RSV were collected using the GT selection options as (i) Whole India (ii) Jammu and Kashmir (Cold zone) (iii) Rajasthan (Hot and Dry zone) (iii) West Bengal (Hot and Humid zone) and (iv) Uttar Pradesh state (Composite zone). The time series analysis was carried out to find seasonal patterns, comorbidity, trends and periodicity in the entire India and four of its states (zones). RESULTS: Our analysis of entire India (2004-2017) revealed high significant seasonal patterns and comorbidity in all the four diseases of SCLD. The positive tau values indicated strong positive seasonal trends in the SCLD throughout the period (Table). The auto correlation analysis revealed that these diseases were subjected to 3, 4 and 6 months period seasonal variations. Similar seasonal patterns and trends were also observed in all the four Indian temperature zones. Overall study indicated that SCLD seasonal search patterns and trends are highly conserved in India even in drastic Indian climatic zones. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome arise out of these observations could be of immense significance in handling the major chronic life style diseases asthma, hypertension, obesity and fibrosis. The possible strong comorbid relationship among asthma, hypertension, obesity and fibrosis may be useful to segregate Indian seasonal sensitive population. In disease activity-based chronotherapy, the search interest of segment of the population with access to Internet may be used as an indicator for public health sectors in the early detection of SCLD from a specific country or a region.

De-identified PenCAT and Communicare Systems data were extracted from the services allocated to the intervention arm of a diabetes care trial, and intra-class correlations for each extracted item were derived at a service level. Strong to very strong correlations between the two data sources were found regarding the total number of patients with diabetes per service (Intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.99), as well as the number (ICC = 0.98-0.99) and proportion (ICC = 0.96) of patients with diabetes by gender. The correlation was moderate for the number and proportion of Type 2 diabetes patients per service in the group aged 18-34 years (ICC = 0.65 and 0.8-0.82 respectively). Strong to very strong correlations were found for numbers and proportions of patients being tested for diabetes, and for appropriate monitoring of patients known to have diabetes (ICC = 0.998-1.00).

An extensive body of safety research has accumulated on this topic. This article presents an analysis of this research domain. Two bibliometric visualization tools are applied: VOSviewer and HistCite. Samples of 618 slip and fall related articles are obtained from the Web of Science database. Networks of institutions, authors, terms, and chronological citation relationships are established. Collaboration and research activities of the slip and fall research community show that most contributors are from the United States, with the (now closed) Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety the most influential research organization. The results of a term clustering analysis show that the slip and fall research can be grouped into three sub-domains: epidemiology, gait/biomechanics, and tribology. Of these, early research focused mainly on tribology, whereas research on gait/biomechanics and epidemiological studies are relatively more recent. Psychological aspects of slip and fall incident occurrence represent a relatively under-investigated research topic, in which future contributions may provide new insights and safety improvements.

A. and Dembski, Sofia and Ghosh, Manosij and Barisic, Ivan and Zdzieblo, Daniela and Vanoirbeek, Jeroen and Schwabl, Philipp and Neuhaus, Winfried",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The exposure of humans to nano-and microplastic particles (NMPs) is an issue recognized as a potential health hazard by scientists, authorities, politics, non-governmental organizations and the general public. The concentration of NMPs in the environment is increasing concomitantly with global plastic production and the usage of plastic materials. NMPs are detectable in numerous aquatic organisms and also in human samples, therefore necessitating a risk assessment of NMPs for human health. So far, a comprehensive risk assessment of NMPs is hampered by limited availability of appropriate reference materials, analytical obstacles and a lack of definitions and standardized study designs. Most studies conducted so far used polystyrene (PS) spheres as a matter of availability, although this polymer type accounts for only about 7% of total plastic production. Differently sized particles, different concentration and incubation times, and various biological models have been used, yielding hardly comparable data sets. Crucial physico-chemical properties of NMPs such as surface (charge, polarity, chemical reactivity), supplemented additives and adsorbed chemicals have been widely excluded from studies, although in particular the surface of NMPs determines the interaction with cellular membranes. In this manuscript we give an overview about the critical parameters which should be considered when performing risk assessments of NMPs, including novel reference materials, taking into account surface modifications (e.g., reflecting weathering processes), and the possible role of NMPs as a substrate and/or carrier for (pathogenic) microbes. Moreover, we make suggestions for biological model systems to evaluate immediate toxicity, long-term effects and the potential of NMPs to cross biological barriers. We are convinced that standardized reference materials and experimental parameters along with technical innovations in (nano)-particle sampling and analytics are a prerequisite for the successful realization of conclusive human health risk assessments of NMPs.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17238832,17,23,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and toxicity and *Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis and microplastics and *Plastics/toxicity and Aquatic Organisms and biofilm and biological barriers and human exposure and microbe carrier and microparticles and Microplastics and nanoparticles and Nanoparticles/analysis and nanoplastics and neurotoxicity and Polystyrenes",NA,NA,2020/11/27/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hunter_2012_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Public health management of antiviral drugs during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic: a survey of local health departments in California,"Hunter, Jennifer C. and Rodriguez, Daniela C. and Aragon, Tomas J.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The large-scale deployment of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile during the 2009 H1N1 influenza response provides a unique opportunity to study local public health implementation of the medical countermeasure dispensing capability in a prolonged event of national significance. This study aims to describe the range of methods used by local health departments (LHDs) in California to manage antiviral activities and to gain a better understanding of the related challenges experienced by health departments and their community partners. METHODS: This research employed a mixed-methods approach. First, a multi-disciplinary focus group of pandemic influenza planners from key stakeholder groups in California was convened in order to generate ideas and identify critical themes related to the local implementation of antiviral activities during the H1N1 influenza response. These qualitative data informed the development of a web-based survey, which was distributed to all 61 LHDs in California for the purpose of assessing the experiences of a representative sample of local health agencies in a large region. RESULTS: Forty-four LHDs participated in this study, representing 72% of the local public health agencies in California. While most communities dispensed a modest number of publicly purchased antivirals, LHDs nevertheless drew on their previous work and engaged in a number of antiviral activities, including: acquiring, allocating, distributing, dispensing, tracking, developing guidance, and communicating to the public and clinical community. LHDs also identified specific antiviral challenges presented by the H1N1 pandemic, including: reconciling multiple sources and versions of antiviral guidance, determining appropriate uses and recipients of publicly purchased antivirals, and staffing shortages. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic presented an unusual opportunity to learn about the role of local public health in the management of antiviral response activities during a real public health emergency. Results of this study offer an important descriptive account of LHD management of publicly purchased antivirals, and provide practitioners, policy makers, and academics with a practice-based assessment of these events. The issues raised and the challenges faced by LHDs should be leveraged to inform public health planning for future pandemics and other emergency events that require medical countermeasure dispensing activities.",2012,10.1186/1471-2458-12-82,12,NA,82,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Adult and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Health Care Surveys and Focus Groups and Decision Making, Organizational and Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control and Health Workforce and *Public Health Administration and California/epidemiology and *Local Government and *Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/isolation & purification and Antiviral Agents/economics/*supply & distribution/therapeutic use and Drug Costs/statistics & numerical data and Influenza, Human/drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2012/01/25/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pan_2012_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Acceptability of early infant male circumcision among Chinese parents: strategy implications of HIV prevention for China,"Pan, Lianjun and Zhang, Aixia and Shen, Rong and Wang, Zhong",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has confirmed that circumcision can be performed as a preventive strategy for HIV and early infant male circumcision (EIMC) is regarded to be safer than circumcision in adulthood; however, limited data are available in the literature about EIMC in China. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the willingness and attitudes of Chinese parents on newborn male circumcision so as to provide data for exploring the feasibility of implementing EIMC as an HIV prevention strategy in China. METHODS: Simple random sampling was used to draw participants from parents who had a newborn son delivered at Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, which is affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, between March and December 2010. A questionnaire was used to determine general medical knowledge or information about circumcision, attitudes about EIMC, and level of decision-making on circumcision for the newborn son. RESULTS: Data derived from 558 responses were analyzed and the ratio of respondents was 56.3% for fathers and 43.6% for mothers. Of the respondents, 34.4% agreed to circumcise their newborn son, and the level of agreement was 3.25 <c2><b1> 1.17 (range, 1-5 with ""1"" being ""reluctantly agree"" and ""5"" being ""very strongly agree""). The major reason for EIMC was for health (44.8%), followed by doctor's advice (31.2%). The major reason not to agree to EIMC was concern about pain (50.5%), followed by the risk of the procedure (23.5%). CONCLUSION: The willingness and acceptability of EIMC in China is low and the parents of newborn sons are usually not very affirmative when making a decision on such a procedure, suggesting that significant effort will be needed if EIMC is to be implemented as an HIV prevention strategy for China.",2012,10.1186/1471-2458-12-738,12,NA,738,eng,1471-2458,"China and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Feasibility Studies and Infant, Newborn and *Attitude to Health and HIV Infections/*prevention & control and Parents/*psychology and Circumcision, Male/*psychology",NA,NA,2012/09/04/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Waynforth_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Mother-Infant Co-Sleeping and Maternally Reported Infant Breathing Distress in the UK Millennium Cohort,"Waynforth, David",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Mother-infant co-sleeping or bed sharing is discouraged by health organisations due to evidence that it is associated with unexplained sudden infant death. On the other hand, there is evidence that it should theoretically be beneficial for infants. One line of this evidence concerns breathing regulation, which at night is influenced by the rocking movement of the mother's chest as she breathes. Here, the hypothesis that mother-infant co-sleeping will be associated with a lower probability of infant breathing distress is tested in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18,552 infants). Maternal, infant, family, and socio-economic covariates were included in logistic regression analysis, and in a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to make full use of the number of variables available in the birth cohort study data. Results from logistic regression analysis showed that co-sleeping was associated with a reduced risk of breathing difficulties (OR = 0.69, p = 0.027). The Random Forest algorithm placed high importance on socio-economic aspects of infant environment, and indicated that a number of maternal, child, and environmental variables predicted breathing distress. Co-sleeping by itself was not high in the Random Forest variable importance ranking.

Sarikaya_2007_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Avian influenza outbreak in Turkey through health personnel's views: a qualitative study,"Sarikaya, Ozlem and Erbaydar, Tugrul",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza threatens public health worldwide because it is usually associated with severe illness and, consequently, a higher risk of death. During the first months of 2006, Turkey experienced its first human avian influenza epidemic. A total of 21 human cases were identified, 12 of which were confirmed by the National Institute for Medical Research. Nine of the cases, including the four fatal ones, were from the Dogubeyazit-Van region. This study aims to evaluate the efforts at the avian influenza outbreak control in the Van-Dogubeyazit region in 2006 through the experiences of health personnel. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who took active roles during the avian influenza outbreak in East Turkey during the first months of 2006. We gathered information about the initial responses, the progress and management of the outbreak control, and the reactions of the health professionals and the public. The findings of the study are reported according to the topics that appeared through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Following the first suspected avian influenza cases, a Van Crisis Coordination Committee was formed as the coordinating and decision-making body and played an important role in the appropriate timing of decisions. The health and agriculture services could not be well coordinated owing to the lack of integrated planning in preparation for outbreak and of integrated surveillance programs. Traditional poultry practice together with the low socio-economic status of the people and the lack of health care access in the region seemed to be a major risk for animal to animal and animal to human transmission. The strengths and weaknesses of the present health system - primary health care services, national surveillance and notification systems, human resource and management - affected the inter organizational coordination during the outbreak. Open communication between the government and the public played an important part in overcoming difficulties. CONCLUSION: Although there were problems during the avian influenza outbreak in Turkey, the rapid responses of the central and regional health authorities and the performance of the health workers were the key points in controlling the epidemic. The lessons from this outbreak should provide an opportunity for integrating the preparation plans of the health and agricultural organizations, and for revising the surveillance system and enhancing the role of the primary health care services in controlling epidemic disease. Developing successful strategies based on knowledge and experience may play a valuable role in delaying an avian influenza pandemic.",2007,10.1186/1471-2458-7-330,7,NA,330,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Time Factors and Risk Factors and Animals and Program Evaluation and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Agriculture and Decision Making, Organizational and Attitude of Health Personnel and Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control and Population Surveillance/methods and Communicable Disease Control/*organization & administration and *Influenza A virus and Turkey/epidemiology and Zoonoses and *Poultry and Influenza in Birds/*epidemiology/prevention & control/virology and Influenza, Human/*epidemiology/prevention & control/virology",NA,NA,2007/11/15/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The algorithm utilizes an uncertain multiplicative linguistic variable to measure the individual original preference to express the real evaluation information as much as possible. The attribute weight was calculated by maximizing the differences among alternatives. It determined the individual alternatives ranking according to the net flow of each alternative. By solving the 0-1 model with the objective of minimizing the differences between individual ranking, the ultimate group compromise ranking is obtained. Then we took 10 well-known M-medical APPs in Chinese as an example, we summarized service categories provided for users and constructed the assessment system consisting of 8 indexes considering the service quality users are concerned with.

Data were drawn from the first four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health in the United States (N = 6504). Neither paternal nor maternal incarceration had any significant effect on the trajectories of male participants. On the other hand, females who experienced father incarceration were more likely to be in the low-stable versus high-decreasing group (coefficient = -0.721, p < 0.05).

Prades_2011_BMCpubhea,JOUR,"Multidisciplinary cancer care in Spain, or when the function creates the organ: qualitative interview study","Prades, Joan and Borras, Josep M.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The Spanish National Health System recognised multidisciplinary care as a health priority in 2006, when a national strategy for promoting quality in cancer care was first published. This institutional effort is being implemented on a co-operative basis within the context of Spain's decentralised health care system, so a high degree of variability is to be expected. This study was aimed to explore the views of professionals working with multidisciplinary cancer teams and identify which barriers to effective team work should be considered to ensure implementation of health policy. METHODS: Qualitative interview study with semi-structured, one-to-one interviews. Data were examined inductively, using content analysis to generate categories and an explanatory framework. 39 professionals performing their tasks, wholly or in part, in different multidisciplinary cancer teams were interviewed. The breakdown of participants' medical specialisations was as follows: medical oncologists (n = 10); radiation oncologists (n = 8); surgeons (n = 7); pathologists or radiologists (n = 6); oncology nurses (n = 5); and others (n = 3). RESULTS: Teams could be classified into three models of professional co-operation in multidisciplinary cancer care, namely, advisory committee, formal co-adaptation and integrated care process. The following barriers to implementation were posed: existence of different gateways for the same patient profile; variability in development and use of clinical protocols and guidelines; role of the hospital executive board; outcomes assessment; and the recording and documenting of clinical decisions in a multidisciplinary team setting. All these play a key role in the development of cancer teams and their ability to improve quality of care. CONCLUSION: Cancer team development results from an specific adaptation to the hospital environment. Nevertheless, health policy plays an important role in promoting an organisational approach that changes the way in which professionals develop their clinical practice.",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-141,11,NA,141,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Patient Care Team and Decision Making and Models, Organizational and Interviews as Topic and Spain and *Interdisciplinary Communication and National Health Programs and *Oncology Service, Hospital",NA,NA,2011/02/28/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the USA, studies have shown that approval process of high-risk medical devices was often based on insufficiently robust studies, suggesting that evidence prior to marketing may not be adequate. This study aimed to ascertain level of evidence available for IMDs access to reimbursement in France. METHODS: The objective was to examine the scientific evidence used for IMDs assessment by the French National Authority for Health. We collected all public documents summarising supportive clinical data and opinions concerning IMDs issued in 2008. An opinion qualifies the expected benefit (EB) of the IMD assessed as sufficient or insufficient, and if sufficient, the level of improvement of the expected benefit (IEB) on a scale from major (level I) to no improvement (level V). For each opinion, the study with the highest level of evidence of efficacy data, and its design were collected, or, where no studies were available, any other data sources used to establish the opinion. RESULTS: One hundred and two opinions were analysed, with 72 reporting at least one study used for assessment (70.6%). When considering the study with the highest level of evidence: 34 were clinical non-comparative studies (47.2%); 29 were clinical comparative studies of which 25 randomised controlled trials (40.3%); 5 were meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (6.9%); and 4 were systematic literature reviews (5.6%). The opinions were significantly different according to the study design (p < 0.001). The most frequent design for insufficient EB, IEB level V and IEB level IV was a non-comparative study (10/19, 52.6%; 15/24, 62.5%; and 8/15, 53.3%; respectively).

Using four-digit and 16-digit binary patterns, we have developed data analytical procedures to group the 72,684 U.S. census tracts into eight and forty groups respectively. This value-added FARA dataset facilitated the design and production of interactive knowledge visualizations that have a collective purpose of knowledge transfer and specific functions including new insights on food accessibility and obesity rates in the United States. The knowledge visualizations of the binary patterns could serve as an integrated explanation and prediction system to help answer why and what-if questions on food accessibility, nutritional inequality and nutrition therapy for diabetic care at varying geographic units.

The way these medical assessments are performed is largely unclear. The aim of the study was to determine which grounds are used by social insurance physicians (SIPs) in these assessments and to determine if the identification of these grounds can help improve the quality of assessments in social insurance practice. The article describes a focus group study and a questionnaire study with SIPs in four different countries. METHOD: Using focus group discussions of SIPs discussing the same case in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia (N = 29) we determined the arguments and underlying grounds as used by the SIP's. We used a questionnaire study among other SIPs (N = 60) in the same countries to establish a first validation of these grounds. RESULTS: Grounds in the focus groups were comparable between the countries studied. The grounds were also recognized by SIPs who had not participated in the focus groups. SIPs agreed most on grounds with regard to the claimant's health condition, and about the claimant's duty to explore rehabilitation and work resumption, but less on accepting permanent incapacity when all options for treatment were exhausted. CONCLUSION: Grounds that SIPs use refer to a limited group of key elements of disability evaluation. SIPs interpret disability in social insurance according to the handicapped role and strive at making their evaluation fair trials. ICF is relevant with regard to the health condition and to the process of evaluation. Identification of grounds is a valuable instrument for controlling the quality of disability evaluation.

High-throughput genome sequencing of microbial communities in the mammalian gastrointestinal system continues to present diverse protein function information to understand the bacterial determinants that influence obesity development. The goal of the research reported in this article was to identify biological processes in probiotic bacteria that could influence the mechanisms for the extraction of energy from diet in the human gastrointestinal system. Our research strategy of combining bioinformatics and visual analytics methods was based on the identification of operon gene arrangements in genomes of Lactobacillus species and Akkermansiamuciniphila that include at least a gene for a universal stress protein. The two major findings from this research study are related to Lactobacillus plantarum and Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria species which are associated with weight-loss. The first finding is that Lactobacillus plantarum strains have a two-gene operon that encodes a universal stress protein for stress response and the membrane translocator protein (TSPO), known to function in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in humans. The second finding is the presence of a three-gene operon in Akkermansia muciniphila that includes a gene whose human mitochondrial homolog is associated with waist-hip ratio and fat distribution.

The aim of this study was to explore married women's perspectives and attitudes on withdrawal use instead of oral contraceptive (OC) in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. Participants were 50 married women, not currently pregnant, not desiring pregnancy and who had been using withdrawal for contraception. Face-to face interviews were conducted to collect data. Content analysis was performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Four major themes were extracted from the interviews: advantages, disadvantages, barriers for OC use, and husband-related factors. Advantages of withdrawal use were identified as: easy to use, convenient, ease of access, natural. Even those participants who had experienced unwanted pregnancy while using withdrawal, relied on withdrawal as their contraceptive method. Disadvantages of OC included concerns about side effects. Barriers related to use of OC included the need for medical advice, vaginal examination and daily use. Husband-related factors included: the husband wanted to be the primary decision maker on the number of children and that he preferred withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Health providers should address misunderstandings that exist about OC and highlight the non-contraceptive health benefits of OC to balance the information provided for women.

Porreca_2020_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Using text mining and sentiment analysis to analyse YouTube Italian videos concerning vaccination,"Porreca, Annamaria and Scozzari, Francesca and Di Nicola, Marta",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Recently, social networks have become a popular source of information on health topics. Particularly, in Italy, there is a lively discussion on the web regarding vaccines also because there is low vaccination coverage, vaccines hesitancy, and anti-vaccine movements. For these reasons, in 2017, Institutions have introduced a law to force children to make ten compulsory vaccines for school attendance and proposed a vaccination campaign. On social networks, this law has fostered a fierce discussion between pro-vaccinations and anti-vaccinations people. This paper aims to understand if and how the population's opinion has changed before the law and after the vaccination campaign using the titles of the videos uploaded on Youtube in these periods. METHOD: Using co-occurrence network (CON) and sentiment analysis, we analysed the topics of YouTube Italian videos on vaccines in 2017 and 2018. RESULTS: The CON confirms that vaccinations were very disapproved before the law. Instead, after the communication campaign, people start to be less critical. The sentiment analysis shows that the intense vaccination campaign also promoted by medical doctors pushed the sentiment to change polarity from a prevailing negative opinion in 2017 (52% negative) to a positive one in 2018 (54% positive). CONCLUSION: At the population level, the potential misinformation of social networks could be significant and is a real risk for health. Our study highlights that vaccination campaigns on social networks could be an essential instrument of health policies and a sharp weapon to fight ignorance and misrepresentations of non-qualified people influencing individuals' decision-making.",2020,10.1186/s12889-020-8342-4,20,1,259,eng,1471-2458,Humans and Child and Sentiment analysis and Data Mining and Italy and *Social Media and *Health Communication and *Attitude to Health and Immunization Programs and YouTube and Vaccinations and No-vax and Pro-vax and Schools/legislation & jurisprudence and Vaccination/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology and Videotape Recording/*statistics & numerical data,NA,NA,2020/02/19/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This statistical disparity is normally positioned an objective, ontological and undeniable social fact, a fact best explained as a function of endemic community disadvantage and disenfranchisement. This research explores the possibility that higher-than-normal Aboriginal suicide rates may also be a function of coronial decision-making practices. Based upon in-depth interviews with 32 coroners from across Australia, the following conclusions emerged from the data. First, coroners have differing perceptions of Indigenous capacity, and are less likely to have concerns about intent when the suicide is committed by an Indigenous person. Second, coroners have identified divergent scripts of Indigenous suicide, particularly its spontaneity and public location, and this supports rather than challenges, a finding of suicide. Third, the coronial perception of Indigenous life is a factor which influences a suicide determination for Indigenous deaths. Finally, the low level of Indigenous engagement with the coronial system, and the unlikelihood of a challenge to the finding of suicide by Indigenous families, means that a coronial determination of suicide is more likely.",2018,10.3390/ijerph15040765,15,4,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,mental health and Humans and Female and Male and Australia and suicide and *Coroners and Medical Examiners and *Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and aboriginal Australian and coroner and indigenous suicide and legal decision making and Suicide/*ethnology and youth suicide,NA,NA,2018/04/16/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in the process of emergency logistics activities, risks may arise due to scheduling problems or insufficient supply of warehouse stocks, resulting in an insufficient rescue capacity. In addition, the risk of emergency logistics is random and may exist in a certain link or throughout the whole rescue process of emergency logistics. Consequently, the disaster site may be invaded by sudden disaster risk due to the lack of necessary material supplies. The entire emergency logistics system may be destroyed and cause even greater losses as well. Based on this phenomenon, this paper introduces reliability factors of materials and combines the complex network theory to build an emergency logistics network and analyze the emergency logistics risk propagation mechanism. This paper firstly builds an emergency logistics network based on complex network theory. Then, it combines the improved epidemic model to analyze the influencing factors of risk propagation in the emergency logistics network.

As of 4 June 2020, more than 1.8 million confirmed cases and over 108 thousand deaths have been reported in this country. Few studies have examined nationwide modeling of COVID-19 incidence in the United States particularly using machine-learning algorithms. Thus, we collected and prepared a database of 57 candidate explanatory variables to examine the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network in predicting the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates across the continental United States. Our results indicated that a single-hidden-layer MLP could explain almost 65% of the correlation with ground truth for the holdout samples. Sensitivity analysis conducted on this model showed that the age-adjusted mortality rates of ischemic heart disease, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia, together with two socioeconomic and environmental factors (median household income and total precipitation), are among the most substantial factors for predicting COVID-19 incidence rates. Moreover, results of the logistic regression model indicated that these variables could explain the presence/absence of the hotspots of disease incidence that were identified by Getis-Ord Gi* (p < 0.05) in a geographic information system environment.

The health status utility values were calculated through a hybrid methodology. We combined the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the AHP with a D-number extended fuzzy preference relation (D-AHP), the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP), and the technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) to obtain individual and aggregated utility values. The preference data were elicited using a sample of individuals from a Colombian university. In all tested methods, the ordinal preferences were consistent, and the weights were compared using the Euclidean distance criterion (EDC). We identified F-AHP-TOPSIS as the optimal method; its benefits were associated with modeling the response options of the EQ-5D in linguistic terms, it gave the best approximation to the initial preferences according to EDC, and it could be used as an alternative to the known prioritization method.

To overcome this, several countries have introduced an opt-out donor consent system. This system, soon planned for Scotland and England means individuals are automatically deemed to consent for organ donation unless they register an opt-out decision. This study was designed to explore the reasons underpinning donor choices for people who plan to actively opt-in to the register, take no action and be on the register via deemed consent, opt-out, and those who are unsure of their decision. METHODS: This study reports the analysis of free-text responses obtained from a large survey of intentions towards opt-out legislation in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland (n = 1202). Of the n = 1202 participants who completed the questionnaire, n = 923 provided a free text response explaining their views. Thematic analysis was used to explore the reasons why participants plan to: opt-in (n = 646), follow deemed consent (n = 205), opt-out (n = 32) and those who were not sure (n = 40). RESULTS: A key theme for people planning to opt-in is that it ensures one's donor choice is explicitly clear and unequivocal. Some regarded deemed consent as unclear and open to ambiguity, thus actively opting-in was viewed as a way of protecting against family uncertainty and interference. For the deemed consent group, a key theme is that it represents a simple effortless choice. This is important from both a pragmatic time-saving point of view and because it protects ambivalent participants from making a challenging emotive choice about organ donation. Key themes for those planning to opt-out relate to fears around medical mistrust and bodily integrity. Notably, both participants who plan to opt-out and opt-in perceived presumed consent as ""authoritarian"" and a method of increasing Government control of organs. In response, registering an active decision protected their freedom of choice. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of registering deliberate active consent for people who choose opt-in, due to concerns over possible family refusal under deemed consent. These findings could inform the development of communication campaigns that encourage family communication before the implementation of opt-out legislation.",2019,10.1186/s12889-019-7774-1,19,1,1463,eng,1471-2458,Uncertainty and England and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Qualitative Research and Scotland and Tissue Donors/*psychology and Organ donation and Trust/*psychology and Qualitative study and Northern Ireland and Bodily integrity and Family refusal and Medical mistrust and Opt-out consent and Presumed Consent/*legislation & jurisprudence and Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2019/11/06/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

In many low-income settings, such data are unavailable or outdated. Using an electronic medical records system, we determined the association between nutritional status and severe illness and mortality among young children presenting to a rural primary health care facility in the Gambia. METHODS: Clinical data collected over five years (2010-2014) on children aged under 60 months making acute visits to a primary health care clinic in the rural Gambian district of Kiang West were retrospectively extracted from the medical records system. Generalised estimating equation models were used to investigate associations between nutritional status and illness severity, accounting for repeat visits, gender, age and access to transport to the clinic. The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) was used to determine the proportion of severe illness likely attributable to different grades of malnutrition. RESULTS: 3839/5021 (77%) children under 60 months of age living in Kiang West presented acutely to the clinic at least once, yielding 21,278 visits (47% girls, median age 20.2 months (Interquartile Range (IQR) 23.92 months)) and 26,001 diagnoses, 86% being infectious diseases.

This study aimed to assess the effect of a community-based hypertension intervention intended to enhance patient adherence to prescribed medications. This study applied a non-equivalent control group design using the Korean National Health Insurance Big Data. Hongcheon County has been continuously implementing the intervention program since 2012. This study involved a cohort of patients with hypertension aged >65 and <85 years, among residents who lived in the study area for five years (between 2010 and 2014). The final number of subjects was 2685 in both the intervention and control region. The indirect indicators were analyzed as patients' adherence and level of continuous treatment using the difference-in-difference regression. The proportion of hypertensive patients who continuously received insurance benefits for >240 days in 2014 was 81.0% in the intervention region and 79.7% in the control region.

This paper specifies the forms of support expected by women considering termination from their family, people in their surroundings and professional medical personnel. Methods: Between June 2014 and May 2016 patients eligible to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons were asked to complete an anonymous survey consisting of sixty questions to determine patient profile and forms of support expected from the society, family and professional medical personnel as well as to assess informational support provided. Results: Women do not take into consideration society's opinion on pregnancy termination (95%). The majority of the respondents think that financial support from the state is not sufficient to provide for sick children (81%). Despite claiming to have a medium standard of life (75%), nearly half of the respondents (45%) say that they do not have the financial resources to take care of a sick child. The women have informed their partner (97%) and closest family members (82%) and a low percentage have informed friends (32%). Nearly one third (31%) have not talked to the attending gynecologist about their decision. Conclusions: The decision to terminate a pregnancy is made by mature women with a stable life situation-supported by their partner and close family. They do not expect systemic support, as they believe it is marginal, and only seek emotional support from their closest family.

The WHO declared this as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31th of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As of March 24th, 2020, the virus has caused a casualty of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different stakeholder's participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce the impact of fake news in this information age and social media.

The Morehouse Choice Accountable Care Organization and Education System (MCACO-ES), or (M-ACO) is a physician led integrated delivery model participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) offered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center. The MSSP establishes incentivized, performance-based payment models for qualifying health care organizations serving traditional Medicare beneficiaries that promote collaborative efficiency models designed to mitigate fragmented and insufficient access to health care, reduce unnecessary cost, and improve clinical outcomes. The M-ACO integration model is administered through participant organizations that include a multi-site community based academic practice, independent physician practices, and federally qualified health center systems (FQHCs). This manuscript aims to present a descriptive and exploratory assessment of health care programs and related innovation methods that validate M-ACO as a reliable simulator to implement, evaluate, and refine M-ACO's integration model to render value-based performance outcomes over time.

Compared with conventional atmospheric dispersion models, machine leaning (ML) models have both high accuracy and efficiency in terms of prediction, especially in field cases. However, selection of model type and the inputs of the ML model are still essential problems. To address this issue, two ML models (i.e., the back propagation (BP) network and support vector regression (SVR) with different input selections (i.e., original monitoring parameters and integrated Gaussian parameters) are proposed in this paper. To compare the performances of presented ML models in field cases, these models are evaluated using the Prairie Grass and Indianapolis field data sets. The influence of the training set scale on the performances of ML models is analyzed as well. Results demonstrate that the integrated Gaussian parameters indeed improve the prediction accuracy in the Prairie Grass case. However, they do not make much difference in the Indianapolis case due to their inadaptability to the complex terrain conditions. In addition, it can be summarized that the SVR shows better generalization ability with relatively small training sets, but tends to under-fit the training data. In contrast, the BP network has a stronger fitting ability, but sometimes suffers from an over-fitting problem. As a result, the model and input selection presented in this paper will be of great help to environmental and public health protection in real applications.",2018,10.3390/ijerph15071450,15,7,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Support Vector Machine and Normal Distribution and Hazardous Substances and *Machine Learning and *Models, Theoretical and *Chemical Hazard Release and back propagation network and field case and Gases and hazardous gas dispersion prediction and input selection and support vector regression",NA,NA,2018/07/10/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both MaxEnt and RF technique results reveal robust predictive power with test The area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) of above 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. Spatial prediction reveals that environmentally suitable areas of scrub typhus are widely distributed across the country particularly in the low-land Tarai and less elevated river valleys. We found that areas close to agricultural land with gentle slopes have higher suitability of scrub typhus occurrence. Despite several speculations on the association between scrub typhus and proximity to earthquake epicenters, we did not find a significant role of proximity to earthquake epicenters in the distribution of scrub typhus in Nepal. About 43% of the population living in highly suitable areas for scrub typhus are at higher risk of infection, followed by 29% living in suitable areas of moderate-risk, and about 22% living in moderately suitable areas of lower risk.

This article presents the protocol drafted for the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, and outlines how the main aims and challenges of the study (i.e. making reliable incidence estimates of end-of-life decisions, even rare ones, and describing their characteristics; allowing comparability with past ELD studies; guaranteeing strict anonymity given the sensitive nature of the research topic; and attaining a sufficient response rate) are addressed in a post-mortem survey using a representative sample of death certificates. STUDY DESIGN: Reliable incidence estimates are achievable by using large at random samples of death certificates of deceased persons in Flanders (aged one year or older). This entails the cooperation of the appropriate administrative authorities. To further ensure the reliability of the estimates and descriptions, especially of less prevalent end-of-life decisions (e.g. euthanasia), a stratified sample is drawn. A questionnaire is sent out to the certifying physician of each death sampled. The questionnaire, tested thoroughly and avoiding emotionally charged terms is based largely on questions that have been validated in previous national and European ELD studies. Anonymity of both patient and physician is guaranteed through a rigorous procedure, involving a lawyer as intermediary between responding physicians and researchers. To increase response we follow the Total Design Method (TDM) with a maximum of three follow-up mailings. Also, a non-response survey is conducted to gain insight into the reasons for lack of response. DISCUSSION: The protocol of the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, is appropriate for achieving the objectives of the study; as past studies in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other European countries have shown, strictly anonymous and thorough surveys among physicians using a large, stratified, and representative death certificate sample are most suitable in nationwide studies of incidence and characteristics of end-of-life decisions.

It has been shown that awareness of the protective effect of male circumcision leads to high acceptability towards the introduction of medical male circumcision services within countries. The objective of this survey was to identify factors determining awareness of male circumcision for HIV prevention. METHODS: We interviewed 452 participants (267 adults >24 years of age; 185 youths 14-24 years) living in three rural Ugandan districts in 2008. Using a standardized questionnaire, we assessed socio-demographic parameters, awareness of MC for HIV prevention, general beliefs/attitudes regarding MC and MC status. Determinants for awareness of MC for HIV prevention were examined with multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: Out of all adults, 52.1% were male (mean +/- SD age 39.8 +/- 11 years), of whom 39.1% reported to be circumcised. Out of all youths, 58.4% were male (18.4 +/- 2.5), 35.0% circumcised.Adults were more aware of MC for HIV prevention than youths (87.1% vs. 76.5%; p = 0.004). In adults, awareness was increased with higher educational level compared to no school: primary school (adjusted OR 9.32; 95%CI 1.80-48.11), secondary (5.04; 1.01-25.25), tertiary (9.91; 0.76-129.18), university education (8.03; 0.59-109.95). Younger age and male sex were further significant determinants of increased awareness, but not marital status, religion, district, ethnicity, employment status, and circumcision status. In youths, we found a borderline statistically significant decrease of awareness of MC for HIV prevention with higher educational level, but not with any other socio-demographic factors.

Nadine and MacMillan, Harriet L.",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence against women (IPV) has been identified as a serious public health problem. Although the health care system is an important site for identification and intervention, there have been challenges in determining how health care professionals can best address this issue in practice. We surveyed nurses and physicians in 2004 regarding their attitudes and behaviours with respect to IPV, including whether they routinely inquire about IPV, as well as potentially relevant barriers, facilitators, experiential, and practice-related factors. METHODS: A modified Dillman Tailored Design approach was used to survey 1000 nurses and 1000 physicians by mail in Ontario, Canada. Respondents were randomly selected from professional directories and represented practice areas pre-identified from the literature as those most likely to care for women at the point of initial IPV disclosure: family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency care, maternal/newborn care, and public health. The survey instrument had a case-based scenario followed by 43 questions asking about behaviours and resources specific to woman abuse. RESULTS: In total, 931 questionnaires were returned; 597 by nurses (59.7% response rate) and 328 by physicians (32.8% response rate). Overall, 32% of nurses and 42% of physicians reported routinely initiating the topic of IPV in practice. Principal components analysis identified eight constructs related to whether routine inquiry was conducted: preparedness, self-confidence, professional supports, abuse inquiry, practitioner consequences of asking, comfort following disclosure, practitioner lack of control, and practice pressures. Each construct was analyzed according to a number of related issues, including clinician training and experience with woman abuse, area of practice, and type of health care provider. Preparedness emerged as a key construct related to whether respondents routinely initiated the topic of IPV. CONCLUSION: The present study provides new insight into the factors that facilitate and impede clinicians' decisions to address the issue of IPV with their female patients. Inadequate preparation, both educational and experiential, emerged as a key barrier to routine inquiry, as did the importance of the ""real world"" pressures associated with the daily context of primary care practice.",2007,10.1186/1471-2458-7-12,7,NA,12,eng,1471-2458,"Communication and Humans and Specialization and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Ontario and Health Care Surveys and Attitude of Health Personnel and Education, Medical and *Physician-Patient Relations and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data and *Nurse-Patient Relations and Battered Women/*psychology and Specialties, Nursing/education and Spouse Abuse/*diagnosis/therapy",NA,NA,2007/01/24/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This analysis sought to examine this belief through the analysis of health ministers' diaries. Entries were downloaded from health ministers' diaries from two states in Australia from January 2013 to June 2018. Entries were coded according to which interest group met with the minister or whether general parliamentary business was undertaken. Coding was also undertaken for any meeting topics related to nutrition policy. Analysis of health ministers' diaries found that the food industry has limited documented interaction with the two state health ministers in Australia. Instead, medical associations, private hospitals and health services, and sporting associations (rugby league associations) had the most interactions with health ministers. Poor representation was seen on nutrition issues, and there was an apparent lack of nutrition advocates interacting with the health ministers. There are opportunities for nutrition advocates to increase their level of interaction with state health ministers. This could include building alliances with medical associations, as they are in a powerful position, to advocate directly to health ministers.

In-depth interviews with 14 core policy elites from four health areas were conducted. As governance is a multidimensional concept, interviewees were asked to evaluate different dimensions based on the World Bank's five elements (Coherent decision-making structures, Consistency and Stability, Stakeholder participation, Supervision and Regulation, and Transparency and Information). Overall, the new payment system was perceived as poorly governed. Since its introduction, it has not offered a new governance perspective because it used a conventional top-down approach, while political windows for cooperation were not wide open. Of the five governance dimensions, the scores were lowest in Stakeholder participation. There was a large perception gap between physicians and government officers here.

Dubowicz_2014_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Functional validity of a judgment skills measure within the concept of health literacy for sleeping disorder patients,"Dubowicz, Arthur and Schulz, Peter J.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"The concept of health literacy has been widened to include higher order aspects such as patient decision-making skills while its measurement continued to rely narrowly on reading and numeracy skills, known as functional health literacy. We developed a Judgment Skills measure, designed to assess patients' ability to make appropriate decisions with regard to their condition. The measure offers scenarios with answer options ranked for biomedical adequacy. This study aims to examine the psychometric properties and the functional validity of the Judgment Skills measure. A self-administered survey among 87 primary insomnia patients in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland was conducted. The extensive path model included variables such as functional health literacy, coping with the medical condition, experience of the scenario, sleep quality, duration suffering, education, and age. Correlation analyses were conducted to link the variables. The Judgment Skills measure showed the expected significant correlations. In general, higher Judgment Skills were related to coping strategies leading to better health outcomes. Functional health literacy correlated highly with education, while Judgment Skills did not, which confirmed the conceptual difference of these skills. The findings propose a model for conducting research that does embrace the broader conceptualization of health literacy.",2014,10.3390/ijerph111010868,11,10,10868-10882,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Psychometrics and Switzerland and *Decision Making and *Self Care and Health Literacy/*methods and *Judgment and Sleep Wake Disorders/*psychology/therapy,NA,NA,2014/10/17/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and air pollution can affect health status and result in increased risk of HDP for women. The major objective of this study was to investigate the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms, air pollution, and their interaction on the risk of HDP by using meta-predictive analytics. We searched various databases comprehensively to access all available studies conducted for various ethnic populations from countries worldwide, from 1997 to 2017. Seventy-one studies with 8064 cases and 13,232 controls for MTHFR C677T and 11 studies with 1425 cases and 1859 controls for MTHFR A1298C were included. MTHFR C677T homozygous TT (risk ratio (RR) = 1.28, p < 0.0001) and CT plus TT (RR = 1.07, p = 0.0002) were the risk genotypes, while wild-type CC played a protective role (RR = 0.94, p = 0.0017) for HDP. The meta-predictive analysis found that the percentage of MTHFR C677T TT plus CT (p = 0.044) and CT (p = 0.043) genotypes in the HDP case group were significantly increased with elevated levels of air pollution worldwide. Additionally, in countries with higher air pollution levels, the pregnant women with wild-type CC MTHFR 677 had a protection effect against HDP (p = 0.014), whereas, the homozygous TT of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was a risk genotype for developing HDP.

Hence, digital information available for patient-oriented decision making has increased drastically but is often scattered across different sites. As as solution, personal health record systems (PHRS) are meant to centralize an individual's health data and to allow access for the owner as well as for authorized health professionals. Yet, expert-oriented language, complex interrelations of medical facts and information overload in general pose major obstacles for patients to understand their own record and to draw adequate conclusions. In this context, recommender systems may supply patients with additional laymen-friendly information helping to better comprehend their health status as represented by their record. However, such systems must be adapted to cope with the specific requirements in the health domain in order to deliver highly relevant information for patients. They are referred to as health recommender systems (HRS). In this article we give an introduction to health recommender systems and explain why they are a useful enhancement to PHR solutions. Basic concepts and scenarios are discussed and a first implementation is presented. In addition, we outline an evaluation approach for such a system, which is supported by medical experts.

In order to identify the factors related to the sustainable care of environment and public health, we have downloaded n = 5873 tweets that used the hashtag #WorldEnvironmentDay on the respective day. As the next step, sentiment analysis with an algorithm developed in Python and trained with data mining was applied to the sample of tweets to group them according to the expressed feelings. Thereafter, a textual analysis was used to group the tweets according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), identifying the key factors about environment and public health that most concern Twitter users. To this end, we used the qualitative analysis software NVivo Pro 12.

To provide an efficient decision support, it is necessary to integrate clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in information systems routinely operated by healthcare professionals, such as hospital information systems (HISs), or by patients deploying their personal health records (PHR). CDSSs should be able to use the semantics and the clinical context of the data imported from other systems and data repositories. A CDSS platform was developed as a set of separate microservices. In this context, we implemented the core components of a CDSS platform, namely its communication services and logical inference components. A fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR)-based CDSS platform addresses the ease of access to clinical decision support services by providing standard-based interfaces and workflows. This type of CDSS may be able to improve the quality of care for doctors who are using HIS without CDSS features. The HL7 FHIR interoperability standards provide a platform usable by all HISs that are FHIR enabled.

We examined the degree to which individuals scored as ""adequate"" HL on the S-TOFHLA would be considered as having low HL by two additional numerical measures. METHODS: English-speaking adults aged 45-75 years were recruited from a large, urban academic medical center and a community foodbank in the United States. Participants completed the S-TOFHLA, the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), and the Graphical Literacy Measure (GL), an objective measure of a person's ability to interpret numeric information presented graphically. Established cut-points or a median split classified participants and having high and low numeracy. RESULTS: Participants (n = 187), on average were: aged 58 years; 63% female; 70% Black/African American; and 45% had a high school degree or less. Of those who scored ""adequate"" on the S-TOFHLA, 50% scored low on the SNS and 40% scored low on GL. Correlation between the S-TOFHLA and the SNS Total was moderate (r = 0.22, n = 186, p = 0.01), while correlation between the S-TOFHLA and the GL Total was large (r = 0.53, n = 187, p <e2><89><a4> 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the S-TOFHLA may not capture an individuals' HL in the dimension of numeracy. Efforts are needed to develop more encompassing and practical strategies for identifying those with low HL for use in research and clinical practice.

MSM do not frequently receive rectal STI testing because of several barriers, such as not being out (disclosure of sexual behavior). We evaluate whether Chinese MSM select an STI test (rectal vs urethral) appropriate for their sexual behavior (insertive and/or receptive), and the interactions with being out. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a cross sectional MSM survey conducted at a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) (December 2018 to January 2019) around uptake of gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among Chinese MSM (N = 431). We collected socio demographics, relevant medical and sexual history, and disclosure of sexual behavior (outness). We estimated the decision to test and test choice, and the extent to which disclosure plays a role in decision making. RESULTS: Among 431 MSM, mean age was 28 years (SD = 7.10) and 65% were out to someone. MSM who indicated versatile sexual behavior and were out to someone had a 26.8% (95%CI = 6.1, 47.5) increased likelihood for selecting the rectal test vs the ure thral test, compared to those versatile and not out.

Some practices associated with obstetric violence have been routinely standardized and do not include the woman in decision making. This type of violence has consequences for the health of both the mother and the baby and that of the professionals who practice or observed it. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 33 items that measured perception through a Likert scale was developed. Some sociodemographic variables were collected. The instrument was applied to a sample of nursing, medicine and midwifery students to determine its psychometric properties. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 153 students. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (p = 0.918) and Barlett tests (p <e2><89><a4> 0.001) allowed for factor analysis, which explained 54.47% of the variance in two factors called protocolized-visible obstetric violence and non-protocolized-invisible obstetric violence.

The WHO's EDRM Framework was used for reviewing the Belgian Public health emergency preparedness and responses in the context of COVID-19. Information on the measures taken was collected through the literature review including all government's communication, reports, and scientific papers. All epidemic data were extracted from a national open database managed and published by the Sciensano. Additionally, two authors closely followed the Belgian situation since the beginning of the pandemic and updated the data every day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the anti-epidemic strategy was mainly to avoid medical resources exceeding the upper limit. Belgium issued a series of emergency decrees to limit the spread of the virus. An existing structure of ""federal-region-municipal"" as the framework of public health emergency preparedness and response was adapted. The emergency response process in Belgium was divided into four phases: information-evaluation-coordination-decision-making at the region level and the final decision-making at the federal level. Belgium also implemented a phased plan in the process of setting up and lifting the lockdown. However, it was vulnerable in early response, due to the shortage of medical equipment supplies in general, and more particularly for the long term care facilities (LTCFs). Belgium has achieved an intensive cooperation between stakeholders based on an existing multisectoral emergency organization framework. Legislation, medical insurance, and good communication also played a role in limiting the spread of viruses. However, the authorities underestimated the risk of an epidemic and did not take quarantine measures among people suspected affected by SARS-COV-2 in the early stages, resulting in insufficient medical equipment supply and a large number of deaths in the LTCF. The implementation of the lockdown measure in Belgium also encountered obstacles. The lockdown and its exit strategy were both closely related to the pandemic situation and social and economic life. The authorities should strengthen information management, improve the public awareness of the measures, and find out the balance points between the social and economic life and infection control measures.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17217985,17,21,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"SARS-CoV-2 and Public Health and COVID-19 and Humans and Belgium and *Betacoronavirus and Pandemics/*prevention & control and Belgium/epidemiology and Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control and Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*prevention & control and *Quarantine and Civil Defense/*organization & administration and Communicable Disease Control/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data and preparedness and response and public health emergency",NA,NA,2020/10/30/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the fluid intake of urban adults in Wuxi, China, and to identify potential risk factors contributing to IFI. METHODS: Adults were selected from the urban area of Wuxi, China, using a multiple-stage random sampling method. The fluid intake information was obtained with a 24-h self-reported diary over seven consecutive days in both summer and winter of 2015. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was conducted to detect the potential risk factors associated with IFI. CART is a machine-learning algorithm that portions the data into subsets by threshold. RESULTS: A total of 584 adults aged 18-87 years were included. The results showed that the median (P25-P75) values of daily fluid intake of the participants were 1100 (800-1550) mL in summer and 1000 (750-1300) mL in winter. Women had a higher prevalence of IFI than men in both summer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.683, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.830-3.934) and winter (OR = 2.636, 95% CI: 1.677-4.142). The results of CART analysis showed that, in summer, BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (probability: 64.2%) and age < 64 years (probability: 67.4%) were main risk factors of IFI for men, and BMI < 29 kg/m(2) (probability: 81.6%) and living in C Community (probability: 86.7%) were main risk factors for women. In winter, age < 40 years (probability: 81.8%) and BMI < 20 kg/m(2) (probability: 94.5%) were identified as main risk factors of IFI for men and women, respectively.

Ho_2017_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Spatial Variability of Geriatric Depression Risk in a High-Density City: A Data-Driven Socio-Environmental Vulnerability Mapping Approach,"Ho, Hung Chak and Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun and Yu, Ruby and Wang, Dan and Woo, Jean and Kwok, Timothy Chi Yui and Ng, Edward",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Previous studies found a relationship between geriatric depression and social deprivation. However, most studies did not include environmental factors in the statistical models, introducing a bias to estimate geriatric depression risk because the urban environment was found to have significant associations with mental health. We developed a cross-sectional study with a binomial logistic regression to examine the geriatric depression risk of a high-density city based on five social vulnerability factors and four environmental measures. We constructed a socio-environmental vulnerability index by including the significant variables to map the geriatric depression risk in Hong Kong, a high-density city characterized by compact urban environment and high-rise buildings. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the variables were significantly different, indicating that both social and environmental variables should be included as confounding factors. For the comprehensive model controlled by all confounding factors, older adults who were of lower education had the highest geriatric depression risks (OR: 1.60 (1.21, 2.12)). Higher percentage of residential area and greater variation in building height within the neighborhood also contributed to geriatric depression risk in Hong Kong, while average building height had negative association with geriatric depression risk. In addition, the socio-environmental vulnerability index showed that higher scores were associated with higher geriatric depression risk at neighborhood scale. The results of mapping and cross-section model suggested that geriatric depression risk was associated with a compact living environment with low socio-economic conditions in historical urban areas in Hong Kong. In conclusion, our study found a significant difference in geriatric depression risk between unadjusted and adjusted models, suggesting the importance of including environmental factors in estimating geriatric depression risk. We also developed a framework to map geriatric depression risk across a city, which can be used for identifying neighborhoods with higher risk for public health surveillance and sustainable urban planning.",2017,10.3390/ijerph14090994,14,9,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Logistic Models and Risk Factors and Hong Kong/epidemiology and *Residence Characteristics and Spatial Analysis and spatial analytics and urban wellbeing and Depression/*epidemiology/psychology and geriatric depression and high-density living and socio-environmental vulnerability and urban environment,NA,NA,2017/08/31/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

A qualitative interview study and stakeholder workshop engaging public health professionals and researchers,"van der Graaf, Peter and Forrest, Lynne F. and Adams, Jean and Shucksmith, Janet and White, Martin",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: With increasing financial pressures on public health in England, the need for evidence of high relevance to policy is now stronger than ever. However, the ways in which public health professionals (PHPs) and researchers relate to one another are not necessarily conducive to effective knowledge translation. This study explores the perspectives of PHPs and researchers when interacting, with a view to identifying barriers to and opportunities for developing practice that is effectively informed by research. METHODS: This research focused on examples from two responsive research schemes, which provide university-based support for research-related enquiries from PHPs: the NIHR SPHR Public Health Practitioner Evaluation Scheme(1) and the responsive research service AskFuse(2). We examined enquiries that were submitted to both between 2013 and 2015, and purposively selected eight enquiries for further investigation by interviewing the PHPs and researchers involved in these requests. We also identified individuals who were eligible to make requests to the schemes but chose not to do so. In-depth interviews were conducted with six people in relation to the PHPES scheme, and 12 in relation to AskFuse. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic framework analysis. Verification and extension of the findings were sought in a stakeholder workshop. RESULTS: PHPs recognised the importance of research findings for informing their practice. However, they identified three main barriers when trying to engage with researchers: 1) differences in timescales; 2) limited budgets; and 3) difficulties in identifying appropriate researchers. The two responsive schemes addressed some of these barriers, particularly finding the right researchers to work with and securing funding for local evaluations. The schemes also supported the development of new types of evidence. However, other barriers remained, such as differences in timescales and the resources needed to scale-up research. CONCLUSIONS: An increased mutual awareness of the structures and challenges under which PHPs and researchers work is required. Opportunities for frequent and meaningful engagement between PHPs and researchers can help to overcome additional barriers to co-production of evidence. Collaborative models, such as the use of researchers embedded in practice might facilitate this; however, flexible research funding schemes are needed to support these models.",2017,10.1186/s12889-017-4896-1,17,1,892,eng,1471-2458,"Public health and England and Humans and Qualitative research and Qualitative Research and *Public Health and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Interprofessional Relations and Stakeholder Participation and Translational Research, Biomedical/*organization & administration and Research Personnel/*psychology and Translational medical research and (MESH): Decision making and Research personnel",NA,NA,2017/11/22/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has led to the need of assessment of the burden of at-risk population so that prevention measures can be developed. The objective of this study was to assess ten years risk assessment of ASCVD using Astro-CHARM and Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE) in a South Asian sub-population. METHODS: A total of 386 residents of all six districts of Karachi with no ASCVD were enrolled in the study through an exponential non-discriminative referral snowball sampling technique. The inclusion criteria consisted of age 40 years or above and either gender. Study participants were enrolled after obtaining informed written consent and those study participants who were found to have either congenital heart disease or valvular heart diseases or ischemic heart disease were excluded from the study based on initial screening. For the calculation of 10 years risk of ACVD based on Astro-CHARM and PCE, the variables were obtained including medical history and coronary artery calcium and C-reactive protein measurements. RESULTS: Mean estimated 10-year risk of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke as per the Astro-CHARM was 13.98 <c2><b1> 8.01%, while mean estimated 10-year risk of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke as per the PCE was 22.26 <c2><b1> 14.01%. Based on Astro-CHARM, 11.14% of the study participants were labeled as having high risk, while PCE estimated 20.73% of study participants as having high risk of ASCVD. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that our findings showed substantial differences in ten-year risk of ASCVD between Astro-CHARM and PCE, both calculators can be used to develop a new population and specific risk estimators for this South Asian sub-population.

Nonetheless, many factors may influence the decision reached, and such influences may be different for male and female volunteers. Being aware of these differences may help researches develop better processes for obtaining consent that safeguard the right of autonomy for all participants. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential gender-based differences in the factors influencing clinical trial participation. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Northeast region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in October 2011. A structured questionnaire was administered to 143 volunteers (48 male, 95 female) screened for participation in a clinical study of an investigational functional food with potential anthelminthic properties. Answers regarding their decision to participate in the study were compared, by gender, using chi-square and Mann Whitney tests. Odds ratios (OR) was used to measure association. RESULTS: A majority of subjects (58% of males, 59% of females) listed the desire to collaborate with the development of a product against parasitic worms as their main reason for participation. Females were significantly more likely to report a decision influenced by friends, family, or researchers (OR 3.14, 3.45, and 3.46 respectively, p < 0.005). Females were also significantly more likely to report a decision influenced by general altruistic considerations (OR 8.45, p < 0.005). There was no difference, by gender, in the report of decisions influenced by informational meetings, understanding of the disease, or the availability of medical treatments or exams. There was also no difference in knowledge of the rights of research participants.

Nationally representative data from the fourth wave of the China Household Finance Survey from 2017 were used, and the dataset comprised 105,691 individuals aged 18 years or older. The Andersen health services utilization model was used to inform the research. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the decision to purchase PHI. The proportion of the sample that had PHI was small, at 5.06%, but coverage for social basic medical insurance (SBMI) was 90.64%. Among PHI holders, the overwhelming majority (87.40%) also had SBMI. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that predisposing factors (age, education, marital status, household size), enabling factors (household income, SBMI status, geographical factors, household medical expense, and medical debt), and needs-based factors (health status) were statistically significant determinants of the decision to purchase PHI. This study suggests that the socio-economic circumstances of households play a crucial role in the decision to acquire PHI.

This secondary analysis examined whether previously reported outcomes from a cluster randomized trial of a clinical decision support system (CDSS)-prompting delivery of a brief alcohol intervention (an educational alcohol resource) for patients drinking above cancer guidelines-were moderated by patients' sex. Patients (n = 5702) enrolled in a smoking cessation program at primary care sites across Ontario, Canada, were randomized to either the intervention (CDSS) or control arm (no CDSS). Logistic generalized estimating equations models were fit for the primary and secondary outcome (HCP offer of resource and patient acceptance of resource, respectively). Previously reported results showed no difference between treatment arms in HCP offers of an educational alcohol resource to eligible patients, but there was increased acceptance of the alcohol resource among patients in the intervention arm. The results of this study showed that these CDSS intervention effects were not moderated by sex, and this can help inform the development of a scalable strategy to overcome gender disparities in alcohol intervention seen in other studies.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17031024,17,3,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Sex Factors and Health Education and Ontario and Health Personnel and Smokers and alcohol and *Decision Support Systems, Clinical and clinical decision support systems and smoking cessation and *Smoking Cessation and tobacco and Alcohol Drinking/*prevention & control and brief intervention and sex differences",NA,NA,2020/02/06/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, some medicines face various risks during transportation and storage due to the particularity of medicines, which must be kept at a low temperature to ensure their quality. In this regard, it is of great significance to evaluate and select drug cold chain logistics suppliers from different perspectives to ensure the quality of medicines and reduce the risks of transportation and storage. To solve such a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, this paper proposes an integrated model based on the combination of the SWARA (stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis) and CoCoSo (combined compromise solution) methods under the probabilistic linguistic environment. An adjustment coefficient is introduced to the SWARA method to derive criteria weights, and an improved CoCoSo method is proposed to determine the ranking of alternatives. The two methods are extended to the probabilistic linguistic environment to enhance the applicability of the two methods.

Community-based interventions based on building women's groups for awareness generation on maternal and child health (MCH) are the best and cost-effective approaches in improving their access to health services. The present study evaluated a community-based intervention aimed at improving marginalized women's awareness and utilization of MCH services, and access to livelihood and savings using the peer-led approach from two districts of India. METHODS: We used peer educators as mediators of knowledge transfer among women and for creating a supportive environment at the household and community levels. The intervention was implemented in two marginalized districts of Uttar Pradesh, namely Banda and Kaushambi. Two development blocks in each of the two districts were selected randomly, and 24 villages in each of the four blocks were selected based on the high percentage of a marginalized population. The evaluation of the intervention involved a non-experimental, 'post-test analysis of the project group' research design, in a mixed-method approach. Data were collected at two points in time, including qualitative interviews at the end line and tracking data of the intervention population (n = 37,324) through an online management information system. RESULTS: Most of the women in Banda (90%) and Kaushambi (85%) attended at least 60% of the education sessions. Around 39% of women in Banda and 35% of women in Kaushambi registered for the livelihood scheme, and 94 and 80% of them had worked under the scheme in these two places, respectively. Women's awareness about MCH seemed to have increased post-intervention. The money earned after getting work under the livelihood scheme or from daily savings was deposited in the bank account by the women. These savings helped the women investing money at times of need, such as starting their work, in emergencies for the medical treatment of their family members, education of their children, etc. CONCLUSION: Peer-led model of intervention can be explored to improve the combined health and economic outcomes of marginalized women.",2020,10.1186/s12889-020-09884-y,20,1,1766,eng,1471-2458,"Poverty and Income and Health Services Accessibility and Humans and Female and Adult and Young Adult and Child and Health services and Employment and Maternal health and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Pregnancy and Health education and Program Evaluation and India and Peer Group and Implementation science and Health Promotion/*methods and Reproductive health and *Empowerment and *Community Health Services and Maternal-Child Health Services/statistics & numerical data and *Social Marginalization and Facilities and Services Utilization/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/11/23/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zaidi_2019_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Using the National Early Warning Score (NEWS/NEWS 2) in different Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to predict the discharge location of patients,"Zaidi, Hassan and Bader-El-Den, Mohamed and McNicholas, James",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS/NEWS 2) has been adopted across the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. as a method of escalating care for deteriorating patients. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resources are limited and in high demand, with patient discharge a focal point for managing resources effectively. There are currently no universally accepted methods for assessing discharge of patients from an ICU, which can cause premature discharges and put patients at risk of subsequent deterioration, readmission to ICU or death. METHODS: We tested the ability of the NEWS to discriminate patients within 24h of admission to an ICU in a U.S. hospital during 2001-2012, by their end discharge location: home; hospital ward; nursing facility; hospice and death. The NEWS performance was compared across five different ICU specialties, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and a large vital signs database (n=2,723,055) collected from 28,523 critical care admissions. RESULTS: The NEWS AUROC (95% CI) at 24h following admission: all patients 0.727 (0.709-0.745); Coronary Care Unit (CCU) 0.829 (0.821-0.837); Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU) 0.844 (0.838-0.850); Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) 0.778 (0.767-0.791); Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) 0.775 (0.762-0.788); Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit (TSICU) 0.765 (0.751-0.773). CONCLUSIONS: The NEWS has reasonable discrimination for any ICU patient's discharge location. The NEWS has greater ability to discriminate patients in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) and Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU) compared to other ICU specialties.

Li_2009_BMCpubhea,JOUR,Threat-responsiveness and the decision to obtain free influenza vaccinations among the older adults in Taiwan,"Li, Ying-Chun and Liu, Chi-Mei",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Although older adults are encouraged by government agencies to receive influenza vaccinations, many do not obtain them. In Taiwan, where universal health care coverage has significantly reduced the barriers of access to care, the health care system has provided free influenza vaccinations for people 65 years or older since 2001. Nevertheless, the numbers of people who use this service are much fewer than expected. The aim of this study was to explore major factors that might affect the decision to receive influenza vaccinations among older adults in Taiwan. METHODS: Using national representative health insurance medical claims from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2002 and 2004, we investigated the role of threat-responsiveness, represented by prior vaccinations and prior physician visits for flu-like respiratory conditions, in the decisions of older adults to obtain vaccinations in Taiwan. RESULTS: Among the sample of 23,023 older adults, the overall yearly vaccination rates in this study were 38.6%, 44.3% and 39.3% for 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Adjusting for covariates of individual and health care facility characteristics, the multivariate logistic regression revealed that older adults who had had prior vaccinations were ten times more likely to be vaccinated during the following influenza season than those who had not (OR=10.22, 95%CI: 9.82-10.64). The greater the frequency of prior physician visits for flu-like respiratory conditions, the greater the likelihood that one would decide to be vaccinated. Visits during prior interim (non-epidemic) season exerted a stronger positive influence than prior influenza season on this likelihood (OR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.46-1.73 vs. OR=1.11 95% CI: 1.01-1.22, respectively). CONCLUSION: Threat-responsiveness, or perceived risk, greatly influences influenza vaccination rates among the older adults in Taiwan. These findings can be used to help design public health campaigns to increase the influenza vaccination rate in this vulnerable group of citizens. Particularly, older adults who never had influenza vaccinations can be identified, educated, and encouraged to participate.",2009,10.1186/1471-2458-9-275,9,NA,275,eng,1471-2458,"Humans and Regression Analysis and Aged and Multivariate Analysis and *Decision Making and Taiwan and Influenza, Human/*prevention & control and Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,2009/07/31/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Herrera_2017_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Estimating the Causal Impact of Proximity to Gold and Copper Mines on Respiratory Diseases in Chilean Children: An Application of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation,"Herrera, Ronald and Berger, Ursula and von Ehrenstein, Ondine S. and Diaz, Ivan and Huber, Stella and Moraga Munoz, Daniel and Radon, Katja",International journal of environmental research and public health,"In a town located in a desert area of Northern Chile, gold and copper open-pit mining is carried out involving explosive processes. These processes are associated with increased dust exposure, which might affect children's respiratory health. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the causal attributable risk of living close to the mines on asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis risk burden in children. Data on the prevalence of respiratory diseases and potential confounders were available from a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2009 among 288 (response: 69 % ) children living in the community. The proximity of the children's home addresses to the local gold and copper mine was calculated using geographical positioning systems. We applied targeted maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the causal attributable risk (CAR) for asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and both outcomes combined. Children living more than the first quartile away from the mines were used as the unexposed group. Based on the estimated CAR, a hypothetical intervention in which all children lived at least one quartile away from the copper mine would decrease the risk of rhinoconjunctivitis by 4.7 percentage points (CAR: - 4.7 ; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): - 8.4 ; - 0.11 ); and 4.2 percentage points (CAR: - 4.2 ; 95 % CI: - 7.9 ; - 0.05 ) for both outcomes combined.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the TE and the quality of care and identify its influencing factors among LTCF. METHODS: A total of 32 registered LTCF in Xiamen of China were surveyed in 2016. The Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) model and Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were used to evaluate the TE of LTCF. The TE has been decomposed into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Utilization of DEA with human, financial, and material resources as inputs and quantity, quality of nursing care as outputs allowed estimation of the relative TE of care in LTCF. In addition, this study applied SBM to measuring the efficiencies and slacks. Furthermore, Tobit model was performed to explore factors associated with TE. RESULTS: There were 7 public and 25 private LTCF respectively, with a total of 6729 beds and 3154 elderly people. 17 LTCF were technically efficient (53.1%). In the BCC model, the average TE was 0.963. The average pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency of LTCF were 0.979, 0.984, respectively. There were 5 LTCF with increasing returns to scale, 8 LTCF with decreasing returns to scale. In the SBM model, the average TE was 0.813, and it had the same effective decision-making unit with SBM model. Depending on TE score from high to low, the top eight are private LTCF, and the last four were public LTCF. The slack analysis showed that they can be reduced in 8 LTCF with decreasing returns to scale such as 53.31% administrative staffs, 67.73% medical staffs, 33.1% caregivers, 51.66% paramedical staffs and 4.1% beds on average. The TE of private LTCF was higher than that of public LTCF. The LTCF in urban were more effective than rural. The TE of LTCF raised by increasing of working hours, training frequency and institutional occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: The overall TE of LTCF in Xiamen of China was relatively high, especially in private institutions. However, LTCF still needs to further improve the utilization of physical resources and the management and training of human resources. The TE of LTCF was associated to their location, institutional nature, allocation of human resources and occupancy rate.

Environmental factors include many features, and ones that are most relevant to HEV are selected and input into the ensemble learning model composed by Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Random Forest for training and prediction. Three indicators, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ensemble learning model against the classical time series prediction model. It is concluded that the ensemble learning model has a better prediction effect than the classical model, and the prediction effectiveness can be improved by exploiting water quality and meteorological factors (radiation, air pressure, precipitation).",2020,10.3390/ijerph18010159,18,1,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"prediction and Humans and Models, Theoretical and ensemble learning and Disease Outbreaks and *Machine Learning and *Climate and *Hepatitis E/epidemiology and *Water Quality and hepatitis E",NA,NA,2020/12/28/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reza and Banihashemi, Saeed and Mahdiyar, Amir and Abdullah, Arham",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)-related injuries are vexing problems for construction projects in developing countries, mostly due to poor managerial-, governmental-, and technical safety-related issues. Though some studies have been conducted on OHS-associated issues in developing countries, research on this topic remains scarce. A review of the literature shows that presenting a predictive assessment framework through machine learning techniques can add much to the field. As for Malaysia, despite the ongoing growth of the construction sector, there has not been any study focused on OHS assessment of workers involved in construction activities. To fill these gaps, an Ensemble Predictive Safety Risk Assessment Model (EPSRAM) is developed in this paper as an effective tool to assess the OHS risks related to workers on construction sites. The developed EPSRAM is based on the integration of neural networks with fuzzy inference systems. To show the effectiveness of the EPSRAM developed, it is applied to several Malaysian construction case projects. This paper contributes to the field in several ways, through: (1) identifying major potential safety risks, (2) determining crucial factors that affect the safety assessment for construction workers, (3) predicting the magnitude of identified safety risks accurately, and (4) predicting the evaluation strategies applicable to the identified risks.

Hu_2019_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Spatial Inequity of Multi-Level Healthcare Services in a Rapid Expanding Immigrant City of China: A Case Study of Shenzhen,"Hu, Wei and Li, Lin and Su, Mo",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Since the onset of reform and opening up in China, large cities in the nation have been experiencing problems related to limited medical resources. These resource limitations are due to rapid population growth and urban expansion. As the country's fastest growing city, Shenzhen has experienced a substantial misalignment between the supply and the demand of healthcare services. Numerous researchers have analyzed spatial inequity in healthcare services by focusing on the spatial accessibility of medical facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, and community health service centers (CHSCs). However, the issue of inequity in healthcare services for vulnerable groups has largely been ignored. We chose general hospitals (GHs) and CHSCs, which provide direct healthcare services to residents, as the study objects. By performing spatial accessibility analysis using the gravity model and the two-step floating catchment area method, we investigated healthcare services inequity for vulnerable groups based on four dimensions: residential type, age, education level, and occupation. We found that the services provided by GHs cannot meet the demand in Shenzhen. This inadequacy is characterized by spatial centralization and neglect of those who reside in urban villages, who have low education levels, and who are employed in the manufacturing industry. In contrast, CHSCs generally serve a relatively broad population. This phenomenon is related to differences in the land and capital needs between GHs and CHSCs. Our study reveals that an appropriate adjustment of GH location could significantly improve healthcare services inequity. Therefore, to alleviate this inequity, it is particularly necessary to increase the number of GHs in the peripheral circle and in areas with large vulnerable populations, accelerate the implementation of the hierarchical medical system, and promote the transfer of medical resources to grassroot institutes through CHSCs. This study helps improve our understanding of healthcare services inequity in rapid expanding cities, which is of substantial significance for improving the planning and construction of medical facilities, facilitating scientific decision-making, and promoting social equity.",2019,10.3390/ijerph16183441,16,18,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"China and Humans and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Aged and Models, Theoretical and accessibility and Aged, 80 and over and Infant, Newborn and Health Services/*statistics & numerical data and Cities and Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data and Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data and *Spatial Analysis and Catchment Area, Health and healthcare services and hierarchical medical system and inequity and Shenzhen city and Transients and Migrants/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2019/09/17/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

China is a country with significant political, socioeconomic, and cultural events since the 1900s; however, no such studies are reported in the literature. METHODS: Age-specific mortality rates of breast cancer during 1990-2015 in China were analyzed using APC modeling (age-period-cohort modeling) method. Net effect from birth cohort was derived to measure cancer mortality risk during 1906-1990 when no mortality data were collected, and net effect from time period was derived to measure cancer mortality risk during 1990-2015 when data were collected. Model parameters were estimated using intrinsic estimator, a novel method to handle collinearity. The estimated effects were numerical differentiated to enhance presentations of time/age trend. RESULTS: Breast cancer mortality rate per 100,000 women increased from 6.83 in 1990 to 12.07 in 2015. After controlling for age and period, the risk of breast cancer mortality declined from 0.626 in 1906-10 to - 1.752 in 1991-95 (RR = 0.09). The decline consisted of 3 phases, a gradual phase during 1906-1940, a moderate phase with some fluctuations during 1941-1970, and a rapid phase with large fluctuations during 1971-1995. After controlling for age and cohort, the risk of breast cancer mortality increased from - 0.141 in 1990 to 0.258 in 2015 (RR = 1.49) with an acceleration after 2005. The time trends revealed by both the cohort effect and the period effect were in consistency with the significant political and socioeconomic events in China since the 1900s. CONCLUSIONS: With recent mortality data in 1990-2015, we detected the risk of breast cancer mortality for Chinese women over a long period from 1906 to 2015. The risk declined more than 90% from the highest level in 1906-10 to the lowest in 1990-95, followed by an increase of 49% from 1990 to 2015.

This, however, results in growing popularity of antivaccine movements and affects global and local epidemiological situation. Vaccine hesitancy has become a significant problem not only for epidemiologists but also for practitioners. Fortunately, the hesitant group seems to be vulnerable to intervention, and studies indicate that these patients can be persuaded to undergo vaccinations. The aim of the present study was to determine the factors most strongly affecting vaccination-related attitudes and decisions. An anonymous, self-administered survey consisting of demographic data and single select multiple-choice questions regarding vaccination was conducted. The voluntary study included secondary school pupils, medical and nonmedical students, healthcare professionals, hospital and clinic patients as well as parents. A total of 7950 survey forms were distributed between January 2018 and June 2019 in south-eastern Poland. A total of 6432 respondents (80.2%) completed a questionnaire that was eligible for analysis. The positive attitude toward vaccination was significantly affected by older age, by the fact of obtaining information on vaccinations from a physician, this information's higher quality (assessed in school grade scale), higher level of knowledge on vaccines and by the fact of denying the association between vaccination and autism in children (p < 0.001). The probability of supporting vaccinations was almost eight-fold lower among respondents believing the vaccine-autism relationship. Chance of supporting vaccination doubled in the group with a higher knowledge level. The individuals not provided with expert information on vaccination were twice as often unconvinced. Age, education and having children significantly affected the attitude toward influenza immunization (p < 0.001). Older, better educated respondents and those having children were more positive about vaccinations. The medical community still exert decisive effects on attitudes toward vaccinations. High-quality information provided by them is of great importance. Skillful and competent provision of evidence-based information disproving the myth about vaccine-autism connection and proper education of medical staff is essential in molding positive attitudes toward vaccinations.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17124461,17,12,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and Female and Male and Surveys and Questionnaires and Poland and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Vaccines/adverse effects and *Vaccination and medical education and vaccination and antivaccine movements and vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-preventable diseases",NA,NA,2020/06/21/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

We trained, validated, and tested each model through data and compared their performance using three measures: Brier score, calibration slope, and calibration-in-the-large. (3) A chi-square test demonstrated that mortality risk statistically significantly differed according to severity, intent, toxic substance, age, and sex. The multilayer perceptron model (MLP) had the highest area under the curve (AUC), and lowest Brier score in training and validation phases, while the logistic regression model (LR) showed the highest AUC (0.827) and lowest Brier score (0.0307) in the testing phase. MLP also had the second-highest AUC (0.816) and second-lowest Brier score (0.003258) in the testing phase, demonstrating better performance than the decision-making tree model.

Little is known about the perspectives of emergency medical services (EMS) which are responsible for hospital transports. The aim of this study was to explore paramedics' experiences with transfers from nursing homes (NHs) and their ideas for possible interventions that can reduce transfers. We conducted three focus groups following a semi-structured question guide. The data were analyzed by content analysis using the software MAXQDA. In total, 18 paramedics (mean age: 33 years, male n = 14) participated in the study. Paramedics are faced with complex issues when transporting NHRs to hospital. They mainly reported on structural reasons (e.g., understaffing or lacking availability of physicians), which led to the initiation of an emergency call. Handovers were perceived as poorly organized because required transfer information (e.g., medication lists, advance directives (ADs)) were incomplete or nursing staff was insufficiently prepared. Hospital transfers were considered as (potentially) avoidable in case of urinary catheter complications, exsiccosis/infections and falls. Legal uncertainties among all involved professional groups (nurses, physicians, dispatchers, and paramedics) seemed to be a relevant trigger for hospital transfers. In paramedics' point of view, emergency standards in NHs, trainings for nursing staff, the improvement of working conditions and legal conditions can reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers from NHs.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17113778,17,11,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and decision making and hospitalization and Emergency Service, Hospital and emergency medical services and Focus Groups and hospital admission and Nursing Homes and emergency department and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Hospitals and *Allied Health Personnel and *Patient Transfer and patient transfer and referral and nursing home residents",NA,NA,2020/05/26/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the climate changes, heatwaves and cold streaks have become more frequent and intense. The ClimApp project aims to develop a smartphone App that provides individualised advice to cope with thermal stress outdoors and indoors. This paper presents a method to predict indoor air temperature to evaluate thermal indoor environments. Two types of input data were used to set up a predictive model: weather data obtained from online weather services and general building attributes to be provided by App users. The method provides discrete predictions of temperature through a decision tree classification algorithm. The data used to train and test the algorithm was obtained from field measurements in seven Danish households and from building simulations considering three different climate regions, ranging from temperate to hot and humid. The results show that the method had an accuracy of 92% (F1-score) when predicting temperatures under previously known conditions (e.g., same household, occupants and climate). However, the performance decreased to 30% under different climate conditions. The approach had the highest performance when predicting the most commonly observed indoor temperatures.

As treatment scale up continues, information on the care provided to patients after initiating ART can help guide decision-making. We estimated retention in care, the quantity of resources utilized, and costs for a retrospective cohort of adults initiating ART under routine clinical conditions in Zambia. METHODS: Data on resource utilization (antiretroviral [ARV] and non-ARV drugs, laboratory tests, outpatient clinic visits, and fixed resources) and retention in care were extracted from medical records for 846 patients who initiated ART at <e2><89><a5>15 years of age at six treatment sites between July 2007 and October 2008. Unit costs were estimated from the provider's perspective using site- and country-level data and are reported in 2011 USD. RESULTS: Patients initiated ART at a median CD4 cell count of 145 cells/<ce><bc>L. Fifty-nine percent of patients initiated on a tenofovir-containing regimen, ranging from 15% to 86% depending on site. One year after ART initiation, 75% of patients were retained in care. The average cost per patient retained in care one year after ART initiation was $243 (95% CI, $194-$293), ranging from $184 (95% CI, $172-$195) to $304 (95% CI, $290-$319) depending on site. Patients retained in care one year after ART initiation received, on average, 11.4 months' worth of ARV drugs, 1.5 CD4 tests, 1.3 blood chemistry tests, 1.4 full blood count tests, and 6.5 clinic visits with a doctor or clinical officer. At all sites, ARV drugs were the largest cost component, ranging from 38% to 84% of total costs, depending on site. CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiate ART late in the course of disease progression and a large proportion drop out of care after initiation. The quantity of resources utilized and costs vary widely by site, and patients utilize a different mix of resources under routine clinical conditions than if they were receiving fully guideline-concordant care. Improving retention in care and guideline concordance, including increasing the use of tenofovir in first-line ART regimens, may lead to increases in overall treatment costs.",2014,10.1186/1471-2458-14-296,14,NA,296,eng,1471-2458,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Office Visits and Guideline Adherence and CD4 Lymphocyte Count and Ambulatory Care Facilities and *Health Care Costs and Zambia and *Health Resources and Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use and Delivery of Health Care/*economics and *Patient Dropouts and Adenine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use and HIV Infections/drug therapy/*economics and Organophosphonates/therapeutic use and Tenofovir,NA,NA,2014/03/31/,BMC Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

J. and Ickenroth, Martine H. P. and de Vries, Nanne K. and Dinant, Geert-Jan and Ronda, Gaby and van der Weijden, Trudy",BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Self-tests are available to consumers for more than 25 conditions, ranging from infectious diseases to cardiovascular risk factors. Self-tests are defined as in-vitro tests on body materials such as blood, urine, faeces, or saliva that are initiated by consumers to diagnose a particular disorder or risk factor without involving a medical professional. In 2006, 16% of a sample of Dutch Internet users had ever used at least one self-test and 17% intended to use a self-test in the future. The objectives of this study are to determine (1) the frequency of self-test use, (2) the consumers' reasons for using or not using a self-test, (3) the information that is used by self-testers in the different self-test stages and the consumers' interpretation of the quality of this information, (4) the consumers' response to self-test results in terms of their confidence in the result, reassurance by the test result, and follow-up behaviour, (5) the information consumers report to need in the decision making process of using or not using a self-test, and in further management on the basis of the self-test result, and (6) the quality of the currently available consumer information on a selected set of self-tests. METHODS: Mixed methods study with (1) a cross-sectional study consisting of a two-phase Internet-questionnaire, (2) semi-structured interviews with self-testers and consumers who intend to use a self-test, and (3) the assessment of the quality of consumer information of self-tests.

However, the effect of changes in office environment (office renovation) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine PA, SB, and space utilization changes among office workers in response to office renovation. This study was a natural experiment at three offices of a single company in Tokyo, Japan. The participants were, 13 workers from one office in the renovation group (mean age: 37.9 <c2><b1> 10.8 years, percentage of females: 23.1%) and 29 from two offices in the control group (mean age: 42.3 <c2><b1> 11.2 years, percentage of females: 31.0%). In the renovation, introduction of activity-based working (ABW) and installation of height-adjustable desks (HAD) were adopted. The ABW office was designed to provide various shared workstations, enabling the workers to choose workstations depending on their task or mood. Accelerometer measurement and object detection method using artificial intelligence (AI) technology for video images were used to assess behavior and space utilization before and after the renovation. Two weeks after the renovation, significant improvements in SB (pre- to post-renovation improvements: 346.8 <c2><b1> 28.6 to 321.2 <c2><b1> 17.8 min/working-hours) and PA (total PA: 173.2 <c2><b1> 28.6 to 198.8 <c2><b1> 17.8 min/working-hours; and light-intensity PA: 130.4 <c2><b1> 27.1 to 150.7 <c2><b1> 31.0 min/working-hours) were observed.

Active failures in opioid dose conversion can contribute to error. Conversion is complex and is currently performed manually using tables of approximate equivalence. Apps that offer opioid dose double-checking are available but there are concerns about their accuracy and clinical validation. This study evaluated a novel opioid dose conversion app, The Safer Prescription of Opioids Tool (SPOT), a CE-marked Class I medical device, as a clinician decision support (CDS) platform. This single-centre prospective clinical utility pilot study followed a mixed methods design. Prescribers completed an initial survey exploring their current opioid prescribing practice. Thereafter prescribers used SPOT for opioid dosage conversions in parallel to their usual clinical practice, then evaluated SPOT through a survey and focus group. SPOT matched the Gold Standard result in 258 of 268 (96.3%) calculations. The 10 instances (3.7%) when SPOT did not match were due to a rounding error. Users had a statistically significant increase in confidence in prescribing opioids after using SPOT. Focus group feedback highlighted benefits in Quality Improvement and Safety when using SPOT.

We used the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance to guide the process evaluation. The recruitment, reach and dose delivered were satisfactory and participation high. The employees felt ProMES clarified priorities, gave control and increased participation in decision-making. However, difficulty in obtaining statistical productivity data from the central administration office (a central feature of the intervention) hindered full implementation and regular feedback meetings. Staffing shortages interfered with the implementation process, while having seven design teams and one consultant prevented all occupational groups from working simultaneously. A detailed examination of access to necessary organizational data should be undertaken before implementing ProMES.

To reveal the complexity behind government intervention decision, we build a bi-layer network diffusion model for the information-disease dynamics that were intervened in and conduct a full space simulation to illustrate the trade-off faced by governments between information disclosing and blocking. The simulation results show that governments prioritize the accuracy of disclosed information over the disclosing speed when there is a high-level medical recognition of the virus and a high public health awareness, while, for the opposite situation, more strict information blocking is preferred. Furthermore, an unaccountable government tends to delay disclosing, a risk-averse government prefers a total blocking, and a low government credibility will discount the effect of information disclosing and aggravate the situation. These findings suggest that information intervention is indispensable for containing the outbreak of infectious disease, but its effectiveness depends on a complicated way on both external social/epidemic factors and the governments' internal preferences and governance capability, for which more thorough investigations are needed in the future.",2020,10.3390/ijerph18010147,18,1,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"COVID-19 and Humans and Decision Making and Models, Theoretical and social network and Systems Analysis and *COVID-19 and Information Dissemination/*methods and *Pandemics/prevention & control and *Government and information blocking and information disclosing and information intervention",NA,NA,2020/12/28/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Identifying individuals on the spectrum has remained a lengthy process for the past few decades due to the fact that some individuals diagnosed with ASD exhibit exceptional skills in areas such as mathematics, arts, and music among others. To improve the accuracy and reliability of autism diagnoses, many scholars have developed pre-diagnosis screening methods to help identify autistic behaviours at an early stage, speed up the clinical diagnosis referral process, and improve the understanding of ASD for the different stakeholders involved, such as parents, caregivers, teachers, and family members. However, the functionality and reliability of those screening tools vary according to different research studies and some have remained questionable. This study evaluates and critically analyses 37 different ASD screening tools in order to identify possible areas that need to be addressed through further development and innovation.

We utilized daily records on reported salmonellosis and non-specific enteritis, and four meteorological parameters (ambient temperature, dew point, humidity, and barometric pressure) in Barnaul, Russia in 2004-2011, maintained by the CliWaDIn database. The data structure was examined using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on Ward distance using the silhouette metric. The selected clusters were assessed with respect to their density and homogeneity. We detected that a well-defined cluster with high counts of salmonellosis occurred during warm summer days and unseasonably warm days in spring. We also detected a cluster with high counts of non-specific enteritis that occurred during unusually ""very warm"" winter days.

Entity recognition of electronic medical records has triggered many studies that propose many entity extraction methods. In this paper, an entity extraction model is proposed to extract entities from Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMR). In the input layer of the model, we use word embedding and dictionary features embedding as input vectors, where word embedding consists of a character representation and a word representation. Then, the input vectors are fed to the bidirectional long short-term memory to capture contextual features. Finally, a conditional random field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags. We performed experiments on body classification task, and the F1 values reached 90.65%. We also performed experiments on anatomic region recognition task, and the F1 values reached 93.89%. On both tasks, our model had higher performance than state-of-the-art models, such as Bi-LSTM-CRF, Bi-LSTM-Attention, and Vote. Through experiments, our model has a good effect when dealing with small frequency entities and unknown entities; with a small training dataset, our method showed 2-4% improvement on F1 value compared to the basic Bi-LSTM-CRF models.

METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted through face to face interviews. The DCE survey was constructed by five attributes: type of service, treatment measures, cost, travel time, and care provider. Patients' preferences and willingness to pay for facility attributes were analyzed using a mixed logit model, and interaction terms were used to assess preference heterogeneity among patients with different sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Patients placed different weights on attributes, depending on whether they perceived their health condition as minor or severe. For conditions perceived as minor, patients valued treatment measures (56.60%), travel time (32.34%) and care provider (8.51%) most. For conditions perceived as severe, they valued treatment measures (52.19%), care provider (38.69%), and type of service (7.30%) most. The WTP related to the change from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) service to Modern Medicine (MM) service was the largest for both severity scenarios. For conditions perceived as minor, patients would be willing to pay 102.84 CNY (15.43 USD) for a reduction in travel time to below 30 min. For conditions perceived as severe, WTP related to the change from general service to specialized service and from junior medical practitioner to senior medical practitioner, were highly valued by respondents, worth 107.3 CNY (16.10 USD) and 565.8 CNY (84.87 USD), respectively.

Therefore, the study analyzed to identify the relationship between bone density and both fat mass and lean mass of Korean adolescents. Subjects were chosen among 21,303 people from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) between 2008 and 2011 that took a bone density checkup; as a result, 1454 teenagers aged between 12 and 18 were selected. Data analysis was performed in SAS ver. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) following the KNHNES and the weighted complex sample analysis was conducted; body fat mass and lean mass were divided into quintile groups, and to figure out the differences in bone density that were analyzed in six models adjusted by body weight (kg) and walking (yes/no), muscle strengthening exercises (yes/no), nutrition (intake of ca (g), and serum vitamin D (ng/mL)). Then, the generalized linear model (GLM) and trend test were conducted for each gender with a significance level of 0.05. The bone density differences of fat mass and lean mass were analyzed. The result of Model 6 considering all correction variables is as follows; in the case of male adolescents, the total femur and lumbar spine showed a significant difference (F = 13.120, p < 0.001; F = 12.900, p < 0.001) for fat mass, and the trend test showed that the figures significantly decreased (<ce><b2> = -0.030, p < 0.001; -0.035, p < 0.001).

It is necessary to enable earlier identification of uncertainties occurring in the perioperative environment. This study aims to propose a framework for resilient surgical scheduling by identifying uncertainty factors affecting the real-time surgical scheduling through a mixed-methods study. We collected the pre- and post-surgical scheduling data for twenty days and a one-day observation data in a top-tier general university hospital in South Korea. Data were compared and analyzed for any changes related to the dimensions of uncertainty. The observations in situ of surgical scheduling were performed to confirm our findings from the quantitative data. Analysis was divided into two phases of fundamental uncertainties categorization (conceptual, technical and personal) and uncertainties leveling for effective decision-making strategies. Pre- and post-surgical scheduling data analysis showed that unconfirmed patient medical conditions and emergency cases are the main causes of frequent same-day surgery schedule changes, with derived factors that affect the scheduling pattern (time of surgery, overtime surgery, surgical procedure changes and surgery duration). The observation revealed how the OR manager controlled the unexpected events to prevent overtime surgeries. In conclusion, integrating resilience approach to identifying uncertainties and managing event changes can minimize potential risks that may compromise the surgical personnel and patients' safety, thereby promoting higher resilience in the current system. Furthermore, this strategy may improve coordination among personnel and increase surgical scheduling efficiency.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17103511,17,10,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Uncertainty and Humans and situation awareness and patient safety and Hospitals, University and surgical scheduling and Republic of Korea and *Efficiency, Organizational and resilience and *Personnel Staffing and Scheduling and *Operating Rooms and uncertainties",NA,NA,2020/05/18/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

The fields of disaster risk reduction need to consider the ways in which inequities, driven by economic and social policy as well as institutional decision-making, create vulnerabilities prior to a disaster, which are then magnified post disaster through entrenched structural differences in access to resources. Drawing on key principles within the Inverse Care Law, the Inverse Response Law refers to the idea that people in lower socio-economic groups are more likely to be impacted and to experience disparities in service provision during the disaster response and recovery phase. In a market model of recovery, vulnerable groups struggle to compete for necessary services creating inequities in adaptive capacity as well as in social and wellbeing outcomes over time. Both the Inverse Care Law and the Inverse Response Law focus on the structural organisation of services at a macro level. In this article, the Inverse Care Law is outlined, its application to medical treatment following disasters considered and an explanation of the Inverse Response Law provided.

Reindeer herding products are used as traditional nutrition, and as effective preventive means and remedies for adapting to the cold and geomagnetic activity in the High North. Export trends of traditional reindeer products have decreased local Indigenous peoples' access to venison and had a negative impact on their health. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially urgent for the Indigenous peoples to have sufficient access to traditional food and be involved in policy decision-making to maintain this traditional business. We aim to analyze the dependencies of Indigenous peoples on the reindeer produce-exporting ""food value chain"" and explore how (1) the independence of reindeer herders could be increased in these export chains and (2) how provision of their products to local communities could be secured. The study takes a multidisciplinary approach based on policy and socioeconomic analyses with input from medical research.

We aimed to describe PAI prescription in an elderly multimorbid population and to determine the factors that influence their prescription, including the impact of age, comorbidities and frailty, evaluated through a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This cross-sectional study included all patients admitted to the acute geriatric department of a university hospital from November 2016 to January 2017. We included 304 consecutive hospitalized patients aged 88.7 <c2><b1> 5.5 years. One third of the population was treated with PAI. A total of 133 (43.8%) patients had a history of cardiovascular disease, 77 of whom were on PAI. For 16 patients, no indication was identified.

These social media-based systems have been widely used in registration, payment, decision-making, chronic diseases management, health information and medical expenses inquiry, etc., and they greatly facilitate the convenience for people to obtain health services. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing sustained health engagement of SocialHMS by combining the theory of planned behavior (TPB) with the big-five theory and the trust theory. Method: We completed an empirical analysis based on the 494 pieces of data collected from Anhui Medical University first affiliated hospital (AMU) in East China through structural equation modeling and SmartPLS (statistical analysis software). Results: Openness to new experience has a significantly positive influence on attitude (path coefficient = 0.671, t = 24.0571, R(2) = 0.451), perceived behavioral control (path coefficient = 0.752, t = 32.2893, R(2) = 0.565), and perceived risk (path coefficient = 0.651, t = 18.5940, R(2) = 0.424), respectively. Attitude, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and trust have a significantly positive influence on sustained health engagement (path coefficients = 0.206, 0.305, 0.197, 0.183 respectively, t = 3.6684, 4.9158, 4.3414, and 3.3715, respectively).

Conclusions: Attitude, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and trust are the determinants that affect sustained health engagement. The users' personality trait of openness to new experience and perceived risk were also found to be important factors for sustained health engagement.

This is an important, but proportionately small target group, regardless of the cancer context. Overlooked by this focus is the larger majority of those screened who receive ""negative"" results. We contend that for optimal dissemination of PCST, the complement of positive and negative results be viewed as an inseparable yin-yang duality with the needs of those who receive negative screening results viewed as important as those deemed to be at highest risk or derive targeted treatment benefit. We describe three areas where communication of negative PCST results warrant particular attention and research consideration: population-based family history screening, germline testing for hereditary cancer syndromes, and tumor testing for targeted cancer treatment decision-making. Without thoughtful consideration of the potential for negative results to have psychological and behavioral influences, there is a potential to create a ""neglected majority"".

OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify and characterize public health system research in public health emergency preparedness produced in the United States from 2009 to 2015, (2) synthesize research findings and assess the level of confidence in these findings, and (3) describe the evolution of knowledge production in public health emergency preparedness system research. Search Methods and Selection Criteria. We reviewed and included the titles and abstracts of 1584 articles derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray literature databases that focused on the organizational or financial aspects of public health emergency preparedness activities and were grounded on empirical studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included 156 articles. We appraised the quality of the studies according to the study design. We identified themes during article analysis and summarized overall findings by theme. We determined level of confidence in the findings with the GRADE-CERQual tool. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one studies provided evidence on how to enhance the usefulness of training. Results demonstrated the utility of drills and exercises to enhance decision-making capabilities and coordination across organizations, the benefit of cross-sector partnerships for successfully implementing training activities, and the value of integrating evaluation methods to support training improvement efforts. Thirty-six studies provided evidence on how to improve timely communications. Results supported the use of communication strategies that address differences in access to information, knowledge, attitudes, and practices across segments of the population as well as evidence on specific communication barriers experienced by public health and health care personnel. Forty-eight studies provided evidence on how to create and sustain preparedness systems. Results included how to build social capital across organizations and citizens and how to develop sustainable and useful planning efforts that maintain flexibility and rely on available medical data. Twenty-six studies provided evidence on the usefulness of measurement efforts, such as community and organizational needs assessments, and new methods to learn from the response to critical incidents. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, the field of public health emergency preparedness system research has been supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the release of the 2008 Institute of Medicine letter report. The first definition of public health emergency preparedness appeared in 2007, and before 2008 there was a lack of research and empirical evidence across all 4 research areas identified by the Institute of Medicine. This field can be considered relatively new compared with other research areas in public health; for example, tobacco control research can rely on more than 70 years of knowledge production. However, this review demonstrates that, during the past 7 years, public health emergency preparedness system research has evolved from generic inquiry to the analysis of specific interventions with more empirical studies. Public Health Implications: The results of this review provide an evidence base for public health practitioners responsible for enhancing key components of preparedness and response such as communication, training, and planning efforts.",2017,10.2105/AJPH.2017.304051,107,S2,e1-e6,eng,1541-0048 0090-0036,"Communication and United States and Humans and Organizational Objectives and Knowledge Bases and Needs Assessment and Biomedical Research/*standards and Public Health/*standards and Research Design/*standards and Disaster Planning/*organization & administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S./*organization & administration and Civil Defense and National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, U.S., Health and Medicine Division/*organization & administration",NA,NA,2017/09//undefined,Am J Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the global budget allocation mechanism (GBAM) used by NHI has led to various adjustments in the providers' way of practice, quality of care, utilization of care, and health expenditure. Studies focusing on the satisfaction of providers with health care supply, however, remain limited. We therefore explored the provider's perceived impact of the NHI allocation plan. A cross-sectional data of 299 health professionals was collected at Taipei Medical University Hospitals in April 2012. Perceptions and attitudes were assessed using a validated 5-point Likert-type questionnaire before using a structural equation modeling technique to explore the complex interrelationships of the NHI's perceived impact. The causal path relationships between the latent variables 'characteristics of NHI's allocation plan' and 'perceived positive effect' (<ce><b2> = 0.39), 'perceived positive effect' and 'satisfaction of health professionals' (<ce><b2> = 0.53), and between 'characteristics of NHI's allocation plan' and 'satisfaction of health professionals' (<ce><b2> = 0.30) were positively associated; while the path relationships between the latent variables 'perceived negative effect' and 'satisfaction of health professionals' (<ce><b2> = -0.27) and 'characteristics of NHI's allocation plan' and 'attitude toward allocation criteria' (<ce><b2> = -0.22) were negatively associated. These results indicate that providers perceived a positive impact of the NHI allocation strategy. The NHI allocation plan is an important decision-making tool among policy makers since it helps optimize outcomes. Research based on its impact at both horizontal and vertical levels on the supply side may be useful towards understanding Taiwan's GBAM. Policy-makers should therefore consider understanding the impact of GBAM at both the demand and supply side in adjusting allocation criteria.",2019,10.3390/ijerph16030467,16,3,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,Humans and Female and Health Expenditures and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Budgets and structural equation modeling and resource allocation and health insurance and Health Care Surveys and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Taiwan and health professionals and Health Care Rationing/*organization & administration and global budget and National Health Programs/*organization & administration and perceptions and attitudes,NA,NA,2019/02/05/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Treatment of T2DM in patients with HF can be challenging, considering that these patients are usually elderly, frail and have extensive comorbidities, most importantly chronic kidney disease. The complexity of medical regimens, the high risk clinical characteristics of patients and the potential of HF therapies to interfere with glucose metabolism, and conversely the emerging potential of some antidiabetic agents to modulate HF outcomes, are only some of the challenges that need to be addressed in the framework of a team-based personalized approach. The presence of established HF or the high risk of developing HF in the future has influenced recent guideline recommendations and can guide therapeutic decision making. Metformin remains first-line treatment for overweight T2DM patients at moderate cardiovascular risk. Although not contraindicated, metformin is no longer considered as first-line therapy for patients with established HF or at risk for HF, since there is robust scientific evidence that treatment with other glucose-lowering agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) should be prioritized in this population due to their strong and remarkably consistent beneficial effects on HF outcomes.",2019,10.3390/ijerph17010155,17,1,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Risk Factors and Comorbidity and Aged, 80 and over and heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Physicians/*psychology and Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use and Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use and cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular outcome trials and Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/epidemiology and glucose-lowering agents and Heart Failure/*drug therapy/epidemiology",NA,NA,2019/12/24/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass quality and strength. The study was conducted with 166 patients. A total of 65% were women and 35% were men. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 77.24 years. The research included 99 variables that consider medical history, pharmacology, psychological tests, comorbidity (Charlson), functional capacity (Barthel and Lawton), undernourishment (mini nutritional assessment (MNA) validated test), as well as biochemical and socio-demographic data. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of the level of sarcopenia in a population of chronically ill patients assessed at the Tijuana General Hospital. We used machine learning techniques to assess and identify the determining variables to focus on the patients' evolution. The following classifiers were used: Support Vector Machines, Linear Support Vector Machines, Radial Basis Function, Gaussian process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, multilayer perceptron, AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. In order of importance, we found that the following variables determine the level of sarcopenia: Age, Systolic arterial hypertension, mini nutritional assessment (MNA), Number of chronic diseases, and Sodium. They are therefore considered relevant in the decision-making process of choosing treatment or prevention. Analysis of the relationship between the presence of the variables and the classifiers used to measure sarcopenia revealed that the Decision Tree classifier, with the Age, Systolic arterial hypertension, MNA, Number of chronic diseases, and Sodium variables, showed a precision of 0.864, accuracy of 0.831, and an F1 score of 0.900 in the first and second events. Precision of 0.867, accuracy of 0.825, and an F1 score of 0.867 were obtained in event three with the same variables. We can therefore conclude that the Decision Tree classifier yields the best results for the assessment of the determining variables and suggests that the study population's sarcopenia did not change from moderate to severe.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17061917,17,6,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,machine learning and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Machine Learning and Prevalence and Bayes Theorem and Hand Strength and prevalence and Mexico/epidemiology and *Sarcopenia/diagnosis/epidemiology and sarcopenia level,NA,NA,2020/03/15/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cvetkovic_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Preparedness and Preventive Behaviors for a Pandemic Disaster Caused by COVID-19 in Serbia,"Cvetkovic, Vladimir M. and Nikolic, Neda and Radovanovic Nenadic, Una and Ocal, Adem and K Noji, Eric and Zecevic, Miodrag",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Serbia. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire examined citizens' basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there are major differences in the public's perception of risks posed by communicable disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management decision-making.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17114124,17,11,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"SARS-CoV-2 and disaster and COVID-19 and Humans and Health Surveys and coronavirus and pandemic and Betacoronavirus/*pathogenicity and Pandemics/*prevention & control and Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control and Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*prevention & control and Quarantine and Serbia and Communicable Disease Control/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data and citizen preparedness and epidemic risk and Serbia/epidemiology",NA,NA,2020/06/09/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
Muller_2020_Injoofenreanpuhe,JOUR,Hepatitis C Reinfection in People Who Inject Drugs in Resource-Limited Countries: A Systematic Review and Analysis,"Muller, Abbe and Vlahov, David and Akiyama, Matthew J. and Kurth, Ann",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Hepatitis C (HCV) is a global pandemic. The World Health Organization has developed a strategic plan for HCV elimination that focuses on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-risk populations, including people who inject drugs (PWID). While direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are highly effective at eliminating HCV infections and have few side effects, medical professionals and policymakers remain concerned about the risk of reinfection among PWID. This study is a systematic review of research measuring the rate of HCV reinfection among PWID in LMICs and identifies additional areas for further research. A systematic search strategy was used to identify studies documenting HCV reinfection after sustained virologic response in PWID in LMICs. We refined results to include studies where at least 50% of participants had DAA treatment for primary HCV infection. Pooled reinfection rate was calculated across all studies. Seven studies met eligibility criteria. Most studies were conducted in six upper middle-income countries (Mexico, Romania, Russia, Taiwan, Georgi, and Brazil) and one lower middle-income country (Bangladesh) with a total of 7665 participants. No study included information from PWID in low-income countries. Sample sizes ranged from 200 to 3004 individuals, with demographic data missing for most participants. Four studies used deep gene sequencing, and reflex genotyping procedures to differentiate reinfection (infection by a different HCV genotype/subtype) from virologic relapse (infection by the same strain). The follow-up time of people cured from primary chronic HCV infection ranged from 12 weeks to 6.6 years. The pooled reinfection rate of all seven studies was 2.8 (range: 0.02 to 10.5) cases per 100 person-years (PY). In the five studies that differentiated relapse from reinfection, the incidence of reinfection was 1.0 per 100 PY. To date, research on reinfection rates among PWID in LMICs remains limited. Research focused on PWID in low-income countries is particularly needed to inform clinical decision making and evidence-based programs. While rates of reinfection among PWID who complete DAA treatment in upper and lower middle-income countries were similar or lower than rates observed in PWID in high-income countries, the rates were highly variable and factors may influence the accuracy of these measurements. This systematic review identifies several areas for continued research. Policies concerning access to HCV testing and treatment should be comprehensive and not place restrictions on PWID in these settings.",2020,10.3390/ijerph17144951,17,14,NA,eng,1660-4601 1661-7827,"Russia and Humans and Mexico and Brazil and Recurrence and Taiwan and Bangladesh and hepatitis C and Romania and low-income country and *Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use and *Hepatitis C, Chronic and *Hepatitis C/drug therapy/epidemiology and *Substance Abuse, Intravenous/drug therapy/epidemiology and direct acting antiviral and lower-middle income country and people who inject drugs and reinfection and upper-middle income country",NA,NA,2020/07/09/,Int J Environ Res Public Health,NA,NA,NA,NA
