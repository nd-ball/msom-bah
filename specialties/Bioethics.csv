Grote_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,On the ethics of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare,"Grote, Thomas and Berens, Philipp",Journal of medical ethics,"In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105586,46,3,205-211,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"machine learning and decision-making and Uncertainty and Humans and Decision Making and uncertainty and Paternalism and autonomy and Reproducibility of Results and paternalism and Ethics, Medical and *Delivery of Health Care and *Morals",NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.",2020,10.1080/15265161.2020.1819469,20,11,17-7,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,machine learning and Artificial intelligence and Humans and Delivery of Health Care and ethics and safety and effectiveness and *Machine Learning and *Morals and test characteristics,NA,NA,2020/11//undefined,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hatherley_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Limits of trust in medical AI,"Hatherley, Joshua James",Journal of medical ethics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to revolutionise the practice of medicine. Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have demonstrated success in variety of clinical tasks: detecting diabetic retinopathy from images, predicting hospital readmissions, aiding in the discovery of new drugs, etc. AI's progress in medicine, however, has led to concerns regarding the potential effects of this technology on relationships of trust in clinical practice. In this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems can be relied on, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely on AI systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105935,46,7,478-481,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,information technology and Humans and ethics and Reproducibility of Results and *Artificial Intelligence and *Trust and quality of health care,NA,NA,2020/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

I find three problems with this argument: (1) it confuses AI with machine learning; (2) it misses machine learning's potential for personalised medicine through big data; (3) it fails to distinguish between evidence-based advice and decision-making within healthcare. I conclude that how much and which tasks we should delegate to machine learning and other technologies within healthcare and beyond is indeed a crucial question of our time, but in order to answer it, we must be careful in analysing and properly distinguish between the different systems and different delegated tasks.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105281,45,8,556-558,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and ethics and Medical Oncology and Ethics, Medical and *Artificial Intelligence and *Machine Learning",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nursing practice is at a critical ideological and ethical precipice where decision-making is enhanced and burdened by new ways of knowing that include artificial intelligence, algorithms, Big Data, genetics and genomics, neuroscience, and technological innovation. On the positive side is the new understanding provided by large data sets; the quick and efficient reduction of data into useable pieces; the replacement of redundant human tasks by machines, error reduction, pattern recognition, and so forth. However, these innovations require skepticism and critique from a profession whose mission is to care for and protect patients. The promise of technology and the new biological sciences to radically and positively transform healthcare may seem compelling when couched in terms of safety, efficiency, and effectiveness but their role in the provision of ethical nursing care remains uncertain.

Fischer_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Clinical decision-making and secondary findings in systems medicine,"Fischer, T. and Brothers, K. B. and Erdmann, P. and Langanke, M.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Systems medicine is the name for an assemblage of scientific strategies and practices that include bioinformatics approaches to human biology (especially systems biology); ""big data"" statistical analysis; and medical informatics tools. Whereas personalized and precision medicine involve similar analytical methods applied to genomic and medical record data, systems medicine draws on these as well as other sources of data. Given this distinction, the clinical translation of systems medicine poses a number of important ethical and epistemological challenges for researchers working to generate systems medicine knowledge and clinicians working to apply it. DISCUSSION: This article focuses on three key challenges: First, we will discuss the conflicts in decision-making that can arise when healthcare providers committed to principles of experimental medicine or evidence-based medicine encounter individualized recommendations derived from computer algorithms. We will explore in particular whether controlled experiments, such as comparative effectiveness trials, should mediate the translation of systems medicine, or if instead individualized findings generated through ""big data"" approaches can be applied directly in clinical decision-making. Second, we will examine the case of the Riyadh Intensive Care Program Mortality Prediction Algorithm, pejoratively referred to as the ""death computer,"" to demonstrate the ethical challenges that can arise when big-data-driven scoring systems are applied in clinical contexts. We argue that the uncritical use of predictive clinical algorithms, including those envisioned for systems medicine, challenge basic understandings of the doctor-patient relationship. Third, we will build on the recent discourse on secondary findings in genomics and imaging to draw attention to the important implications of secondary findings derived from the joint analysis of data from diverse sources, including data recorded by patients in an attempt to realize their ""quantified self."" This paper examines possible ethical challenges that are likely to be raised as systems medicine to be translated into clinical medicine. These include the epistemological challenges for clinical decision-making, the use of scoring systems optimized by big data techniques and the risk that incidental and secondary findings will significantly increase. While some ethical implications remain still hypothetical we should use the opportunity to prospectively identify challenges to avoid making foreseeable mistakes when systems medicine inevitably arrives in routine care.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0113-5,17,1,32,eng,1472-6939,"Electronic health records and Humans and Medical Informatics and Physician-Patient Relations and Algorithms and Big data and Prognosis and Systems Analysis and Epistemology and Knowledge and Statistics as Topic and Precision Medicine and *Ethics, Medical and *Data Collection and Decision Making/*ethics and *Incidental Findings and *Systems Biology and *Translational Research, Biomedical and Clinical decision-making and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and Scoring systems and Secondary findings and Systems medicine and Translation",NA,NA,2016/05/21/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rumbold_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,A critique of the regulation of data science in healthcare research in the European Union,"Rumbold, John M. M. and Pierscionek, Barbara K.",BMC medical ethics,"The EU offers a suitable milieu for the comparison and harmonisation of healthcare across different languages, cultures, and jurisdictions (albeit with a supranational legal framework), which could provide improvements in healthcare standards across the bloc. There are specific ethico-legal issues with the use of data in healthcare research that mandate a different approach from other forms of research. The use of healthcare data over a long period of time is similar to the use of tissue in biobanks. There is a low risk to subjects but it is impossible to gain specific informed consent given the future possibilities for research. Large amounts of data on a subject present a finite risk of re-identification. Consequently, there is a balancing act between this risk and retaining sufficient utility of the data. Anonymising methods need to take into account the circumstances of data sharing to enable an appropriate balance in all cases. There are ethical and policy advantages to exceeding the legal requirements and thereby securing the social licence for research. This process would require the examination and comparison of data protection laws across the trading bloc to produce an ethico-legal framework compatible with the requirements of all member states.

Ploug_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"In Defence of informed consent for health record research - why arguments from 'easy rescue', 'no harm' and 'consent bias' fail","Ploug, Thomas",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Health data holds great potential for improved treatments. Big data research and machine learning models have been shown to hold great promise for improved diagnostics and treatment planning. The potential is tied, however, to the availability of personal health data. In recent years, it has been argued that data from health records should be available for health research, and that individuals have a duty to make the data available for such research. A central point of debate is whether such secondary use of health data requires informed consent. MAIN BODY: In response to recent writings this paper argues that a requirement of informed consent for health record research must be upheld. It does so by exploring different contrasting notions of the duty of easy rescue and arguing that none of them entail a perfect duty to participate in health record research. In part because the costs of participation cannot be limited to 1) the threat of privacy breaches, but includes 2) the risk of reduced trust and 3) suboptimal treatment, 4) stigmatization and 5) medicalisation, 6) further stratification of solidarity and 7) increased inequality in access to treatment and medicine. And finally, it defends the requirement of informed consent by arguing that the mere possibility of consent bias provides a rather weak reason for making research participation mandatory, and that there are strong, independent reasons for making. CONCLUSION: Arguments from the duty of easy rescue in combination with claims about little risk of harm and potential consent bias fail to establish not only a perfect duty to participate in health record research, but also that participation in such research should be mandatory. On the contrary, an analysis of these arguments indicates that the duty to participate in research is most adequately construed as an imperfect duty, and reveals a number of strong reasons for insisting that participation in health records research is based on informed consent.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00519-w,21,1,75,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Trust and Privacy and *Informed Consent and *Trust and Informed consent and Consent bias and Dissent and Disputes and Duty of easy rescue and Equality in health and Harm and Health data and Medicalization and Solidarity and Stigmatization,NA,NA,2020/08/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Degeling_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Community perspectives on the benefits and risks of technologically enhanced communicable disease surveillance systems: a report on four community juries,"Degeling, Chris and Carter, Stacy M. and van Oijen, Antoine M. and McAnulty, Jeremy and Sintchenko, Vitali and Braunack-Mayer, Annette and Yarwood, Trent and Johnson, Jane and Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of infectious disease cause serious and costly health and social problems. Two new technologies - pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Big Data analytics - promise to improve our capacity to detect and control outbreaks earlier, saving lives and resources. However, routinely using these technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information could be perceived as intrusive and a threat to privacy. METHOD: Four community juries were convened in two demographically different Sydney municipalities and two regional cities in New South Wales, Australia (western Sydney, Wollongong, Tamworth, eastern Sydney) to elicit the views of well-informed community members on the acceptability and legitimacy of: making pathogen WGS and linked administrative data available for public health researchusing this information in concert with data linkage and machine learning to enhance communicable disease surveillance systems Fifty participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited by random-digit-dialling and topic-blinded social-media advertising. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence supporting different expert perspectives on the potential benefits and costs of technologically enhanced public health research and communicable disease surveillance and given the opportunity to question experts. RESULTS: Almost all jurors supported data linkage and WGS on routinely collected patient isolates for the purposes of public health research, provided standard de-identification practices were applied. However, allowing this information to be operationalised as a syndromic surveillance system was highly contentious with three juries voting in favour, and one against by narrow margins. For those in favour, support depended on several conditions related to system oversight and security being met. Those against were concerned about loss of privacy and did not trust Australian governments to run secure and effective systems. CONCLUSIONS: Participants across all four events strongly supported the introduction of data linkage and pathogenomics to public health research under current research governance structures. Combining pathogen WGS with event-based data surveillance systems, however, is likely to be controversial because of a lack of public trust, even when the potential public health benefits are clear. Any suggestion of private sector involvement or commercialisation of WGS or surveillance data was unanimously rejected.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00474-6,21,1,31,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Infectious disease and Trust and Australia/epidemiology and *Communicable Diseases/epidemiology and Data-linkage and New South Wales/epidemiology and Pathogenomics and Public deliberation and Public health surveillance and Social licence,NA,NA,2020/04/25/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mouton.Dorey_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Patient data and patient rights: Swiss healthcare stakeholders' ethical awareness regarding large patient data sets - a qualitative study,"Mouton Dorey, Corine and Baumann, Holger and Biller-Andorno, Nikola",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in aggregating more biomedical and patient data into large health data sets for research and public benefits. However, collecting and processing patient data raises new ethical issues regarding patient's rights, social justice and trust in public institutions. The aim of this empirical study is to gain an in-depth understanding of the awareness of possible ethical risks and corresponding obligations among those who are involved in projects using patient data, i.e. healthcare professionals, regulators and policy makers. METHODS: We used a qualitative design to examine Swiss healthcare stakeholders' experiences and perceptions of ethical challenges with regard to patient data in real-life settings where clinical registries are sponsored, created and/or used. A semi-structured interview was carried out with 22 participants (11 physicians, 7 policy-makers, 4 ethical committee members) between July 2014 and January 2015. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using a thematic method derived from Grounded Theory. RESULTS: All interviewees were concerned as a matter of priority with the needs of legal and operating norms for the collection and use of data, whereas less interest was shown in issues regarding patient agency, the need for reciprocity, and shared governance in the management and use of clinical registries' patient data. This observed asymmetry highlights a possible tension between public and research interests on the one hand, and the recognition of patients' rights and citizens' involvement on the other. CONCLUSIONS: The advocation of further health-related data sharing on the grounds of research and public interest, without due regard for the perspective of patients and donors, could run the risk of fostering distrust towards healthcare data collections. Ultimately, this could diminish the expected social benefits. However, rather than setting patient rights against public interest, new ethical approaches could strengthen both concurrently. On a normative level, this study thus provides material from which to develop further ethical reflection towards a more cooperative approach involving patients and citizens in the governance of their health-related big data.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0261-x,19,1,20,eng,1472-6939,"Physicians and Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Big Data and Trust and Qualitative Research and Switzerland and Social Justice and *Awareness and Stakeholder Participation and *Community Participation and Social Control, Formal and Health data and *Moral Obligations and *Patient Rights and Administrative Personnel/*ethics and Agency and Clinical registries and Datasets as Topic/*ethics and Health Personnel/*ethics and Healthcare stakeholders and Justice and Patient rights and Reciprocity and Registries/ethics",NA,NA,2018/03/07/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Evans_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,A qualitative study of big data and the opioid epidemic: recommendations for data governance,"Evans, Elizabeth A. and Delorme, Elizabeth and Cyr, Karl and Goldstein, Daniel M.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic has enabled rapid and unsurpassed use of big data on people with opioid use disorder to design initiatives to battle the public health crisis, generally without adequate input from impacted communities. Efforts informed by big data are saving lives, yielding significant benefits. Uses of big data may also undermine public trust in government and cause other unintended harms. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify concerns and recommendations regarding how to use big data on opioid use in ethical ways. METHODS: We conducted focus groups and interviews in 2019 with 39 big data stakeholders (gatekeepers, researchers, patient advocates) who had interest in or knowledge of the Public Health Data Warehouse maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. RESULTS: Concerns regarding big data on opioid use are rooted in potential privacy infringements due to linkage of previously distinct data systems, increased profiling and surveillance capabilities, limitless lifespan, and lack of explicit informed consent. Also problematic is the inability of affected groups to control how big data are used, the potential of big data to increase stigmatization and discrimination of those affected despite data anonymization, and uses that ignore or perpetuate biases. Participants support big data processes that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions. Recommendations for ethical big data governance offer ways to narrow the big data divide (e.g., prioritize health equity, set off-limits topics/methods, recognize blind spots), enact shared data governance (e.g., establish community advisory boards), cultivate public trust and earn social license for big data uses (e.g., institute safeguards and other stewardship responsibilities, engage the public, communicate the greater good), and refocus ethical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Using big data to address the opioid epidemic poses ethical concerns which, if unaddressed, may undermine its benefits. Findings can inform guidelines on how to conduct ethical big data governance and in ways that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00544-9,21,1,101,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Big data and Qualitative methods and Qualitative Research and Data Anonymization and *Big Data and *Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects and Data governance and Opioid epidemic and Opioid Epidemic and Public health ethics",NA,NA,2020/10/21/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hohm_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"""It Was the Best Decision of My Life"": a thematic content analysis of former medical tourists' patient testimonials","Hohm, Carly and Snyder, Jeremy",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Medical tourism is international travel with the intention of receiving medical care. Medical tourists travel for many reasons, including cost savings, limited domestic access to specific treatments, and interest in accessing unproven interventions. Medical tourism poses new health and safety risks to patients, including dangers associated with travel following surgery, difficulty assessing the quality of care abroad, and complications in continuity of care. Online resources are important to the decision-making of potential medical tourists and the websites of medical tourism facilitation companies (companies that may or may not be affiliated with a clinic abroad and help patients plan their travel) are an important source of online information for these individuals. These websites fail to address the risks associated with medical tourism, which can undermine the informed decision-making of potential medical tourists. Less is known about patient testimonials on these websites, which can be a particularly powerful influence on decision-making. METHODS: A thematic content analysis was conducted of patient testimonials hosted on the YouTube channels of four medical tourism facilitation companies. Five videos per company were viewed. The content of these videos was analyzed and themes identified and counted for each video. RESULTS: Ten main themes were identified. These themes were then grouped into three main categories: facilitator characteristics (e.g., mentions of the facilitator by name, reference to the price of the treatment or to cost savings); service characteristics (e.g., the quality and availability of the surgeon, the quality and friendliness of the support staff); and referrals (e.g., referrals to other potential medical tourists). These testimonials were found either not to mention risks associated with medical tourism or to claim that these risks can be effectively managed through the use of the facilitation company. The failure fully to address the risks of medical tourism can undermine the informed decision-making of potential medical tourists, particularly given the considerable influence on decision-making by patient testimonials. CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of these global companies is difficult, making the development of testimonials highlighting the risks of medical tourism essential. Additional research is needed on the impact of patient testimonial videos on the decision-making of potential medical tourists.",2015,10.1186/1472-6939-16-8,16,NA,8,eng,1472-6939,Risk and Patients and Humans and Internet and Videotape Recording and Health Facilities and *Decision Making and *Patient Satisfaction and *Medical Tourism,NA,NA,2015/01/22/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Snyder_2013_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"""Do your homework...and then hope for the best"": the challenges that medical tourism poses to Canadian family physicians' support of patients' informed decision-making","Snyder, Jeremy and Crooks, Valorie A. and Johnston, Rory and Dharamsi, Shafik",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Medical tourism-the practice where patients travel internationally to privately access medical care-may limit patients' regular physicians' abilities to contribute to the informed decision-making process. We address this issue by examining ways in which Canadian family doctors' typical involvement in patients' informed decision-making is challenged when their patients engage in medical tourism. METHODS: Focus groups were held with family physicians practicing in British Columbia, Canada. After receiving ethics approval, letters of invitation were faxed to family physicians in six cities. 22 physicians agreed to participate and focus groups ranged from two to six participants. Questions explored participants' perceptions of and experiences with medical tourism. A coding scheme was created using inductive and deductive codes that captured issues central to analytic themes identified by the investigators. Extracts of the coded data that dealt with informed decision-making were shared among the investigators in order to identify themes. Four themes were identified, all of which dealt with the challenges that medical tourism poses to family physicians' abilities to support medical tourists' informed decision-making. Findings relevant to each theme were contrasted against the existing medical tourism literature so as to assist in understanding their significance. RESULTS: Four key challenges were identified: 1) confusion and tensions related to the regular domestic physician's role in decision-making; 2) tendency to shift responsibility related to healthcare outcomes onto the patient because of the regular domestic physician's reduced role in shared decision-making; 3) strains on the patient-physician relationship and corresponding concern around the responsibility of the foreign physician; and 4) regular domestic physicians' concerns that treatments sought abroad may not be based on the best available medical evidence on treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Medical tourism is creating new challenges for Canadian family physicians who now find themselves needing to carefully negotiate their roles and responsibilities in the informed decision-making process of their patients who decide to seek private treatment abroad as medical tourists. These physicians can and should be educated to enable their patients to look critically at the information available about medical tourism providers and to ask critical questions of patients deciding to access care abroad.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-37,14,NA,37,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Focus Groups and British Columbia and *Physician's Role and Decision Making/*ethics and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and *Informed Consent/ethics/standards and *Medical Tourism/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/trends and *Physicians, Family/ethics/standards/trends and *Social Responsibility and Choice Behavior/ethics and Ethical Analysis",NA,NA,2013/09/22/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of the current study was to explore in-depth and to explain the decision-making process from the perspective of Mexican oncologists, parents, and affected adolescents and to identify the ethical principles that guide such decision-making. METHODS: Purposive, qualitative design based on individual, fact-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The participants were thirteen paediatric oncologists, 13 parents or primary carers, and six adolescents with incurable cancer. The participants were recruited from the paediatric oncology services of three national tertiary-care medical centres in Mexico City. RESULTS: The oncologists stated that they broach the subject of palliative management when they have determined that curative treatment has failed. Respect for autonomy was understood as the assent of the parent/adolescent to what the oncologist determined to be in the best interest of the adolescent. The oncologists thought that the adolescent should be involved in the decision-making. They also identified the ability to count on a palliative care clinic or service as an urgent need. For the parents, it was essential that the oncologist be truly interested in their adolescent child. The parents did not consider it necessary to inform the child about impending death. The adolescents stated that the honesty of their oncologists was important; however, several of them opted for a passive role in the decision-making process.

Meyer.Zehnder_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,How to introduce medical ethics at the bedside - Factors influencing the implementation of an ethical decision-making model,"Meyer-Zehnder, Barbara and Albisser Schleger, Heidi and Tanner, Sabine and Schnurrer, Valentin and Vogt, Deborah R. and Reiter-Theil, Stella and Pargger, Hans",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: As the implementation of new approaches and procedures of medical ethics is as complex and resource-consuming as in other fields, strategies and activities must be carefully planned to use the available means and funds responsibly. Which facilitators and barriers influence the implementation of a medical ethics decision-making model in daily routine? Up to now, there has been little examination of these factors in this field. METHODS: A medical ethics decision-making model called METAP was introduced on three intensive care units and two geriatric wards. An evaluation study was performed from 7 months after deployment of the project until two and a half years. Quantitative and qualitative methods including a questionnaire, semi-structured face-to-face and group-interviews were used. RESULTS: Sixty-three participants from different professional groups took part in 33 face-to-face and 9 group interviews, and 122 questionnaires could be analysed. The facilitating factors most frequently mentioned were: acceptance and presence of the model, support given by the medical and nursing management, an existing or developing (explicit) ethics culture, perception of a need for a medical ethics decision-making model, and engaged staff members. Lack of presence and acceptance, insufficient time resources and staff, poor inter-professional collaboration, absence of ethical competence, and not recognizing ethical problems were identified as inhibiting the implementation of the METAP model. However, the results of the questionnaire as well as of explicit inquiry showed that the respondents stated to have had enough time and staff available to use METAP if necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitators and barriers of the implementation of a medical ethics decision-making model are quite similar to that of medical guidelines. The planning for implementing an ethics model or guideline can, therefore, benefit from the extensive literature and experience concerning the implementation of medical guidelines. Lack of time and staff can be overcome when people are convinced that the benefits justify the effort.",2017,10.1186/s12910-017-0174-0,18,1,16,eng,1472-6939,"Hospitalization and Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Implementation and Models, Theoretical and Surveys and Questionnaires and Workload and Intensive Care Units and Barriers and *Ethics, Medical and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Medical ethics and Decision Making/*ethics and Ethical decision-making model and Facilitators and Personnel, Hospital/supply & distribution",NA,NA,2017/02/23/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fukuda_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Parents' attitudes towards and perceptions of involving minors in medical research from the Japanese perspective,"Fukuda, Yasue and Fukuda, Koji",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Children's intentions should be respected. Parents are the key persons involved in decision-making related to their children. In Japan, the appropriate ages and standards for a child's consent and assent, approval, and decision-making are not clearly defined, which makes the process of obtaining consent and assent for clinical research complex. The purpose of this paper is as follows: to understand the attitudes and motives of parents concerning children's participation in medical research and the factors influencing their decision-making. We also sought to clarify who has the right to be involved in decisions regarding children's participation in research. METHODS: A semi-structured Internet survey on parents' opinions and attitudes and preferences concerning medical research involvement was conducted. Children were divided into three age groups (6-10-year-olds, 11-14-year-olds, and 15-18-year-olds), with three illness severity categories. Possible correlations between the number of children, children's ages, parents' educational levels, and parents' attitudes were examined. RESULTS: Among the participants, 42.3% recognized the term ""informed consent."" The proportion of participants who understood ""informed consent"" increased with educational level. Four out of five participants did not know, or had not heard of, the term ""informed assent."" Furthermore, the percentage of those who understood the term ""informed assent"" increased with academic level. Participants generally believed in prioritizing parents' opinions over children's, and that parents and children would ideally reach a joint decision. Although many parents favored collaborative decision-making, they also wanted their own will reflected in the decision and felt they should receive important information before their children do. Decision-making was affected by the condition's severity and prognosis. This indicates that most Japanese parents believe that their children have the right to know their disease name and treatment; nonetheless, they should be protected. Parents' values and judgments regarding medical intervention involving their children varied. CONCLUSIONS: Children's ability to consent to treatment and research believed to be in their best interests should be assessed appropriately. They should be permitted to provide consent or assent, and their views should be respected. Involving children in decision-making fosters more open communication and transparency between medical professionals, parents, and children.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0330-1,19,1,91,eng,1472-6939,Medical research and Medical treatment and Children and Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Surveys and Questionnaires and Educational Status and Attitude to Health and Age Factors and Japan and Decision Making/ethics and Informed consent and Parents/*psychology and Biomedical Research/*ethics and Informed assent and Informed Consent By Minors/ethics/psychology and Informed Consent/ethics/psychology and Minors and Parental attitude and Parental permission,NA,NA,2018/11/21/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Page_2012_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The four principles: can they be measured and do they predict ethical decision making?,"Page, Katie",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed.",2012,10.1186/1472-6939-13-10,13,NA,10,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Judgment and Intention and Religion and Medicine and *Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and *Beneficence and *Social Justice/ethics and Blood Transfusion/ethics and Confidentiality/ethics and Fertilization in Vitro/ethics and Ownership/ethics and Suicide, Assisted/ethics",NA,NA,2012/05/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Clarke_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Eating and drinking interventions for people at risk of lacking decision-making capacity: who decides and how?,"Clarke, Gemma and Galbraith, Sarah and Woodward, Jeremy and Holland, Anthony and Barclay, Stephen",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Some people with progressive neurological diseases find they need additional support with eating and drinking at mealtimes, and may require artificial nutrition and hydration. Decisions concerning artificial nutrition and hydration at the end of life are ethically complex, particularly if the individual lacks decision-making capacity. Decisions may concern issues of life and death: weighing the potential for increasing morbidity and prolonging suffering, with potentially shortening life. When individuals lack decision-making capacity, the standard processes of obtaining informed consent for medical interventions are disrupted. Increasingly multi-professional groups are being utilised to make difficult ethical decisions within healthcare. This paper reports upon a service evaluation which examined decision-making within a UK hospital Feeding Issues Multi-Professional Team. METHODS: A three month observation of a hospital-based multi-professional team concerning feeding issues, and a one year examination of their records. The key research questions are: a) How are decisions made concerning artificial nutrition for individuals at risk of lacking decision-making capacity? b) What are the key decision-making factors that are balanced? c) Who is involved in the decision-making process? RESULTS: Decision-making was not a singular decision, but rather involved many different steps. Discussions involving relatives and other clinicians, often took place outside of meetings. Topics of discussion varied but the outcome relied upon balancing the information along four interdependent axes: (1) Risks, burdens and benefits; (2) Treatment goals; (3) Normative ethical values; (4) Interested parties. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making was a dynamic ongoing process with many people involved. The multiple points of decision-making, and the number of people involved with the decision-making process, mean the question of 'who decides' cannot be fully answered. There is a potential for anonymity of multiple decision-makers to arise. Decisions in real world clinical practice may not fit precisely into a model of decision-making. The findings from this service evaluation illustrate that within multi-professional team decision-making; decisions may contain elements of both substituted and supported decision-making, and may be better represented as existing upon a continuum.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0034-8,16,NA,41,eng,1472-6939,"Risk and Hospitals and Humans and Quality of Health Care and United Kingdom and Program Evaluation and Morals and Interprofessional Relations and Terminal Care and *Ethics, Medical and *Informed Consent and *Mental Competency and Decision Making/*ethics and Drinking and *Eating and Group Processes and Nutritional Support/*ethics",NA,NA,2015/06/11/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Torabi_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Experiences of pre-hospital emergency medical personnel in ethical decision-making: a qualitative study,"Torabi, Mohammad and Borhani, Fariba and Abbaszadeh, Abbas and Atashzadeh-Shoorideh, Foroozan",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Emergency care providers regularly deal with ethical dilemmas that must be addressed. In comparison with in-hospital nurses, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are faced with more problems such as distance to resources including personnel, medico-technical aids, and information; the unpredictable atmosphere at the scene; arriving at the crime scene and providing emergency care for accident victims and patients at home. As a result of stressfulness, unpredictability, and often the life threatening nature of tasks that ambulance professionals have to deal with every day, ethical decision-making (EDM) has become an inevitable challenge. METHODS: The content analysis approach was used to conduct the present qualitative study in Iran. The participants consisted of 14 EMS personnel selected through purposive sampling, which continued until the data became saturated. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed concurrently with their collection through the constant comparison method. RESULTS: The process of data analysis resulted in the emergence of 3 main categories ""respecting client's values"", ""performing tasks within the professional manner"", ""personal characteristic"", and the emergence of eight (8) sub-categories signifying participants' experiences with regard to EDM. CONCLUSION: According to the results, when EMS personnel are faced with ethical dilemmas, they consider the client's values and professional dignity, and perform the assigned tasks within the framework of the regulation. The findings also suggest that pre-hospital care providers assess legal consequences before making any decision.

Zurcher_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The notion of free will and its ethical relevance for decision-making capacity,"Zurcher, Tobias and Elger, Bernice and Trachsel, Manuel",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Obtaining informed consent from patients is a moral and legal duty and, thus, a key legitimation for medical treatment. The pivotal prerequisite for valid informed consent is decision-making capacity of the patient. Related to the question of whether and when consent should be morally and legally valid, there has been a long-lasting philosophical debate about freedom of will and the connection of freedom and responsibility. MAIN TEXT: The scholarly discussion on decision-making capacity and its clinical evaluation does not sufficiently take into account this fundamental debate. It is contended that the notion of free will must be reflected when evaluating decision-making capacity. Namely, it should be included as a part of the appreciation-criterion for decision-making capacity. The argumentation is mainly drawn on the compatibilism of Harry Frankfurt. CONCLUSIONS: A solution is proposed which at the same time takes the notion of free will seriously and enriches the traditional understanding of decision-making capacity, strengthening its justificatory force while remaining clinically applicable.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0371-0,20,1,31,eng,1472-6939,Ethics and Humans and Competence and *Decision Making and *Personal Autonomy and Informed consent and *Mental Competency/psychology and Authenticity and Autonomy and Compatibilism and Decision-making capacity and Free will and Harry Frankfurt and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology,NA,NA,2019/05/08/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Aggarwal_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"""Nudge"" in the clinical consultation--an acceptable form of medical paternalism?","Aggarwal, Ajay and Davies, Joanna and Sullivan, Richard",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Libertarian paternalism is a concept derived from cognitive psychology and behavioural science. It is behind policies that frame information in such a way as to encourage individuals to make choices which are in their best interests, while maintaining their freedom of choice. Clinicians may view their clinical consultations as far removed from the realms of cognitive psychology but on closer examination there are a number of striking similarities. DISCUSSION: Evidence has shown that decision making is prone to bias and not necessarily rational or logical, particularly during ill health. Clinicians will usually have an opinion about what course of action represents the patient's best interests and thus may ""frame"" information in a way which ""nudges"" patients into making choices which are considered likely to maximise their welfare. This may be viewed as interfering with patient autonomy and constitute medical paternalism and appear in direct opposition to the tenets of modern practice. However, we argue that clinicians have a responsibility to try and correct ""reasoning failure"" in patients. Some compromise between patient autonomy and medical paternalism is justified on these grounds and transparency of how these techniques may be used should be promoted. SUMMARY: Overall the extremes of autonomy and paternalism are not compatible in a responsive, responsible and moral health care environment, and thus some compromise of these values is unavoidable. Nudge techniques are widely used in policy making and we demonstrate how they can be applied in shared medical decision making. Whether or not this is ethically sound is a matter of continued debate but health care professionals cannot avoid the fact they are likely to be using nudge within clinical consultations. Acknowledgment of this will lead to greater self-awareness, reflection and provide further avenues for debate on the art and science of clinical communication.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-31,15,NA,31,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Cooperative Behavior and Patient Participation and Morals and Ethics, Medical and *Policy Making and *Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Patient-Centered Care/methods and Choice Behavior/ethics and Paternalism/*ethics and Referral and Consultation/*ethics",NA,NA,2014/04/17/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Torabi_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Barriers to ethical decision-making for pre-hospital care professionals,"Torabi, Mohammad and Borhani, Fariba and Abbaszadeh, Abbas and Atashzadeh-Shoorideh, Foroozan",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Emergency care providers are frequently faces with situations in which they have to make decisions quickly in stressful situations.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify barriers of ethical decision-making in Iranian Emergency Medical Service personnel. METHODS: In this qualitative research, the participants (n = 15) were selected using the purposive sampling method, and the data were collected by deep and semi-structured interviews. Finally, the data are analyzed using the content analysis approach.

Studies showed that physicians are often insufficiently trained in the evaluation of decision-making capacity. In this study, we present findings from a secondary analysis of a qualitative interviews with physicians. These interviews were initially used to assess usability of an instrument for the evaluation of decision-making capacity. By looking at difficult cases of decision-making capacity evaluation in patients with dementia, we provide recommendations for such evaluations in clinical practice. METHODS: We used thematic coding to analyse physicians' narratives of problematic decision-making capacity evaluations in patients with dementia to uncover challenging issues of decision-making capacity evaluation. RESULTS: In this study, decision-making capacity evaluations in patients with dementia were mainly perceived as challenging when they pertained to treatment refusals and treatment unrelated circumstances, such as psychiatric consultation, advance directives, and new living arrangements. Furthermore, the physicians reported training needs regarding situation-independent challenges with decision-making capacity evaluation.

Salter_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,"The new futility? The rhetoric and role of ""suffering"" in pediatric decision-making","Salter, Erica K.",Nursing ethics,"This article argues that while the presence and influence of ""futility"" as a concept in medical decision-making has declined over the past decade, medicine is seeing the rise of a new concept with similar features: suffering. Like futility, suffering may appear to have a consistent meaning, but in actuality, the concept is colloquially invoked to refer to very different experiences. Like ""futility,"" claims of patient ""suffering"" have been used (perhaps sometimes consciously, but most often unconsciously) to smuggle value judgments about quality of life into decision-making. And like ""futility,"" it would behoove us to recognize the need for new, clearer terminology. This article will focus specifically on secondhand claims of patient suffering in pediatrics, but the conclusions could be similarly applied to medical decisions for adults being made by surrogate decision-makers. While I will argue that suffering, like futility, is not sufficient wholesale justification for making unilateral treatment decisions, I will also argue that claims of patient suffering cannot be ignored, and that they almost always deserve some kind of response.

Hein_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Why is it hard to make progress in assessing children's decision-making competence?,"Hein, Irma M. and Troost, Pieter W. and Broersma, Alice and de Vries, Martine C. and Daams, Joost G. and Lindauer, Ramon J. L.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: For decades, the discussion on children's competence to consent to medical issues has concentrated around normative concerns, with little progress in clinical practices. Decision-making competence is an important condition in the informed consent model. In pediatrics, clinicians need to strike a proper balance in order to both protect children's interests when they are not fully able to do so themselves and to respect their autonomy when they are. Children's competence to consent, however, is currently not assessed in a standardized way. Moreover, the correlation between competence to give informed consent and age in children has never been systematically investigated, nor do we know which factors exactly contribute to children's competence.This article aims at identifying these gaps in knowledge and suggests options for dealing with the obstacles in empirical research in order to advance policies and practices regarding children's medical decision-making competence. DISCUSSION: Understanding children's competency is hampered by the law. Legislative regulations concerning competency are established on a strong presumption that persons older than a certain age are competent, whereas younger persons are not. Furthermore, a number of contextual factors are believed to be of influence on a child's decision-making competence: the developmental stage of children, the influence of parents and peers, the quality of information provision, life experience, the type of medical decision, and so on. Ostensibly, these diverse and extensive barriers hinder any form of advancement in this conflicted area. Addressing these obstacles encourages the discussion on children's competency, in which the most prominent question concerns the lack of a clear operationalization of children's competence to consent. Empirical data are needed to substantiate the discussion. SUMMARY: The empirical approach offers an opportunity to give direction to the debate. Recommendations for future research include: studying a standardized assessment instrument covering all four relevant dimensions of competence (understanding, reasoning, appreciation, expressing a choice), including a study population of children covering the full age range of 7 to 18 years, improving information provision, and assessing relevant contextual data.",2015,10.1186/1472-6939-16-1,16,NA,1,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Adolescent and Child and Comprehension and Age Factors and Empirical Research and *Decision Making and Child Development and Thinking and *Mental Competency and *Informed Consent/ethics/psychology and *Pediatrics/ethics and Adolescent Development,NA,NA,2015/01/10/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gomez.Virseda_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Relational autonomy: what does it mean and how is it used in end-of-life care? A systematic review of argument-based ethics literature,"Gomez-Virseda, Carlos and de Maeseneer, Yves and Gastmans, Chris",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Respect for autonomy is a key concept in contemporary bioethics and end-of-life ethics in particular. Despite this status, an individualistic interpretation of autonomy is being challenged from the perspective of different theoretical traditions. Many authors claim that the principle of respect for autonomy needs to be reconceptualised starting from a relational viewpoint. Along these lines, the notion of relational autonomy is attracting increasing attention in medical ethics. Yet, others argue that relational autonomy needs further clarification in order to be adequately operationalised for medical practice. To this end, we examined the meaning, foundations, and uses of relational autonomy in the specific literature of end-of-life care ethics. METHODS: Using PRESS and PRISMA procedures, we conducted a systematic review of argument-based ethics publications in 8 major databases of biomedical, philosophy, and theology literature that focused on relational autonomy in end-of-life care. Full articles were screened. All included articles were critically appraised, and a synthesis was produced. RESULTS: Fifty publications met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight articles were published in the last 5 years; publications were originating from 18 different countries. Results are organized according to: (a) an individualistic interpretation of autonomy; (b) critiques of this individualistic interpretation of autonomy; (c) relational autonomy as theoretically conceptualised; (d) relational autonomy as applied to clinical practice and moral judgment in end-of-life situations. CONCLUSIONS: Three main conclusions were reached. First, literature on relational autonomy tends to be more a 'reaction against' an individualistic interpretation of autonomy rather than be a positive concept itself. Dichotomic thinking can be overcome by a deeper development of the philosophical foundations of autonomy. Second, relational autonomy is a rich and complex concept, formulated in complementary ways from different philosophical sources. New dialogue among traditionally divergent standpoints will clarify the meaning. Third, our analysis stresses the need for dialogical developments in decision making in end-of-life situations. Integration of these three elements will likely lead to a clearer conceptualisation of relational autonomy in end-of-life care ethics. This should in turn lead to better decision-making in real-life situations.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0417-3,20,1,76,eng,1472-6939,"Decision making and Humans and End of life and Physician-Patient Relations and Morals and Review and *Decision Making and Medical ethics and Dissent and Disputes and Terminal Care/*ethics and *Relational Autonomy and Informed Consent/ethics and Philosophy, Medical and Relational autonomy and Respect for autonomy",NA,NA,2019/10/26/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also identified the challenges, the motives interfering in decision-making, and the consequences of the decisions on pregnancy, child and mother. METHODS: This descriptive, prospective and longitudinal study was conducted in France, amongst pregnant women who wished to continue their pregnancy despite an unfavorable medical advice (incurable fetal cardiac pathologies). Socio-demographic data were collected through a questionnaire. Such questionnaire covered information assessing the parents/mother's perception of prenatal diagnosis, and medical termination of pregnancy, their interpretation of the established diagnosis and their motives for not considering pregnancy termination. RESULTS: 72 eligible patients were analyzed over one year: mean age 33 <c2><b1> 6.89 years, 47 patients had already given birth to <e2><89><a5>1 healthy child. Mean gestational age at the detection of fetal cardiac pathologies was 30 <c2><b1> 4.37 weeks of amenorrhea. Patients decided to keep the child after 3 <c2><b1> 1.25 consultations. 56 (77.78%) patients made their decision with their husbands and 16 made their decision alone. Reasons for declining the medical termination were culpability and responsibility (n = 36), ideologies and convictions (n = 24), mistrust and hope (n = 12). Newborns of 67 patients died with a mean survival duration of 38 days. CONCLUSIONS: Patient informed consent should be sought before any decision in neonatology, even if conflicting with the medical team's knowledge and the pregnant mother's benefits.

Wiskin_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"Beyond 'health and safety' - the challenges facing students asked to work outside of their comfort, qualification level or expertise on medical elective placement","Wiskin, Connie and Dowell, Jonathan and Hale, Catherine",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: On elective students may not always be clear about safeguarding themselves and others. It is important that placements are safe, and ethically grounded. A concern for medical schools is equipping their students for exposure to and response to uncomfortable and/or unfamiliar requests in locations away from home, where their comfort and safety, or that of the patient, may be compromised. This can require legal, ethical, and/or moral reasoning on the part of the student. The goal of this article is to establish what students actually encounter on elective, to inform better preparing students for safe and ethical medical placements. We discuss the implications of our findings, which are arguably applicable to other areas of graduate training, e.g. first medical roles post-qualification. METHOD: An anonymised survey exploring clinical and ethical dilemmas on elective was issued across 3 years of returning final year elective medical students. Questions included the prevalence and type of potentially unsafe scenarios encountered, barriers to saying 'no' in unsafe situations, perceived differences between resource poor and developed world settings and the degree to which students refused or consented to participation in events outside of the 'norms' of their own training experience. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-nine students participated. 45% were asked to do something ""not permissible"" at home. 27% were asked to do something they felt ""uncomfortable"" with, often an invasive clinical task. Half asked to do something not usually permissible were ""comfortable"". 48% felt it more acceptable to bypass guidelines in developing settings. 27% refused an offer outside their experience. CONCLUSION: Of interest are reasons for ""going along with"" uncomfortable invitations, e.g. ""emergency"", self-belief in 'capability' and being 'more qualified' than host-personnel. This ""best pair of hands available"" merits scrutiny. Adverse scenarios were not exclusive to developing settings. We discuss preparing students for decision-making in new contexts, and address whether 'home' processes are too inflexible to prepare students for 'real' medical life? Ethical decision-making and communicating reluctance should be included in elective preparation.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0307-0,19,1,74,eng,1472-6939,"Ethics and International and Safety and Humans and Female and Male and United Kingdom and Students and Clinical Competence and *Students, Medical/psychology and *Patient Safety and Education, Medical/ethics/methods and Electives and Evaluations and Limitations and Schools, Medical/ethics/organization & administration and Supervision",NA,NA,2018/07/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Essex_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Do codes of ethics and position statements help guide ethical decision making in Australian immigration detention centres?,"Essex, Ryan",BMC medical ethics,"Australian immigration detention has been called state sanctioned abuse and a crime against humanity. The Australian healthcare community has been closely involved with these policies, calling for their reform and working within detention centres to provide healthcare. As well as having a devastating impact on health, immigration detention changes the scope and nature of healthcare, with its delivery described as a Sisyphean task. In this article I will explore the guidance that is available to clinicians who work within detention centres and argue that codes, guidelines and positions statements provide little help in relation to ethical decision making. First I will outline guidance that can be found in codes of ethics and position statements, focusing on particularly relevant principles, such as advocacy, clinical independence and the clinicians' relationship to human rights. I will then highlight the disparity between this guidance and the delivery of healthcare within detention by drawing on the testimony of clinicians who formerly worked in these environments. While this disparity should be cause for alarm and at a minimum call into question how codes and positions statements are being used (if at all), there are more fundamental reasons why codes and position statements fail to provide guidance in these circumstances. I will outline a more general criticism of codes of ethics and use this to suggest a way forward, including looking beyond codes and position statements to guide action within Australian immigration detention.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0392-8,20,1,52,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Healthcare and Australia and Migration and Codes of ethics and Decision Making/*ethics and *Organizational Policy and Clinical ethics and *Codes of Ethics and *Emigrants and Immigrants/legislation & jurisprudence and *Health Services Accessibility/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Asylum seeker and Human rights and Immigration detention and Refugee and Refugee Camps/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Refugees/legislation & jurisprudence and Societies, Medical/ethics/standards",NA,NA,2019/07/23/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wangmo_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical concerns with the use of intelligent assistive technology: findings from a qualitative study with professional stakeholders,"Wangmo, Tenzin and Lipps, Mirjam and Kressig, Reto W. and Ienca, Marcello",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and wearable computing are creating novel technological opportunities for mitigating the global burden of population ageing and improving the quality of care for older adults with dementia and/or age-related disability. Intelligent assistive technology (IAT) is the umbrella term defining this ever-evolving spectrum of intelligent applications for the older and disabled population. However, the implementation of IATs has been observed to be sub-optimal due to a number of barriers in the translation of novel applications from the designing labs to the bedside. Furthermore, since these technologies are designed to be used by vulnerable individuals with age- and multi-morbidity-related frailty and cognitive disability, they are perceived to raise important ethical challenges, especially when they involve machine intelligence, collect sensitive data or operate in close proximity to the human body. Thus, the goal of this paper is to explore and assess the ethical issues that professional stakeholders perceive in the development and use of IATs in elderly and dementia care. METHODS: We conducted a multi-site study involving semi-structured qualitative interviews with researchers and health professionals. We analyzed the interview data using a descriptive thematic analysis to inductively explore relevant ethical challenges. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that professional stakeholders find issues of patient autonomy and informed consent, quality of data management, distributive justice and human contact as ethical priorities. Divergences emerged in relation to how these ethical issues are interpreted, how conflicts between different ethical principles are resolved and what solutions should be implemented to overcome current challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a general agreement among professional stakeholders on the ethical promises and challenges raised by the use of IATs among older and disabled users. Yet, notable divergences persist regarding how these ethical challenges can be overcome and what strategies should be implemented for the safe and effective implementation of IATs. These findings provide technology developers with useful information about unmet ethical needs. Study results may guide policy makers with firsthand information from relevant stakeholders about possible solutions for ethically-aligned technology governance.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0437-z,20,1,98,eng,1472-6939,Artificial intelligence and Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Dementia and Europe and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Care and Health Personnel/psychology and Robotics and Stakeholder Participation and Research Personnel/psychology and Artificial Intelligence/*ethics and Justice and Autonomy and Assistive technology and Robotics/ethics and Self-Help Devices/*ethics,NA,NA,2019/12/19/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Masaki_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Contemporary issues concerning informed consent in Japan based on a review of court decisions and characteristics of Japanese culture,"Masaki, Sakiko and Ishimoto, Hiroko and Asai, Atsushi",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Since Japan adopted the concept of informed consent from the West, its inappropriate acquisition from patients in the Japanese clinical setting has continued, due in part to cultural aspects. Here, we discuss the current status of and contemporary issues surrounding informed consent in Japan, and how these are influenced by Japanese culture. DISCUSSION: Current legal norms towards informed consent and information disclosure are obscure in Japan. For instance, physicians in Japan do not have a legal duty to inform patients of a cancer diagnosis. To gain a better understanding of these issues, we present five court decisions related to informed consent and information disclosure. We then discuss Japanese culture through reviews of published opinions and commentaries regarding how culture affects decision making and obtaining informed consent. We focus on two contemporary problems involving informed consent and relevant issues in clinical settings: the misuse of informed consent and persistence in obtaining consent. For the former issue, the phrase ""informed consent"" is often used to express an opportunity to disclose medical conditions and recommended treatment choices. The casual use of the expression ""informed consent"" likely reflects deep-rooted cultural influences. For the latter issue, physicians may try to obtain a signature by doing whatever it takes, lacking a deep understanding of important ethical principles, such as protecting human dignity, serving the patient's best interest, and doing no harm in decision-making for patients.There is clearly a misunderstanding of the concept of informed consent and a lack of complete understanding of ethical principles among Japanese healthcare professionals. Although similar in some respects to informed consent as it originated in the United States, our review makes it clear that informed consent in Japan has clear distinguishing features. SUMMARY: Japanese healthcare professionals should aim to understand the basic nature of informed consent, irrespective of their attitudes about individualism, liberalism, and patient self-determination. If they believe that the concept of informed consent is important and essential in Japanese clinical settings, efforts should be made to obtain informed consent in an appropriate manner.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-8,15,NA,8,eng,1472-6939,"Disclosure and Humans and Female and Male and Risk Assessment and Physician-Patient Relations and Patient Access to Records and Patient Advocacy and Ethics, Medical and Cultural Characteristics and *Physicians and Decision Making/*ethics and Jurisprudence and *Legislation, Medical/ethics/trends and *Patient Rights/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Truth Disclosure/ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Japan/ethnology and Personhood",NA,NA,2014/02/04/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Forte_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,A bioethical framework to guide the decision-making process in the care of seriously ill patients,"Forte, Daniel Neves and Kawai, Fernando and Cohen, Claudio",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: One of the biggest challenges of practicing medicine in the age of informational technology is how to conciliate the overwhelming amount of medical-scientific information with the multiple patients' values of modern pluralistic societies. To organize and optimize the the Decision-Making Process (DMP) of seriously ill patient care, we present a framework to be used by Healthcare Providers. The objective is to align Bioethics, Evidence-based Practice and Person-centered Care. MAIN BODY: The framework divides the DMP into four steps, each with a different but complementary focus, goal and ethical principle. Step 1 focuses exclusively on the disease, having accuracy is its ethical principle. It aims at an accurate and probabilistic estimation of prognosis, absolute risk reduction, relative risk reduction and treatments' burdens. Step 2 focuses on the person, using empathic communication to learn about patient values and what suffering means for the patient. Emphasis is given to learning and active listening, not taking action. Thus, instead beneficence, we trust comprehension and understanding with the suffering of others and respect for others as autonomous moral agents as the ethical principles of Step 2. Step 3 focuses on the healthcare team, having the ethics of situational awareness guiding this step. The goal is, through effective teamwork, to contextualize and link rates and probabilities related to the disease to the learned patient's values, presenting a summary of which treatments the team considers as acceptable, recommended, potentially inappropriate and futile. Finally, Step 4 focuses on provider-patient relationship, seeking shared Goals of Care (GOC), for the best and worst scenario. Through an ethics of deliberation, it aims for a consensus that could ensure that the patient's values will be respected as well as a scientifically acceptable medical practice will be provided. In summary: accuracy, comprehension, understanding, situational awareness and deliberation would be the ethical principles guiding each step. CONCLUSION: Hopefully, by highlighting and naming the different perspectives of knowledge needed in clinical practice, this framework will be valuable as a practical and educational tool, guiding modern medical professionals through the many challenges of providing high quality person-centered care that is both ethical and evidence based.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0317-y,19,1,78,eng,1472-6939,Decision-making and Humans and Decision Making/*ethics and Critical Illness/*therapy and Bioethics and Critical Care/*ethics and Evidence-based practice and Evidence-Based Practice/ethics and Patient-Centered Care/ethics and Person-centered care,NA,NA,2018/08/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Peicius_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Are advance directives helpful for good end of life decision making: a cross sectional survey of health professionals,"Peicius, Eimantas and Blazeviciene, Aurelija and Kaminskas, Raimondas",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: This paper joins the debate over changes in the role of health professionals when applying advance directives to manage the decision-making process at the end of life care. Issues in relation to advance directives occur in clinical units in Lithuania; however, it remains one of the few countries in the European Union (EU) where the discussion on advance directives is not included in the health-care policy-making agenda. To encourage the discussion of advance directives, a study was designed to examine health professionals' understanding and preferences related to advance directives. In addition, the study sought to explore the views of health care professionals of the application of Advance Directives (AD) in clinical practice in Lithuania. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by interviewing 478 health professionals based at major health care centers in Kaunas district, Lithuania. The design of the study included the use of a questionnaire developed for this study and validated by a pilot study. The collected data were analyzed using standard descriptive statistical methods. RESULTS: The analysis of knowledge about AD revealed some statistically significant differences when comparing the respondents' profession and gender. The analysis also indicated key emerging themes among respondents including tranquility of mind, the longest possible life expectancy and freedom of choice. Further, the study findings revealed that more than half of the study participants preferred to express their will while alive by using advance directives. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed a low level of knowledge on advance directives among health professionals. Most health professionals agreed that AD's improved end-of-life decision making while the majority of physicians appreciated AD as the best tool for sharing responsibilities in clinical practice in Lithuania.

Murgic_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Paternalism and autonomy: views of patients and providers in a transitional (post-communist) country,"Murgic, Lucija and Hebert, Philip C. and Sovic, Slavica and Pavlekovic, Gordana",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Patient autonomy is a fundamental, yet challenging, principle of professional medical ethics. The idea that individual patients should have the freedom to make choices about their lives, including medical matters, has become increasingly prominent in current literature. However, this has not always been the case, especially in communist countries where paternalistic attitudes have been interwoven into all relationships including medical ones. Patients' expectations and the role of the doctor in the patient-physician relationship are changing. Croatia, as a transitional country, is currently undergoing this particular process. METHODS: Qualitative research was conducted by means of six focus group discussions held in the years 2012 and 2013 in Croatia. Focus groups were held separately with each of the following: first year and final (6(th)) year medical students, physicians engaged in medical ethics education, physicians practicing in a clinical hospital, family medicine residents and individuals representing patients with chronic disease. This research specifically addresses issues related to patient autonomy, in particular, the principles of truth telling, confidentiality, and informed consent. All focus group discussions were audio taped and then transcribed verbatim and systematized according to acknowledged qualitative analysis methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patient autonomy is much more than a simple notion defined as the patient's right to make treatment decisions independently. It has to be understood in context of the broader socio-cultural setting. At present, both patients and medical doctors in Croatia are increasingly appreciating the importance of promoting the principle of autonomy in medical decision-making. However, the current views of medical students, physicians and patients reveal inconsistencies. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing how to respect the various facets of patients' autonomy should be part of physician's professional duties, and also be reflected in his or her core clinical competencies. For this reason greater importance should be dedicated to patient autonomy issues in medical education in Croatia.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0059-z,16,1,65,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Decision Making and Confidentiality and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and *Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology and Paternalism/*ethics and Croatia/epidemiology and Patient Rights/*ethics/trends",NA,NA,2015/09/29/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nagao_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Comparison of ethical judgments exhibited by clients and ethics consultants in Japan,"Nagao, Noriko and Kadooka, Yasuhiro and Asai, Atsushi",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals must make decisions for patients based on ethical considerations. However, they rely on clinical ethics consultations (CEC) to review ethical justifications of their decisions. CEC consultants support the cases reviewed and guide medical care. When both healthcare professionals and CEC consultants face ethical problems in medical care, how is their judgment derived? How do medical judgments differ from the ethical considerations of CECs? This study examines CECs in Japan to identify differences in the ethical judgment of clients and CEC consultants. METHODS: The CEC request and response documents of all 60 cases reviewed across Japan between October 2006 and the end of October 2011 were classified in terms of the presence of decisional capacity in the patient. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the differences in reasoning between client and CEC consultants. Reasoned judgments were verified in individual cases to classify the similarities or differences of opinion between CEC clients and teams. RESULTS: As the result of classification of the decisional capacity and the difference of opinion regarding medical care, the most frequent category was 25 cases (41.7%) of ""uncertain decisional capacity,"" and 23 cases (38.3%) of ""withholding of decision-making."" A chi-square analysis was performed on presence of decisional capacity and agreement in decision-making, yielding a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). The CEC consultants' reasoning was based on ""patient's preference was ambiguous,"" ""validity of family as a surrogate,"" ""estimation of patient preference,"" and ""patient's best interest,"" whereas the CEC client's reasoning was based on ""consistent family preference was shown/not shown"" and ""appropriate therapeutic methods to manage patient safety."" CONCLUSION: Differences in opinions were found in cases classified according to decisional capacity. Furthermore, the reasoning behind judgments differed between CEC clients and CEC consultants. The reasoning of CEC consultants was critical and reflective, while for clients it was situational and pragmatic.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-19,15,NA,19,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Male and Physician-Patient Relations and Quality of Life and Japan and Ethics, Clinical and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Ethics, Research and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Terminal Care/*ethics and *Ethics Committees, Clinical and *Ethics Consultation and Patient Advocacy/ethics",NA,NA,2014/03/04/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Yek_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Defining reasonable patient standard and preference for shared decision making among patients undergoing anaesthesia in Singapore,"Yek, J. L. J. and Lee, A. K. Y. and Tan, J. A. D. and Lin, G. Y. and Thamotharampillai, T. and Abdullah, H. R.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional study to ascertain what the Singapore population would regard as material risk in the anaesthesia consent-taking process and identify demographic factors that predict patient preferences in medical decision-making to tailor a more patient-centered informed consent. METHODS: A survey was performed involving patients 21 years old and above who attended the pre-operative evaluation clinic over a 1-month period in Singapore General Hospital. Questionnaires were administered to assess patients' perception of material risks, by trained interviewers. Patients' demographics were obtained. Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used. Statistical significance was taken at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred fourteen patients were eligible of which 26 refused to participate and 24 were excluded due to language barrier. 364 patients were recruited. A higher level of education (p < 0.007), being employed (p < 0.046) and younger age group (p < 0.003) are factors identified in patients who wanted greater participation in medical decisions. Gender, marital status, type of surgery, and previous surgical history did not affect their level of participation. The complications most patients knew about were Nausea (64.8%), Drowsiness (62.4%) and Surgical Wound Pain (58.8%). Patients ranked Heart Attack (59.3%), Death (53.8%) and Stroke (52.7%) as the most significant risks that they wanted to be informed about in greater detail. Most patients wanted to make a joint decision with the anaesthetist (52.2%), instead of letting the doctor decide (37.1%) or deciding for themselves (10.7%). Discussion with the anaesthetist (61.3%) is the preferred medium of communication compared to reading a pamphlet (23.4%) or watching a video (15.4%). CONCLUSION: Age and educational level can influence medical decision-making. Despite the digital age, most patients still prefer a clinic consult instead of audio-visual multimedia for pre-operative anaesthetic counselling. The local population appears to place greater importance on rare but serious complications compared to common complications.

Nordby_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The importance of reliable information exchange in emergency practices: a misunderstanding that was uncovered before it was too late,"Nordby, Halvor",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Many medical emergency practices are regulated by written procedures that normally provide reliable guidelines for action. In some cases, however, the consequences of following rule-based instructions can have unintended negative consequences. The article discusses a case - described on a type level - where the consequences of following a rule formulation could have been fatal. CASE PRESENTATION: A weak and elderly patient has cardiac arrest, and a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) clause is written in the patient's medical record. Paramedics at the scene cannot see that the patient's general appearance match conditions which would indicate the DNR clause, so they start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the patient survives. This turns out to be a crucial decision. The DNR clause is from an earlier bout with serious disease from which the patient has recovered, against all odds, and someone has forgotten to remove the clause from the medical record. ANALYSIS: In order to be able to interpret the validity of written guidelines, paramedics and other health workers need to develop personal skills that transcend the ability simply to follow written instructions. Within traditional virtue ethics, personal judgment is conceived of as crucial for being able to make 'good' autonomous decisions. Virtue ethical analyses, decision-making abilities and non-technical communication skills are important as conceptual tools when health workers need to make difficult clinical decisions. CONCLUSION: The case study accentuates the significance of prudent judgment in medical practice. In the case described, the consequence of trusting the written advance directive could have been fatal, but the point is general: for the purpose of achieving excellent organizational performance, it is insufficient for health workers to rely uncritically on rules and procedures. Even the clearest rule formulations must be interpreted contextually in order to determine ethically correct behavior and avoid potential negative consequences that are not in the patient's best interests.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0038-4,16,NA,46,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Aged and Comprehension and Morals and Medical Records and Guideline Adherence and Heart Arrest and Emergencies and *Communication and *Decision Making and *Judgment and *Resuscitation Orders and Emergency Medical Services/*ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and Allied Health Personnel/*ethics and Virtues",NA,NA,2015/07/07/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Alonso_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Critical appraisal of advance directives given by patients with fatal acute stroke: an observational cohort study,"Alonso, A. and Dorr, D. and Szabo, K.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Advance directives (AD) imply the promise of determining future medical treatment in case of decisional incapacity. However, clinical practice increasingly indicates that standardized ADs often fail to support patients' autonomy. To date, little data are available about the quality and impact of ADs on end-of-life decisions for incapacitated acute stroke patients. METHODS: We analyzed the ADs of patients with fatal stroke, focusing on: (a) their availability and type, (b) stated circumstances to which the AD should apply, and (c) stated wishes regarding specific treatment options. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2014, 143 patients died during their hospitalization on our stroke unit. Forty-two of them (29.4%) had a completed and signed, written AD, as reported by their family, but only 35 ADs (24.5%) were available. The circumstances in which the AD should apply were stated by 21/35 (60%) as a ""terminal condition that will cause death within a relatively short time"" or an ongoing ""dying process."" A retrospective review found only 16 of 35 ADs (45.7%) described circumstances that, according to the medical file, could have been considered applicable by the treating physicians. A majority of patients objected to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (22/35, 62.9%), mechanical ventilation (19/35, 54.3%), and artificial nutrition (26/35, 74.3%), while almost all (33/35, 94.3%) directed that treatment for alleviation of pain or discomfort should be provided at all times even if it could hasten death. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ADs among patients who die from acute stroke is still low. A major flaw of the ADs in our cohort was their attempt to determine single medical procedures without focusing on a precise description of applicable scenarios. Therefore, less than half of the ADs were considered applicable for severe acute stroke.

Baeroe_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Translational ethics: an analytical framework of translational movements between theory and practice and a sketch of a comprehensive approach,"Baeroe, Kristine",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Translational research in medicine requires researchers to identify the steps to transfer basic scientific discoveries from laboratory benches to bedside decision-making, and eventually into clinical practice. On a parallel track, philosophical work in ethics has not been obliged to identify the steps to translate theoretical conclusions into adequate practice. The medical ethicist A. Cribb suggested some years ago that it is now time to debate 'the business of translational' in medical ethics. Despite the very interesting and useful perspective on the field of medical ethics launched by Cribb, the debate is still missing. In this paper, I take up Cribb's invitation and discuss further analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice. DISCUSSION: The analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice are identified as 'movements of translation'. I explore briefly what would constitute success and limitations to these intended translational movements by addressing the challenges of the epistemological gap between philosophical and practical ethics. The categories of translational movements I suggest can serve as a starting point for a systematic, collective self-inspection and discussion of the merits and limitations of the various academic and practical activities that bioethicists are engaged in. I further propose that translational ethics could be considered as a new discipline of ethical work constructively structured around compositions of translational movements. SUMMARY: Breaking the idea of translational ethics into distinct translational movements provide us with a nuanced set of conditions to explore and discuss the justification and limitations of various efforts carried out in the field of bioethics. In this sense, the proposed framework could be a useful vehicle for augmented collective, self-reflexivity among both philosophers and practitioners who are 'doing bioethics'. Also, carefully designed, overall approaches combining justified, self-reflexive philosophical and practical efforts according to the suggested distinctions could be expected to realise - or at least improve a facilitation of - translation of ethics across the theory-practice gap.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-71,15,NA,71,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Decision Making and Philosophy and Information Dissemination and *Ethics, Medical and *Bioethics and *Ethical Analysis and *Ethical Theory and Ethicists and Translational Research, Biomedical/*ethics",NA,NA,2014/09/30/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nineteen nurses and 11 physicians from a single newborn intensive care unit participated. Using content analysis, an overarching obligation of creating the best possible experience for infants and parents was identified, within which two categories of obligations (decision making and the end of life itself) emerged. Obligations in decision making included talking to parents and timing withdrawal. End-of-life obligations included providing options, preparing parents, being with, advocating, creating peace and normalcy, and providing comfort. Nurses and physicians perceived obligations in both categories, although nurse obligations centered on the end of life while physician obligations focused on decision making.

Vyshka_2011_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Inapplicability of advance directives in a paternalistic setting: the case of a post-communist health system,"Vyshka, Gentian and Kruja, Jera",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The Albanian medical system and Albanian health legislation have adopted a paternalistic position with regard to individual decision making. This reflects the practices of a not-so-remote past when state-run facilities and a totalitarian philosophy of medical care were politically imposed. Because of this history, advance directives concerning treatment refusal and do-not-resuscitate decisions are still extremely uncommon in Albania. Medical teams cannot abstain from intervening even when the patient explicitly and repeatedly solicits therapeutic abstinence. The Albanian law on health care has no provisions regarding limits or withdrawal of treatment. This restricts the individual's healthcare choices. DISCUSSION: The question of 'medically futile' interventions and pointless life-prolonging treatment has been discussed by several authors. Dutch physicians call such interventions 'medisch zinloos' (senseless), and the Netherlands, as one of the first states to legislate on end-of-life situations, actually regulates such issues through appropriate laws. In contrast, leaving an 'advance directive' is not a viable option for Albanian ailing individuals of advanced age. Verbal requests are provided during periods of mental competence, but unfortunately such instructions are rarely taken seriously, and none of them has ever been upheld in a legal or other official forum. SUMMARY: End-of-life decisions, treatment refusal and do-not-resuscitate policies are hazardous options in Albania, from the legal point of view. Complying with them involves significant risk on the part of the physician. Culturally, the application of such instructions is influenced from a mixture of religious beliefs, death coping-behaviors and an immense confusion concerning the role of proxies as decision-makers. Nevertheless, Albanian tradition is familiar with the notion of 'amanet', a sort of living will that mainly deals the property and inheritance issues. Such living wills, verbally transmitted, may in certain cases include advance directives regarding end-of-life decisions of the patient including refusal or termination of futile medical treatments. Since these living wills are never formally and legally validated, their application is impossible and treatment refusal remains still non practicable.

Edvardsson_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ultrasound's 'window on the womb' brings ethical challenges for balancing maternal and fetal health interests: obstetricians' experiences in Australia,"Edvardsson, Kristina and Small, Rhonda and Lalos, Ann and Persson, Margareta and Mogren, Ingrid",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Obstetric ultrasound has become a significant tool in obstetric practice, however, it has been argued that its increasing use may have adverse implications for women's reproductive freedom. This study aimed to explore Australian obstetricians' experiences and views of the use of obstetric ultrasound both in relation to clinical management of complicated pregnancy, and in situations where maternal and fetal health interests conflict. METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken as part of the CROss-Country Ultrasound Study (CROCUS). Interviews were held in November 2012 with 14 obstetricians working in obstetric care in Victoria, Australia. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: One overall theme emerged from the analyses: The ethical challenge of balancing maternal and fetal health interests, built on four categories: First, Encountering maternal altruism' described how pregnant women's often 'altruistic' position in relation to the health and wellbeing of the fetus could create ethical challenges in obstetric management, particularly with an increasing imbalance between fetal benefits and maternal harms. Second, 'Facing shifting attitudes due to visualisation and medico-technical advances' illuminated views that ultrasound and other advances in care have contributed to a shift in what weight to give maternal versus fetal welfare, with increasing attention directed to the fetus. Third, 'Guiding expectant parents in decision-making' described the difficult task of facilitating informed decision-making in situations where maternal and fetal health interests were not aligned, or in situations characterised by uncertainty. Fourth, 'Separating private from professional views' illuminated divergent views on when the fetus can be regarded as a person. The narratives indicated that the fetus acquired more consideration in decision-making the further the gestation progressed. However, there was universal agreement that obstetricians could never act on fetal grounds without the pregnant woman's consent. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that medico-technical advances such as ultrasound have set the scene for increasing ethical dilemmas in obstetric practice. The obstetricians interviewed had experienced a shift in previously accepted views about what weight to give maternal versus fetal welfare. As fetal diagnostics and treatment continue to advance, how best to protect pregnant women's right to autonomy requires careful consideration and further investigation.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0023-y,16,NA,31,eng,1472-6939,"Physicians and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Australia and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Mothers and Patient Rights and Informed Consent and Ethics, Medical and Pregnancy Complications and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Gestational Age and Decision Making/*ethics and Personhood and *Fetus/diagnostic imaging and *Maternal Health and Obstetrics/*ethics and Prenatal Care/*ethics and Ultrasonography, Prenatal/*ethics",NA,NA,2015/05/08/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hindmarch_2013_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Depression and decision-making capacity for treatment or research: a systematic review,"Hindmarch, Thomas and Hotopf, Matthew and Owen, Gareth S.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders can pose problems in the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC). This is so particularly where psychopathology is seen as the extreme end of a dimension that includes normality. Depression is an example of such a psychiatric disorder. Four abilities (understanding, appreciating, reasoning and ability to express a choice) are commonly assessed when determining DMC in psychiatry and uncertainty exists about the extent to which depression impacts capacity to make treatment or research participation decisions. METHODS: A systematic review of the medical ethical and empirical literature concerning depression and DMC was conducted. Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies of depression and consent and DMC. Empirical studies and papers containing ethical analysis were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: 17 publications were identified. The clinical ethics studies highlighted appreciation of information as the ability that can be impaired in depression, indicating that emotional factors can impact on DMC. The empirical studies reporting decision-making ability scores also highlighted impairment of appreciation but without evidence of strong impact. Measurement problems, however, looked likely. The frequency of clinical judgements of lack of DMC in people with depression varied greatly according to acuity of illness and whether judgements are structured or unstructured. CONCLUSIONS: Depression can impair DMC especially if severe. Most evidence indicates appreciation as the ability primarily impaired by depressive illness. Understanding and measuring the appreciation ability in depression remains a problem in need of further research.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-54,14,NA,54,eng,1472-6939,Uncertainty and Humans and Comprehension and *Decision Making and *Judgment and Depression/*therapy and *Patient Participation/psychology and *Mental Competency/psychology and *Informed Consent/ethics/psychology/standards and Depressive Disorder/*therapy,NA,NA,2013/12/13/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shepherd_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Research involving adults lacking capacity to consent: the impact of research regulation on 'evidence biased' medicine,"Shepherd, Victoria",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Society is failing in its moral obligation to improve the standard of healthcare provided to vulnerable populations, such as people who lack decision making capacity, by a misguided paternalism that seeks to protect them by excluding them from medical research. Uncertainties surround the basis on which decisions about research participation is made under dual regulatory regimes, which adds further complexity. Vulnerable individuals' exclusion from research as a result of such regulation risks condemning such populations to poor quality care as a result of 'evidence biased' medicine. MAIN TEXT: This paper explores the research regulation provisions for proxy decision making for those unable to provide informed consent for themselves, and the subsequent legal and practical difficulties for decision-makers. There are two separate regulatory regimes governing research involving adults who lack capacity to consent in England and Wales. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 governs how incapacitated adults can be involved in research, however clinical trials of medicinal products are separately regulated by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. There are significant differences under these dual regimes in the provisions for those lacking capacity to participate in medical research. The level of risk permitted differs, with a greater requirement for justification for participation in a clinical trial than other types of research. Who acts as proxy decision maker, how much information is provided to the person lacking capacity, and whether they retain the power of veto also significantly differs. CONCLUSION: The development of two separate regulatory regimes has resulted in significant differences between the provisions for clinical trials and other forms of research, and from usual medical practice. The resulting uncertainty has reinforced the tendency of those approving and conducting research to exclude adults lacking capacity to avoid difficult decisions about seeking consent for their participation. Future developments, such as the incoming EU Regulations, may address some of these differences, however the justification and level of risk permitted requires review to ensure that requirements are appropriate and proportionate to the burdens and risks for the individual, and also to the benefits for the wider population represented.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0138-9,17,1,55,eng,1472-6939,Uncertainty and England and Humans and Healthcare Disparities and Adult and Risk Assessment and Paternalism and Bias and Access to Information and Personal Autonomy and Vulnerable Populations and Wales and *Decision Making and Mental Competency/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Government Regulation and Ethical Analysis and Informed Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Third-Party Consent and Biomedical Research/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Clinical Trials as Topic/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Research Subjects/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2016/09/08/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Gomez.Virseda_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Relational autonomy in end-of-life care ethics: a contextualized approach to real-life complexities,"Gomez-Virseda, Carlos and de Maeseneer, Yves and Gastmans, Chris",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Respect for autonomy is a paramount principle in end-of-life ethics. Nevertheless, empirical studies show that decision-making, exclusively focused on the individual exercise of autonomy fails to align well with patients' preferences at the end of life. The need for a more contextualized approach that meets real-life complexities experienced in end-of-life practices has been repeatedly advocated. In this regard, the notion of 'relational autonomy' may be a suitable alternative approach. Relational autonomy has even been advanced as a foundational notion of palliative care, shared decision-making, and advance-care planning. However, relational autonomy in end-of-life care is far from being clearly conceptualized or practically operationalized. MAIN BODY: Here, we develop a relational account of autonomy in end-of-life care, one based on a dialogue between lived reality and conceptual thinking. We first show that the complexities of autonomy as experienced by patients and caregivers in end-of-life practices are inadequately acknowledged. Second, we critically reflect on how engaging a notion of relational autonomy can be an adequate answer to addressing these complexities. Our proposal brings into dialogue different ethical perspectives and incorporates multidimensional, socially embedded, scalar, and temporal aspects of relational theories of autonomy. We start our reflection with a case in end-of-life care, which we use as an illustration throughout our analysis. CONCLUSION: This article develops a relational account of autonomy, which responds to major shortcomings uncovered in the mainstream interpretation of this principle and which can be applied to end-of-life care practices.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00495-1,21,1,50,eng,1472-6939,Decision making and Humans and Decision Making and Patient Preference and Advance Care Planning and Palliative Care and Personal Autonomy and *Terminal Care and Medical ethics and *Advance Care Planning and End-of-life and Relational autonomy and Euthanasia and Relational Autonomy,NA,NA,2020/06/30/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence shows that studies based on sharing and secondary use of data/samples have the potential to significantly advance medical knowledge. However, sharing of such resources for international collaboration is hampered by the lack of clarity about ethical and legal requirements for transfer of data and samples across international borders. MAIN TEXT: Here, the International Clinical Trial Center Network (ICN) reports the legal and ethical requirements governing data and sample exchange (DSE) across four continents. The most recurring requirement is ethical approval, whereas only in specific conditions approval of national health authorities is required. Informed consent is not required in all sharing situations. However, waiver of informed consent is only allowed in certain countries/regions and under certain circumstances. The current legal and ethical landscape appears to be very complex and under constant evolution. Regulations differ between countries/regions and are often incomplete, leading to uncertainty. CONCLUSION: With this work, ICN illuminates the unmet need for a single international collaborative framework to facilitate DSE. Harmonising requirements for global DSE will reduce inefficiency and waste in research. There are many challenges to realising this ambitious vision, including inconsistent terminology and definitions, and heterogeneous and dynamic legal constraints. Here, we identify areas of agreement and significant difference as a necessary first step towards facilitating international collaboration. We propose the establishment of a working group to continue the comparison across jurisdictions, create a standardised glossary and define a set of basic principles and fundamental requirements for DSE.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-0448-9,21,1,8,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Big data and Data sharing and Global Health and Internationality and Biobanking and Electronic Health Records/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Information Dissemination/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and International Cooperation/*legislation & jurisprudence and International exchange and Ownership/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Research policies and Tissue Banks/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2020/01/21/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ilguy_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical decision making in dental education: a preliminary study,"Ilguy, Mehmet and Ilguy, Dilhan and Oktay, Inci",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In terms of ethical decision making, every clinical case, when seen as an ethical problem, may be analyzed by means of four topics: medical indications, patient preferences, quality of life, contextual features. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 4th year dental students on Ethical Decision Making before and after a course on ethics. METHODS: Fourth year dental students (n = 37) from academic year 2013-2014 participated in the study. A 3-h lecture, which was about four topics approach to clinical ethical case analysis, was given to the students. The lecture was based on case scenarios related with dental ethics. After the completion of lectures,a case scenario was presented to the students to assess their ethical decision making abilities. At the end of the exam, four topics and ethical judgment were evaluated. Their performances on this examination were evaluated before and after lectures. Statistical evaluation was performed with the significance level set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found between the means of four topics (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of judgment of ethical decision (p > 0.05). The mean total score of the students after the course was significantly higher than before course (67.5 and 54.4, respectively; p < 0.05).

Strech_2008_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Evidence-based ethics--what it should be and what it shouldn't,"Strech, Daniel",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The concept of evidence-based medicine has strongly influenced the appraisal and application of empirical information in health care decision-making. One principal characteristic of this concept is the distinction between ""evidence"" in the sense of high-quality empirical information on the one hand and rather low-quality empirical information on the other hand. In the last 5 to 10 years an increasing number of articles published in international journals have made use of the term ""evidence-based ethics"", making a systematic analysis and explication of the term and its applicability in ethics important. DISCUSSION: In this article four descriptive and two normative characteristics of the general concept ""evidence-based"" are presented and explained systematically. These characteristics are to then serve as a framework for assessing the methodological and practical challenges of evidence-based ethics as a developing methodology. The superiority of evidence in contrast to other empirical information has several normative implications such as the legitimization of decisions in medicine and ethics. This implicit normativity poses ethical concerns if there is no formal consent on which sort of empirical information deserves the label ""evidence"" and which does not. In empirical ethics, which relies primarily on interview research and other methods from the social sciences, we still lack gold standards for assessing the quality of study designs and appraising their findings. CONCLUSION: The use of the term ""evidence-based ethics"" should be discouraged, unless there is enough consensus on how to differentiate between high- and low-quality information produced by empirical ethics. In the meantime, whenever empirical information plays a role, the process of ethical decision-making should make use of systematic reviews of empirical studies that involve a critical appraisal and comparative discussion of data.",2008,10.1186/1472-6939-9-16,9,NA,16,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Empirical Research and Review Literature as Topic and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and *Evidence-Based Medicine/ethics",NA,NA,2008/10/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
McDougall_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Computer knows best? The need for value-flexibility in medical AI,"McDougall, Rosalind J.",Journal of medical ethics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being developed for use in medicine, including for diagnosis and in treatment decision making. The use of AI in medical treatment raises many ethical issues that are yet to be explored in depth by bioethicists. In this paper, I focus specifically on the relationship between the ethical ideal of shared decision making and AI systems that generate treatment recommendations, using the example of IBM's Watson for Oncology. I argue that use of this type of system creates both important risks and significant opportunities for promoting shared decision making. If value judgements are fixed and covert in AI systems, then we risk a shift back to more paternalistic medical care. However, if designed and used in an ethically informed way, AI could offer a potentially powerful way of supporting shared decision making. It could be used to incorporate explicit value reflection, promoting patient autonomy. In the context of medical treatment, we need value-flexible AI that can both respond to the values and treatment goals of individual patients and support clinicians to engage in shared decision making.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105118,45,3,156-160,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"decision-making and information technology and Humans and *Decision Making, Computer-Assisted and *Artificial Intelligence/ethics and Decision Making, Shared and *Social Values and clinical ethics and Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/ethics/methods and Medical Oncology/ethics/methods and Paternalism/ethics",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are scarce empirical data on patients' perceived purpose of informed consent, which may include administrative routine/courtesy gesture, simple honest permission, informed permission, patient-clinician shared decision-making, and enabling patient's self decision-making. Different purposes require different processes. METHODS: We surveyed 488 adults who were planning to undergo or had recently undergone written informed consent-requiring procedures. Perceptions of informed consent purpose (from norm and current practice perspectives) were explored by asking respondents to rank (1 = most reflective) 10 randomly-presented statements: ""meaningless routine"", ""courtesy gesture"" ""litigation protection"", ""take away compensation rights"", ""inform patient', ""make sure patient understand"", ""document patient's decision"", ""discover patient's preferences"", ""have shared decision"", and ""help patient decide"". RESULTS: Respondents' mean (SD) age was 38.3 (12.5); 50.4% were males, 56.8% had <e2><89><a5> college education, and 37.3% had undergone a procedure. From the norm perspective, the least reflective statement was ""meaningless routine"" (ranked 1-3 by 2.6% of respondents) and the most reflective statements were ""help patient decide"", ""make sure patient understand"", and ""inform patient"" (ranked 1-3 by 65%, 60%, and 48% of respondents with median [25%,75%] ranking scores of 2 [1,5], 3 [2,4], and 4 [2,5], respectively). Compared to their counterparts, males and pre-procedure respondents ranked ""help patient decide"" better, whereas females and post-procedure respondents ranked ""inform patient"" better (p = 0.007 to p < 0.001). Age was associated with better ranking of ""help patient decide"" and ""make sure patient understand"" statements (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), which were ranked 1-3 by only 46% and 42% of respondents from the current practice perspective (median ranking score 4 [2,6], p < 0.001 vs. norm perspective for both). CONCLUSIONS: 1) the informed consent process is important to patients, however, patients vary in their views of its purpose with the dominant view being enabling patients' self decision-making, 2) males, pre-procedure, and older patients more favor a self decision-making purpose, whereas females and post-procedure patients more favor an information disclosure purpose, and 3) more self decision-making and more effective information disclosure than is currently practiced are desired.

Jerpseth_2017_Nursethi,JOUR,Nurses' role and care practices in decision-making regarding artificial ventilation in late stage pulmonary disease,"Jerpseth, Heidi and Dahl, Vegard and Nortvedt, Per and Halvorsen, Kristin",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding whether or not to institute mechanical ventilation during the later stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is challenging both ethically, emotionally and medically. Caring for these patients is a multifaceted process where nurses play a crucial role. Research question and design: We have investigated how nurses experienced their own role in decision-making processes regarding mechanical ventilation in later stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and how they consider the patients' role in these processes. We applied a qualitative approach, with six focus-group interviews of nurses (n = 26). Ethical considerations: The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics approved the study. Voluntary informed consent was obtained. FINDINGS: The nurses found themselves operating within a cure-directed treatment culture wherein they were unable to stand up for the caring values. They perceived their roles and responsibilities in decision-making processes regarding mechanical ventilation to patients as unclear and unsatisfactory. They also experienced inadequate interdisciplinary cooperation. DISCUSSION: Lack of communication skills, the traditional hierarchical hospital culture together with operating in a medical-orientated treatment culture where caring values is rated as less important might explain the nurses' absence in participation in the decision about mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: To be able to advocate for the patients' and their own right to be included in decision-making processes, nurses need an awareness of their own responsibilities. This requires personal courage, leadership who are capable of organising common interpersonal meetings and willingness on the part of the physicians to include and value the nurses' participation in decision-making processes.",2017,10.1177/0969733015626600,24,7,821-832,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Qualitative Research and Norway and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Focus Groups and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and *Decision Making and *Perception and Resuscitation Orders and nursing ethics and mechanical ventilation and caring values and end-of-life decision-making and Lung Diseases/*nursing/psychology and Nurse's Role/*psychology and Respiration, Artificial/*nursing",NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Muggli_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Shall parent / patient wishes be fulfilled in any case? A series of 32 ethics consultations: from reproductive medicine to neonatology,"Muggli, Mirella and De Geyter, Christian and Reiter-Theil, Stella",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Questions concerning the parent/ patient's autonomy are seen as one of the most important reasons for requesting Ethics Consultations (ECs). Respecting parent/ patient's autonomy also means respecting the patient's wishes. But those wishes may be controversial and sometimes even go beyond legal requirements. The objective of this case series of 32 ECs was to illustrate ethically challenging parent / patients' wishes during the first stages of life and how the principle of patient's autonomy was handled. METHODS: The case series has a qualitative retrospective approach. A documentary sheet was designed de novo and information was gained from EC minutes and medical charts. The cases originate from the following specialties: reproductive medicine, obstetrics and neonatology as well as two interdisciplinary cases. RESULTS: Through the structured EC minutes aspects of patient / parents' wishes could be identified explicitly. Overall the patient / parents' wishes were not supported in 61% of the cases. Central reasons for rejection of patient / parent wishes were mainly the protection of the best interest of the unborn / new-born child as well as the rejection of clinical approaches that were regarded as being substandard treatment. CONCLUSION: The study shows that treatment decisions in reproductive medicine, obstetrics and neonatology raise substantial ethical questions leading to the request for ethics consultation. The systematic case series presented here gives insight into the ethical reflection carried out to support the clinicians in their decision-making and counselling. It shows that clinicians, after using ethics consultation, make deliberate decisions that do not ""automatically"" fulfil the treatment requests of the patients and parents (to-be).",2019,10.1186/s12910-018-0342-x,20,1,4,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Risk Assessment and Obstetrics and Pregnancy and Qualitative Research and Infant, Newborn and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology and Neonatology and *Ethics Consultation and Ethics consultation and Neonatology/*ethics and Parent/ patients' wishes and Parents/education/*psychology and Patient Advocacy/*ethics/psychology and Patient autonomy and Reproductive medicine and Reproductive Medicine/*ethics",NA,NA,2019/01/08/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ineichen_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Measuring value sensitivity in medicine,"Ineichen, Christian and Christen, Markus and Tanner, Carmen",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Value sensitivity - the ability to recognize value-related issues when they arise in practice - is an indispensable competence for medical practitioners to enter decision-making processes related to ethical questions. However, the psychological competence of value sensitivity is seldom an explicit subject in the training of medical professionals. In this contribution, we outline the traditional concept of moral sensitivity in medicine and its revised form conceptualized as value sensitivity and we propose an instrument that measures value sensitivity. METHODS: We developed an instrument for assessing the sensitivity for three value groups (moral-related values, values related to the principles of biomedical ethics, strategy-related values) in a four step procedure: 1) value identification (n = 317); 2) value representation (n = 317); 3) vignette construction and quality evaluation (n = 37); and 4) instrument validation by comparing nursing professionals with hospital managers (n = 48). RESULTS: We find that nursing professionals recognize and ascribe importance to principle-related issues more than professionals from hospital management. The latter are more likely to recognize and ascribe importance to strategy-related issues.

Mikal_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical issues in using Twitter for population-level depression monitoring: a qualitative study,"Mikal, Jude and Hurst, Samantha and Conway, Mike",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Recently, significant research effort has focused on using Twitter (and other social media) to investigate mental health at the population-level. While there has been influential work in developing ethical guidelines for Internet discussion forum-based research in public health, there is currently limited work focused on addressing ethical problems in Twitter-based public health research, and less still that considers these issues from users' own perspectives. In this work, we aim to investigate public attitudes towards utilizing public domain Twitter data for population-level mental health monitoring using a qualitative methodology. METHODS: The study explores user perspectives in a series of five, 2-h focus group interviews. Following a semi-structured protocol, 26 Twitter users with and without a diagnosed history of depression discussed general Twitter use, along with privacy expectations, and ethical issues in using social media for health monitoring, with a particular focus on mental health monitoring. Transcripts were then transcribed, redacted, and coded using a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: While participants expressed a wide range of opinions, there was an overall trend towards a relatively positive view of using public domain Twitter data as a resource for population level mental health monitoring, provided that results are appropriately aggregated. Results are divided into five sections: (1) a profile of respondents' Twitter use patterns and use variability; (2) users' privacy expectations, including expectations regarding data reach and permanence; (3) attitudes towards social media based population-level health monitoring in general, and attitudes towards mental health monitoring in particular; (4) attitudes towards individual versus population-level health monitoring; and (5) users' own recommendations for the appropriate regulation of population-level mental health monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Focus group data reveal a wide range of attitudes towards the use of public-domain social media ""big data"" in population health research, from enthusiasm, through acceptance, to opposition.

Ploug_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Informed consent and registry-based research - the case of the Danish circumcision registry,"Ploug, Thomas and Holm, Soren",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Research into personal health data holds great potential not only for improved treatment but also for economic growth. In these years many countries are developing policies aimed at facilitating such research often under the banner of 'big data'. A central point of debate is whether the secondary use of health data requires informed consent if the data is anonymised. In 2013 the Danish Minister of Health established a new register collecting data about all ritual male childhood circumcisions in Denmark. The main purpose of the register was to enable future research into the consequences of ritual circumcision. DISCUSSION: This article is a study into the case of the Danish Circumcision Registry. We show that such a registry may lead to various forms of harm such as 1) overreaching social pressure, 2) stigmatization, 3) medicalization of a religious practice, 4) discrimination, and 5) polarised research, and that a person may therefore have a strong and legitimate interest in deciding whether or not such data should be collected and/or used in research. This casts doubt on the claim that the requirement of informed consent could and should be waived for all types of secondary research into registries. We finally sketch a new model of informed consent - Meta consent - aimed at striking a balance between the interests in promoting research and at the same time protecting the individual. Research participants may have a strong and legitimate interest in deciding whether or not their data should be collected and used for registry-based research whether or not their data is anonymised.",2017,10.1186/s12910-017-0212-y,18,1,53,eng,1472-6939,"Denmark and Humans and Male and Discrimination and Ethics, Medical and Religion and Medicine and Informed consent and Social Stigma and Circumcision, Male/*statistics & numerical data and Health data and Medicalization and Stigmatization and Informed Consent/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Ceremonial Behavior and Data Anonymization/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Meta consent and Parental Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Polarisation and Registries/*ethics and Religious circumcision and Social pressure",NA,NA,2017/09/15/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Salloch_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The normative background of empirical-ethical research: first steps towards a transparent and reasoned approach in the selection of an ethical theory,"Salloch, Sabine and Wascher, Sebastian and Vollmann, Jochen and Schildmann, Jan",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Empirical-ethical research constitutes a relatively new field which integrates socio-empirical research and normative analysis. As direct inferences from descriptive data to normative conclusions are problematic, an ethical framework is needed to determine the relevance of the empirical data for normative argument. While issues of normative-empirical collaboration and questions of empirical methodology have been widely discussed in the literature, the normative methodology of empirical-ethical research has seldom been addressed. Based on our own research experience, we discuss one aspect of this normative methodology, namely the selection of an ethical theory serving as a background for empirical-ethical research. DISCUSSION: Whereas criteria for a good ethical theory in philosophical ethics are usually related to inherent aspects, such as the theory's clarity or coherence, additional points have to be considered in the field of empirical-ethical research. Three of these additional criteria will be discussed in the article: (a) the adequacy of the ethical theory for the issue at stake, (b) the theory's suitability for the purposes and design of the empirical-ethical research project, and (c) the interrelation between the ethical theory selected and the theoretical backgrounds of the socio-empirical research. Using the example of our own study on the development of interventions which support clinical decision-making in oncology, we will show how the selection of an ethical theory as a normative background for empirical-ethical research can proceed. We will also discuss the limitations of the procedures chosen in our project. The article stresses that a systematic and reasoned approach towards theory selection in empirical-ethical research should be given priority rather than an accidental or implicit way of choosing the normative framework for one's own research. It furthermore shows that the overall design of an empirical-ethical study is a multi-faceted endeavor which has to balance between theoretical and pragmatic considerations.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0016-x,16,NA,20,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Cooperative Behavior and Morals and *Ethics, Medical and *Research Design and *Ethical Analysis and *Ethical Theory and *Empirical Research and Clinical Decision-Making/ethics and Medical Oncology/ethics",NA,NA,2015/04/04/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Falconer_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Perceptions and intentions toward medical assistance in dying among Canadian medical students,"Falconer, James and Couture, Felix and Demir, Koray K. and Lang, Michael and Shefman, Zachary and Woo, Mark",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Medical assistance in dying (MAID) was legalized in Canada in 2016. As of July 2017, approximately 2149 patients have accessed MAID. There remains no national-level data on the perspectives of future physicians about MAID or its changing legal status. We provide evidence from a national survey of Canadian medical students about their opinions, intentions, and concerns about MAID. METHODS: From October 2016 to July 2017, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all students at 15 of Canada's 17 medical schools. The survey collected data on respondent socio-demographic characteristics, features of their medical education, intentions for medical practice, and perspectives on MAID. We analyzed responses using univariate descriptive and stepwise multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In 1210 completed surveys, 71% of respondents reported being willing to provide MAID under a legal framework that permits it. Non-religious respondents reported greater willingness to participate in MAID than respondents of any religious affiliation (p < 0.001). Frequency of religious attendance was inversely associated with willingness to provide MAID (p < 0.001). Medical students born in Quebec were more willing to provide MAID than respondents from other provinces (OR 2.21; p < 0.001). Age, sex, socioeconomic status, year of medical study, previous academic major, and rural/urban city of birth were not associated with willingness to provide MAID.

Forde_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"""It scares me to know that we might not have been there!"": a qualitative study into the experiences of parents of seriously ill children participating in ethical case discussions","Forde, Reidun and Linja, Trude",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: All hospital trusts in Norway have clinical ethics committees (CEC). Some of them invite next of kin/patients to be present during the discussion of their case. This study looks closer at how parents of seriously ill children have experienced being involved in CEC discussions. METHODS: Ten next of kin of six seriously ill children were interviewed. Their cases were discussed in two CECs between April of 2011 and March of 2014. The main ethical dilemma was limitation of life-prolonging treatment. Health care personnel who could elucidate the case were also present in the discussion. The interviewer observed each discussion and then interviewed the next of kin shortly after the meeting, following a structured interview guide. RESULTS: All next of kin emphasized that it had been important for them to be present. They stressed the important role of the CEC chair and appreciated that their case was discussed in a systematic way. Some next of kin appreciated that the child's impending death was discussed openly, and believed that this would facilitate their future grieving. Having had an opportunity to hear all the arguments behind the decision to be made would probably help them to accept the road ahead. All of them felt that they were taken seriously and listened to. They felt that they had added vital information to the discussion. All but one couple did not want any decision-making responsibility, some of them even worried that they might have influenced the discussion too much. CONCLUSIONS: None of the next of kin felt that being present during the CEC discussion had been too heavy a burden. On the contrary, they claimed that their presence in a CEC discussion may add vital information to the discussion and may improve the quality of the decision. It is important that the CEC's role is explained to them so they are well prepared for what to expect.

This article critically examines the harm principle movement and identifies serious defects within the project of using Mill's harm principle for medical decision making for children. While the harm principle proponents successfully highlight some difficulties in present-day use of the best interest standard, the use of the harm principle suffers substantial normative and conceptual problems. A medical decision-making framework for children is suggested, grounded in the four principles.

In this study, we explored the consent practices and attitudes regarding essential information required for the consent process within hospital-based trial communities from four referral hospitals in Vietnam. METHODS: We collected surveys from and conducted semi-structured interviews with study physicians, study nurses, ethics committee members, and study participants and family members regarding their experiences of participating in research, their perspectives toward research, and their views about various elements of the consent process. RESULTS: In our findings, we describe three interrelated themes related to the consent process: (1) words and regulation; (2) reimbursement, suspicions, and joining; and (3) responsibilities. In general, stakeholders had highly varied perspectives of nghien cuu (Eng.: research) and researchers used varying levels of detail regarding all aspects of the study in the consent process to build trust with and/or promote potential research participants' choices about taking part in research. Findings additionally highlight how researchers felt that offering financial reimbursements in a hospital setting, where payment for services was routine, would be unfamiliar to participants and could raise suspicions about the research. Participants, however, focused their discussions on reimbursement or alternative reasons for joining the study, such as health related benefits or altruism. Finally, participants often relied on their physician to help them decide about joining a study or not. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to understand how researchers and participants make sense of and practice consent, and how that impacts participants' decision-making about research participation. To promote valid consent within this context, it is important to engage with hospital-based trial communities as a whole. The data from this study will inform future research on consent, guide the revisions of consent related policies within our research sites and point to several larger issues surrounding researcher-participant expectations, communication, and trust.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-0445-z,21,1,4,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Trust and Interviews as Topic and Referral and Consultation and Vietnam and Clinical research and Consent and *Decision Making and Informed Consent/*ethics and Family/psychology and Research Subjects/*psychology and Biomedical Research/*ethics and Dengue/therapy and Ethics Committees and Medical Staff, Hospital/psychology and nghien cuu and Nursing Staff, Hospital/psychology and Research ethics",NA,NA,2020/01/10/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research. RESULTS: We observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used.

Roeline W. and van der Heide, Agnes and van Delden, Johannes J. M. and Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Although euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) in people with psychiatric disorders is relatively rare, the increasing incidence of EAS requests has given rise to public and political debate. This study aimed to explore support of the public and physicians for euthanasia and assisted suicide in people with psychiatric disorders and examine factors associated with acceptance and conceivability of performing EAS in these patients. METHODS: A survey was distributed amongst a random sample of Dutch 2641 citizens (response 75%) and 3000 physicians (response 52%). Acceptance and conceivability of performing EAS, demographics, health status and professional characteristics were measured. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the general public 53% were of the opinion that people with psychiatric disorders should be eligible for EAS, 15% was opposed to this, and 32% remained neutral. Higher educational level, Dutch ethnicity, and higher urbanization level were associated with higher acceptability of EAS whilst a religious life stance and good health were associated with lower acceptability. The percentage of physicians who considered performing EAS in people with psychiatric disorders conceivable ranged between 20% amongst medical specialists and 47% amongst general practitioners. Having received EAS requests from psychiatric patients before was associated with considering performing EAS conceivable. Being female, religious, medical specialist, or psychiatrist were associated with lower conceivability. The majority (> 65%) of the psychiatrists were of the opinion that it is possible to establish whether a psychiatric patient's suffering is unbearable and without prospect and whether the request is well-considered. CONCLUSION: The general public shows more support than opposition as to whether patients suffering from a psychiatric disorder should be eligible for EAS, even though one third of the respondents remained neutral. Physicians' support depends on their specialization; 39% of psychiatrists considered performing EAS in psychiatric patients conceivable.

RESULTS: We found that each individual attending physician's likelihood of signing do-not-resuscitate orders for their patients was significantly different from each other. Some attending physicians were more likely to write do-not-resuscitate orders for their patients, and other attending physicians were less likely to do so.

Ganya_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Autonomy of the child in the South African context: is a 12 year old of sufficient maturity to consent to medical treatment?,"Ganya, Wandile and Kling, Sharon and Moodley, Keymanthri",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: A child is a developing person with evolving capacities that include autonomy, mental (decisional) capacity and capacity to assume responsibility. Hence, children are entitled to participatory (autonomy) rights in South Africa as observed in the Children's Act 38 of 2005. According to section 129 of the Act a child may consent to his or her own medical treatment provided that he or she is over the age of 12 years and is of sufficient maturity and decisional capacity to understand the various implications of the treatment including the risks and benefits thereof. However, the Act does not provide a definition for what qualifies as 'sufficient maturity' nor does it stipulate how health professionals ought to assess the decisional capacity of a child. In addition, South Africa is a culturally diverse country. The Western liberal notion of autonomy may not necessarily find equal prominence in the mores of people with a different worldview. Hence we demonstrate a few salient comparisons between legal liberal moral theory and African communitarianism as pertinent to the autonomy of the child. DISCUSSION: Children are rights-holders by virtue of their humanity. Their dignity as individual human persons affords them the entitlement to human rights as contemplated under the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. However, contrary to the traditional Western notion of individual autonomous persons African societies hold a communalistic notion of person hence there is less regard for individual autonomy and rights with more emphasis on the communal good and maintaining the continuity of relationships and interdependencies shared within a community. A child considered in this view is not regarded as a full person. This implies that decisions concerning the child, including consent to medical treatment are discussed and determined by the community to which the child belongs. Lastly, in this article, we draw on the notion of capacity for responsibility to produce a pragmatic definition of sufficient maturity. CONCLUSION: It seems reasonable to suggest a move away from a general legal age of consent for medical treatment toward more individualised, context-specific approaches in determining the maturity of a child patient to consent to medical treatment. Perhaps, decision-making with respect to consent to the medical treatment of a child belonging to a traditional African community where the notion of a person is embedded in communitarianism ought to involve the child's parents/guardians/caregivers where possible provided that the best interests of the child are awarded priority.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0150-0,17,1,66,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Social Responsibility and Child and Comprehension and Morals and South Africa and Ethics, Clinical and Consent and *Decision Making and *Culture and *Personal Autonomy and *Child Development and *Residence Characteristics and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Autonomy and Personhood and Ethical Theory and Human Rights/legislation & jurisprudence and Informed Consent By Minors/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Person and Social Norms and Sufficient maturity",NA,NA,2016/11/02/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper we investigate exactly how age influences the decision-making process. To explore the normative argumentation in the decisions regarding an elderly patient we make use of the argumentation model advanced by Toulmin. By expanding the model in order to identify normative components in the argumentation process it is possible to analyse the way that age-related value judgements influence the medical decision-making process. We apply the model to practice descriptions made by medical students after they had attended consultations and meetings in medical practice during their clinical training. Our results show the pervasive character of age-related value judgements. They influence the physician's decision in several ways and at several points in the decision-making process. Such explicit value judgements were not exclusively used for arguments against further diagnosis or treatment of older patients. We found no systematic ""ageist"" pattern in the clinical decisions by physicians. Since age plays such an important, yet hidden role in the medical decision-making process, we make a plea for revealing such normative argumentation in order to gain transparency and accountability in this process. An explicit deliberative approach will make the medical decision-making process more transparent and improve the physician-patient relationship, creating confidence and trust, which are at the heart of medical practice.",2008,10.1136/jme.2008.025247,34,12,863-868,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Patient Participation and Decision Making/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and *Age Factors,NA,NA,2008/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bator_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,This moral coil: a cross-sectional survey of Canadian medical student attitudes toward medical assistance in dying,"Bator, Eli Xavier and Philpott, Bethany and Costa, Andrew Paul",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In February, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the ban on medical assistance in dying (MAiD). In June, 2016, the federal government passed Bill C-14, permitting MAiD. Current medical students will be the first physician cohort to enter a system permissive of MAiD, and may help to ensure equitable access to care. This study assessed medical student views on MAiD, factors influencing these views, and opportunities for medical education. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed to medical students across all years of a three-year Canadian undergraduate medical program. The investigators administered the survey to participants during academic sessions from November to December, 2015. Analysis of the results included summary descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test of independence to identify differences between participants by year of study, logistic regression to identify factors that influence students' stances on MAiD, and Wilcoxon signed rank test to measure changes in student support for MAiD and comfort discussing MAiD. RESULTS: There were 405 participants for a response rate of 87%. The majority of students (88%) supported the Supreme Court's decision, 61% would provide the means for a patient to end their life, and 38% would personally administer a lethal medication. Students who were more willing to provide the means for MAiD found medical education/clinical experience and patient autonomy to be important contributors to their stances on MAiD. Those students who were less willing to provide the means for MAiD found religious/spiritual beliefs and teachings, as well as concern about potential negative consequences, to be important contributors to their stances on MAiD.

Empirical research can inform the debate about whether to adjust these procedures for culturally diverse settings. Our objective was to delineate procedures related to recruiting, obtaining informed consent, and compensating health research participants in the extremely high-density multicultural setting of Qatar. METHODS: During a multistage mixed methods project, field observations and qualitative interviews were conducted in a general medicine clinic of a major medical center in Qatar. Participants were chosen based on gender, age, literacy, and preferred language, i.e., Arabic, English, Hindi and Urdu. Qualitative analysis identified themes about recruitment, informed consent, compensation, and other research procedures. RESULTS: A total of 153 individuals were approached and 84 enrolled; the latter showed a diverse age range (18 to 75 years); varied language representation: Arabic (n = 24), English (n = 20), Hindi (n = 20), and Urdu (n = 20); and balanced gender distribution: women (n = 43) and men (n = 41). Primary reasons for 30 declinations included concern about interview length and recording. The study achieved a 74% participation rate. Qualitative analytics revealed key themes about hesitation to participate, decisions about participation with family members as well as discussions with them as ""incidental research participants"", the informed consent process, privacy and gender rules of the interview environment, reactions to member checking and compensation, and motivation for participating. Vulnerability emerged as a recurring issue throughout the process among a minority of participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study from Qatar is the first to provide empirical data on recruitment, informed consent, compensation and other research procedures in a general adult population in the Middle East and Arabian Gulf. This investigation illustrates how potential research participants perceive research participation.

However, in clinical practice, most older cancer patients' treatment decisions are made by family members. OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to analyze the treatment decision-making process and formation mechanism for older cancer patients within the special cultural context of Chinese medical practice. METHOD: A qualitative study was conducted. With the sample saturation principle, data collected by in-depth interviews with 17 family members and 12 patients were subjected to thematic analysis. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the ethics committees of Sun Yat-sen University. All participants provided verbal informed consent after being told their rights of confidentiality, anonymity, and voluntary participation. They had the right to refuse to answer questions and could withdraw at any time. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) complex process; (2) transformation of family decision-making power; and (3) individual compromise. Family members inevitably had different opinions during the long process of treatment decision-making for older cancer patients. The direction of this process could be regarded as an extension of the family power relationship. The patient usually compromised the decision to survive, which was made by family members. CONCLUSION: This study describes the treatment decision-making process of older cancer patients in the context of Chinese culture. The reasons underlying this process are related to the views on life and death and family values. An individual is a part of the family, which is often seen as the minimal interpersonal unit in Chinese society. It is significant that while emphasizing patient autonomy in the decision-making process, health professionals should also pay attention to the important roles of culture and family.",2021,10.1177/0969733020945752,28,2,242-252,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,China and decision-making and culture and Humans and Aged and Qualitative Research and Family and Informed Consent and *Decision Making and process and *Neoplasms/therapy and older cancer patients and values,NA,NA,2021/03//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Oerlemans_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical problems in intensive care unit admission and discharge decisions: a qualitative study among physicians and nurses in the Netherlands,"Oerlemans, Anke J. M. and van Sluisveld, Nelleke and van Leeuwen, Eric S. J. and Wollersheim, Hub and Dekkers, Wim J. M. and Zegers, Marieke",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: There have been few empirical studies into what non-medical factors influence physicians and nurses when deciding about admission and discharge of ICU patients. Information about the attitudes of healthcare professionals about this process can be used to improve decision-making about resource allocation in intensive care. To provide insight into ethical problems that influence the ICU admission and discharge process, we aimed to identify and explore ethical dilemmas healthcare professionals are faced with. METHODS: This was an explorative, descriptive study using qualitative methods (individual and focus group interviews). We conducted 19 individual interviews and 4 focus group interviews with nurses and physicians working in the ICU or the general ward of 10 Dutch hospitals. RESULTS: The ethical problems in the context of ICU admission and discharge can be divided into problems concerning full bed occupancy and problems related to treatment decisions. The gap between the high level of care the ICU can provide and the lower care level in the general ward sometimes leads to mutual misunderstandings. Our results indicate that when professionals of different wards feel there is a collective responsibility and effort to solve a problem, this helps to prevent or alleviate moral distress. ICU patients' wishes are often unknown, causing healthcare professionals to err on the side of more treatment. Additionally, the highly technological nature of intensive care appears to encourage over-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for ICUs and general wards to communicate and cooperate well, since there is a mutual dependency for optimal patient flow between the different departments. Interventions that improve the understanding and cooperation between these wards may help mitigate ethical problems. The nature of the ICU environment makes it important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the risk of over-treatment, reflect on why they do what they do, and be mindful of a possible negative impact of over-treatment on their patients. Early discussion of a patient's wishes with regard to treatment options is important in preventing over-treatment.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0001-4,16,NA,9,eng,1472-6939,"Physicians and Humans and Cooperative Behavior and Surveys and Questionnaires and Stress, Psychological and Nurses and Qualitative Research and Morals and Focus Groups and Interprofessional Relations and Netherlands and Health Services Misuse and *Ethics, Medical and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Quality of Health Care and *Intensive Care Units and Decision Making/*ethics and *Ethics, Nursing and Critical Care/*ethics",NA,NA,2015/02/26/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Christopher and Keegan, Mark T.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Following passage of the Patient Self Determination Act in 1990, health care institutions that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding are required to inform patients of their right to make their health care preferences known through execution of a living will and/or to appoint a surrogate-decision maker. We evaluated the impact of external factors and perceived patient preferences on physicians' decisions to honor or forgo previously established advance directives (ADs). In addition, physician views regarding legal risk, patients' ability to comprehend complexities involved with their care, and impact of medical costs related to end-of-life care decisions were explored. METHODS: Attendees of two Mayo Clinic continuing medical education courses were surveyed. Three scenarios based in part on previously court-litigated matters assessed impact of external factors and perceived patient preferences on physician compliance with patient-articulated wishes regarding resuscitation. General questions measured respondents' perception of legal risk, concerns over patient knowledge of idiosyncrasies involved with their care, and impact medical costs may have on compliance with patient preferences. Responses indicating strength of agreement or disagreement with statements were treated as ordinal data and analyzed using the Cochran Armitage trend test. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight of 951 surveys were completed (41% response rate). Eighty percent reported they were likely to honor a patient's AD despite its 5 year age. Fewer than half (41%) would honor the AD of a patient in ventricular fibrillation who had expressed a desire to ""pass away in peace."" Few (17%) would forgo an AD following a family's request for continued resuscitative treatment. A majority (52%) considered risk of liability to be lower when maintaining someone alive against their wishes than mistakenly failing to provide resuscitative efforts. A large percentage (74%) disagreed that patients could not appreciate complexities surrounding their care while 69% agreed that costs should never impact a physician's decision as to whether to comply with a patient's AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the impact, albeit small, external factors have on physician AD compliance.

Tuffrey.Wijne_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Euthanasia and assisted suicide for people with an intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder: an examination of nine relevant euthanasia cases in the Netherlands (2012-2016),"Tuffrey-Wijne, Irene and Curfs, Leopold and Finlay, Ilora and Hollins, Sheila",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) have been legally possible in the Netherlands since 2001, provided that statutory due care criteria are met, including: (a) voluntary and well-considered request; (b) unbearable suffering without prospect of improvement; (c) informing the patient; (d) lack of a reasonable alternative; (e) independent second physician's opinion. 'Unbearable suffering' must have a medical basis, either somatic or psychiatric, but there is no requirement of limited life expectancy. All EAS cases must be reported and are scrutinised by regional review committees (RTE). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether any particular difficulties arise when the EAS due care criteria are applied to patients with an intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder. METHODS: The 416 case summaries available on the RTE website (2012-2016) were searched for intellectual disability (6) and autism spectrum disorder (3). Direct content analysis was used on these nine cases. RESULTS: Assessment of decisional capacity was mentioned in eight cases, but few details given; in two cases, there had been uncertainty or disagreement about capacity. Two patients had progressive somatic conditions. For most, suffering was due to an inability to cope with changing circumstances or increasing dependency; in several cases, suffering was described in terms of characteristics of living with an autism spectrum disorder, rather than an acquired medical condition. Some physicians struggled to understand the patient's perspective. Treatment refusal was a common theme, leading physicians to conclude that EAS was the only remaining option. There was a lack of detail on social circumstances and how patients were informed about their prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomy and decisional capacity are highly complex for patients with intellectual disabilities and difficult to assess; capacity tests in these cases did not appear sufficiently stringent. Assessment of suffering is particularly difficult for patients who have experienced life-long disability. The sometimes brief time frames and limited number of physician-patient meetings may not be sufficient to make a decision as serious as EAS. The Dutch EAS due care criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism spectrum disorder, and do not appear to act as adequate safeguards.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0257-6,19,1,17,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Legislation and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Netherlands and Disabled Persons and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and *Decision Making and Empathy and *Mental Competency and Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis and *Autism Spectrum Disorder and Decision-making capacity and Euthanasia and Ethics Committees and *Intellectual Disability and Autism spectrum disorders and Euthanasia, Active, Voluntary/ethics and Euthanasia/*ethics and Intellectual disabilities and Physician-assisted suicide and Refusal to Treat and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics",NA,NA,2018/03/05/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

It concludes that there is a significant tension between the often non-rational choice behaviour and the traditional theory of informed consent. Responsible ways of dealing with or solving these problems are considered. To this end, patient decisions aids (PDAs) are discussed as suitable interventions to support autonomous decision-making.

Penney_2011_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Risk communication and informed consent in the medical tourism industry: a thematic content analysis of Canadian broker websites,"Penney, Kali and Snyder, Jeremy and Crooks, Valorie A. and Johnston, Rory",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Medical tourism, thought of as patients seeking non-emergency medical care outside of their home countries, is a growing industry worldwide. Canadians are amongst those engaging in medical tourism, and many are helped in the process of accessing care abroad by medical tourism brokers - agents who specialize in making international medical care arrangements for patients. As a key source of information for these patients, brokers are likely to play an important role in communicating the risks and benefits of undergoing surgery or other procedures abroad to their clientele. This raises important ethical concerns regarding processes such as informed consent and the liability of brokers in the event that complications arise from procedures. The purpose of this article is to examine the language, information, and online marketing of Canadian medical tourism brokers' websites in light of such ethical concerns. METHODS: An exhaustive online search using multiple search engines and keywords was performed to compile a comprehensive directory of English-language Canadian medical tourism brokerage websites. These websites were examined using thematic content analysis, which included identifying informational themes, generating frequency counts of these themes, and comparing trends in these counts to the established literature. RESULTS: Seventeen websites were identified for inclusion in this study. It was found that Canadian medical tourism broker websites varied widely in scope, content, professionalism and depth of information. Three themes emerged from the thematic content analysis: training and accreditation, risk communication, and business dimensions. Third party accreditation bodies of debatable regulatory value were regularly mentioned on the reviewed websites, and discussion of surgical risk was absent on 47% of the websites reviewed, with limited discussion of risk on the remaining ones. Terminology describing brokers' roles was somewhat inconsistent across the websites. Finally, brokers' roles in follow up care, their prices, and the speed of surgery were the most commonly included business dimensions on the reviewed websites. CONCLUSION: Canadian medical tourism brokers currently lack a common standard of care and accreditation, and are widely lacking in providing adequate risk communication for potential medical tourists. This has implications for the informed consent and consequent safety of Canadian medical tourists.",2011,10.1186/1472-6939-12-17,12,NA,17,eng,1472-6939,"Risk and Language and Humans and Internet and Canada and Terminology as Topic and Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Informed Consent/*ethics and Information Dissemination/*ethics and Health Care Sector/*ethics and Marketing of Health Services/*ethics/standards and Medical Tourism/*ethics",NA,NA,2011/09/26/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Physician behavior in real-life pediatric consultations in relation to ethical practice, such as informed consent (provision of information, understanding), respect for integrity and patient autonomy (decision-making), has not been subjected to thorough empirical investigation. Such investigations are important tools in developing sound ethical praxis. METHODS: 21 consultations for inguinal hernia were video recorded and observers independently assessed global impressions of provision of information, understanding, respect for integrity, and participation in decision making. The consultations were analyzed for the occurrence of specific physician verbal and nonverbal behaviors and length of time in minutes. RESULTS: All of the consultations took less than 20 minutes, the majority consisting of 10 minutes or less. Despite this narrow time frame, we found strong and consistent association between increasing time and higher ratings on all components of ethical practice: information, (beta = .43), understanding (beta = .52), respect for integrity (beta = .60), and decision making (beta = .43). Positive nonverbal behaviors by physicians during the consultation were associated particularly with respect for integrity (beta =.36). Positive behaviors by physicians during the physical examination were related to respect for children's integrity. CONCLUSION: Time was of essence for the ethical encounter. Further, verbal and nonverbal positive behaviors by the physicians also contributed to higher ratings of ethical aspects.

Patrick and McGowan, Michelle L. and Teare, Harriet J. A. and Coathup, Victoria and Fishman, Jennifer R. and Settersten, Richard A. Jr and Sterckx, Sigrid and Kaye, Jane and Juengst, Eric T.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The language of ""participant-driven research,"" ""crowdsourcing"" and ""citizen science"" is increasingly being used to encourage the public to become involved in research ventures as both subjects and scientists. Originally, these labels were invoked by volunteer research efforts propelled by amateurs outside of traditional research institutions and aimed at appealing to those looking for more ""democratic,"" ""patient-centric,"" or ""lay"" alternatives to the professional science establishment. As mainstream translational biomedical research requires increasingly larger participant pools, however, corporate, academic and governmental research programs are embracing this populist rhetoric to encourage wider public participation. DISCUSSION: We examine the ethical and social implications of this recruitment strategy. We begin by surveying examples of ""citizen science"" outside of biomedicine, as paradigmatic of the aspirations this democratizing rhetoric was originally meant to embody. Next, we discuss the ways these aspirations become articulated in the biomedical context, with a view to drawing out the multiple and potentially conflicting meanings of ""public engagement"" when citizens are also the subjects of the science. We then illustrate two uses of public engagement rhetoric to gain public support for national biomedical research efforts: its post-hoc use in the ""care.data"" project of the National Health Service in England, and its proactive uses in the ""Precision Medicine Initiative"" of the United States White House. These examples will serve as the basis for a normative analysis, discussing the potential ethical and social ramifications of this rhetoric. We pay particular attention to the implications of government strategies that cultivate the idea that members of the public have a civic duty to participate in government-sponsored research initiatives. We argue that such initiatives should draw from policy frameworks that support normative analysis of the role of citizenry. And, we conclude it is imperative to make visible and clear the full spectrum of meanings of ""citizen science,"" the contexts in which it is used, and its demands with respect to participation, engagement, and governance.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0117-1,17,1,33,eng,1472-6939,"United States and England and Precision medicine and Humans and Big data and Science and Crowdsourcing and Social Values and Biomedical Research and *Language and *Public Opinion and Recruitment and Government and *Precision Medicine and *Community Participation and *Social Responsibility and *Patient Selection/ethics and *Translational Research, Biomedical/ethics and Care.data and Citizen science and Citizenship and National health research and Participant centric initiatives and Public engagement",NA,NA,2016/06/04/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Repenshek_2009_Nursethi,JOUR,Moral distress: inability to act or discomfort with moral subjectivity?,"Repenshek, Mark",Nursing ethics,"Amidst the wealth of literature on the topic of moral distress in nursing, a single citation is ubiquitous, Andrew Jameton's 1984 book Nursing practice. The definition Jameton formulated reads '... moral distress arises when one knows the right thing to do, but institutional constraints make it nearly impossible to pursue the right course of action'. Unfortunately, it appears that, despite the frequent use of Jameton's definition of moral distress, the definition itself remains uncritically examined. It seems as if the context of how moral distress arises (i.e. anger, frustration etc.) has been co-opted as its definition. This current work suggests that the current definition is not moral distress as defined by Jameton, but rather, in large part, nursing's discomfort with moral subjectivity in end-of-life decision making.

Okoye_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Must we remain blind to undergraduate medical ethics education in Africa? A cross-sectional study of Nigerian medical students,"Okoye, Onochie and Nwachukwu, Daniel and Maduka-Okafor, Ferdinand C.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: As the practice of medicine inevitably raises both ethical and legal issues, it had been recommended since 1999 that medical ethics and human rights be taught at every medical school. Most Nigerian medical schools still lack a formal undergraduate medical ethics curriculum. Medical education remains largely focused on traditional medical science components, leaving the medical students to develop medical ethical decision-making skills and moral attitudes passively within institutions noted for relatively strong paternalistic traditions. In conducting a needs assessment for developing a curriculum germane to the Nigerian society, and by extension most of Sub-Saharan Africa, this study determined the views of Nigerian medical students on medical ethics education, ethical issues related to the doctor-patient relationship and the ethical/professional dilemmas they are confronted with. METHODS: Using self-administered 63-item structured questionnaires, a cross-sectional survey of the final year medical students of the University of Nigeria was conducted in July 2015.Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS Version 17), frequency counts and percentages were generated. RESULTS: The sample included 100 males (71.4%) and 40 females (28.6%), with the respective mean (SD) age being 24.6(5.61) and 21.8 (6.38) years. Only 35.7% were satisfied with their medical ethics knowledge, and 97.9% indicated that medical ethics should be taught formally. Only 8.6% had never witnessed a medical teacher act unethically. The dilemmas of poor communication between physicians and patients, and the provision of sub-standard care were reported highest for being encountered 'often'. A majority (60.7%) indicated that ""a doctor should do his best always, irrespective of the patient's wishes"". No significant difference in responses across gender was noted.

Until recent decades, patients relied on doctors to tell them what to do.

Unfortunately, current medical practice often falls short of empowering patients. In this article, we reflect on whether the current state of medical decision making effectively promotes patients' health care goals. We base our reflections, in part, on research in which we observed physicians making earnest efforts to partner with patients in making treatment decisions, but still struggling to empower patients-failing to communicate clearly to patients about decision-relevant information, overwhelming patients with irrelevant information, overlooking when patients' emotions made it hard to engage in choices, and making recommendations before discussing patients' goals.",2017,10.1080/15265161.2017.1378753,17,11,31-39,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,Humans and Decision Making and shared decision making and autonomy and *Communication and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Patient Participation and *Personal Autonomy and informed consent and physician/patient communication,NA,NA,2017/11//undefined,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA

We view this knowledge in light of the nursing project and the ongoing debate regarding the ethical legitimacy of nudging in healthcare. We argue that it is insufficient to discuss nudging in nursing and healthcare in light of free will and patient autonomy alone. Sometimes, nurses must take charge and exhibit leadership in the nurse-patient relationship. From the perspective of nursing as leadership, nudging becomes a useful tool for directing and guiding patients towards the shared goals of health, recovery and independence and away from suffering.

Kim_2015_Nursethi,JOUR,Preferences for autonomy in end-of-life decision making in modern Korean society,"Kim, Su Hyun",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The demand for autonomy in medical decision making is increasing among Korean people, but it is not well known why some people prefer autonomy in decision making but others do not. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which Korean adults wished to exercise autonomy in the process of decision making regarding end-of-life treatment and to determine whether economic issues and family functioning, in particular, were associated with preferences for participation in decision making in Korean people. RESEARCH DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional correlational study using a survey. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 354 patients or their families who visited ambulatory departments at two general hospitals in South Korea, recruited by the proportionate quota sampling method. Data analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression analyses. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the hospitals' directors and the ethics committee of Kyungpook National University Hospital. Written informed consent was given by all participants. FINDINGS: A majority of Korean people wanted to make autonomous decisions regarding treatment at the end of life. Preferences for autonomous decision making regarding end-of-life treatment, rather than relying on family, showed a significant increase in association with poor family functioning and low income. DISCUSSION: Results of this study suggested the necessity for development of alternatives to a dominant traditional ""family-centered"" approach in Korean people, in order to enhance end-of-life decision making for people who wish to take an active role in the decision-making process.

Bito_2007_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Attitudes and behaviors of Japanese physicians concerning withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment for end-of-life patients: results from an Internet survey,"Bito, Seiji and Asai, Atsushi",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Evidence concerning how Japanese physicians think and behave in specific clinical situations that involve withholding or withdrawal of medical interventions for end-of-life or frail elderly patients is yet insufficient. METHODS: To analyze decisions and actions concerning the withholding/withdrawal of life-support care by Japanese physicians, we conducted cross-sectional web-based internet survey presenting three scenarios involving an elderly comatose patient following a severe stroke. Volunteer physicians were recruited for the survey through mailing lists and medical journals. The respondents answered questions concerning attitudes and behaviors regarding decision-making for the withholding/withdrawal of life-support care, namely, the initiation/withdrawal of tube feeding and respirator attachment. RESULTS: Of the 304 responses analyzed, a majority felt that tube feeding should be initiated in these scenarios. Only 18% felt that a respirator should be attached when the patient had severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Over half the respondents felt that tube feeding should not be withdrawn when the coma extended beyond 6 months. Only 11% responded that they actually withdrew tube feeding. Half the respondents perceived tube feeding in such a patient as a ""life-sustaining treatment,"" whereas the other half disagreed. Physicians seeking clinical ethics consultation supported the withdrawal of tube feeding (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.5-16.3; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Physicians tend to harbor greater negative attitudes toward the withdrawal of life-support care than its withholding. On the other hand, they favor withholding invasive life-sustaining treatments such as the attachment of a respirator over less invasive and long-term treatments such as tube feeding. Discrepancies were demonstrated between attitudes and actual behaviors.

Span.Sluyter_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Moral dilemmas and conflicts concerning patients in a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: shared or non-shared decision making? A qualitative study of the professional perspective in two moral case deliberations,"Span-Sluyter, Conny A. M. F. H. and Lavrijsen, Jan C. M. and van Leeuwen, Evert and Koopmans, Raymond T. C. M.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Patients in a vegetative state/ unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) pose ethical dilemmas to those involved. Many conflicts occur between professionals and families of these patients. In the Netherlands physicians are supposed to withdraw life sustaining treatment once recovery is not to be expected. Yet these patients have shown to survive sometimes for decades. The role of the families is thought to be important. The aim of this study was to make an inventory of the professional perspective on conflicts in long-term care of patients in VS/UWS. METHODS: A qualitative study of transcripts on 2 Moral Deliberations (MD's) in 2 cases of patients in VS/UWS in long-term care facilities. RESULTS: Six themes emerged: 1) Vision on VS/UWS; 2) Treatment and care plan; 3) Impact on relationships; 4) Feelings/attitude; 5) Communication; 6) Organizational aspects. These themes are related to professionals and to what families had expressed to the professionals. We found conflicts as well as contradictory feelings and thoughts to be a general feature in 4 of these themes, both in professionals and families. Conflicts were found in several actors: within families concerning all 6 themes, in nurse teams concerning the theme treatment and care plan, and between physicians concerning all 6 themes. CONCLUSIONS: Different visions, different expectations and hope on recovery, deviating goals and contradictory feelings/thoughts in families and professionals can lead to conflicts over a patient with VS/UWS. Key factors to prevent or solve such conflicts are a carefully established diagnosis, clarity upon visions, uniformity in treatment goals and plans, an open and empathic communication, expertise and understanding the importance of contradictory feelings/thoughts. Management should bridge conflicts and support their staff, by developing expertise, by creating stability and by facilitating medical ethical discourses. Shared compassion for the patient might be a key to gain trust and bridge the differences from non-shared to shared decision making.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0247-8,19,1,10,eng,1472-6939,Emotions and Shared decision making and Physicians and Communication and Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Trust and Nurses and Qualitative Research and Morals and Attitude of Health Personnel and Family and Netherlands and Long-Term Care and Empathy and *Attitude and Conflict and Decision Making/*ethics and *Professional-Family Relations and *Family and Ethical Analysis and *Persistent Vegetative State and *Wakefulness and Moral case deliberation and Patient Care/*ethics and Vegetative state/ unresponsive wakefulness syndrome,NA,NA,2018/02/22/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Paganini_2015_Nursethi,JOUR,Nurses' autonomy in end-of-life situations in intensive care units,"Paganini, Maria Cristina and Bousso, Regina Szylit",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The intensive care unit environment focuses on interventions and support therapies that prolong life. The exercise by nurses of their autonomy impacts on perception of the role they assume in the multidisciplinary team and on their function in the intensive care unit context. There is much international research relating to nurses' involvement in end-of-life situations; however, there is a paucity of research in this area in Brazil. In the Brazilian medical scenario, life support limitation generated a certain reluctance of a legal nature, which has now become unjustifiable with the publication of a resolution by the Federal Medical Council. In Brazil, the lack of medical commitments to end-of-life care is evident. OBJECTIVE: To understand the process by which nurses exercise autonomy in making end-of-life decisions in intensive care units. RESEARCH DESIGN: Symbolic Interactionism and Corbin and Strauss theory methodology were used for this study. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Data were collected through single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with 14 critical care nurses. The comparative analysis of the data has permitted the understanding of the meaning of nurse's experience in exercising autonomy relating to end-of-life decision-making. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Institutional ethics approval was obtained for data collection. Participants gave informed consent. All data were anonymized. FINDINGS: The results revealed that nurses experience the need to exercise autonomy in intensive care units on a daily basis. Their experience expressed by the process of increase opportunities to exercise autonomy is conditioned by the pressure of the intensive care unit environment, in which nurses can grow, feel empowered, and exercise their autonomy or else can continuously depend on the decisions made by other professionals. CONCLUSION: Nurses exercise their autonomy through care. They work to create new spaces at the same time that they acquire new knowledge and make decisions. Because of the complexity of the end-of-life situation, nurses must adopt a proactive attitude that inserts them into the decision-making process.",2015,10.1177/0969733014547970,22,7,803-814,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Decision-making and Humans and grounded theory and qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Brazil and Intensive Care Units and *Decision Making and Terminal Care/*psychology and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and *Professional Autonomy and professional autonomy and end-of-life care and *Critical Care Nursing and intensive care and life support systems and nurse",NA,NA,2015/11//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lamont_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Capacity and consent: Knowledge and practice of legal and healthcare standards,"Lamont, Scott and Stewart, Cameron and Chiarella, Mary",Nursing ethics,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare practitioners have a legal, ethical and professional obligation to obtain patient consent for all healthcare treatments. There is increasing evidence which suggests dissonance and variation in practice in assessment of decision-making capacity and consent processes. AIMS: This study explores healthcare practitioners' knowledge and practices of assessing decision-making capacity and obtaining patient consent to treatment in the acute generalist setting. METHODS: An exploratory descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using an online questionnaire, method was employed with all professional groups invited via email to participate. Data were collected over 3 months from July to September 2015. Survey content and format was reviewed by the liaison psychiatry team and subsequently contained five sections (demographics, general knowledge and practice, delirium context, legal aspects and education/training). Descriptive, univariate and bivariate analysis of quantitative data and qualitative content analysis of qualitative data were undertaken. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the institutional Human Research and Ethics Committee and informed consent was taken to be provided by participants upon completion and submission of the de-identified survey. RESULTS: In total, 86 participants engaged the survey with n = 24, exiting at the first consent question. Almost two-thirds of respondents indicated that all treatments required patient consent. Knowledge of consent and decision-making capacity as legal constructs was deficient. Decision-making capacity was primarily assessed using professional judgement and perceived predominantly as the responsibility of medical and psychology staff. A range of patient psychological and behavioural symptoms were identified as indicators requiring assessment of decision-making capacity. Despite this, many patients with delirium have their decision-making capacity assessed and documented only sometimes. Uncertain knowledge and inconsistent application of legislative frameworks are evident. Many participants were unsure of the legal mechanisms for obtaining substitute consent in patients with impaired decision-making capacity and refusing treatment. CONCLUSION: The legal context of decision-making capacity and consent to treatment appears complex for healthcare practitioners. Professional, ethical and legal standards of care in this context can benefit from structured education programmes and supportive governance processes. An understanding of why 'duty of care' is being used as a framework within the context of impaired decision-making capacity is warranted, alongside a review of the context of Duty of Care within health policy, guidance and faculty teaching.",2019,10.1177/0969733016687162,26,1,71-83,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Australia and Statistics, Nonparametric and *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Decision-making capacity and delirium and informed consent and *Reference Standards and Health Personnel/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology and healthcare rights and legislation and mental capacity and mental competence",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

An important goal within this domain is to identify the values and ethical norms that guide physicians' decisions and their recourse to technological aids to preserve life. Though crucial, this objective is not easy to achieve. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically the real-life bioethical dilemmas with which palliative physicians are confronted when treating terminal cancer patients. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, observational, comparative, prospective and mixed (qualitative and quantitative) study was conducted in order to analyse the correlation between the palliative doctor-patient relationship and ethical judgments regarding everyday bioethical dilemmas that arise in palliative clinical practice. The values at stake in decision-making on a daily basis were also explored. From February 2012 to march 2014, palliative healthcare personnel were invited to participate in a research project on axiology of clinical practice in palliative medicine. Each participant answered to a set of survey instruments focusing on ethical dilemmas, views, and representations of clinical practice. For this analysis we selected a convenience sample of 30 physicians specialized in pain medicine and palliative care (algologists and palliativists), with two or more years of experience with oncologic patients and end-of-life care. RESULTS: 113 dilemmas were obtained, the most frequent of which were those regarding sedation, home administration of opioids, and institutional regulations. We observed that the ethical nucleus of palliative medicine is truth-telling, implying bidirectional trust between patients and healthcare providers. The two most prominent virtues among the participants in our study were justice and professional humility. The outstanding roles of the physician in palliative medicine are as educator and as adviser, followed by that of provider of medical assistance. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation opens up new horizons in a career path where professional wearing is rampant. The rediscovery of values and virtues in palliative clinical practice will renew and replenish the motivation of healthcare providers who carry out these duties, giving them a new professional and personal perspective of growth.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0003-2,16,NA,11,eng,1472-6939,"Disclosure and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Trust and Patient Education as Topic and Attitude of Health Personnel and Pain Management and Social Justice and *Ethics, Medical and *Physician-Patient Relations and *Bioethical Issues and Neoplasms/*therapy and Decision Making/*ethics and Bioethics and Terminal Care/*ethics and Virtues and Palliative Care/*ethics/trends",NA,NA,2015/02/26/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pullman_2013_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"""Media, politics and science policy: MS and evidence from the CCSVI Trenches""","Pullman, Daryl and Zarzeczny, Amy and Picard, Andre",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, Dr. Paolo Zamboni proposed chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) as a possible cause of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although his theory and the associated treatment (""liberation therapy"") received little more than passing interest in the international scientific and medical communities, his ideas became the source of tremendous public and political tension in Canada. The story moved rapidly from mainstream media to social networking sites. CCSVI and liberation therapy swiftly garnered support among patients and triggered remarkable and relentless advocacy efforts. Policy makers have responded in a variety of ways to the public's call for action. DISCUSSION: We present three different perspectives on this evolving story, that of a health journalist who played a key role in the media coverage of this issue, that of a health law and policy scholar who has closely observed the unfolding public policy developments across the country, and that of a medical ethicist who sits on an expert panel convened by the MS Society of Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to assess the evidence as it emerges. SUMMARY: This story raises important questions about resource allocation and priority setting in scientific research and science policy. The growing power of social media represents a new level of citizen engagement and advocacy, and emphasizes the importance of open debate about the basis on which such policy choices are made. It also highlights the different ways evidence may be understood, valued and utilized by various stakeholders and further emphasizes calls to improve science communication so as to support balanced and informed decision-making.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-6,14,NA,6,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Decision Making and Canada and Research Support as Topic and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Social Media and *Health Policy and *Policy Making and *Politics and Saskatchewan and *Health Care Rationing and *Patient Advocacy and Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects and Brain/blood supply and Clinical Trials as Topic/economics/ethics and Multiple Sclerosis/*etiology/*therapy and Spine/blood supply and Stents/adverse effects and Venous Insufficiency/*complications",NA,NA,2013/02/12/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Breitsameter_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,Medical decision-making and communication of risks: an ethical perspective,"Breitsameter, Christof",Journal of medical ethics,"The medical decision-making process is currently in flux. Decisions are no longer made entirely at the physician's discretion: patients are becoming more and more involved in the process. There is a great deal of discussion about the ideal of 'informed consent', that is that diagnostic and therapeutic decisions should be made based on an interaction between physician and patient. This means that patients are informed about the advantages and disadvantages of a treatment as well as alternatives to the treatment; then, based on this information they can decide whether or not they want to undergo the treatment. However, recent studies show that the realisation of the ideal of 'shared decision-making' faces a number of difficulties related to the fact that patients are not provided with complete and accurate information. Using the example of breast cancer screening, this article examines the question of whether, in light of these difficulties, the ideal of informed decision-making is only an illusion or whether concrete steps can be taken towards the realisation of this ideal.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.033282,36,6,349-352,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Risk and Humans and Patient Education as Topic and Mass Screening and *Communication and *Ethics, Medical and *Informed Consent and Decision Making/*ethics",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the global north, communication patterns have been regulated to promote autonomy, whereas in the global south, they reflect the physician's personal choices. The goal of this study was to contribute to knowledge on the communication patterns used in clinical practice in Mexico and to identify the determinants that favour a doctor-patient relationship characterized by low paternalism/autonomy. METHODS: A self-report study on communication patterns in a sample of 761 mental healthcare professionals in Central and Western Mexico was conducted. Multiple ordinal logistic regression models were used to analyse paternalism and associated factors. RESULTS: A high prevalence (68.7% [95% CI 60.0-70.5]) of paternalism was observed among mental health professionals in Mexico. The main determinants of low paternalism/autonomy were medical specialty (OR 1.67 [95% CI 1.16-2.40]) and gender, with female physicians being more likely to explicitly share diagnoses and therapeutic strategies with patients and their families (OR 1.57 [95% CI 1.11-2.22]). A pattern of highly explicit communication was strongly associated with low paternalism/autonomy (OR 12.13 [95% CI 7.71-19.05]). Finally, a modifying effect of age strata on the association between communication pattern or specialty and low paternalism/autonomy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Among mental health professionals in Mexico, high paternalism prevailed. Gender, specialty, and a pattern of open communication were closely associated with low paternalism/autonomy. Strengthening health professionals' competencies and promoting explicit communication could contribute to the transition towards more autonomist communication in clinical practice in Mexico.

Turnham_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Minority report: can minor parents refuse treatment for their child?,"Turnham, Helen Lynne and Binik, Ariella and Wilkinson, Dominic",Journal of medical ethics,"Infants are unable to make their own decisions or express their own wishes about medical procedures and treatments. They rely on surrogates to make decisions for them. Who should be the decision-maker when an infant's biological parents are also minors? In this paper, we analyse a case in which the biological mother is a child. The central questions raised by the case are whether minor parents should make medical decisions on behalf of an infant, and if so, what are the limits to this decision-making authority? In particular, can they refuse treatment that might be considered best for the infant? We examine different ethical arguments to underpin parental decision-making authority; we argue that provided that minor parents are capable of fulfilling their parental duties, they should have a right to make medical decisions for their infant. We then examine the ethical limits to minor parents' decision-making authority for their children. We argue that the restricted authority that teenagers are granted to make medical decisions for themselves looks very similar to the restricted autonomy of all parents. That is, they are permitted to make choices, but not harmful choices. Like all parents, minor parents must not abuse or neglect their children and must also promote their welfare. They have a moral right to make medical decisions for their infants within the same 'zone of parental discretion' that applies to adult parents.

Erbay_2014_Nursethi,JOUR,Attitudes of prehospital emergency care professionals toward refusal of treatment: A regional survey in Turkey,"Erbay, Hasan and Alan, Sultan and Kadioglu, Selim",Nursing ethics,"INTRODUCTION: Prehospital emergency medicine is a specific field of emergency medicine. The basic approach of prehospital emergency medicine is to provide patients with medical intervention at the scene of the incident. This special environment causes health professionals to encounter various problems. One of the most important problems in this field is ethics, in particular questions involving refusal of treatment and the processes associated with it. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify emergency health professionals' views regarding refusal of treatment. METHODS: This study was conducted with 356 health professionals who were on active duty in prehospital emergency health services. The data were collected through a form which included 10 statements. The participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with the statements given by rating them between 0 and 10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Before conducting the research, permission was received from the local ethics committee. Participants were given written information about the purpose of the study. Participants were assured that their participation was voluntary. RESULTS: The healthcare professionals with fewer years of experience in the profession and female participants adopted an attitude of giving priority to providing care. Young participants, in general, respected patient autonomy. However, paradoxically, when it comes to emergency medical cases, they expressed an opinion closer to paternalism. CONCLUSIONS: This study has found that prehospital emergency health professionals generally respect the patient's right to refuse treatment; however, they do not prioritize this right when there is a life-threatening situation or when the person does not have decision-making capacity. In these cases, prehospital emergency health professionals tended to adopt a more paternalistic approach.",2014,10.1177/0969733013505311,21,5,530-539,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Paternalism and paternalism and Turkey and Personal Autonomy and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Emergency Medical Services and Autonomy and *Treatment Refusal and prehospital emergency medicine and refusal of treatment and right to refuse treatment,NA,NA,2014/08//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ursin_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Protect us from ourselves: Balancing the parental instinct of saving,"Ursin, Lars and Syltern, Janicke",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Neonatologists, legal experts and ethicists extensively discuss the ethical challenges of decision-making when a child is born at the limit of viability. The voices of parents are less heard in this discussion. In Norway, parents are actively shielded from the burden of decision-making responsibility. In an era of increasing patient autonomy, is this position still defendable? RESEARCH QUESTION: In this article, we discuss the role of parents in neonatal decision-making, based on the following research question: Should parents decide whether to provide lifesaving treatment when their child is born at the limit of viability? RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted eight interviews with 12 parents, 4 individuals and 4 couples, all having experienced prenatal counselling at the limit of viability. The interviews took place at different university locations in Norway in the years 2014-2018. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: All study participants gave their written informed consent. The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics approved the study. FINDINGS: We identified six main themes in parents' responses to the research question. Parents (1) experienced an emotional turmoil confronted with birth at the border of viability, (2) emphasized the importance of being involved in decision-making, (3) described and reflected on the need to balance the parental instinct of saving, (4) were concerned about the dilemmas involved in protecting the family, (5) were worried about the burden of overwhelming responsibility and (6) called for guideline relief. CONCLUSION: The perceived parental instinct of saving the life of their child makes it hard for parents to step away from a call for 'everything to be done'. Involvement of an interprofessional periviability team drawing on the experiences and viewpoints of nurses and neonatologists in decision-making is needed to protect both infants and parents against undue parental push for treatment and enable parents to make good decisions regarding their child.",2020,10.1177/0969733019871691,27,5,1282-1296,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Infant and Qualitative Research and Norway and Infant, Newborn and Decision Making/ethics and *Professional-Family Relations and Parents/*psychology and Interviews as Topic/methods and *Instinct and extremely premature infants and Infant, Premature/psychology and life-and-death decisions and neonatal nursing and Parenting/*psychology and role of parents",NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition to completing their training, nurses need to reflect on and use ethically grounded arguments and defined ethical values such as patient's dignity in their clinical work. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to gain a deeper understanding of how nurses deal with ethical decision-making in daily practice. The chosen research question is ""How do nurses participate in ethical decision-making for the patient?"" DESIGN AND METHOD: We use Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics as well as Kvale and Brinkmann's three levels of understanding in interpreting the data material. Nine registered nurses were interviewed. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The Ombudsman of Norwegian Social Science Data and the head of the hospital approved the investigation. The participants received both oral and written information about the study and they gave their consent.

RESULTS: Four key themes emerged: (1) confusion in relation to professional and operational expectations of role, (2) ideal somnolence, (3) inadequate argumentation skills, and (4) compound pressure. CONCLUSION: Ethical ideals appear to be latent in the mindset of the participants; however, the main finding of this investigation is that nurses need to activate the ideals and apply them into practice.

Our research will seek empirical survey evidence about the roles, responsibilities, and information and policy needs of the key stakeholders in the introduction into clinical practice of new surgical devices for pelvic floor surgery, in terms of the underlying ethical principals involved in the economic decision-making process, using the example of pelvic floor procedures. METHODS/DESIGN: Our study involves three linked case studies using, as examples, selected pelvic floor surgery devices representing Health Canada device safety risk classes: low, medium and high risk. Data collection will focus on stakeholder roles and responsibilities, information and policy needs, and perceptions of those of other key stakeholders, in seeking and using evidence about new surgical devices when licensing and adopting them into practice. For each class of device, interviews will be used to seek the opinions of stakeholders. The following stakeholders and ethical and economic principles provide the theoretical framework for the study: Stakeholders--federal regulatory body, device manufacturers, clinicians, patients, health care institutions, provincial health departments, and professional societies. Clinical settings in two centres (in different provinces) will be included. Ethics--beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice.

Hernandez.Marrero_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Palliative care nursing involvement in end-of-life decision-making: Qualitative secondary analysis,"Hernandez-Marrero, Pablo and Fradique, Emilia and Pereira, Sandra Martins",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Nurses are the largest professional group in healthcare and those who make more decisions. In 2014, the Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe launched the ""Guide on the decision-making process regarding medical treatment in end-of-life situations"" (hereinafter, Guide), aiming at improving decision-making processes and empowering professionals in making end-of-life decisions. The Guide does not mention nurses explicitly. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the ethical principles most valued by nurses working in palliative care when making end-of-life decisions and investigate if they are consistent with the framework and recommendations of the Guide; to identify what disputed/controversial issues are more frequent in these nurses' current end-of-life care practices. DESIGN: Qualitative secondary analysis. PARTICIPANTS/CONTEXT: Three qualitative datasets including 32 interviews from previous studies with nurses working in palliative care in Portugal. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Research Lab of the Instituto de Bioetica (Ethics Research Lab of the Institute of Bioethics) (Ref.04.2015). Ethical procedures are thoroughly described. FINDINGS: All participant nurses referred to autonomy as an ethical principle paramount in end-of-life decision-making. They were commonly involved in end-of-life decision-making. Palliative sedation and communication were the most mentioned disputed/controversial issues. DISCUSSION: Autonomy was highly valued in end-of-life care and decision-making. Nurses expressed major concerns in assessing patients' preferences, wishes, and promoting advance care planning. Nurses working in palliative care in Portugal were highly involved in end-of-life decision-making. These processes embraced a collective, inclusive approach. Palliative sedation was the most mentioned disputed issue, which is aligned with previous findings. Communication also emerged as a sensitive ethical issue; it is surprising, however, that only three nurses referred to it. CONCLUSION: While the Guide does not explicitly mention nurses in its content, this study shows that nurses working in palliative care in Portugal are involved in these processes. Further research is needed on nurses' involvement and practices in end-of-life decision-making.",2019,10.1177/0969733018774610,26,6,1680-1695,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,Decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and guidelines and Qualitative Research and Attitude of Health Personnel and Portugal and Decision Making/*ethics and Interviews as Topic/methods and end-of-life decisions and palliative care and nursing ethics and end-of-life and ethical principles and Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing/ethics/*methods and qualitative secondary analysis and Terminal Care/*ethics/methods,NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Audrey_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Young people's views about the purpose and composition of research ethics committees: findings from the PEARL qualitative study,"Audrey, Suzanne and Brown, Lindsey and Campbell, Rona and Boyd, Andy and Macleod, John",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a birth cohort study within which the Project to Enhance ALSPAC through Record Linkage (PEARL) was established to enrich the ALSPAC resource through linkage between ALSPAC participants and routine sources of health and social data. PEARL incorporated qualitative research to seek the views of young people about data linkage, including their opinions about appropriate safeguards and research governance. In this paper we focus on views expressed about the purpose and composition of research ethics committees. METHODS: Digitally recorded interviews were conducted with 48 participants aged 17-19 years. Participants were asked about whether medical research should be monitored and controlled, their knowledge of research ethics committees, who should sit on these committees and what their role should be. Interview recordings were fully transcribed and anonymised. Thematic analysis was undertaken, assisted by the Framework approach to data management. RESULTS: The majority of interviewees had little or no specific knowledge of ethics committees. Once given basic information about research ethics committees, only three respondents suggested there was no need for such bodies to scrutinise research. The key tasks of ethics committees were identified as monitoring the research process and protecting research participants. The difficulty of balancing the potential to inhibit research against the need to protect research participants was acknowledged. The importance of relevant research and professional expertise was identified but it was also considered important to represent wider public opinion, and to counter the bias potentially associated with self-selection possibly through a selection process similar to 'jury duty'. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more education and public awareness about the role and composition of research ethics committees. Despite an initial lack of knowledge, interviewees were able to contribute their ideas and balance the rights of individuals with the wider benefits from research. The suggestion that public opinion should be represented through random selection similar to jury duty may be worth pursuing in the light of the need to ensure diversity of opinion and establish trust amongst the general public about the use of 'big data' for the wider public good.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0133-1,17,1,53,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Social Responsibility and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Young Adult and Longitudinal Studies and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Qualitative research and Qualitative Research and Informed Consent and Public Opinion and *Attitude and Social Control, Formal and Ethical Analysis and Biomedical Research/*ethics and *Ethics Committees, Research and ALSPAC and Data linkage and Research ethics committees and Young people",NA,NA,2016/09/02/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bremer_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Ethical conflicts in patient relationships: Experiences of ambulance nursing students,"Bremer, Anders and Holmberg, Mats",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Working as an ambulance nurse involves facing ethically problematic situations with multi-dimensional suffering, requiring the ability to create a trustful relationship. This entails a need to be clinically trained in order to identify ethical conflicts. AIM: To describe ethical conflicts in patient relationships as experienced by ambulance nursing students during clinical studies. RESEARCH DESIGN: An exploratory and interpretative design was used to inductively analyse textual data from examinations in clinical placement courses. PARTICIPANTS: The 69 participants attended a 1-year educational programme for ambulance nurses at a Swedish university. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave voluntary informed consent for this study. FINDINGS: The students encountered ethical conflicts in patient relationships when they had inadequate access to the patient's narrative. Doubts regarding patient autonomy were due to uncertainty regarding the patient's decision-making ability, which forced students to handle patient autonomy. Conflicting assessments of the patient's best interest added to the conflicts and also meant a disruption in patient focus. The absence of trustful relationships reinforced the ethical conflicts, together with an inadequacy in meeting different needs, which limited the possibility of providing proper care. DISCUSSION: Contextual circumstances add complexity to ethical conflicts regarding patient autonomy, dependency and the patient's best interest. Students felt they were fluctuating between paternalism and letting the patient choose, and were challenged by considerations regarding the patient's communication and decision-making ability, the views of third parties, and the need for prioritisation. CONCLUSION: The essence of the patient relationship is a struggle to preserve autonomy while focusing on the patient's best interest. Hence, there is a need for education and training that promotes ethical knowledge and ethical reflection focusing on the core nursing and caring values of trust and autonomy, particularly in situations that affect the patient's decision-making ability.",2020,10.1177/0969733020911077,27,4,946-959,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Trust and Qualitative Research and Sweden and thematic analysis and *Personal Autonomy and Ambulances and Ambulance service and Decision Making/*ethics and Emergency Medical Services/*ethics and *Relational Autonomy and Students, Nursing/*psychology and clinical studies and ethical conflicts and Nurse-Patient Relations/*ethics and nursing students and patient relationship",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Initially, consequentialist and deontological ethical theory are outlined. The concepts of autonomy, paternalism and competence are described and an overview of Beauchamp and Childress's principle-based approach to moral reasoning is given. Relevant common law is discussed and the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in assessing competence is evaluated. In order to demonstrate the consideration of moral issues in clinical practice, ethical theory is applied to two well-known incidents: the case of Re MB, where doubt over decision-making capacity led to a paternalistic act to override a patient's choice; and the death of Emma Gough, a situation where respect for autonomy prevailed when healthcare staff acted lawfully in following a patient's refusal of life-saving treatment.

Ling_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,"Truth-telling, decision-making, and ethics among cancer patients in nursing practice in China","Ling, Dong-Lan and Yu, Hong-Jing and Guo, Hui-Ling",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Truth-telling toward terminally ill patients is a challenging ethical issue in healthcare practice. However, there are no existing ethical guidelines or frameworks provided for Chinese nurses in relation to decision-making on truth-telling of terminal illness and the role of nurses thus is not explicit when encountering this issue. OBJECTIVES: The intention of this paper is to provide ethical guidelines or strategies with regards to decision-making on truth-telling of terminal illness for Chinese nurses. METHODS: This paper initially present a case scenario and then critically discuss the ethical issue in association with ethical principles and philosophical theories. Instead of focusing on attitudes toward truth disclosure, it aims to provide strategies regarding this issue for nurses. It highlights and discusses some of the relevant ethical assumptions around the perceived role of nurses in healthcare settings by focusing on nursing ethical virtues, nursing codes of ethics, and philosophical perspectives. And Confucian culture is discussed to explicate that deontology does not consider family-oriented care in China. CONCLUSION: Treating each family individually to explore the family's beliefs and values on this issue is essential in healthcare practice and nurses should tailor their own approach to individual needs regarding truth-telling in different situations. Moreover, the Chinese Code of Ethics should be modified to be more specific and applicable. Finally, a narrative ethics approach should be applied and teamwork between nurses, physicians and families should be established to support cancer patients and to ensure their autonomy and hope.

Hein_2015_BMCmedeth_1,JOUR,Informed consent instead of assent is appropriate in children from the age of twelve: Policy implications of new findings on children's competence to consent to clinical research,"Hein, Irma M. and De Vries, Martine C. and Troost, Pieter W. and Meynen, Gerben and Van Goudoever, Johannes B. and Lindauer, Ramon J. L.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: For many decades, the debate on children's competence to give informed consent in medical settings concentrated on ethical and legal aspects, with little empirical underpinnings. Recently, data from empirical research became available to advance the discussion. It was shown that children's competence to consent to clinical research could be accurately assessed by the modified MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. Age limits for children to be deemed competent to decide on research participation have been studied: generally children of 11.2 years and above were decision-making competent, while children of 9.6 years and younger were not. Age was pointed out to be the key determining factor in children's competence. In this article we reflect on policy implications of these findings, considering legal, ethical, developmental and clinical perspectives. DISCUSSION: Although assessment of children's competence has a normative character, ethics, law and clinical practice can benefit from research data. The findings may help to do justice to the capacities children possess and challenges they may face when deciding about treatment and research options. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of standardized competence assessment in children on a case-by-case basis compared to application of a fixed age limit, and conclude that a selective implementation of case-by-case competence assessment in specific populations is preferable. We recommend the implementation of age limits based on empirical evidence. Furthermore, we elaborate on a suitable model for informed consent involving children and parents that would do justice to developmental aspects of children and the specific characteristics of the parent-child dyad. Previous research outcomes showed that children's medical decision-making capacities could be operationalized into a standardized assessment instrument. Recommendations for policies include a dual consent procedure, including both child as well as parents, for children from the age of 12 until they reach majority. For children between 10 and 12 years of age, and in case of children older than 12 years in special research populations of mentally compromised patients, we suggest a case-by-case assessment of children's competence to consent. Since such a dual consent procedure is fundamentally different from a procedure of parental permission and child assent, and would imply a considerable shift regarding some current legislations, practical implications are elaborated.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0067-z,16,1,76,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Child and Comprehension and Age Factors and Guidelines as Topic and Empirical Research and Liability, Legal and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Mental Competency and Biomedical Research/*ethics and Patient Participation/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and Refusal to Participate/*ethics/psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2015/11/09/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rady_2010_BMCmedeth,JOUR,End-of-life discontinuation of destination therapy with cardiac and ventilatory support medical devices: physician-assisted death or allowing the patient to die?,"Rady, Mohamed Y. and Verheijde, Joseph L.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Bioethics and law distinguish between the practices of ""physician-assisted death"" and ""allowing the patient to die."" DISCUSSION: Advances in biotechnology have allowed medical devices to be used as destination therapy that are designed for the permanent support of cardiac function and/or respiration after irreversible loss of these spontaneous vital functions. For permanent support of cardiac function, single ventricle or biventricular mechanical assist devices and total artificial hearts are implanted in the body. Mechanical ventilators extrinsic to the body are used for permanent support of respiration. Clinical studies have shown that destination therapy with ventricular assist devices improves patient survival compared to medical management, but at the cost of a substantial alteration in end-of-life trajectories. The moral and legal assessment of the appropriateness and permissibility of complying with a patient's request to electively discontinue destination therapy in a life-terminating act in non-futile situations has generated controversy. Some argue that complying with this request is ethically justified because patients have the right to request withdrawal of unwanted treatment and be allowed to die of preexisting disease. Other commentators reject the argument that acceding to an elective request for death by discontinuing destination therapy is 'allowing a patient to die' because of serious flaws in interpreting the intention, causation, and moral responsibility of the ensuing death. SUMMARY: Destination therapy with cardiac and/or ventilatory medical devices replaces native physiological functions and successfully treats a preexisting disease. We posit that discontinuing cardiac and/or ventilatory support at the request of a patient or surrogate can be viewed as allowing the patient to die if--and only if--concurrent lethal pathophysiological conditions are present that are unrelated to those functions already supported by medical devices in destination therapy. In all other cases, compliance with a patient's request constitutes physician-assisted death because of the pathophysiology induced by the turning off of these medical devices, as well as the intention, causation, and moral responsibility of the ensuing death. The distinction between allowing the patient to die and physician-assisted death is pivotal to the moral and legal status of elective requests for death by discontinuing destination cardiac and/or ventilatory medical devices in patients who are not imminently dying. This distinction also represents essential information that must be disclosed to patients and surrogates in advance of consent to this type of therapy.",2010,10.1186/1472-6939-11-15,11,NA,15,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Causality and Intention and Ethics, Clinical and Ethics, Medical and *Respiration, Artificial and Decision Making/ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and *Moral Obligations and Ethical Analysis and Medical Futility/ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and Physicians/*ethics and *Heart-Assist Devices and Euthanasia, Active/*ethics and Euthanasia, Passive/*ethics and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2010/09/15/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This may also hold for patients with advanced dementia. We investigated the differing opinions of physicians and members of the general public on the acceptability of euthanasia in patients with advanced dementia. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 16 medical specialists, 19 general practitioners, 16 elderly physicians and 16 members of the general public were interviewed and asked for their opinions about a vignette on euthanasia based on an AED in a patient with advanced dementia. RESULTS: Members of the general public perceived advanced dementia as a debilitating and degrading disease. Physicians emphasized the need for direct communication with the patient when making decisions about euthanasia. Respondent from both groups acknowledged difficulties in the assessment of patients' autonomous wishes and the unbearableness of their suffering. CONCLUSION: Legally, an AED may replace direct communication with patients about their request for euthanasia. In practice, physicians are reluctant to forego adequate verbal communication with the patient because they wish to verify the voluntariness of patients' request and the unbearableness of suffering.

Krishna_2017_Nursethi,JOUR,Applying the welfare model to at-own-risk discharges,"Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha and Menon, Sumytra and Kanesvaran, Ravindran",Nursing ethics,"""At-own-risk discharges"" or ""self-discharges"" evidences an irretrievable breakdown in the patient-clinician relationship when patients leave care facilities before completion of medical treatment and against medical advice. Dissolution of the therapeutic relationship terminates the physician's duty of care and professional liability with respect to care of the patient. Acquiescence of an at-own-risk discharge by the clinician is seen as respecting patient autonomy. The validity of such requests pivot on the assumptions that the patient is fully informed and competent to invoke an at-own-risk discharge and that care up to the point of the at-own-risk discharge meets prevailing clinical standards. Palliative care's use of a multidisciplinary team approach challenges both these assumptions. First by establishing multiple independent therapeutic relations between professionals in the multidisciplinary team and the patient who persists despite an at-own-risk discharge. These enduring therapeutic relationships negate the suggestion that no duty of care is owed the patient. Second, the continued employ of collusion, familial determinations, and the circumnavigation of direct patient involvement in family-centric societies compromises the patient's decision-making capacity and raises questions as to the patient's decision-making capacity and their ability to assume responsibility for the repercussions of invoking an at-own-risk discharge. With the validity of at-own-risk discharge request in question and the welfare and patient interest at stake, an alternative approach to assessing at-own-risk discharge requests are called for. The welfare model circumnavigates these concerns and preserves the patient's welfare through the employ of a multidisciplinary team guided holistic appraisal of the patient's specific situation that is informed by clinical and institutional standards and evidenced-based practice. The welfare model provides a robust decision-making framework for assessing the validity of at-own-risk discharge requests on a case-by-case basis.",2017,10.1177/0969733015617340,24,5,525-537,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Risk and Humans and Liability, Legal and Singapore and Personal Autonomy and *Choice Behavior and palliative care and *Patient Dropouts and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and end of life and Patient-Centered Care/ethics and *Treatment Refusal and ""At-own-risk discharges"" and ""discharges against medical advice"" and leaves against medical advice and Patient Care/ethics and self-discharge and Terminal Care/ethics and welfare model",NA,NA,2017/08//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This understanding of medical futility is problematic because it rests on the final outcomes of procedures that are narrow and medically defined.

Denier_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,'You can give them wings to fly': a qualitative study on values-based leadership in health care,"Denier, Yvonne and Dhaene, Lieve and Gastmans, Chris",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Within contemporary health care, many of the decisions affecting the health and well-being of patients are not being made by the clinicians or health professionals, but by those involved in health care management. Existing literature on organizational ethics provides insight into the various structures, processes and strategies - such as mission statement, ethics committees, ethical rounds ... - that exist to create an organizational climate, which fosters ethical practices and decision-making It does not, however, show how health care managers experience their job as being intrinsically ethical in itself. In the present article, we investigate the way in which ethical values are present in the lived experiences and daily practice of health care management. What does it imply to take up a managing position within a health care institution and to try to do this in an ethically inspired way? METHOD: We carried out a qualitative study (Grounded Theory Approach) to explore the essence of values-based leadership in health care. We interviewed 15 people with extensive experience in health care management in the fields of elderly care, hospital care and mental health care in the various regions of Flanders, Belgium. RESULTS: Six predominant themes, presented as metaphors, illustrate the essence of values-based leadership in health care management. These are: (1) values-based health care management as managing a large garden, (2) as learning and using a foreign language, (3) going on a trekking with an ethical compass, (4) embodying integrity and authenticity in a credible encounter with everyone, (5) being a present and trustworthy leader during sun and storm, and (6) contributing to human flourishing by giving people wings to fly. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the importance of organizing a good ethics infrastructure, values-based leadership in health care entails much more than that. It is about the co-creation of an integrated and comprehensive ethical climate of which community-model thinking and authentic leadership are essential components. As a never-ending process, the six metaphors can help leaders to take substantive proactive steps to shape a fruitful ethical climate within their organization.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0374-x,20,1,35,eng,1472-6939,"Organizational Culture and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Health care management and Qualitative research and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Grounded theory and Grounded Theory and Organizational Policy and Ethics, Medical and *Leadership and Ethical decision-making and Authentic leadership and Delivery of Health Care/ethics/*organization & administration and Values-based leadership",NA,NA,2019/05/27/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lind_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Sense of responsibility in ICU end-of-life decision-making: Relatives' experiences,"Lind, Ranveig",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Relatives of intensive care unit patients who lack or have reduced capacity to consent are entitled to information and participation in decision-making together with the patient. Practice varies with legislation in different countries. In Norway, crucial decisions such as withdrawing treatment are made by clinicians, usually morally justified to relatives with reference to the principle of non-maleficence. The relatives should, however, be consulted about whether they know what the patient would have wished in the situation. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: To examine and describe relatives' experiences of responsibility in the intensive care unit decision-making process. RESEARCH DESIGN: A secondary analysis of interviews with bereaved relatives of intensive care unit patients was performed, using a narrative analytical approach. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In all, 27 relatives of 21 deceased intensive care unit patients were interviewed about their experiences from the end-of-life decision-making process. Most interviews took place in the participants' homes, 3-12 months after the patient's death. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Based on informed consent, the study was approved by the Data Protection Official of the Norwegian Social Science Data Services and by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. FINDINGS: The results show that intensive care unit relatives experienced a sense of responsibility in the decision-making process, independently of clinicians' intention of sparing them. Some found this troublesome. Three different variants of participation were revealed, ranging from paternalism to a more active role for relatives. DISCUSSION: For the study participants, the sense of responsibility reflects the fact that ethics and responsibility are grounded in the individual's relationship to other people. Relatives need to be included in a continuous dialogue over time to understand decisions and responsibility. CONCLUSION: Nurses and physicians should acknowledge and address relatives' sense of responsibility, include them in regular dialogue and help them separate their responsibility from that of the clinicians.",2019,10.1177/0969733017703697,26,1,270-279,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Qualitative Research and Norway and responsibility and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and *Decision Making and intensive care unit and Family/*psychology and Withholding Treatment/ethics and End-of-life and relatives and Terminal Care/ethics/*psychology and withdrawal and withholding,NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kadooka_2012_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Can physicians' judgments of futility be accepted by patients? A comparative survey of Japanese physicians and laypeople,"Kadooka, Yasuhiro and Asai, Atsushi and Bito, Seiji",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Empirical surveys about medical futility are scarce relative to its theoretical assumptions. We aimed to evaluate the difference of attitudes between laypeople and physicians towards the issue. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was designed. Japanese laypeople (via Internet) and physicians with various specialties (via paper-and-pencil questionnaire) were asked about whether they would provide potentially futile treatments for end-of-life patients in vignettes, important factors for judging a certain treatment futile, and threshold of quantitative futility which reflects the numerical probability that an act will produce the desired physiological effect. Also, the physicians were asked about their practical frequency and important reasons for futile treatments. RESULTS: 1134 laypeople and 401 (80%) physicians responded. In all vignettes, the laypeople were more affirmative in providing treatments in question significantly. As the factors for judging futility, medical information and quality of life (QOL) of the patient were rather stressed by the physicians. Treatment wish of the family of the patient and psychological impact on patient side due to the treatment were rather stressed by laypeople. There were wide variations in the threshold of judging quantitative futility in both groups. 88.3% of the physicians had practical experience of providing futile treatment. Important reasons for it were communication problem with patient side and lack of systems regarding futility or foregoing such treatment. CONCLUSION: Laypeople are more supportive of providing potentially futile treatments than physicians. The difference is explained by the importance of medical information, the patient family's influence to decision-making and QOL of the patient. The threshold of qualitative futility is suggested to be arbitrary.",2012,10.1186/1472-6939-13-7,13,NA,7,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Cross-Sectional Studies and Life Expectancy and Aged and Cost Control and Surveys and Questionnaires and Aged, 80 and over and Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic and Treatment Failure and Japan and *Quality of Life and *Judgment and Withholding Treatment/ethics and *Medical Futility and Patients/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and Physicians/ethics/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2012/04/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Karlsson_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Ethical dilemmas during cardiac arrest incidents in the patient's home,"Karlsson, Mattias and Karlsson, Niclas and Hilli, Yvonne",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The majority (70%) of cardiac arrests in Sweden are experienced in the patient's home. In these situations, the ambulance nurses may encounter several ethical dilemmas. AIM: The aim was to investigate Swedish specialist ambulance nurses' experiences of ethical dilemmas associated with cardiac arrest situations in adult patients' homes. METHODS: Nine interviews were conducted with specialist ambulance nurses at four different ambulance stations in the southeast region of Sweden. Data were analysed using content analysis. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical principles mandated by the Swedish Research Council were carefully followed during the whole process. FINDINGS: Two main themes with six sub-themes were identified: The scene - creating a sheltered space for caring and Ethical decision-making. The results showed that ethical dilemmas might occur when trying to create a sheltered space to preserve the patients' integrity and dignity. A dilemma could be whether or not to invite significant others to be present during the medical treatment. Ethical decision-making was dependent on good communication and ethical reasoning among all parties. In certain situations, decisions were made not to commence or to terminate care despite guidelines. The decision was guided by combining the medical/nursing perspectives and ethical competence with respect to the human being's dignity and a will to do good for the patient. The nurses followed the voice of their heart and had the courage to be truly human. CONCLUSION: The ambulance nurses were guided by their ethos, including the basic motive to care for the patient, to alleviate suffering, to confirm the patient's dignity and to serve life and health.",2019,10.1177/0969733017709337,26,2,625-637,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"qualitative study and Humans and Qualitative Research and Sweden and Attitude of Health Personnel and Ethics, Nursing and Interviews as Topic/methods and Nurses/*psychology and cardiac arrest and Emergency Medical Services/*ethics and Problem Solving/ethics and *Accidents, Home and Ambulance nurse and ethical dilemmas and ethos and interview and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*nursing and patient's home",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

A qualitative study from Norway,"Romoren, Maria and Pedersen, Reidar and Forde, Reidun",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Ethically challenging critical events and decisions are common in nursing homes. This paper presents nursing home doctors' descriptions of how they include the patient and next of kin in end-of-life decisions. METHODS: We performed ten focus groups with 30 nursing home doctors. Advance care planning; aspects of decisions on life-prolonging treatment, and conflict with next of kin were subject to in-depth analysis and condensation. RESULTS: The doctors described large variations in attitudes and practices in all aspects of end-of-life decisions. In conflict situations, many doctors were more concerned about the opinion of next of kin than ensuring the patient's best interest.

Close_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Doctors' perceptions of how resource limitations relate to futility in end-of-life decision making: a qualitative analysis,"Close, Eliana and White, Ben P. and Willmott, Lindy and Gallois, Cindy and Parker, Malcolm and Graves, Nicholas and Winch, Sarah",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVE: To increase knowledge of how doctors perceive futile treatments and scarcity of resources at the end of life. In particular, their perceptions about whether and how resource limitations influence end-of-life decision making. This study builds on previous work that found some doctors include resource limitations in their understanding of the concept of futility. SETTING: Three tertiary hospitals in metropolitan Brisbane, Australia. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth, semistructured, face-to-face interviews. Ninety-six doctors were interviewed in 11 medical specialties. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Doctors' perceptions of whether resource limitations were relevant to their practice varied, and doctors were more comfortable with explicit rather than implicit rationing. Several doctors incorporated resource limitations into their definition of futility. For some, availability of resources was one factor of many in assessing futility, secondary to patient considerations, but a few doctors indicated that the concept of futility concealed rationing. Doctors experienced moral distress due to the resource implications of providing futile treatment and the lack of administrative supports for bedside rationing. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors' ability to distinguish between futility and rationing would be enhanced through regulatory support for explicit rationing and strategies to support doctors' role in rationing at the bedside.

Bernstein_2017_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Presumed consent: licenses and limits inferred from the case of geriatric hip fractures,"Bernstein, Joseph and LeBrun, Drake and MacCourt, Duncan and Ahn, Jaimo",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are common and serious injuries in the geriatric population. Obtaining informed consent for surgery in geriatric patients can be difficult due to the high prevalence of comorbid cognitive impairment. Given that virtually all patients with hip fractures eventually undergo surgery, and given that delays in surgery are associated with increased mortality, we argue that there are select instances in which it may be ethically permissible, and indeed clinically preferable, to initiate surgical treatment in cognitively impaired patients under the doctrine of presumed consent. In this paper, we examine the boundaries of the license granted by presumed consent and use the example of geriatric hip fracture to build an ethical framework for understanding the doctrine of presumed consent. DISCUSSION: The license to act under presumed consent requires three factors: patient incapacity, clinical urgency and clarity on the correct course of action. All three can apply to geriatric hip fracture. The typical patient frequently lacks capacity. Delays in initiating surgical treatment are associated with markedly increased mortality rates. Last, there appears to be consensus that surgery is the preferred treatment. Nonetheless, because there is a window of safe delay during which treating physicians can stabilize the patient, address reversible causes of cognitive impairment and identify surrogate decision makers, presumed consent should be invoked only as a method of last resort. CONCLUSIONS: A medical situation need not be characterized by risk of imminent and certain death for presumed consent to be relevant. Rather, there are two distinct windows that must be considered: the time interval in which action may be delayed without danger, and the time interval needed to obtain a better form of consent. Presumed consent is appropriate only when the latter exceeds the former.",2017,10.1186/s12910-017-0180-2,18,1,17,eng,1472-6939,"Risk and Geriatrics and Humans and Aged and Hip fractures and Age Factors and *Ethics, Medical and Informed consent and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Mental Competency and Ethical Theory and Hip Fractures/*surgery and Presumed consent and Presumed Consent/*ethics",NA,NA,2017/02/24/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jonas_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,The baby MB case: medical decision making in the context of uncertain infant suffering,"Jonas, Monique",Journal of medical ethics,"The recent MB case involved a dispute between an infant's parents and his medical team about the appropriateness of continued life support. The dispute reflected uncertainty about two key factors that inform medical decision making for seriously ill infants: both the amount of pain MB experiences and the extent of his cognitive capacities are uncertain. Uncertainty of this order makes decision making in accordance with the best-interests principle very problematic. This article addresses two of the problems that cases such as that of MB pose for those charged with making medical decisions for infants. First, the question of the moral significance of the interest in avoiding pain is considered. It is claimed that this interest can be outweighed by higher-order interests such as those related to autonomy but that where such higher-order interests do not exist, the interest in avoiding pain should be prioritised. Second, the question of how to proceed in cases in which the level of pain or the extent of an infant's higher-order interests cannot be decisively established is considered. It is suggested that when genuine uncertainty over the interests of an infant exists, parental views about treatment should prevail.",2007,10.1136/jme.2006.017335,33,9,541-544,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,"Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Infant and Attitude of Health Personnel and Pain Management and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Parents/*psychology and Dissent and Disputes and Medical Futility/*ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics/instrumentation and Muscular Atrophy, Spinal/*therapy and Terminal Care/*ethics/organization & administration",NA,NA,2007/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Agu_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Attitude towards informed consent practice in a developing country: a community-based assessment of the role of educational status,"Agu, Kenneth Amaechi and Obi, Emmanuel Ikechukwu and Eze, Boniface Ikenna and Okenwa, Wilfred Okwudili",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported by some studies that the desire to be involved in decisions concerning one's healthcare especially with regard to obtaining informed consent is related to educational status. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to assess the influence of educational status on attitude towards informed consent practice in three south-eastern Nigerian communities. METHODS: Responses from consenting adult participants from three randomly selected communities in Enugu State, southeast Nigeria were obtained using self-/interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 2545 respondents (1508 males and 1037 females) with an age range of 18 to 65 years. More than 70% were aged 40 years and below and 28.4% were married. More than 70% of the respondents irrespective of educational status will not leave all decisions about their healthcare to the doctor. A lower proportion of those with no formal education (18.5%) will leave this entire decision-making process in the hands of the doctor compared to those with tertiary education (21.9%). On being informed of all that could go wrong with a procedure, 61.5% of those with no formal education would consider the doctor unsafe and incompetent while 64.2% of those with tertiary education would feel confident about the doctor. More than 85% of those with tertiary education would prefer consent to be obtained by the doctor who will carry out the procedure as against 33.8% of those with no formal education. Approximately 70% of those who had tertiary education indicated that informed consent was necessary for procedures on children, while the greater number of those with primary (64.4%) and no formal education (76.4%) indicated that informed consent was not necessary for procedures on children. Inability to understand the information was the most frequent specific response among those without formal education on why they would leave all the decisions to the doctor. CONCLUSION: The study showed that knowledge of the informed consent practice increased with level of educational attainment but most of the participants irrespective of educational status would want to be involved in decisions about their healthcare.

This is common at the end of a person's life where decision-making capacity is often lost. A further, and separate, decision that is often considered at the time of death (and often preceding death) is whether the person wanted to act as an organ or tissue donor. However, in some jurisdictions, the lawful decision-maker for the donation decision (the 'donation decision-maker') is different from the person who was granted decision-making authority for medical decisions during the person's life. To date, little attention has been given in the literature to the ethical concerns and practical problems that arise where this shift in legal authority occurs. Such a change in decision-making authority is particularly problematic where premortem measures are suggested to maximise the chances of a successful organ donation.

End-of-life medical ethical dilemmas in Bahrain,"Alwadaei, Sayed and Almoosawi, Barrak and Humaidan, Hani and Dovey, Susan",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Bahrain, maintaining life support at all costs is a cultural value considered to be embedded in the Islamic religion. We explore end-of-life decision making for brain dead patients in an Arab country where medical cultures are dominated by Western ideas and the lay culture is Eastern. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted from February to April 2018 with 12 Western-educated Bahraini doctors whose medical practice often included end-of-life decision making. Discussions were about who should make withdrawal of life support decisions, how decisions are made and the context for decision making. To develop results, we used the inductive method of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Informants considered it difficult to engage non-medical people in end-of-life decisions because of people's reluctance to talk about death and no legal clarity about medical responsibilities. There was disagreement about doctors' roles with some saying that end-of-life decisions were purely medical or purely religious but most maintaining that such decisions need to be collectively owned by medicine, patients, families, religious advisors and society. Informants practised in a legal vacuum that made their ethics interpretations and clinical decision making idiosyncratic regarding end-of-life care for brain dead patients. Participants referred to contrasts between their current practice and previous work in other countries, recognising the influences of religious and cultural dimensions on their practice in Bahrain.

Woolfall_2013_BMCmedeth,JOUR,How experience makes a difference: practitioners' views on the use of deferred consent in paediatric and neonatal emergency care trials,"Woolfall, Kerry and Frith, Lucy and Gamble, Carrol and Young, Bridget",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In 2008 UK legislation was amended to enable the use of deferred consent for paediatric emergency care (EC) trials in recognition of the practical and ethical difficulties of obtaining prospective consent in an emergency situation. However, ambiguity about how to make deferred consent acceptable to parents, children and practitioners remains. In particular, little is known about practitioners' views and experiences of seeking deferred consent in this setting. METHODS: As part of a wider study investigating consent methods in paediatric emergency care trials (called CONNECT), a 20 item online questionnaire was sent by email inviting practitioners (doctors and nurses) who were involved in talking with families about children's and young people's (aged 0-16 years) participation in UK EC trials. To ensure those with and without experience of deferred consent were included, practitioners were sampled using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data, whilst the constant comparative method was used to analyse qualitative data. Elements of a symbiotic empirical ethics approach was used to integrate empirical evidence and bioethical literature to explore the data and draw practice orientated conclusions. RESULTS: Views on deferred consent differed depending upon whether or not practitioners were experienced in this consent method. Practitioners who had no experience of deferred consent reported negative perceptions of this consent method; these practitioners were concerned about the impact that deferred consent would have upon the parent-practitioner relationship. In contrast, practitioners experienced in deferred consent described how families had been receptive to the consent method, if conducted sensitively and in a time appropriate manner. Experienced practitioners also described how deferred consent had improved recruitment, parental decision-making capacity and parent-practitioner relationships in the emergency care setting. CONCLUSIONS: The views of practitioners with first-hand experience of deferred consent should be considered in the design and ethical review of future paediatric EC trials; the design and ethical review of such trials should not solely be informed by the beliefs of those without experience of using deferred consent. Further research involving parents and children is required to inform practitioner training and normative guidance on the use and appropriateness of deferred consent in emergency settings.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-45,14,NA,45,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and Time Factors and Surveys and Questionnaires and United Kingdom and Electronic Mail and Attitude of Health Personnel and Infant, Newborn and Physicians/*statistics & numerical data and Decision Making/*ethics and Professional-Family Relations/*ethics and Emergency Medical Services/*ethics and Clinical Trials as Topic/*ethics and Nurses/*statistics & numerical data and Parental Consent/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2013/11/06/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies on physicians' opinions about assisted dying (euthanasia or assisted suicide) exist, but changes in physicians' attitudes towards hastened death in clinical decision-making and the background factors explaining this remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in these attitudes among Finnish physicians. METHODS: A questionnaire including hypothetical patient scenarios was sent to 1182 and 1258 Finnish physicians in 1999 and 2015, respectively. Two scenarios of patients with advanced cancer were presented: one requesting an increase in his morphine dose to a potentially lethal level and another suffering a cardiac arrest. Physicians' attitudes towards assisted death, life values and other background factors were queried as well. The response rate was 56%. RESULTS: The morphine dose was increased by 25% and 34% of the physicians in 1999 and 2015, respectively (p < 0.001). Oncologists approved the increase most infrequently without a significant change between the study years (15% vs. 17%, p = 0.689). Oncological specialty, faith in God, female gender and younger age were independent factors associated with the reluctance to increase the morphine dose. Euthanasia, but not assisted suicide, was considered less reprehensible in 2015 (p = 0.008). In both years, most physicians (84%) withheld cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Finnish physicians accepted the risk of hastening death more often in 2015 than in 1999. The physicians' specialty and many other background factors influenced this acceptance.

Drawing on empirical research on intentionality that has been done in other contexts, this is the first study to test whether the ""asymmetric effect"" of intention ascription is exhibited by respondents when presented with clinical decision-making scenarios. OBJECTIVE: To assess how individuals attribute intentions to clinical actors in clinical decision-making scenarios. METHODS: A total of 149 first and second year medical students was randomly assigned to two groups (group A, group B). Subjects in each group read two scenarios and submitted anonymous responses to questions regarding each scenario. RESULTS: The asymmetric effect was strongly exhibited by the responses given to scenario 2, but it was not exhibited by the responses given to scenario 1. CONCLUSION: The present study provided evidence for the view that people's ascription of intentions to others is influenced by their previous evaluative judgement of the conduct in question.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.032045,36,1,2-6,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Young Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Decision Making and *Clinical Medicine and *Intention and Students, Medical/psychology",NA,NA,2010/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Shilling_2009_BMCmedeth,JOUR,How do parents experience being asked to enter a child in a randomised controlled trial?,"Shilling, Valerie and Young, Bridget",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: As the number of randomised controlled trials of medicines for children increases, it becomes progressively more important to understand the experiences of parents who are asked to enroll their child in a trial. This paper presents a narrative review of research evidence on parents' experiences of trial recruitment focussing on qualitative research, which allows them to articulate their views in their own words. DISCUSSION: Parents want to do their best for their children, and socially and legally their role is to care for and protect them yet the complexities of the medical and research context can challenge their fulfillment of this role. Parents are simultaneously responsible for their child and cherish this role yet they are dependent on others when their child becomes sick. They are keen to exercise responsibility for deciding to enter a child in a trial yet can be fearful of making the 'wrong' decision. They make judgements about the threat of the child's condition as well as the risks of the trial yet their interpretations often differ from those of medical and research experts. Individual parents will experience these and other complexities to a greater or lesser degree depending on their personal experiences and values, the medical situation of their child and the nature of the trial. Interactions at the time of trial recruitment offer scope for negotiating these complexities if practitioners have the flexibility to tailor discussions to the needs and situation of individual parents. In this way, parents may be helped to retain a sense that they have acted as good parents to their child whatever decision they make. SUMMARY: Discussing randomised controlled trials and gaining and providing informed consent is challenging. The unique position of parents in giving proxy consent for their child adds to this challenge. Recognition of the complexities parents face in making decisions about trials suggests lines for future research on the conduct of trials, and ultimately, may help improve the experience of trial recruitment for all parties.",2009,10.1186/1472-6939-10-1,10,NA,1,eng,1472-6939,"Emotions and Humans and Social Responsibility and Female and Male and Adolescent and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Altruism and Trust and Truth Disclosure and Vulnerable Populations and *Decision Making and *Patient Selection and *Judgment and *Parents/psychology and Professional-Family Relations and *Parental Consent and *Negotiating and *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/psychology",NA,NA,2009/02/16/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Physician-related factors including gender, personal preferences to life-supporting treatment, and specialty have been found to affect the timing and selection of life-supporting treatment decision-making. This study aimed to examine the influence of physician workload on signing a DNR order in the ICUs. METHODS: This is retrospective observational study. The medical records of patients, admitted to the surgical ICUs for the first time between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, were reviewed. We used a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to examine the influence of the physician's workload on his/her writing a DNR order by adjusting for multiple factors. We then used Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank test to compare the time from ICU admission to DNR orders written for patients for two groups of physicians based on the average number of patients each physician cared for per day during data collection period. RESULTS: The hazard of writing a DNR order by the attending physicians who cared for more than one patient per day significantly decreased by 41% as compared to the hazard of writing a DNR order by those caring for fewer than one patient (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.89, P = .01). In addition, the factors associated with writing a DNR order as determined by the Cox model were non-operative, cardiac failure/insufficiency diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.71, 95% CI 1.00-2.91, P = .05) and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System score (hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, P = .03). Physicians who cared for more than one patient per day were less likely to write a DNR order for their patients than those who cared for in average fewer than one patient per day (log-rank chi-square = 5.72, P = .02).

Sibley_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Developing a new justification for assent,"Sibley, Amanda and Pollard, Andrew J. and Fitzpatrick, Raymond and Sheehan, Mark",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines do not clearly outline when assent should be attained from paediatric research participants, nor do they detail the necessary elements of the assent process. This stems from the fact that the fundamental justification behind the concept of assent is misunderstood. In this paper, we critically assess three widespread ethical arguments used for assent: children's rights, the best interests of the child, and respect for a child's developing autonomy. We then outline a newly-developed two-fold justification for the assent process: respect for the parent's pedagogical role in teaching their child to become an autonomous being and respect for the child's moral worth. DISCUSSION: We argue that the ethical grounding for the involvement of young children in medical decision-making does not stem from children's rights, the principle of best interests, or respect for developing autonomy. An alternative strategy is to examine the original motivation to engage with the child. In paediatric settings there are two obligations on the researcher: an obligation to the parents who are responsible for determining when and under what circumstances the child develops his capacity for autonomy and reasoning, and an obligation to the child himself. There is an important distinction between respecting a decision and encouraging a decision. This paper illustrates that the process of assent is an important way in which respect for the child as an individual can be demonstrated, however, the value lies not in the child's response but the fact that his views were solicited in the first place. This paper demonstrates that the common justifications for the process of assent are incomplete. Assent should be understood as playing a pedagogical role for the child, helping to teach him how specific decisions are made and therefore helping him to become a better decision-maker. How the researcher engages with the child supports his obligation to the child's parents, yet why the researcher engages with the child stems from the child's moral worth. Treating a child as having moral worth need not mean doing what they say but it may mean listening, considering, engaging or involving them in the decision.",2016,10.1186/s12910-015-0085-x,17,NA,2,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Child and *Decision Making and *Research Subjects and *Personal Autonomy and *Patient Rights and Biomedical Research/*ethics and Pediatrics/*ethics and Informed Consent By Minors/*ethics,NA,NA,2016/01/12/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Zigdon_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Barriers in implementing the dying patient law: the Israeli experience - a qualitative study,"Zigdon, Avi and Nissanholtz-Gannot, Rachel",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Coping with end-of-life issues is a major challenge for governments and health systems. Despite progress in legislation, many barriers exist to its full implementation. This study is aimed at identifying these end-of-life barriers in relation to Israel. METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews using professionals and decision makers in the health-care and related systems (n = 37) were carried out, along with two focus groups based on brainstorming techniques consisting of nurses (n = 10) and social workers (n = 10). Data was managed and analyzed using Naralyzer software. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis showed identification of six primary barriers: 1) law, procedures, and forms; 2) clinical aspects; 3) human aspects; 4) knowledge and skills of medical teams; 5) communication; and 6) resource allocation. These were further divided into 44 sub area barriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of the family doctor in end-of-life by training physicians in decision-making workshops and increasing their knowledge in the field of palliative medicine.

Aizawa_2013_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Defining futile life-prolonging treatments through Neo-Socratic Dialogue,"Aizawa, Kuniko and Asai, Atsushi and Bito, Seiji",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In Japan, people are negative towards life-prolonging treatments. Laws that regulate withholding or discontinuing life-prolonging treatments and advance directives do not exist. Physicians, however, view discontinuing life-prolonging treatments negatively due to fears of police investigations. Although ministerial guidelines were announced regarding the decision process for end-of-life care in 2007, a consensus could not be reached on the definition of end-of-life and conditions for withholding treatment. We established a forum for extended discussions and consensus building on this topic. METHODS: We used the Neo-Socratic Dialogue (NSD) method which promotes philosophical discussion based on a case-study to address a question and formulate a consensus and answer in a group. The question chosen for the dialogue was: ""What is a life-prolonging treatment?"" A series of dialogues took place over a period of one and a half days. It was carried out by three groups in 2010 and 2011. Seven participants with diverse backgrounds were recruited per group. We analyzed the content of the discussion. RESULTS: Based on three case studies concerning different opinions about treatment options for an older dementia patient, a patient demanding chemotherapy, and a severely ill neonate, conditions for futile life-prolonging treatment were elucidated through NSD. Such treatments are those carried out for the sole purpose of prolonging life and are detrimental to the patient, and should be decided based foremost on the patient's lack of desire for treatment, the consensus of those involved, and through social acceptance. These arguments are essentially consistent with ones on medical futility in the United States. By expressing the objective of healthcare and the requirement of social acceptance, participants were also able to elucidate issues related to the awareness of those involved and the medical environment. Compared to the end-of-life guidelines in Japan, the objective of treatment, its effects, and benefits were more specifically discussed with the patient's intentions as the foremost consideration, rather than being limited to the terminal stage. CONCLUSIONS: This small study contributed to elucidating the conditions and current problems of futile life-prolonging treatment through NSD. They would suggest more substantial guidelines and improvements on the administration of the treatment.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-51,14,NA,51,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Dementia and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Infant, Newborn and Critical Illness and Japan and Concept Formation and Public Opinion and Decision Making/*ethics and Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use and Dissent and Disputes and Resuscitation Orders/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Choice Behavior/ethics and Ethical Analysis and Philosophy, Medical and Terminal Care/ethics and Medical Futility/*ethics and Advance Directives/*ethics and *Negotiating and *Physicians/ethics/trends and Life Support Care/*ethics and Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards",NA,NA,2013/12/09/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Byju_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Medical error in the care of the unrepresented: disclosure and apology for a vulnerable patient population,"Byju, Arjun S. and Mayo, Kajsa",Journal of medical ethics,"Defined as patients who 'lack decision-making capacity and a surrogate decision-maker', the unrepresented (sometimes referred to as the 'unbefriended', 'isolated patients' and/or 'patients without surrogates') present a major quandary to clinicians and ethicists, especially in handling errors made in their care. A novel concern presented in the care of the unrepresented is how to address an error when there is seemingly no one to whom it can be disclosed. Given that the number of unrepresented Americans is expected to rise in the coming decades, and some fraction of them will experience a medical error, creating protocols that answer this troubling question is of the utmost importance. This paper attempts to begin that conversation, first arguing that the precarious position of unrepresented patients, particularly in regards to errors made in their care, demands their recognition as a vulnerable patient population. Next, it asserts that the ethical obligation to disclose error still exists for the unrepresented because the moral status of error does not change with the presence or absence of surrogate decision-makers. Finally, this paper concludes that in outwardly acknowledging wrongdoing, a clinician or team leader can alleviate significant moral distress, satisfy the standards of a genuine apology, and validate the inherent and equivalent moral worth of the unrepresented patient.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2019-105633,45,12,821-823,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and Humans and Decision Making/ethics and Mental Competency and *Vulnerable Populations and medical error and Truth Disclosure/*ethics and capacity and Medical Errors/*ethics and truth disclosure,NA,NA,2019/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lee_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Developing a moral compass: Themes from the Clinical Ethics Residency for Nurses' final essays,"Lee, Susan and Robinson, Ellen M. and Grace, Pamela J. and Zollfrank, Angelika and Jurchak, Martha",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The Clinical Ethics Residency for Nurses was offered selectively to nurses affiliated with two academic medical centers to increase confidence in ethical decision-making. RESEARCH QUESTION/AIM: To discover how effective the participants perceived the program and if their goals of participation had been met. RESEARCH DESIGN: A total of 65 end-of-course essays (from three cohorts) were analyzed using modified directed content analysis. In-depth and recursive readings of the essays by faculty were guided by six questions that had been posed to graduates. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Institutional review board approval was granted for the duration of the program and its reporting period. Confidentiality was maintained via the use of codes for all evaluations including the essays and potentially identifying content redacted. FINDINGS: An umbrella theme emerged: participants had developed ethical knowledge and skills that provided a ""moral compass to navigate the many gray areas of decision-making that confront them in daily practice."" Six major themes corresponding to questions posed to the participants included the ability to advocate for good patient care; to support and empower colleagues, patients, and families; they experienced personal and professional transformation; they valued the multimodal nature of the program; and were using their new knowledge and skills in practice. However, they also recognized that their development as moral agents was an ongoing process. DISCUSSION: Findings support that enhancing nurse confidence in their moral agency with a multimodal educational approach that includes mentored practice in ethical decision-making, enhancing communication skills and role-play can mitigate moral distress. A majority found the program personally and professionally transformative. However, they recognized that ongoing ethics discussion involvement and supportive environments would be important in their continued development of ethical agency.

Zolkefli_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Negotiated ethical responsibility: Bruneian nurses' ethical concerns in nursing practice,"Zolkefli, Yusrita",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: There has been wide interest shown in the manner in which ethical dimensions in nursing practice are approached and addressed. As a result, a number of ethical decision-making models have been developed to tackle these problems. However, this study argued that the ethical dimensions of nursing practice are still not clearly understood and responded to in Brunei. RESEARCH AIM: To explore how Bruneian nurses define ethical concerns they meet in everyday practice in the medical surgical wards of three Brunei hospitals. RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative study was employed. Interviews were conducted with 28 practising and administrative nurses of three hospitals. Interview data were analysed via a constant comparative method. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: The study's protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the School of Health in Social Science at the University of Edinburgh and the Medical Health Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health, Brunei. FINDINGS: The nurses described three ethical dimensions in their practice, namely: 'nurse at work' which illustrates the ethical dimensions within the work environment; 'nurse and doctor' which elucidates the ethical dimensions in the nurse and doctor relationship; and 'nurse and patient' which further examines ethical aspects in patient care. Nurses responded to the ethical dimensions in the ward setting with the aim of avoiding the conflict and maintaining ward harmony. DISCUSSION: The data provide new insights into how nurses respond to ethical dimension in the ward settings where it puts strong emphasis on the nurses' understanding of responsibility placed upon them as professional nurses. CONCLUSION: With these findings, it is recommended that further support is needed for nurses to be aware of the ethical dimension in their practice and to respond to ethical concerns accordingly.",2019,10.1177/0969733018809797,26,7-8,1992-2005,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and ethics and qualitative and Qualitative Research and practice and Decision Making/ethics and Interviews as Topic/methods and Nurses/*psychology and *Ethics, Nursing and Brunei and Nurses' concerns",NA,NA,2019/12//Nov undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Forty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with gynaecologists-obstetricians (n=26) and midwives (n=15) in a large Swiss city. RESULTS: Three professional profiles were constructed along a continuum that defines the relative distance or proximity towards patients' demands for professional involvement in the decision-making process. The first profile insists on enforcing patient responsibility, wherein the healthcare provider avoids any form of professional participation. A second profile defends the idea of a shared decision making between patients and professionals. The third highlights the intervening factors that justify professionals' involvement in decisions.

This paper argues that the principlist model is unreflective of how ethical decisions are taken in clinical practice. Two kinds of medical ethical decisions are distinguished: biosocial ethics and clinical ethics. It is argued that principlism is an inappropriate model for clinical ethics as it is neither sufficiently action-guiding nor does it emphasise the professional integrity of the clinician.

Cheah_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Consent and assent in paediatric research in low-income settings,"Cheah, Phaik Yeong and Parker, Michael",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In order to involve children in the decision-making process about participation in medical research it is widely recommended that the child's assent be sought in addition to parental consent. However, the concept of assent is fraught with difficulties, resulting in confusion among researchers and ethics committees alike. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we outline the current international debate surrounding pediatric consent and assent, and its unique challenges arising in low-income settings. We go on to propose some key requirements for a fit-for-purpose assent model in these difficult settings. The paper recommends that children who are competent, that is, children who are judged to be able to understand and retain relevant information, weigh this information in making a mature judgment, come to a decision and communicate the decision, should be able to consent for themselves. Our proposal is that where the decision about whether to participate in a study is of comparable complexity to the decisions the child is used to making in other aspects of his or her life, it should be made by the child him or herself. The relevant level of complexity should be judged by local standards rather than standards of the developed world. In the paper we explore some of the practical challenges and counter arguments of implementing this proposal. As in high-income settings, we argue that in the case of children who are judged to lack this level of competence both parental consent and assent from the child should be sought and go on to define assent as involving the child to the extent compatible to his or her maturity and with cultural norms and not as obtaining the child's permission to proceed. SUMMARY: The concept of assent in the current guidelines is confusing. There is an urgent need for clearer guidelines that can be adapted for all types of paediatric research wherever it is to be carried out and an evidence-base concerning good assent/consent practice.

Rogowski_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Evaluation as institution: a contractarian argument for needs-based economic evaluation,"Rogowski, Wolf H.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: There is a gap between health economic evaluation methods and the value judgments of coverage decision makers, at least in Germany. Measuring preference satisfaction has been claimed to be inappropriate for allocating health care resources, e.g. because it disregards medical need. The existing methods oriented at medical need have been claimed to disregard non-consequentialist fairness concerns. The aim of this article is to propose a new, contractarian argument for justifying needs-based economic evaluation. It is based on consent rather than maximization of some impersonal unit of value to accommodate the fairness concerns. MAIN TEXT: This conceptual paper draws upon contractarian ethics and constitution economics to show how economic evaluation can be viewed as an institution to overcome societal conflicts in the allocation of scarce health care resources. For this, the problem of allocating scarce health care resources in a society is reconstructed as a social dilemma. Both disadvantaged patients and affluent healthy individuals can be argued to share interests in a societal contract to provide technologies which ameliorate medical need, based on progressive funding. The use of needs-based economic evaluation methods for coverage determination can be interpreted as institutions for conflict resolution as far as they use consented criteria to ensure the social contract's sustainability and avoid implicit rationing or unaffordable contribution rates. This justifies the use of needs-based evaluation methods by Pareto-superiority and consent (rather than by some needs-based value function per se). CONCLUSION: The view of economic evaluation presented here may help account for fairness concerns in the further development of evaluation methods. This is because it directs the attention away from determining some unit of value to be maximized towards determining those persons who are most likely not to consent and meeting their concerns. Following this direction in methods development is likely to increase the acceptability of health economic evaluation by decision makers.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0294-1,19,1,59,eng,1472-6939,"Poverty and Humans and Technology and Decision Making and Judgment and Contracts and Social Class and Germany and Health Services Needs and Demand and Health Resources and Vulnerable Populations and *Social Justice and Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics and Health Equity and Dissent and Disputes and *Ethical Analysis and *Social Values and Ethical Theory and *Insurance, Health and Constitution economics and Contractarianism and Contractualism and Ethical contract theory and Ethics of health economic evaluation and Health Care Rationing/economics/*ethics and Normative economics",NA,NA,2018/06/13/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
De.Panfilis_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Compassionate use programs in Italy: ethical guidelines,"De Panfilis, Ludovica and Satolli, Roberto and Costantini, Massimo",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: This article proposes a retrospective analysis of a compassionate use (CU), using a case study of request for Avelumab for a patient suffering from Merkel Cell Carcinoma. The study is the result of a discussion within a Provincial Ethics Committee (EC) following the finding of a high number of requests for CU program. The primary objective of the study is to illustrate the specific ethical and clinical profiles that emerge from the compassionate use program (CUP) issue. The secondary goals are: a) to promote a moral reflection among physicians who require approval for the CUP and b) provide the basis for recommendations on how to request CUP. MAIN BODY: The instruments for carrying out the analysis of the case study and the discussion are as follows: Analysis of the audio-recording of the EC meeting regarding the selected Case study. In-depth discussion of topics that emerged during the meeting by means of administration of 5 semi-structured interviews with 2 doctors involved in the case (proposing physician and palliative physician) and with 3 components of the EC who played a major role in the EC internal discussion. CONCLUSIONS: In an exploration of emerging clinical and ethical issues, four primary themes arise: 1. efficacy, safety of the treatment and patient's quality of life; 2. clear, realistic, adequate communication; 3. right to hope; 4. simultaneous Palliative Care approach. The results of ethical analysis carried out concern two areas: 1) ethical profiles relating to the use of CUP; 2) the role of the EC concerning the compassionate use of drugs and the need to provide recommendations on how to request CUP. With the aim of implementing these conclusions, the provincial EC of Reggio Emilia chose to steer the request for drugs for compassionate use through recommendations for good clinical and ethical practice based on the following assumptions: 1) the ""simultaneous care"" approach must be preferred. Secondly, 2) the EC's assessment must be part of the decision-making process that the care team conducts before proposing compassionate use to the patient.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0263-8,19,1,22,eng,1472-6939,"Communication and Cancer and Humans and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Quality of life and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Quality of Life and Patient Rights and Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized and Italy and *Ethics, Medical and *Bioethical Issues and Empathy and Decision Making/*ethics and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics and Palliative Care/*ethics and Hope and Ethical Analysis and Terminal Care/ethics and *Ethics Committees and Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use and Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/drug therapy and Compassionate use programs and Compassionate Use Trials/*ethics and Ethics committee and Right to hope and Simultaneous palliative care",NA,NA,2018/03/09/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such a scenario has fostered the need to deepen discussions on the subject and possibly revise legislation governing the substance use and access. OBJECTIVES: Identify the types of stigma related to the therapeutic use of Cannabis and describe the strategies people use to overcome stigma. METHODS: This integrative review was carried out in the databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, with 565 articles being retrieved. Triads' cross-check were done, first maintaining the ""cannabis"" and ""therapeutic use"" pair, added by ""stigma,"" ""bioethics,"" ""ethics,"" ""social consequences,"" and ""legal consequences."" The final selection resulted in six articles. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: However, the ethical issues that pervade and regulate decisions on this subject must be considered. RESULTS: Different dimensions and types of stigma related to the therapeutic use of Cannabis have been identified. The bioethical principle of autonomy was an expression of citizenship and human rights, mitigating internal conflicts related to self-stigma and the effects of external stigma on the person's life. CONCLUSION: It was possible to identify the types of stigma related to the therapeutic use of Cannabis is an internal dimension represented (self-stigma) and an external dimension, represented (social and structural stigmas) and to identify strategies adopted to face this stigma: skills training group for users, elaboration of laws and specific programs to clarify the therapeutic use of Cannabis with a greater social scope, and support for family members. Thus, contributing to the building of people's autonomy in a broader context of decision-making autonomy and executive autonomy will provide the development of people's capacity to perform complex tasks of self-management and, consequently, to continue promoting and preserving their decision-making process and their capacity to plan and perform tasks associated with managing their lives and their treatments.",2019,10.1177/0969733017703699,26,1,104-96,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,mental health and Humans and nursing and Brazil and Social Stigma and Bioethics and *Bioethics and Human Rights/psychology and Medical Marijuana/*therapeutic use and stigma and therapeutic use,NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, ethics training programs for IRB members in Botswana have focused on ethical principles and international guidelines rather than on the ethical dimensions of specific medical technologies and research methodologies. Little is known about the knowledge and concerns of current and prospective IRB members in Botswana with respect to export, reuse, storage, and benefit-sharing of biospecimens. METHODS: This qualitative study examined perspectives of IRB members in Botswana about the collection and use of biospecimens in research. Forty-one IRB members representing five committees in Botswana participated in discussions groups in March 2013. Transcriptions of audiotapes and field notes were analyzed to identify issues of concern that might be alleviated through education and capacity-building, and areas that required ongoing discussion or additional regulatory guidance. RESULTS: Areas of concern included lack of understanding among patients and providers about the use of biospecimens in clinical care and research; reuse of biospecimens, particularly issues of consent, ownership and decision-making; export of specimens and loss of control over reuse and potential benefits; and felt need for regulatory guidance and IRB-member training. Local belief systems about bodily integrity and strong national identity in the construct of benefits may be at odds with initiatives that involve foreign biorepositories or consider such collections to be global public goods. CONCLUSION: Education is needed to strengthen IRB-member capacity to review and monitor protocols calling for the collection and use of biospecimens, guided by clear national policy on priority-setting, partnerships, review, and oversight. Engagement with local stakeholders is needed to harmonize fundamentally different ways of understanding the human body and community identity with the aims of contemporary biomedicine.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0047-3,16,NA,54,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Qualitative Research and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Ownership/*ethics and Botswana and Ethics, Research and Biomedical Research/*ethics and *Ethics Committees, Research and *Capacity Building and Biological Specimen Banks/*ethics",NA,NA,2015/08/19/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Systematic research investigating the experiences of doctors involved in decisions about resuscitation in light of the recent changes in law remains lacking. AIM: To analyse the practice of resuscitation decision making on hospital wards from the perspectives of doctors. DESIGN: The data presented in this paper were collected as part of a wider research study of end-of-life care in an acute hospital setting. Data collection comprised ethnographic non-participant observation on two acute hospital wards and individual interviews with patients, relatives and healthcare professionals caring for patients thought to be approaching the end of life. Data were analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Discussions and decision making about resuscitation present many challenges for those involved on acute medical wards. The data highlight the potential for multiple interpretations of legal precedents, creating misunderstandings that may impact patient care in less positive ways. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides unique insights into how doctors respond to the changing medico-legal culture and the subsequent effects on patient care. It demonstrates how the juridification of medical practice can occur. It highlights the potential benefit of a structure to support clinicians, patients and relatives in discussing and navigating decisions around care at the end of life in line with the patient's wishes and preferences.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial, with superiority study design. All trauma patients scheduled to receive trauma-related debridement surgery in the ED of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital were included. Patients were assigned to one of two education protocols. Participants in the intervention group watched an educational video illustrating informed consent information, whereas those in the control group read an informed consent document. The primary outcome was knowledge scores and the secondary outcome was assessment of patient satisfaction. A multivariable regression model, with predefined covariates, was used to analyze differences in knowledge scores and patient satisfaction levels between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were enrolled, with 70 and 72 assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Mean knowledge scores were higher in the intervention (72.57 <c2><b1> 16.21 (SD)) than in the control (61.67 <c2><b1> 18.39) group. By multivariate analysis, the intervention group had significantly greater differences in knowledge scores (coefficient: 7.646, 95% CI: 3.381-11.911). Age, injury severity score, and baseline knowledge score significantly affected the differences in knowledge scores. Significant improvements were observed in patients' perception of statements addressing comprehension of the information provided, helpfulness of the supplied information for decision making, and satisfaction with the informed consent process. Multivariate analysis showed significant correlations between video education and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Both the educational approach and severity of injury may have an impact on patient understanding during the informed consent process in an emergency environment. Video-assisted informed consent may improve the understanding of surgery and satisfaction with the informed consent process for trauma patients in the ED. Institutions should develop structured methods and other strategies to better inform trauma patients, facilitate treatment decisions, and improve patient satisfaction.

METHOD: Qualitative, in-depth interview study with 45 doctors (30 across Yorkshire, England and 15 across South Wales). Doctors were from three specialties: oncology, palliative medicine and general practice, with a mixture of senior and junior staff. Framework analysis was used. RESULTS: Doctors opinions as to whether LMWH treatment was ethically appropriate for patients who were symptomatic from VTE but at end of life existed on a shifting continuum, largely influenced by patient prognosis. A lack of immediate benefit coupled with the discomfort of a daily injection had influenced some doctors not to prescribe LMWH. The point at which LMWH injections should be stopped in patients at the end of life was ambiguous. Some perceived 'overcaution' in their own and other clinicians' treatment of patients. Viewpoints were divergent on whether dying of a PE was considered a ""good way to go"". The interventionalism and ethos of palliative medicine was discussed.

However, ethics competency at the time of graduation and after years of practice has not been described. RESEARCH AIM: To examine the ethics knowledge base of neonatal nurse practitioners as this knowledge relates to decision making in the neonatal intensive care unit and to determine whether this knowledge is reflected in attitudes toward ethical dilemmas in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study that examined decision making at the threshold of viability, life-sustaining therapies for sick neonates, and a ranking of the five most impactful ethical issues. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: All 47 neonatal nurse practitioners who had an active license in the State of Mississippi were contacted via e-mail. Surveys were completed online using Survey Monkey software. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the University of Mississippi Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB; #2015-0189). FINDINGS: Of the neonatal nurse practitioners who completed the survey, 87.5% stated that their religious practices affected their ethical decision making and 76% felt that decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment for a neonate should not involve consultation with the hospital's legal team or risk management. Only 11% indicated that the consent process involved patient understanding of possible procedures. Participating in the continuation or escalation of care for infants at the threshold of viability was the top ethical issue encountered by neonatal nurse practitioners.

I sketch a NIT framework as a useful tool for bioethics and medical ethics and explain how NITs can contribute to policy design in non-ideal circumstances. Different NITs can coexist and be evaluated vis-a-vis the IT. Additionally, I address what an individual doctor ought to do in this non-ideal context with the view that knowledge of NITs can facilitate the decision-making process. NITs help conceptualise problems faced in the context of non-compliance and scarcity in a better and more realistic way. Deciding which policy is optimal in such contexts may influence physicians' decisions regarding their patients.

Kim_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,A new kind of paternalism in surrogate decision-making? The case of Barnsley Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v MSP,"Kim, Scott Y. H. and Ruck Keene, Alexander",Journal of medical ethics,"The modern legal and ethical movement against traditional welfare paternalism in medical decision-making extends to how decisions are made for patients lacking decisional capacity, prioritising surrogates' judgment about what patients would have decided over even their best interests. In England and Wales, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 follows this trend of prioritising the patient's prior wishes, values and beliefs but the dominant interpretation in life-sustaining treatment cases does so by in effect calling those values the 'best interests' of the patient and focusing nearly exclusively on the 'subjective' viewpoint of the patient. In this article, we examine the recent Court of Protection judgment in Barnsley Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v MSP [2020] EWCOP 26, which adhered closely to this approach, to suggest that it could have unexpected negative consequences. These include insufficient information gathering about and attention to patients' objective medical interests, inadequacy of the evidentiary standard used for the substituted decision-making and, in some cases, even prioritising a surrogate's current substituted judgment over the potential for an actual judgment by the patient.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106797,NA,NA,2020-106797-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and legal aspects and competence/incompetence and end of life care,NA,NA,2020/11/23/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Porteri_2018_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Advance directives as a tool to respect patients' values and preferences: discussion on the case of Alzheimer's disease,"Porteri, Corinna",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The proposal of the new criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on biomarker data is making possible a diagnosis of AD at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or predementia/prodromal- stage. Given the present lack of effective treatments for AD, the opportunity for the individuals to personally take relevant decisions and plan for their future before and if cognitive deterioration occurs is one the main advantages of an early diagnosis. MAIN BODY: Advance directives are largely seen as an effective tool for planning medical care in the event the subject becomes incompetent. Nevertheless, their value has been questioned with regard to people with dementia by scholars who refer to the arguments of personal identity and of patient's changing interests before and after the onset of dementia. In this paper, I discuss the value of advance directives in Alzheimer's disease and other kind of dementia. Despite critics, I argue that advance directives are especially advisable in dementia and provide reasons in favor of their promotion at an early stage of the disease as a valuable tool to respect patients' values and preferences on medical treatment, including participation in research and end of life decisions. I mainly support advance directives that include both decisions regarding health care and the appointment of an attorney in fact. CONCLUSION: I conclude that patients with AD at a prodromal or early stage should be offered the opportunity to execute an advance directive, and that not to honor a demented individual's directive would be an unacceptable form of discrimination towards those patients.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0249-6,19,1,9,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Dementia and Delivery of Health Care and Advance directives and Biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease and Cognitive Dysfunction and Disease Progression and Early Diagnosis and Terminal Care and Personal Autonomy and *Decision Making and *Patient Preference and *Mental Competency and Proxy and Dissent and Disputes and *Patient Rights and Respect and Personhood and *Advance Directives/ethics and *Alzheimer Disease/complications/diagnosis/therapy and *Cognition Disorders/etiology and Attorney in fact and End of life decisions and Personal identity and Social Discrimination,NA,NA,2018/02/20/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the possibilities is the use of personalized medicine, an approach based on quantifiable and scientific factors that determine the global immunological risk of rejection for each patient. Although this approach can improve the efficacy of transplantations, it also poses a number of ethical questions. METHODS: The qualitative research involved 22 semi-structured interviews with nephrologists involved in renal transplantation, with the goal of determining the professionals' views about calculating the global immunological risk and the attendant ethical issues. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a general acceptance of this approach amongst the participants in the study. Knowledge of each patient's immunological risk could improve treatment and the post-graft follow-up. On the other hand, the possibility that patients might be excluded from transplantation poses a significant ethical issue. This approach is not seen as something entirely new, given the fact that medicine is increasingly scientific and evidence-based. Although renal transplantation incorporates scientific data, these physicians believe that there should always be a place for clinical judgment and the physician-patient relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The participants see the benefits of including the calculation of the global immunological risk within transplantation. Such data, being more precise and rigorous, could be of help in their clinical work. However, in spite of the use of such scientific data, a place must be retained for the clinical judgment that allows a physician to make decisions based on medical data, professional expertise and knowledge of the patient.

Kaldjian_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Teaching practical wisdom in medicine through clinical judgement, goals of care, and ethical reasoning","Kaldjian, Lauris Christopher",Journal of medical ethics,"Clinical decision making is a challenging task that requires practical wisdom-the practised ability to help patients choose wisely among available diagnostic and treatment options. But practical wisdom is not a concept one typically hears mentioned in medical training and practice. Instead, emphasis is placed on clinical judgement. The author draws from Aristotle and Aquinas to describe the virtue of practical wisdom and compare it with clinical judgement. From this comparison, the author suggests that a more complete understanding of clinical judgement requires its explicit integration with goals of care and ethical values. Although clinicians may be justified in assuming that goals of care and ethical values are implicit in routine decision making, it remains important for training purposes to encourage habits of clinical judgement that are consciously goal-directed and ethically informed. By connecting clinical judgement to patients' goals and values, clinical decisions are more likely to stay focused on the particular interests of individual patients. To cultivate wise clinical judgement among trainees, educational efforts should aim at the integration of clinical judgement, communication with patients about goals of care, and ethical reasoning. But ultimately, training in wise clinical judgement will take years of practice in the company of experienced clinicians who are able to demonstrate practical wisdom by example. By helping trainees develop clinical judgement that incorporates patients' goals of care and ethical reasoning, we may help lessen the risk that 'clinical judgement' will merely express 'the clinician's judgement.'",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.035295,36,9,558-562,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Models, Psychological and Physicians/psychology and *Evidence-Based Medicine and *Problem-Based Learning and Education, Medical, Continuing/*methods and *Clinical Medicine and Decision Making/*ethics and Judgment/*ethics",NA,NA,2010/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The term is not generally used in medical ethics. Decision makers such as parents and physicians generally do not use the concept or the word in evaluating ethical dilemmas. They may not even be aware of the precise nature of the moral hazard problem they are experiencing, beyond a general concern for the patient's seemingly excessive burden. This article brings the language and logic of moral hazard to pediatrics. The concept reminds us that decision makers in this context are often not the primary party affected by their decisions.

MAIN TEXT: Having to make such decisions certainly entails substantial difficulties, and that has led many health care professional to seek ethical guidance. The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has attempted to meet that growing need by a set of recommendations, applying ""clinical soundness"" as a beacon standard; that approach tends to prioritize patients with higher life expectancy, which could be characterized as a ""moderately utilitarian"" approach. Yet, such a selection has engendered daunting ethical quandaries. The authors believe it can only be warranted and acceptable if rooted in a transparent decision-making process and verifiable, reviewed criteria. Moreover, the authors have stressed how clinical experimentation in a pandemic setting is a subtext of great interest from an ethical perspective. In Italy, no drug therapy and trials were undertaken for COVID-19 patients for a rather long period of time. When the epidemic was already circulating, an intervention proved necessary on the system of administrative procedures, aimed at expediting the authorization and validation of protocols, then bogged down by bureaucracy. A new system has since been instituted by a government decree that was signed about one month after the first Covid-19 case was officially recorded in the country. Such a swift implementation, which took just a few weeks, is noteworthy and proves that clinical trials can be initiated in a timely fashion, even with a pandemic unfolding. The concerted, action of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to attain effective forms of treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have arrived at the conclusion that the most effective and ethically sound response on the part of any national health care system would be to adequately reconfigure its organizational mechanisms, by making clinical trials and all related administrative procedures consistent with the current state of emergency.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00562-7,21,1,117,eng,1472-6939,"COVID-19 and Ethics and Humans and Italy and *Ethics, Medical and *Attitude of Health Personnel and COVID-19/*epidemiology and Health Care Rationing/*ethics and Critical Illness/epidemiology and Emergency and Emergency Service, Hospital/*ethics",NA,NA,2020/11/19/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objectives of the study were to assess the points of view and practices of intensivists in Lebanon along with the opinions of medical, legal and religious leaders regarding withholding withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments in Lebanese intensive care units (ICU). METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among intensivists working in Lebanese adult ICUs. Interviews were also done with Lebanese medical, legal and religious leaders. RESULTS: Of the 229 survey recipients, 83 intensivists completed it, i.e. a response rate of (36.3%).

Ninety-two percent of them were familiar with the withholding and withdrawal concepts and 80% applied them. Poor prognosis of the acute and chronic disease and futile therapy were the main reasons to consider withholding and withdrawal of treatments. Ninety-five percent of intensivists agreed with the ""Principle of Double Effect"" (i.e. adding analgesia and or sedation to patients after the withholding/withdrawal decisions in order to prevent their suffering and allow their comfort, even though it might hasten the dying process).

For once, the law's inability to keep up with changing medical practice and standards is not the problem. The authors argue that while the common law has moved forward and started to recognise the importance of patient autonomy and informed decision-making, the GMC has taken a step back in their 2008 guidance on consent.

The objective of this study was to explore how American and Japanese experts analyze an Alzheimer's case regarding ethics consultation. METHODS: We presented the case to physicians and ethicists from the US and Japan (one expert from each field from both countries; total = 4) and obtained their responses through a questionnaire and in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Establishing a consensus was a common goal among American and Japanese participants. In attempting to achieve consensus, the most significant similarity between Japanese and American ethics consultants was that they both appeared to adopt an ""ethics facilitation"" approach. Differences were found in recommendation and assessment between the American and Japanese participants. In selecting a surrogate, the American participants chose to contact the grandson before designating the daughter-in-law as the surrogate decision-maker. Conversely the Japanese experts assumed that the daughter-in-law was the surrogate. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that consensus building through an ""ethics facilitation"" approach may be a commonality to the practice of ethics consultation in the US and Japan, while differences emerged in terms of recommendations, surrogate assessment, and assessing treatments.

This study evaluated in healthcare professionals whether the decision to resuscitate at the limit of viability (intensive care versus comfort care) are influenced by the way information on incurred risks is given or received. METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled study. This study evaluated the attitude of healthcare professionals by testing the effect of information given through graphic fact sheets formulated either optimistically or pessimistically. The written educational fact sheet included three graphical presentations of survival and complication/morbidity by gestational age.

The received risk tended to be more severe in both groups compared to the graphically presented facts and current guidelines, although optimistic representation favoured the perception of ""survival without disability"" at 23 to 25 weeks. Therapeutic attitudes did not differ between groups, but healthcare professionals with children were more restrained and students more aggressive at very low gestational ages. CONCLUSION: Written information on mortality and morbidity given to healthcare professionals in graphic form encourages them to overestimate the risk. However, perception in healthcare staff may not be directly transferable to parental perception during counselling as the later are usually naive to the data received. This parental information are always communicated in ways that subtly shape the decisions that follow.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0413-7,20,1,74,eng,1472-6939,"Attitudes and Survival and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Prospective Studies and Infant, Newborn and Nurses/psychology and *Decision Making and Patient Education as Topic/*methods and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Gestational Age and Resuscitation and Students, Medical/psychology and *Infant, Premature and Counselling and Extremely preterm infant and Intensive Care, Neonatal and Limit of viability and Optimism and Pediatricians/psychology and Perinatal Care/*organization & administration/standards and Pessimism and Resuscitation/*psychology",NA,NA,2019/10/22/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kerruish_2015_Joofmeet,JOUR,Parental reasoning about growth attenuation therapy: report of a single-case study,"Kerruish, Nicola and McMillan, John R.",Journal of medical ethics,"In 2006 a case report was published about a 6-year-old girl, Ashley, who has profound developmental disabilities and was treated with oestrogen patches to limit her final height, along with a hysterectomy and the removal of her breast buds. Ashley's parents claimed that attenuating her growth would make it possible for them to lift and move her more easily, facilitating greater involvement in family activities and making routine care more straightforward. The 'Ashley treatment' provoked public comment and academic debate and remains ethically controversial. As more children are being referred for such treatment, there is an urgent need to clarify how clinicians and ethics committees should respond to such requests. The controversy surrounding the Ashley treatment exists, at least in part, because of gaps in the literature, including a lack of empirical data about the outcomes for children who do and do not receive such treatment. However, we suggest in this paper that there is also merit in examining the parental decision-making process itself, and provide empirical data about the reasoning of one set of parents who ultimately chose part of this treatment for their child. Using the interview data, we illuminate some important points regarding how these parents characterise benefits and harms and their responsibilities as surrogate decision-makers. This analysis could inform decision-making about future requests for growth attenuation and might also have wider relevance to healthcare decision-making for children with profound cognitive impairment.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2013-101913,41,9,745-749,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Disability and *Quality of Life and *Ethics, Medical and *Parents/psychology and Decision Making/*ethics and Ethical Analysis and Ethics Committees and *Intellectual Disability and *Developmental Disabilities and *Disabled Children and *Parenting/psychology and Growth/*drug effects and Hormones/*administration & dosage and Hysterectomy/ethics and Mastectomy/ethics and Minors/Parental Consent",NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the barriers, facilitators, and ethical conflicts perceived by health professionals derived from the management of advance directives in emergency services. RESEARCH DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND CONTEXT: This is a qualitative phenomenological study conducted with purposive sampling including a population of nursing and medical professionals linked to Hospital Emergency Department and Emergency Medical Services. Three focus groups were formed, totalling 24 participants. We performed an inductive-type thematic discourse analysis. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by ethical committees of Ethical Commitee of Clinic Hospital (Barcelona) and Comittee of Emergency Medical Services (Barcelona). The participants received information about the purpose of the study. Patients' anonymity and willingness to participate in the study were guaranteed. FINDINGS: There were four types of barriers that hindered the proper management of patients' advance directives in Hospital Emergency Department and Emergency Medical Services: personal and professional, family members, organisational and structural, and those derived from the health system. These barriers caused ethical conflicts and hindered professionals' decision-making. DISCUSSION: These results are in line with those of previous studies and indicate that factors such as gender, professional category, and years of experience, in addition to professionals' beliefs and the opinions of colleagues and family members, can also influence the professionals' final decisions.

White_2017_Joofmeet,JOUR,The role of law in decisions to withhold and withdraw life-sustaining treatment from adults who lack capacity: a cross-sectional study,"White, Benjamin P. and Willmott, Lindy and Williams, Gail and Cartwright, Colleen and Parker, Malcolm",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the role played by law in medical specialists' decision-making about withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment from adults who lack capacity, and the extent to which legal knowledge affects whether law is followed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional postal survey of medical specialists. SETTING: The two largest Australian states by population. PARTICIPANTS: 649 medical specialists from seven specialties most likely to be involved in end-of-life decision-making in the acute setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance with law and the impact of legal knowledge on compliance. RESULTS: 649 medical specialists (of 2104 potential participants) completed the survey (response rate 31%). Responses to a hypothetical scenario found a potential low rate of legal compliance, 32% (95% CI 28% to 36%). Knowledge of the law and legal compliance were associated: within compliers, 86% (95% CI 83% to 91%) had specific knowledge of the relevant aspect of the law, compared with 60% (95% CI 55% to 65%) within non-compliers. However, the reasons medical specialists gave for making decisions did not vary according to legal knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Medical specialists prioritise patient-related clinical factors over law when confronted with a scenario where legal compliance is inconsistent with what they believe is clinically indicated. Although legally knowledgeable specialists were more likely to comply with the law, compliance in the scenario was not motivated by an intention to follow law. Ethical considerations (which are different from, but often align with, law) are suggested as a more important influence in clinical decision-making. More education and training of doctors is needed to demonstrate the role, relevance and utility of law in end-of-life care.",2017,10.1136/medethics-2016-103543,43,5,327-333,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Ethics and Humans and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Australia and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Law and Attitude of Health Personnel and Guidelines as Topic and *Physicians and *Critical Illness and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and End-of-life and Guideline Adherence/*ethics and Terminal Care/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Advance Care Planning/ethics and Care of the Dying Patient and Living Wills/Advance Directives and Withholding Treatment/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2017/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study explored nurses' (n = 22) and physicians' (n = 5) perceptions of what actually happens when an aggressive behaviour episode occurs on the ward and what alternatives to seclusion and restraint are actually in use as normal standard practice in acute psychiatric care. The data were collected by focus group interviews and analysed by inductive content analysis. The participants believed that the decision-making process for managing patients' aggressive behaviour contains some in-built ethical dilemmas. They thought that patients' subjective perspective received little attention. Nevertheless, the staff proposed and appeared to use a number of alternatives to minimize or replace the use of seclusion and restraint.

Nurses, social workers and pastors, however, are often excluded from ethical case deliberation. If multiprofessional ethical case deliberations do take place, participants may not always know how to perform to the fullest. SETTING: A level-IIID neonatal intensive care unit of a paediatric teaching hospital in the Netherlands. METHODS: Structured multiprofessional medical ethical decision-making (MEDM) was implemented to help overcome problems experienced. Important features were: all professionals who are directly involved with the patient contribute to MEDM; a five-step procedure is used: exploration, agreement on the ethical dilemma/investigation of solutions, analysis of solutions, decision-making, planning actions; meetings are chaired by an impartial ethicist. A 15-item questionnaire to survey staff perceptions on this intervention just before and 8 months after implementation was developed. RESULTS: Before and after response rates were 91/105 (87%) and 85/113 (75%). Factor analysis on the questionnaire suggested a four-factor structure: participants' role; structure of MEDM; content of ethical deliberation; and documentation of decisions/conclusions. Effect sizes were 1.67 (p<0.001), 0.69 (p<0.001) and 0.40 (p<0.01) for the first three factors respectively, but only 0.07 (p=0.65) for the fourth factor. Nurses' perceptions of improvement did not significantly exceed those of physicians.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between a preference for physician-directed decision-making and patient health status and sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Sociodemographic and clinical information from all consenting general internal medicine patients at the University of Chicago Medical Center were examined. The primary objectives were to (1) assess the extent to which patients prefer an active role in clinical decision-making, and (2) determine whether religious service attendance, the importance of religion, self-rated spirituality, Charlson Comorbidity Index, self-reported health, Vulnerable Elder Score and several demographic characteristics were associated with these preferences. RESULTS: Data were collected from 8308 of 11,620 possible participants. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents wanted doctors to offer them choices and to consider their opinions. However, two out of three (67%) preferred to leave medical decisions to the doctor. In multiple regression analyses, preferring to leave decisions to the doctor was associated with older age (per year, OR=1.019, 95% CI 1.003 to 1.036) and frequently attending religious services (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1, compared with never), and it was inversely associated with female sex (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8), university education (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9, compared with no high school diploma) and poor health (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9).

Herreros_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Why have Advance Directives failed in Spain?,"Herreros, Benjamin and Benito, Maria and Gella, Pablo and Valenti, Emanuele and Sanchez, Beatriz and Velasco, Tayra",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In Spain, there has been great effort by lawmakers to put Advance Directives (ADs) into practice since 2002. At the same time, the field of bioethics has been on the rise, a discipline that has spurred debate on the right of patients to exercise their autonomy. Despite all this, the implementation of ADs can be said to have failed in Spain, because its prevalence is very low, there is a great lack of knowledge about them and they have very little impact on clinical decisions. The purpose of this article is to analyze and discuss the main reasons for the failure of ADs in Spain. MAIN BODY: The main reasons why ADs have no impact on clinical practice in Spain have been fundamentally four: (1) the training of health professionals about the end of life and AD is lacking; (2) there has been no public process to increase awareness about AD, and therefore people (with the exception of specific highly sensitized groups) know little about them; (3) the bureaucratic procedure to document and implement ADs is excessively complex and cumbersome, creating a significant barrier to their application; (4) in Spain, the remnants of a paternalistic medical culture continue to exist, which causes shared decision-making to be difficult. CONCLUSION: Due to the four reasons mentioned above, AD have not been a useful tool to help honor patients' autonomous decisions about their future care and, therefore, they have not achieved their objective. However, despite the difficulties and problems identified, it has also been observed that health care professionals and the Spanish public have a very positive view of AD. Having identified the problems which have kept AD from being successful, strategies must be developed to help improve their implementation into the future.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00557-4,21,1,113,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Spain and *Health Personnel and Advance care planning and *Advance Directives and Advance directive and Living will,NA,NA,2020/11/16/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Faeo_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Home-dwelling persons with dementia's perception on care support: Qualitative study,"Faeo, Stein Erik and Bruvik, Froydis Kristine and Tranvag, Oscar and Husebo, Bettina S.",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Over the last years, there has been a growth in care solutions aiming to support home-dwelling persons with dementia. Assistive technology and voluntarism have emerged as supplements to traditional homecare and daycare centers. However, patient participation is often lacking in decision-making processes, undermining ethical principles and basic human rights. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: This study explores the perceptions of persons with dementia toward assistive technology, volunteer support, homecare services, and daycare centers. RESEARCH DESIGN: A hermeneutical approach was chosen for this study, using a semi-structured interview guide to allow for interviews in the form of open conversations. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Twelve home-dwelling persons with dementia participated in the study. The participants were recruited through municipal daycare centers. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Interviews were facilitated within a safe environment, carefully conducted to safeguard the participants' integrity. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Western Norway (Project number 2016/1630) approved the study. FINDINGS: The participants shared a well of reflections on experience and attitudes toward the aspects explored. They described assistive technology as possibly beneficial, but pointed to several non-beneficial side effects. Likewise, they were hesitant toward volunteer support, depending on how this might fit their individual preferences. Homecare services were perceived as a necessary means of care, its benefits ascribed to a variety of aspects. Similarly, the participants' assessments of daycare centers relied on specific aspects, with high individual variety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study indicates that the margins between whether these specific care interventions were perceived as supportive or infringing may be small and details may have great effect on the persons' everyday life. This indicates that patient participation in decision-making processes for this group is-in addition to be a judicial and ethical requirement-crucial to ensure adequate care and support.",2020,10.1177/0969733019893098,27,4,1002-991,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and ethics and decision making and Volunteers and Qualitative Research and patient participation and Aged, 80 and over and hermeneutics and dementia and Home Care Services and Patient Participation/*psychology and Norway/epidemiology and Assistive technology and Dementia/*psychology and Adult Day Care Centers and care support and Self-Help Devices/psychology and volunteer support",NA,NA,2020/06//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

During research on two different qualitative research projects on healthcare prioritisations, we found a striking difference on how hospital executive managers and clinical healthcare professionals talked about and understood prioritisations. AIM: The purpose of this study is to explore how healthcare professionals in mental healthcare and somatic medicine prioritise their care, to compare different ways of setting priorities among managers and clinicians and to explore how moral dilemmas are balanced and reconciled. Research design and participants: We conducted qualitative observations, interviews and focus groups with medical doctors, nurses and other clinical members of the interdisciplinary team in both somatic medical and mental health wards in hospitals in Norway. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Ethical considerations: Basic ethical principles for research ethics were followed. The respondents signed an informed consent for participation. They were assured anonymity and confidentiality. The studies were approved by relevant ethics committees in line with the Helsinki Convention. FINDINGS: Our findings showed a widening gap between the views of clinicians on one hand and managers on the other. Clinicians experienced a threat to their autonomy, to their professional ideals and to their desire to perform their job in a professional way. Prioritisations were a cause of constant concern and problematic decisions. Even though several managers understood and empathised with the clinicians, the ideals of patient flow and keeping budgets balanced were perceived as more important. DISCUSSION: We discuss our findings in light of the moral challenges of patient-centred individual healthcare versus demands of distributive justice from healthcare management.

Aasen_2015_Nursethi,JOUR,A comparison of the discursive practices of perception of patient participation in haemodialysis units,"Aasen, Elin Margrethe",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: According to Norwegian law, nurses are obligated to provide an acceptable level of health assistance to patients and their family members and to allow patients and their family members to participate in the planning of patient care and treatment. AIM: The aim of this study is to compare the perceptions of older patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment and of their next of kin and of nurses regarding patient participation in the context of haemodialysis treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN: The study adopts an approach that is both comparative and explorative in nature by examining the narratives of patients, nurses and next of kin and by performing critical discourse analysis as outlined by Fairclough. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Permission to carry out the research was granted by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Mid-Norway and by the participating hospitals. Informed consent and confidentiality were ensured. FINDINGS: Two discourses were found: (a) the discourse of paternalism with the discursive practices of achieving physiological balance in patients, trusting the healthcare team and being excluded or included in the difficult end-of-life decision-making process, and (b) the discourse of patient participation, with the themes of maintaining patients' quality of life and trusting patients. CONCLUSION: The participation of older patients and their next of kin was not as well integrated as social practice in dialysis units. The dominant discourse seemed to have an ideology and social practice of paternalism. However, there existed hegemonic struggles for an ideology of patient participation that involved (a) achieving physiological balance in patients versus maintaining patients' quality of life, (b) trusting the healthcare team versus trusting the patient, and (c) being excluded versus included in the difficult end-of-life decision-making process.",2015,10.1177/0969733014533240,22,3,341-351,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and patient participation and Norway and Quality of Life and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Perception and Decision Making/*ethics and Patient Participation/*methods and nurses and Comparison and critical discourse analysis and haemodialysis and Hemodialysis Units, Hospital/ethics/*standards and next of kin and Norwegian law and older patients and Patient Care Planning/ethics",NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Horntvedt_2014_Nursethi,JOUR,Ethical problems related to intravenous fluids in nursing homes,"Horntvedt, May-Elin T. and Romoren, Maria and Solvoll, Betty-Ann",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous fluids and/or antibiotics are applied to only a limited extent in Norwegian nursing homes, and the patients are often sent to hospital in these situations. A transfer and a stay in hospital may be unnecessary strains for frail older patients. Given this background, a collaborative research project was initiated in a Norwegian county in 2009. A teaching programme was developed, which aimed to strengthen the awareness of ethics, assessments and practical procedures related to intravenous fluid and/or antibiotics among healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aimed to increase our knowledge of the ethical problems experienced by nursing home nurses in situations related to the administration of intravenous fluids and/or antibiotics. RESEARCH DESIGN: An exploratory design was used, and five focus group interviews were conducted with 26 registered nurses. A hermeneutic analytic approach was applied. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was reported to the Norwegian Social Science Data Services in May 2010. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics approved the collaborative research project. FINDINGS: The analysis showed that the nurses experienced difficult decision-making situations, which were interpreted as external pressure and internal pressure. External pressure emerged in interactions with patients and relatives. Organizational factors were also interpreted as external pressure. Internal pressure was interpreted as the nurses' experience of feeling inadequate in situations where it was difficult to protect the dignity of patients. DISCUSSION: These findings correspond with international studies, which show that ethical problems often arise during decision-making situations. CONCLUSION: In agreement with the definition of an ethical problem, we found that the nurses experienced uncertainty and disagreements about how situations should be managed. External and internal pressures related to intravenous fluids and/or antibiotics in nursing homes have not been reported in previous studies. Thus, these findings merit further exploration.",2014,10.1177/0969733014521093,21,8,890-901,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Decision-making and Humans and Qualitative Research and Norway and elderly and Focus Groups and nursing home and *Ethics, Nursing and Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage and ethical problem and Infusions, Intravenous/*ethics and intravenous fluid and Nursing Homes/*ethics and relative",NA,NA,2014/12//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dreyer_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,Life-prolonging treatment in nursing homes: how do physicians and nurses describe and justify their own practice?,"Dreyer, A. and Forde, R. and Nortvedt, P.",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Making the right decisions, while simultaneously showing respect for patient autonomy, represents a great challenge to nursing home staff in the issues of life-prolonging treatment, hydration, nutrition and hospitalisation to dying patents in end-of-life. OBJECTIVES: To study how physicians and nurses protect nursing home patients' autonomy in end-of-life decisions, and how they justify their practice. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design with analysis of the content of transcribed in-depth interviews with physicians and nurses. PARTICIPANTS: Nine physicians and ten nurses in 10 nursing homes in Norway. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS: Assessment of the patient's competence to consent to treatment is almost absent. The physicians build their practice on the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Nurses tend to trust the patients' rejection of life support, even when the patients have difficulty speaking or suffer from dementia. Relatives were, according to the health personnel, included in decision-making processes to a very limited extent. However, futile life support is sometimes provided contrary to the physicians' judgement of what constitutes the patient's best interest on occasions when they are pressurised by next of kin. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a need to improve decision-making routines according to ethical ideals and legislation. Conflicts between relatives and healthcare professionals in the decision-making process deflect the focus from searching for the best possible treatment for the terminal patient.

The provision by the doctor of relevant information about treatment and free decision-making by the patient are essential elements of IC.

In analogy to the original problem with the concept of knowledge, these Gettier-type cases show an indeterminacy in the concept of IC: we either need to add some explicit additional condition of causal connection between information and consent, or else we should understand the concept in a new way-specifically, since the practice of autonomy necessarily involves some consideration of the relevant information, we must understand free consent in a way that no longer refers to patient autonomy.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.041939,37,11,642-645,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Decision Making and Comprehension and Physician-Patient Relations and Personal Autonomy and *Ethics, Medical and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology and Informed Consent/ethics/*psychology",NA,NA,2011/11//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Eide_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,How to reach trustworthy decisions for caesarean sections on maternal request: a call for beneficial power,"Eide, Kristiane T. and Baeroe, Kristine",Journal of medical ethics,"Caesarean delivery is a common and life-saving intervention. However, it involves an overall increased risk for short-term and long-term complications for both mother and child compared with vaginal delivery. From a medical point of view, healthcare professionals should, therefore, not recommend caesarean sections without any anticipated medical benefit. Consequently, caesarean sections requested by women for maternal reasons can cause conflict between professional recommendations and maternal autonomy. How can we assure ethically justified decisions in the case of caesarean sections on maternal request in healthcare systems that also respect patients' autonomy and aspire for shared decisions? In the maternal-professional relationship, which can be characterised in terms of reciprocal obligations and rights, women may not be entitled to demand a C-section. Nevertheless, women have a right to respect for their deliberative capacity in the decision-making process. How should we deal with a situation of non-agreement between a woman and healthcare professional when the woman requests a caesarean section in the absence of obvious medical indications? In this paper, we illustrate how the maternal-professional relationship is embedded in a nexus of power, trust and risk that reinforces a structural inferiority for women. To accommodate for beneficial use of power, these decision processes need to be trustworthy. We propose a framework, inspired by Lukes' three-dimensional notion of power, which serves to facilitate trust and allows for beneficial power in shared processes of decision-making about the delivery mode for women requesting planned C-sections.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106071,47,12,e45,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and ethics and women and obstetrics and gynaecology,NA,NA,2020/10/14/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of recently trained paediatricians which included a validated 23-item instrument called the Test of Residents' Ethics Knowledge for Pediatrics. The sample included paediatricians who completed medical school in 2006-2008, whose primary specialty was paediatrics or a paediatric subspecialty, and who completed paediatric residency training in 2010-2011. This sample was stratified based on residency programme variables: presence of a formal curriculum in ethics or professionalism, programme size and American Board of Pediatrics certifying exam passage rate. Paediatricians were randomly selected from each stratum for survey participation. RESULTS: Among the 370 responding paediatricians (55%), the mean knowledge score was 17.3 (SD 2.2) out of a possible 23. Presence of a formal curriculum in ethics and/or professionalism was not significantly associated with knowledge. Knowledge was lowest on items about parental requests for a child to undergo genetic testing (2 items, 44% and 85% incorrect), preserving patient confidentiality over email (55% incorrect), decision-making regarding life-sustaining technologies (61% incorrect), and decision-making principles such as assent and parental permission (2 items, 47% and 49% incorrect).

METHODS: Withdrawal of treatment for children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a regional children's hospital in eastern China from 2006 to 2017 was studied retrospectively. Withdrawal of treatment was categorized as medical withdrawal or premature withdrawal. The guardian's self-reported reasons for abandoning the child's treatment were recorded from 2011. RESULTS: The incidence of withdrawal of treatment for children in the PICU decreased significantly; for premature withdrawal the 3-year average of 15.1% in 2006-2008 decreased to 1.9% in 2015-2017 (87.4% reduction). The overall incidence of withdrawal of care reduced over the time period, and withdrawal of therapy by guardians was the main contributor to the overall reduction. The median age of children for whom treatment was withdrawn increased from 14.5 months (interquartile range: 4.0-72.0) in 2006 to 40.5 months (interquartile range: 8.0-99.0) in 2017. Among the reasons given by guardians of children whose treatment was withdrawn in 2011-2017, ""illness is too severe"" ranked first, accounting for 66.3%, followed by ""condition has been improved"" (20.9%). Only a few guardians ascribed treatment withdrawal to economic reasons.

Nurses' perspective on professional values affects decision-making and patient care. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the importance of professional values from clinical nurses' perspective. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016 in four educational hospitals of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Data were collected via the Persian version of Nursing Professional Values Scale-Revised (NPVS-R) by Weis and Schank. Sampling was conducted through the use of stratified random sampling method and 250 clinical nurses participated in the study. RESULTS: Results indicated that the total score of the nurses' professional values was high. (102.57 <c2><b1> 11.94). From nurses' perspective items such as ""Maintaining confidentiality of patients"" and ""Safeguarding patients' right to privacy"" had more importance; however, ""Recognizing role of professional nursing associations in shaping healthcare policy"" and ""Participating in nursing research and/or implementing research findings appropriate to practice had less importance. A statistically significant relationship was observed between NPVS-R mean scores and nurses' age, work experience as well as participation in professional ethical training (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the total score related to the clinical nurses' perspective on professional values was high, the importance of certain values was at a lower level. Owing to the emerging ethical challenges, it is indispensable to design educational programs in order to improve nurses' awareness and understanding of the comprehensive importance of professional values. Furthermore, it is recommended that mixed methods studies should be conducted in order to design an instrument to evaluate the use of values in nursing practice.",2017,10.1186/s12910-017-0178-9,18,1,20,eng,1472-6939,"Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Universities and Nursing and Iran and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Nursing Staff, Hospital and *Hospitals and *Nurses and *Ethics, Nursing and *Professionalism and Nursing values and Professional values",NA,NA,2017/03/01/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wrigley_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,Proxy consent: moral authority misconceived,"Wrigley, A.",Journal of medical ethics,"The Mental Capacity Act 2005 has provided unified scope in the British medical system for proxy consent with regard to medical decisions, in the form of a lasting power of attorney. While the intentions are to increase the autonomous decision making powers of those unable to consent, the author of this paper argues that the whole notion of proxy consent collapses into a paternalistic judgement regarding the other person's best interests and that the new legislation introduces only an advisor, not a proxy with the moral authority to make treatment decisions on behalf of another. The criticism is threefold. First, there is good empirical evidence that people are poor proxy decision makers as regards accurately representing other people's desires and wishes, and this is therefore a pragmatically inadequate method of gaining consent. Second, philosophical theory explaining how we represent other people's thought processes indicates that we are unlikely ever to achieve accurate simulations of others' wishes in making a proxy decision. Third, even if we could accurately simulate other people's beliefs and wishes, the current construction of proxy consent in the Mental Capacity Act means that it has no significant ethical authority to match that of autonomous decision making. Instead, it is governed by a professional, paternalistic, best-interests judgement that undermines the intended role of a proxy decision maker. The author argues in favour of clearly adopting the paternalistic best-interests option and viewing the proxy as solely an advisor to the professional medical team in helping make best-interests judgements.",2007,10.1136/jme.2006.019711,33,9,527-531,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,Humans and Morals and Decision Making/*ethics and Third-Party Consent/*ethics and Mental Competency/legislation & jurisprudence and Proxy/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology,NA,NA,2007/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
de.Vries_2011_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical issues at the interface of clinical care and research practice in pediatric oncology: a narrative review of parents' and physicians' experiences,"de Vries, Martine C. and Houtlosser, Mirjam and Wit, Jan M. and Engberts, Dirk P. and Bresters, Dorine and Kaspers, Gertjan J. L. and van Leeuwen, Evert",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric oncology has a strong research culture. Most pediatric oncologists are investigators, involved in clinical care as well as research. As a result, a remarkable proportion of children with cancer enrolls in a trial during treatment. This paper discusses the ethical consequences of the unprecedented integration of research and care in pediatric oncology from the perspective of parents and physicians. METHODOLOGY: An empirical ethical approach, combining (1) a narrative review of (primarily) qualitative studies on parents' and physicians' experiences of the pediatric oncology research practice, and (2) comparison of these experiences with existing theoretical ethical concepts about (pediatric) research. The use of empirical evidence enriches these concepts by taking into account the peculiarities that ethical challenges pose in practice. RESULTS: Analysis of the 22 studies reviewed revealed that the integration of research and care has consequences for the informed consent process, the promotion of the child's best interests, and the role of the physician (doctor vs. scientist). True consent to research is difficult to achieve due to the complexity of research protocols, emotional stress and parents' dependency on their child's physician. Parents' role is to promote their child's best interests, also when they are asked to consider enrolling their child in a trial. Parents are almost never in equipoise on trial participation, which leaves them with the agonizing situation of wanting to do what is best for their child, while being fearful of making the wrong decision. Furthermore, a therapeutic misconception endangers correct assessment of participation, making parents inaccurately attribute therapeutic intent to research procedures. Physicians prefer the perspective of a therapist over a researcher. Consequently they may truly believe that in the research setting they promote the child's best interests, which maintains the existence of a therapeutic misconception between them and parents. CONCLUSION: Due to the integration of research and care, their different ethical perspectives become intertwined in the daily practice of pediatric oncology. Increasing awareness of what this means for the communication between parents and physicians is essential. Future research should focus on efforts that overcome the problems that the synchronicity of research and care evokes.",2011,10.1186/1472-6939-12-18,12,NA,18,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Child and Qualitative Research and Empirical Research and Narration and *Physicians and *Parents/psychology and *Physician's Role and Decision Making/*ethics and Ethics, Research and Medical Oncology/*ethics and Pediatrics/*ethics and Professional-Family Relations/ethics and Bioethical Issues and Patient Care/*ethics and Parental Consent/ethics and Clinical Trials as Topic/*ethics and Research Personnel/*ethics and Therapeutic Equipoise and Therapeutic Misconception",NA,NA,2011/09/27/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Foster_2019_Joofmeet_1,JOUR,The rebirth of medical paternalism: An NHS Trust v Y,"Foster, Charles",Journal of medical ethics,"Over the last quarter of a century, English medical law has taken an increasingly firm stand against medical paternalism. This is exemplified by cases such as Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority, Chester v Afshar, and Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board. In relation to decision-making on behalf of incapacitous adults, the actuating principle of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 is respect for patient autonomy. The only lawful acts in relation to an incapacitous person are acts which are in the best interests of that person. The 2005 Act requires a holistic assessment of best interests. Best interests are wider than 'medical best interests'. The 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court in An NHS Trust v Y (which concerned the question of whether a court needed to authorise the withdrawal of life-sustaining clinically administered nutrition/hydration (CANH) from patients in prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC)) risks reviving medical paternalism. The judgment, in its uncritical endorsement of guidelines from various medical organisations, may lend inappropriate authority to medical judgments of best interests and silence or render impotent non-medical contributions to the debate about best interests-so frustrating the 2005 Act. To minimise these dangers, a system of meditation should be instituted whenever it is proposed to withdraw (at least) life-sustaining CANH from (at least) patients with PDOC, and there needs to be a guarantee of access to the courts for families, carers and others who wish to challenge medical conclusions about withdrawal. This would entail proper public funding for such challenges.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105098,45,1,3-7,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and Humans and United Kingdom and autonomy and Personal Autonomy and Jurisprudence and Paternalism/*ethics and clinical ethics and capacity and end of life care and Mental Competency/legislation & jurisprudence and Malpractice/legislation & jurisprudence and State Medicine/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Buiting_2009_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Reporting of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands: descriptive study,"Buiting, Hilde and van Delden, Johannes and Onwuteaka-Philpsen, Bregje and Rietjens, Judith and Rurup, Mette and van Tol, Donald and Gevers, Joseph and van der Maas, Paul and van der Heide, Agnes",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: An important principle underlying the Dutch Euthanasia Act is physicians' responsibility to alleviate patients' suffering. The Dutch Act states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the presence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life. To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee. We studied which arguments Dutch physicians use to substantiate their adherence to the criteria and which aspects attract review committees' attention. METHODS: We examined 158 files of reported euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide cases that were approved by the review committees. We studied the physicians' reports and the verdicts of the review committees by using a checklist. RESULTS: Physicians reported that the patient's request had been well-considered because the patient was clear-headed (65%) and/or had repeated the request several times (23%). Unbearable suffering was often substantiated with physical symptoms (62%), function loss (33%), dependency (28%) or deterioration (15%). In 35%, physicians reported that there had been alternatives to relieve patients' suffering which were refused by the majority. The nature of the relationship with the consultant was sometimes unclear: the consultant was reported to have been an unknown colleague (39%), a known colleague (21%), otherwise (25%), or not clearly specified in the report (24%). Review committees relatively often scrutinized the consultation (41%) and the patient's (unbearable) suffering (32%); they had few questions about possible alternatives (1%). CONCLUSION: Dutch physicians substantiate their adherence to the criteria in a variable way with an emphasis on physical symptoms. The information they provide is in most cases sufficient to enable adequate review.

Busquets_2017_Nursethi,JOUR,Informed consent: A study of patients with life-threatening illnesses,"Busquets, Montserrat and Cais, Jordi",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between healthcare professionals and patients in the Spanish health sector has undergone dramatic change. One aspect of this is that the use of informed consent has become a key factor in the delivery of adequate healthcare. But although a certain period of time has already passed since informed consent started to be used, in Spain there is still doubt about how adequately informed consent is being used. OBJECTIVES: (a) To look at how patients understand the notion and purpose of informed consent, and (b) how the informed consent is applied - the way patients receive such information affects their level of participation and decision making during the time they receive medical care. METHODOLOGY: We use interpretative description of interviews with patients. We developed guiding questions for the interviews with patients in two preliminary and exploratory focus groups. Then, we carried out 20 personal open-ended interviews with 20 purposive selected patients with illnesses that had a serious impact on their lives. Ethical considerations: Permission from ethical committees and institutions involved in the study, and consent and confidentiality were ensured before conducting the research. RESULTS: The findings show that while patients agreed that their consent should be necessary for health professionals to be able to intervene, they had serious difficulty obtaining and then understanding information offered to them at the moment when they were being asked to sign informed consent documents. The participants were critical of the consent documents, which they considered were treated as merely a formality and even some of them had felt coerced to sign. DISCUSSION: Participants confirmed that the informed consent documents that they signed did not meet their ethical objectives. Their perception of the purpose of consent indicates that informed consent document may still be largely understood as a formality rather an ethical obligation.",2017,10.1177/0969733015614880,24,4,430-440,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and information and Qualitative Research and paternalism and Focus Groups and Spain and *Decision Making and Informed Consent/*ethics and Autonomy and informed consent and Information Dissemination/ethics/methods and nursing intervention,NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mamhidir_2007_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Ethical challenges related to elder care. High level decision-makers' experiences,"Mamhidir, Anna-Greta and Kihlgren, Mona and Sorlie, Venke",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Few empirical studies have been found that explore ethical challenges among persons in high public positions that are responsible for elder care. The aim of this paper was to illuminate the meaning of being in ethically difficult situations related to elder care as experienced by high level decision-makers. METHODS: A phenomenological-hermeneutic method was used to analyse the eighteen interviews conducted with political and civil servant high level decision-makers at the municipality and county council level from two counties in Sweden. The participants worked at a planning and control as well as executive level and had both budget and quality of elder care responsibilities. RESULTS: Both ethical dilemmas and the meaning of being in ethically difficult situations related to elder care were revealed. No differences were seen between the politicians and the civil servants. The ethical dilemmas mostly concerned dealings with extensive care needs and working with a limited budget. The dilemmas were associated with a lack of good care and a lack of agreement concerning care such as vulnerable patients in inappropriate care settings, weaknesses in medical support, dissimilar focuses between the caring systems, justness in the distribution of care and deficient information. Being in ethically difficult situations was challenging. Associated with them were experiences of being exposed, having to be strategic and living with feelings such as aloneness and loneliness, uncertainty, lack of confirmation, the risk of being threatened or becoming a scapegoat and difficult decision avoidance. CONCLUSION: Our paper provides further insight into the ethical dilemmas and ethical challenges met by high level decision-makers', which is important since the overall responsibility for elder care that is also ethically defensible rests with them. They have power and their decisions affect many stakeholders in elder care. Our results can be used to stimulate discussions between high level decision-makers and health care professionals concerning ways of dealing with ethical issues and the necessity of structures that facilitate dealing with them. Even if the high level decision-makers have learned to live with the ethical challenges that confronted them, it was obvious that they were not free from feelings of uncertainty, frustration and loneliness. Vulnerability was revealed regarding themselves and others. Their feelings of failure indicated that they felt something was at stake for the older adults in elder care and for themselves as well, in that there was the risk that important needs would go unmet.",2007,10.1186/1472-6939-8-3,8,NA,3,eng,1472-6939,"Ethics and Uncertainty and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Budgets and Interviews as Topic and Sweden and Aged, 80 and over and Loneliness and Politics and *Policy Making and *Decision Making, Organizational and Ethics, Professional and Administrative Personnel/*ethics/psychology and Ethics, Institutional and Health Services for the Aged/economics/*ethics/*organization & administration and Local Government and Public Health Administration/economics/*ethics and Resource Allocation/economics/ethics",NA,NA,2007/04/10/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although initially important as a counterweight to widespread medical paternalism, recent years have seen a reaction against a widely perceived 'triumph of autonomy'. In particular, competent patients' refusal of life-saving or clearly beneficial treatment presents complex dilemmas for both healthcare professionals and ethicists. Discussion of the mechanism provided by the Israel Patient's Rights Act of 1996 for ethics committees to override refusal of treatment by such patients has provided several examples in which it seems an obligation to benefit the patient can outweigh concerns regarding respect for their autonomy. However, such analyses as have been undertaken so far may be seen to omit important elements of the moral decision-making process that takes place even when the latter appears to 'win out'. In addition to helping better prepare clinicians to meet such challenges in the future, a fuller appreciation of those elements that are present in justified cases of coercive treatment may enable them to arrive at a better understanding of what autonomy itself can mean in a medical context.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.042101,37,9,540-543,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Morals and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/ethics and Israel and Jurisprudence and Paternalism/*ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and Beneficence and Coercion and Patient Rights/*ethics and Treatment Refusal/ethics",NA,NA,2011/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

A nationwide survey,"Hubert, Sidonie and Wainschtein, Sarah and Hugues, Albane and Schimpf, Caroline and Degroote, Thecle and Tiercelet, Kelly and Tran, Marc and Bruel, Cedric and Philippart, Francois",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The doctor-patient relationship has evolved to respect ""the autonomy and patients' rights"". One of the cornerstones in such autonomy is the opportunity for patients to draw living wills, also known as advance directives (AD). However, information about AD available to patients remains scarce largely due to the lack of involvement of General practitioners for several reasons. The aim of our study was to evaluate current general practitioner residents' (GPR) behavior concerning their role in informing their patients about AD. METHOD: We built a French nationwide survey from GPR class of 2012 to 2014. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred ten residents completed our survey (21.1% of the total population of GPR during the period). 89.8% declared their willingness to offer patients the opportunity of writing AD. When asked about the usefulness of AD, 73.6% of residents responded that these are a suitable help for patients, but 19.7% considered that AD are essentially geared towards frail patients. Among residents who want to inform patients about AD (n = 2075), 14.7% wanted to involve all patients. Only 20.5% thought that elderly people should be systematically informed about AD. When the question involves other frail people in various disease areas, information seems relevant for 60.1% of GPR considering patient with cancer or malignant hematologic disease and for 56.2% about patients affected by neurodegenerative disease. When considering the routine use of AD, 20.5% of GPR would take them into account only if they are in agreement with the patient's decision.

Interviews and debriefings were tape recorded in Amharic, and transcribed and translated to English. Coding of the transcripts was facilitated by use of NVivo software. Thematic analysis was employed to respond to the initial questions and interpret findings. RESULTS: Perceived barriers to voluntary study participation included lack of reporting back study results of previous studies, the decision making status of women, hopelessness or fatigue in the patients, shyness of the women, data collectors approach to the patient, and patient's time constraints. Most of the patients preferred oral over written consent and face-to-face interview over telephone interview. Provision of detail information about the study, using short and understandable tool, competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators of the same gender were suggested to assure participation. Due to the perceived severity, the use of the term ""cancer"" was associated with fear and anxiety. Alternatively, uses of phrases like ""breast or cervical illness/disease"" were suggested during patient interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary participation is not straight forward but affected by different factors. Using competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators, short and precise questioning tools to limit the time of the interview could improve voluntary participation. Moreover, careful consideration of the patients and families concept of the disease such as wording and information has to be taken into account. This assessment helped in improving the consent process of the ongoing project on breast and cervical cancer patients.",2018,10.1186/s12910-018-0328-8,19,1,87,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Female and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Aged and Longitudinal Studies and Neoplasms/therapy and Ethiopia and Cancer patients and Medical Oncology/*ethics and Biomedical Research/*ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and *Ethics Consultation and Research ethics and Consent process and Patient Selection/ethics and Prohibitins and Rapid ethical assessment,NA,NA,2018/11/14/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Normative implications of time in intensive care, which affect all three areas, have so far barely been considered. The study explores patterns of decision making concerning the continuation, withdrawal and withholding of therapies in intensive care. A triangulation of qualitative data collection methods was chosen. Data were collected through non-participant observation on a surgical ICU at an academic medical centre followed by semi-structured interviews with nurses and physicians. The transcribed interviews and observation notes were coded and analysed using qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Three themes related to time emerged regarding the escalation or de-escalation of therapies: influence of time on prognosis, time as a scarce resource and timing in regards to decision making. The study also reveals the ambivalence of time as a norm for decision making. The challenge of dealing with time-related efforts in ICU care results from the tension between the need to wait to optimise patient care, which must be balanced against the significant time pressure which is characteristic of the ICU setting.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105752,NA,NA,2019-105752-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,ethics and clinical Ethics and health personnel and philosophy of medicine,NA,NA,2020/04/24/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Newborn gestational age discriminates neonatal resuscitation practices in the Italian debate,"Turillazzi, Emanuela and Fineschi, Vittorio",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary study groups have produced documents in an attempt to support decisions regarding whether to resuscitate ""at risk"" newborns or not. Moreover, there has been an increasingly insistent request for juridical regulation of neonatal resuscitation practices as well as for clarification of the role of parents in decisions regarding this kind of assistance. The crux of the matter is whether strict guidelines, reference standards based on the parameter of gestational age and authority rules are necessary. DISCUSSION: The Italian scenario reflects the current animated debate, illustrating the difficulty intrinsic in rigid guidelines on the subject, especially when gestational age is taken as a reference parameter for the medical decision. SUMMARY: Concerning the decision to interrupt or not to initiate resuscitation procedures on low gestational age newborns, physicians do not need rigid rules based on inflexible gestational age and birth weight guidelines. Guidance in addressing the difficult and trying issues associated with infants born at the margins of viability with a realistic assessment of the infant's clinical condition must be based on the infant's best interests, with clinicians and parents entering into what has been described as a ""partnership of care"".",2009,10.1186/1472-6939-10-19,10,NA,19,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Patient Participation and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Parents and Infant, Newborn and Italy and *Decision Making/ethics and Birth Weight and *Infant, Premature and *Gestational Age and Cesarean Section/ethics/standards and Fetal Viability and Intensive Care, Neonatal/ethics/methods/*standards and Resuscitation/ethics/*standards and Withholding Treatment/ethics/*standards",NA,NA,2009/11/12/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lewis_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Capturing and promoting the autonomy of capacitous vulnerable adults,"Lewis, Jonathan",Journal of medical ethics,"According to the High Court in England and Wales, the primary purpose of legal interventions into the lives of vulnerable adults with mental capacity should be to allow the individuals concerned to regain their autonomy of decision-making. However, recent cases of clinical decision-making involving capacitous vulnerable adults have shown that, when it comes to medical law, medical ethics and clinical practice, vulnerability is typically conceived as opposed to autonomy. The first aim of this paper is to detail the problems that arise when the courts and healthcare practitioners respond to the vulnerability of capacitous adults on the basis of such an opposition. It will be shown that not only does the common law approach to vulnerability fail to adequately capture the autonomy of capacitous vulnerable adults, the conception of vulnerability and autonomy in oppositional terms leads to objectionably paternalistic healthcare responses that undermine the autonomy of vulnerable patients as well as clinical and legal interventions that violate their autonomy. In response, the second aim of this paper is to show that the concepts of autonomy and vulnerability are necessarily entwined and, on that basis, the focus should be on promoting the autonomy of capacitous vulnerable adults where possible In order to make this case, the paper explains the limitations of standard approaches to the autonomy of vulnerable adults and, in their place, offers a conception of legitimate, self-authorised autonomy that is fundamentally dependent on intersubjective practices of recognition.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106835,NA,NA,2020-106835-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and autonomy and legal aspects and informed consent and capacity,NA,NA,2020/12/21/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nondisclosure is possible because these are silent decisions to refrain from screening, diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Nondisclosure is ethically permissible when the usual presumption that the patient should be involved in decisions is defeated by considerations of clinical utility or patient emotional and physical well-being. Some silent decisions--not all--are ethically justified by this standard. Justified silent decisions are typically dependent on the physician's professional judgment, experience and knowledge, and are not likely to be changed by patient preferences. We condemn the inappropriate exclusion of the patient from the decision-making process. However, if a test or treatment is unlikely to yield a net benefit, disclosure and discussion are at times unnecessary.

Kottow_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,Ethical quandaries posing as conflicts of interest,"Kottow, Miguel",Journal of medical ethics,"Conflicts of interest are receiving increased attention in medical research, clinical practice and education. Criticism of, and penalties for, conflicts of interest have been insufficiently discussed and have been applied without adequate conceptual backing. Genuine conflicts of interest are situations in which alternative courses of action are ethically equivalent, decision-making being less a matter of moral deliberation than of personal weighing of interest. In contrast, situations usually thought of as conflicts of interest are mostly temptations to follow an attractive but undue option that causes harm by failing to uphold well-entrenched ethical standards. Examples of moral quandaries that pose as ethically neutral conflicts of interest are healthcare providers enticed to favour certain products; patients being referred to non-therapeutic trials entailing risks and non-optimal healthcare; industry-supported scientists failing to deliver unbiased research results and reports or participating in ghost-writing; and sponsored educators who praise their supporters beyond objective evidence. All these are moral blemishes, where integrity gives way to material incentives at the cost of provoking risky and harm-producing situations, thus constituting false conflicts of interest when they are in fact ethical misdemeanours. Disclosure has been the most widely recommended response to avoid the concealment of conflicting and ethically suspect interests. Regulations regarding disclosure reveal a utilitarian stance that shows more concern for the magnitude of support or sponsorship than for the underlying ethical transgression. Education and oversight should directly address and help correct the moral attitude towards undue influence of inducements and marketing strategies falsely posing as conflicts of interest.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.034710,36,6,328-332,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Decision Making, Organizational and *Ethics, Medical and *Ethics, Research and *Conflict of Interest and Bioethical Issues and Moral Obligations and Delivery of Health Care/*ethics/organization & administration",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Dimech_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Challenges faced by patients, relatives and clinicians in end-stage dementia decision-making: a qualitative study of swallowing problems","Dimech, Joseph and Agius, Emmanuel and Hughes, Julian C. and Bartolo, Paul",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making in end-stage dementia (ESD) is a complex process involving medical, social, legal and ethical issues. In ESD, the person suffers from severe cognitive problems leading to a loss of capacity to decide matters regarding health and end-of-life issues. The decisional responsibility is usually passed to clinicians and relatives who can face significant difficulty in making moral decisions, particularly in the presence of life-threatening swallowing problems. AIM: This study aimed to understand the decision-making processes of clinical teams and relatives in addressing life-threatening swallowing difficulties in ESD in long-term care in Malta. METHOD: The study followed a qualitative approach where six case studies, involving six different teams and relatives of six different patients, were interviewed retrospectively to understand their decision-making in connection with the management of swallowing difficulties in ESD. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with each stakeholder. All data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: the vulnerability of patients in dementia decision-making; the difficult role of relatives in decision-making; the decisional conflict between aggressive care through tube feeding versus oral comfort feeding; a consensus-building decision-making process as ideal to facilitate agreement and respect for patient's dignity. CONCLUSION: Decision-making to manage swallowing difficulties in ESD is a challenging process, which involves an interpretation of personal values, beliefs, patient preferences, care needs and clinical practice. Better communication between clinicians and relatives in dementia helps promote agreement between stakeholders leading to a care plan that respects the dignity of patients at their end of life.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106222,NA,NA,2020-106222-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and dementia and end of life care and deglutition disorders and human dignity,NA,NA,2020/08/03/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHOD AND MATERIALS: 299 of 312 eligible patients admitted to general internal medicine or surgery wards from May to December 2006 were interviewed according to a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions about patients' preferences regarding four domains of information and their participation in decision-making. Patients' responses were measured on a visual analogue scale graded from 1 to 10. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score for desire to receive information was 8.88 out of 10 (1.5) and for participation in medical decision-making was 7.75 out of 10 (3). The desire to receive information was greater in women than men (9.0 (1.5) vs 7.8 (1.4), p = 0.025). It was also correlated with their education (r = 0.2, p = 0.001) and their estimation of the severity of their own disease (r = 0.13, p = 0.027). The score for preference to participate in decision-making was higher in women than in men (7.95 (2.8) and 7.0 (3.2), respectively; beta = 0.8, p = 0.022) and was negatively correlated with education (r = -0.14, p = 0.015).

Several consenting systems have been proposed. There is limited information on public relative attitudes towards various consenting systems, especially in Middle Eastern/Islamic countries. METHODS: We surveyed 698 Saudi Adults attending outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital. Preference and perception of norm regarding consenting options for posthumous organ donation were explored. Participants ranked (1, most agreeable) the following, randomly-presented, options from 1 to 11: no-organ-donation, presumed consent, informed consent by donor-only, informed consent by donor-or-surrogate, and mandatory choice; the last three options <c2><b1> medical or financial incentive. RESULTS: Mean(SD) age was 32(9) year, 27% were males, 50% were patients' companions, 60% had <e2><89><a5> college education, and 20% and 32%, respectively, knew an organ donor or recipient. Mandated choice was among the top three choices for preference of 54% of respondents, with an overall median[25%,75%] ranking score of 3[2,6], and was preferred over donor-or-surrogate informed consent (4[2,7], p < 0.001), donor-only informed consent (5[3,7], p < 0.001), and presumed consent (7[3,10], p < 0.001). The addition of a financial or medical incentive, respectively, reduced ranking of mandated choice to 7[4,9], p < 0.001, and 5[3,8], p < 0.001; for donor-or-surrogate informed consent to 7[5,9], p < 0.001, and 5[3,7], p = 0.004; and for donor-only informed consent to 8[6,10], p < 0.001, and 5[3,7], p = 0.56. Distribution of ranking score of perception of norm and preference were similar except for no-organ donation (11[7,11] vs. 11[6,11], respectively, p = 0.002). Compared to females, males more perceived donor-or-surrogate informed consent as the norm (3[1,6] vs. 5[3,7], p < 0.001), more preferred mandated choice with financial incentive option (6[3,8] vs. 8[4,9], p < 0.001), and less preferred mandated choice with medical incentive option (7[4,9] vs. 5[2,7], p < 0.001). There was no association between consenting options ranking scores and age, health status, education level, or knowing an organ donor or recipient. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that: 1) most respondents were in favor of posthumous organ donation, 2) mandated choice system was the most preferred and presumed consent system was the least preferred, 3) there was no difference between preference and perception of norm in consenting systems ranking, and 4) financial (especially in females) and medical (especially in males) incentives reduced preference.",2012,10.1186/1472-6939-13-32,13,NA,32,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Sex Factors and Surveys and Questionnaires and Motivation and Tertiary Care Centers and Saudi Arabia and *Public Opinion and Decision Making/*ethics and Choice Behavior/ethics and Presumed Consent/*ethics and Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics,NA,NA,2012/11/22/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In patients who do not stand to receive proportional clinical benefits, the harms involved in interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation seem to run contrary to the principle of non-maleficence, and provision of such interventions may cause clinicians significant moral distress. However, because the application of these policies involves taking choices out of the domain of shared decision-making, they face important ethical and legal problems, including a recent challenge to their constitutionality. In light of these concerns, we suggest a re-conceptualization of informed non-dissent as an alternative approach in cases where the application of process-based policies is being considered.

Using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as an example of life-supporting treatments, the objectives of this study were: (1) to examine the relationship between age and the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use; (2) to examine the relationship between age and the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use; and (3) to deliberate the ethical and societal implications of age and gender disparities in the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. METHODS: This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study. Taiwan's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cases from 2000 to 2010 were collected. The annual incidence rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use adjusting for both age and gender distribution for each year from 2000 to 2010 was derived using the population of 2000 as the reference population. The trend of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was examined using time-series linear regression analysis. We conducted joinpoint regression for estimating the trend change of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. RESULTS: The trends of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use both for different gender groups, and for different age groups have been significantly increasing over time. Men were more likely to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than women. Women's perspectives toward life and death, and women's perception of well-being may be associated with the phenomenon. In addition, the patients at the age of 65 or older were more likely to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than those younger than 65. Family autonomy/family-determination, and the Confucian tradition of filial piety and respecting elders may account for this phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed gender and age disparities in the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in Taiwan, which may be accounted for by the cultural and societal values in Taiwan.

Schaden_2010_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The role of advance directives in end-of-life decisions in Austria: survey of intensive care physicians,"Schaden, Eva and Herczeg, Petra and Hacker, Stefan and Schopper, Andrea and Krenn, Claus G.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Currently, intensive care medicine strives to define a generally accepted way of dealing with end-of-life decisions, therapy limitation and therapy discontinuation.In 2006 a new advance directive legislation was enacted in Austria. Patients may now document their personal views regarding extension of treatment. The aim of this survey was to explore Austrian intensive care physicians' experiences with and their acceptance of the new advance directive legislation two years after enactment (2008). METHODS: Under the aegis of the OEGARI (Austrian Society of Anaesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care) an anonymised questionnaire was sent to the medical directors of all intensive care units in Austria. The questions focused on the physicians' experiences regarding advance directives and their level of knowledge about the underlying legislation. RESULTS: There were 241 questionnaires sent and 139 were turned, which was a response rate of 58%. About one third of the responders reported having had no experience with advance directives and only 9 directors of intensive care units had dealt with more than 10 advance directives in the previous two years.

CONCLUSION: A response rate of almost 60% proves the great interest of intensive care professionals in making patient-oriented end-of-life decisions.

Buiting_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,Dutch experience of monitoring active ending of life for newborns,"Buiting, Hilde M. and Karelse, Maartje A. C. and Brouwers, Hens A. A. and Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D. and van der Heide, Agnes and van Delden, Johannes J. M.",Journal of medical ethics,"INTRODUCTION: In 2007, a national review committee was instituted in The Netherlands to review cases of active ending of life for newborns. It was expected that 15-20 cases would be reported. To date, however, only one case has been reported to this committee. Reporting is essential to obtain societal control and transparency; the possible explanations for this lack of reporting were therefore explored. METHODS: Data on end-of-life decision-making were scrutinised from Dutch nation-wide studies (1995, 2001 and 2005), before institution of the committee. Physicians received a questionnaire about their medical decision-making for stratified samples of deceased infants up to 1 year, drawn from the central death registry. RESULTS: In 2005, 58% of all deaths were preceded by an end-of-life decision, compared with 68% in 2001 and 62% in 1995. The use of drugs with a possible life-shortening effect tended to be lower. In 2005, all four cases in the study in which an infants' life was actively ended were preceded by a decision to forego life-prolonging treatment. In three cases, the infant's life expectancy was short; one case involved a longer life expectancy. DISCUSSION: The expected number of cases is probably an overestimation due to changes in medical practice such as the tendency to attribute less life-shortening effects to opioids. The lack of reports is probably also associated with requirements in the regulation; it may be difficult to fulfil them due either to time constraints or the nature of the suffering that is addressed. If societal control of active ending of life is considered useful, changes in the regulation may be needed.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.034397,36,4,234-237,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Infant and Retrospective Studies and Time Factors and Surveys and Questionnaires and Quality of Life and Infant, Newborn and Netherlands and *Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Euthanasia, Active/*ethics and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*ethics",NA,NA,2010/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Mertz_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,How to tackle the conundrum of quality appraisal in systematic reviews of normative literature/information? Analysing the problems of three possible strategies (translation of a German paper),"Mertz, Marcel",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In the last years, there has been an increase in publication of systematic reviews of normative (""argument-based"") literature or of normative information (such as ethical issues) in bioethics. The aim of a systematic review is to search, select, analyse and synthesise literature in a transparent and systematic way in order to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the information sought, predominantly as a basis for informed decision-making in health care. Traditionally, one part of the procedure when conducting a systematic review is an appraisal of the quality of the literature that could be included. MAIN TEXT: However, while there are established methods and standards for appraising e.g. clinical studies or other empirical research, quality appraisal of normative literature (or normative information) in the context of a systematic review is still rather a conundrum - not only is it unclear how it could or should be done, but also the question whether it necessarily must be done is not settled yet. Based on a pragmatic definition of ""normative literature"" as well as on a typology of different types of systematic reviews of normative literature/information, this paper identifies and critically discusses three possible strategies of conducting quality appraisal. CONCLUSIONS: The paper will argue that none of the three strategies is able to provide a general and satisfying solution to the problems associated with quality appraisal of normative literature/information. Still, the discussion of the three strategies allows outlining minimal conditions that elaborated strategies have to meet in future, and facilitates sketching a theoretically and practically promising strategy.",2019,10.1186/s12910-019-0423-5,20,1,81,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Methodology and Systematic review and Germany and Data Accuracy and *Ethics, Research and Medical ethics and *Systematic Reviews as Topic and Bioethics and Evidence-based ethics and Normative information and Normative literature and Periodicals as Topic/ethics/*standards and Quality appraisal",NA,NA,2019/11/14/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Schuurmans_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Euthanasia requests in dementia cases; what are experiences and needs of Dutch physicians? A qualitative interview study,"Schuurmans, Jaap and Bouwmeester, Romy and Crombach, Lamar and van Rijssel, Tessa and Wingens, Lizzy and Georgieva, Kristina and O'Shea, Nadine and Vos, Stephanie and Tilburgs, Bram and Engels, Yvonne",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, in 2002, euthanasia became a legitimate medical act, only allowed when the due care criteria and procedural requirements are met. Legally, an Advanced Euthanasia Directive (AED) can replace direct communication if a patient can no longer express his own wishes. In the past decade, an exponential number of persons with dementia (PWDs) share a euthanasia request with their physician. The impact this on physicians, and the consequent support needs, remained unknown. Our objective was to gain more insight into the experiences and needs of Dutch general practitioners and elderly care physicians when handling a euthanasia request from a person with dementia (PWD). METHODS: We performed a qualitative interview study. Participants were recruited via purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the conventional thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Eleven general practitioners (GPs) and elderly care physicians with a variety of experience and different attitudes towards euthanasia for PWD were included. Euthanasia requests appeared to have a major impact on physicians. Difficulties they experienced were related to timing, workload, pressure from and expectations of relatives, society's negative view of dementia in combination with the 'right to die' view, the interpretation of the law and AEDs, ethical considerations, and communication with PWD and relatives. To deal with these difficulties, participants need support from colleagues and other professionals. Although elderly care physicians appreciated moral deliberation and support by chaplains, this was hardly mentioned by GPs. CONCLUSIONS: Euthanasia requests in dementia seem to place an ethically and emotionally heavy burden on Dutch GPs and elderly care physicians.

Patients asked to participate in RCTs often experience difficulties in understanding the meaning of these and their justification. METHODS: We reviewed RCT protocols, statements of the principal investigator (PI), and participant-information materials, as submitted for opinion to a research ethics committee. We evaluated how the justification for the use of placebo was described in these documents and how the participants had been informed about randomisation, placebo use, and the possible risks of receiving placebo. RESULTS: In total, 52 RCTs were identified. Eighteen of the study protocols (35%) provided some rationale for the use of placebo. In 15 (29%) of the statements, the PI had provided justification for its use. Possible risks related to placebo use were described in nine (17%) of the statements. An explanation as to why placebo was necessary featured in only 12 (23%) of the sets of participant-information materials, and only six (12%) of the documents discussed the possible risks associated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The justification of placebo control was inadequately described in the RCT study protocols, by principal or national co-ordinating investigators, and in participant-information documents.

Greenblum_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Responding to religious patients: why physicians have no business doing theology,"Greenblum, Jake and Hubbard, Ryan K.",Journal of medical ethics,"A survey of the recent literature suggests that physicians should engage religious patients on religious grounds when the patient cites religious considerations for a medical decision. We offer two arguments that physicians ought to avoid engaging patients in this manner. The first is the Public Reason Argument. We explain why physicians are relevantly akin to public officials. This suggests that it is not the physician's proper role to engage in religious deliberation. This is because the public character of a physician's role binds him/her to public reason, which precludes the use of religious considerations. The second argument is the Fiduciary Argument. We show that the patient-physician relationship is a fiduciary relationship, which suggests that the patient has the clinical expectation that physicians limit themselves to medical considerations. Since engaging in religious deliberations lies outside this set of considerations, such engagement undermines trust and therefore damages the patient-physician relationship.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2019-105452,45,11,705-710,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and Humans and Decision Making and Physician's Role and Trust and *Physician-Patient Relations and Religion and Medicine and clinical ethics and Physicians/*ethics and moral and religious aspects and applied and professional ethics,NA,NA,2019/11//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tveit and Moi, Asgjerd Litlere and Aasen, Elin M. and Nortvedt, Per and Gjengedal, Eva",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: While being prepared for abortions, some women experience decisional ambivalence during their encounters with health personnel at the hospital. Women's experiences with these encounters have rarely been examined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore ambivalent abortion-seeking women's experiences of their encounters with health personnel. RESEARCH DESIGN: The data were collected in individual interviews and analysed with dialogical narrative analyses. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A total of 13 women (aged 18-36 years), who were uncertain of whether to terminate their pregnancies during the first trimester, were interviewed before and after they made their decisions. The participants were recruited at six Norwegian outpatient clinics. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approval was granted by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. FINDINGS: The ambivalent pregnant women sought to make autonomous decisions while simultaneously involving their closest confidants and health personnel in the process. The following three types of narratives of women's experiences with encounters with health personnel were identified: the respected women; the identified women; and the abandoned women. DISCUSSION: The findings are discussed in terms of the ambivalent pregnant woman's autonomous responsibility in considering an abortion and how her autonomy can be enabled or impaired during encounters with health personnel. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: Although the women considered themselves autonomous and responsible for their final decisions, they wished health personnel were involved in their situations. The health personnel contributed by enabling or disabling the possibility of decision-making in accordance with the women's values.

The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: Among 685 instructors, 560 (82%) agreed to participate. Only 5%-13% reported having opportunity for antenatal counselling parents: if called, 22% reported discussing with the family about the possibility not to resuscitate in the DR; 63% about the possibility of death in the DR and 89% about the possibility of death in the neonatal unit. If the parents did not agree with the advice of the paediatrician, 30%-50% of the respondents would follow the procedures they advised regardless of the opinion of the parents. The higher the gestational age, the lower is the percentage of paediatricians who believed that parents should participate in decision-making. Only 9% participants reported the existence of written guidelines at their hospital on initiation of resuscitation in the DR at limits of viability, but 80% paediatricians reported using some criteria for limiting resuscitation in the DR.

Buturovic_2021_Joofmeet,JOUR,Procedural safeguards cannot disentangle MAiD from organ donation decisions,"Buturovic, Zeljka",Journal of medical ethics,"In the past, a vast majority of medical assistance in dying (MAiD) patients were elderly patients with cancer who are not suitable for organ donation, making organ donation from such patients a rare event. However, more expansive criteria for MAiD combined with an increased participation of MAiD patients in organ donation is likely to drastically increase the pool of MAiD patients who can serve as organ donors. Previous discussions of ethical issues arising from these trends have not fully addressed difficulties involved in separating decision to end one's life from the one to donate one's organs. However, realities of organ donation logistics and human decision making suggest that this separation can be extraordinary difficult. The need to maximise quality of donated organs complicates dying experience of the donor and is likely in tension with the dying experience the patient envisioned when first considering MAiD. Furthermore, the idea that patients will think about MAiD first, and only when firmly decided to end their life, consider organ donation, runs contrary to organ donation policies in some countries as well as end of life and everyday decision making. This opens the door for organ donation to serve as an incentive in MAiD decisions.

Since the suggestion that HCQ has potential for COVID-19, there have been varying responses from clinicians and healthcare institutions, ranging from adoption of protocols using HCQ for routine care to the conduct of randomised controlled trials to an effective system-wide prohibition on its use for COVID-19. In this article, we argue that the concept of 'disease public profile' has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the disease's public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage.

Close_2018_Joofmeet,JOUR,Charlie Gard: in defence of the law,"Close, Eliana and Willmott, Lindy and White, Benjamin P.",Journal of medical ethics,"Much of the commentary in the wake of the Charlie Gard litigation was aimed at apparent shortcomings of the law. These include concerns about the perceived inability of the law to consider resourcing issues, the vagueness of the best interests test and the delays and costs of having disputes about potentially life-sustaining medical treatment resolved by the courts. These concerns are perennial ones that arise in response to difficult cases. Despite their persistence, we argue that many of these criticisms are unfounded. The first part of this paper sets out the basic legal framework that operates when parents seek potentially life-sustaining treatment that doctors believe is against a child's best interests, and describes the criticisms of that framework. The second part of the paper suggests an alternative approach that would give decision-making power to parents, and remove doctors' ability to unilaterally withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment that they regard is futile. This proposal is grounded in several values that we argue should guide these regulatory choices. We also contend that the best interests test is justifiable and since the courts show no sign of departing from it, the focus should be on how to better elucidate the underlying values driving decisions. We discuss the advantages of our proposed approach and how it would address some of the criticisms aimed at the law.

It argues that the legal basis of the argument, from the case of Ashya King, was tenuous. It sought to introduce different categories of cases concerning children's medical treatment when, despite the inevitable factual distinctions between individual cases, the duty of the judge in all cases to determine the best interests of the child is firmly established by the case law. It argues that the focus should not have been on a threshold for intervention but on whether his parents had established that the therapy they wanted was a viable alternative therapeutic option. In the April hearing, Charlie's parents relied on the offer of treatment from a US doctor; by July they had an independent panel of international experts supporting their case although by this time the medical evidence was that it was too late for Charlie. One of Charlie's legacies for future disputes may be that his case highlighted the need for evidence as to whether the treatment parents want for their child is a viable alternative therapeutic option before a court can determine which therapeutic option is in the best interests of the child.",2018,10.1136/medethics-2017-104720,44,7,466-470,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"decision-making and Humans and Child and Decision Making and Parents/*psychology and Dissent and Disputes and legal aspects and Child Advocacy/*ethics and care of dying minors and Parental Consent/*ethics and Medical Futility/*ethics and minors/parental consent and Therapies, Investigational/*ethics",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Newdick_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Tragic choices in intensive care during the COVID-19 pandemic: on fairness, consistency and community","Newdick, Chris and Sheehan, Mark and Dunn, Michael",Journal of medical ethics,"Tragic choices arise during the COVID-19 pandemic when the limited resources made available in acute medical settings cannot be accessed by all patients who need them. In these circumstances, healthcare rationing is unavoidable. It is important in any healthcare rationing process that the interests of the community are recognised, and that decision-making upholds these interests through a fair and consistent process of decision-making. Responding to recent calls (1) to safeguard individuals' legal rights in decision-making in intensive care, and (2) for new authoritative national guidance for decision-making, this paper seeks to clarify what consistency and fairness demand in healthcare rationing during the COVID-19 pandemic, from both a legal and ethical standpoint. The paper begins with a brief review of UK law concerning healthcare resource allocation, considering how community interests and individual rights have been marshalled in judicial deliberation about the use of limited health resources within the National Health Service (NHS). It is then argued that an important distinction needs to be drawn between procedural and outcome consistency, and that a procedurally consistent decision-making process ought to be favoured. Congruent with the position that UK courts have adopted for resource allocation decision-making in the NHS more generally, specific requirements for a procedural framework and substantive triage criteria to be applied within that framework during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered in detail.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106487,46,10,646-651,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"SARS-CoV-2 and decision-making and COVID-19 and Humans and United Kingdom and Pandemics and law and Betacoronavirus and Decision Making/*ethics and State Medicine and clinical ethics and allocation of health care resources and Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*therapy and Critical Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Health Care Rationing/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*therapy",NA,NA,2020/10//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Johal_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Conflict before the courtroom: challenging cognitive biases in critical decision-making,"Johal, Harleen Kaur and Danbury, Christopher",Journal of medical ethics,"Conflict is an important consideration in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this setting, conflict most commonly occurs over the 'best interests' of the incapacitated adult patient; for instance, when families seek aggressive life-sustaining treatments, which are thought by the medical team to be potentially inappropriate. Indeed, indecision on futility of treatment and the initiation of end-of-life discussions are recognised to be among the greatest challenges of working in the ICU, leading to emotional and psychological 'burnout' in ICU teams. When these disagreements occur, they may be within the clinical team or among those close to the patient, or between the clinical team and those close to the patient. It is, therefore, crucial to have a theoretical understanding of decision-making itself, as unpicking misalignments in the family's and clinical team's decision-making processes may offer strategies to resolve conflict. Here, we relate Kahneman and Tversky's work on cognitive biases and behavioural economics to the ICU environment, arguing that these biases could partly explain disparities in the decision-making processes for the two conflicting parties. We suggest that through the establishment of common ground, challenging of cognitive biases and formulation of mutually agreeable solutions, mediation may offer a pragmatic and cost-effective solution to conflict resolution. The litigation process is intrinsically adversarial and strains the doctor-patient-relative relationship. Thus an alternative external party should be considered, however mediation is not frequently used and more research is needed into its effectiveness in resolving conflicts in the ICU.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106177,47,12,e36,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and ethics and psychology and capacity and end of life care,NA,NA,2020/07/06/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, multicentre, retrospective study based on medical chart review. The medical records of all patients that died in seven paediatric and three adult ICUs belonging to university and tertiary hospitals over a period of 2 years were included. Deaths in the first 24 h of admission to the ICU and brain death were excluded. INTERVENTION: Two intensive care fellows of each ICU were trained in fulfilling a standard protocol (kappa=0.9) to record demographic data and all medical management provided in the last 48 h of life. The Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi(2) test and RR were used for data comparison. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 1053 medical charts were included (59.4% adult patients). Life support limitation was more frequent in the adult group (86% vs 43.5%; p<0.001). A 'do not resuscitate' order was the most common life support limitation in both groups (75% and 66%), whereas withholding/withdrawing were more frequent in the paediatric group (33.9% vs 24.9%; p=0.02). The life support limitation was rarely reported in the medical chart in both groups (52.6% and 33.7%) with scarce family involvement in the decision making process (23.0% vs 8.7%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Life support limitation decision making in Brazilian ICUs is predominantly centred on the medical perspective with scarce participation of the family, and consequently several non-coherent medical interventions are observed in patients with life support limitation.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.035113,36,6,344-348,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Child and Child, Preschool and Retrospective Studies and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Brazil and Hospitals, University and Length of Stay and Intensive Care Units, Pediatric and *Intensive Care Units and Terminal Care/*methods and Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data and Life Support Care/*methods/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2010/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pettersson_2020_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The ethics of DNR-decisions in oncology and hematology care: a qualitative study,"Pettersson, Mona and Hedstrom, Mariann and Hoglund, Anna T.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In cancer care, do not resuscitate (DNR) orders are common in the terminal phase of the illness, which implies that the responsible physician in advance decides that in case of a cardiac arrest neither basic nor advanced Coronary Pulmonary Rescue should be performed. Swedish regulations prescribe that DNR decisions should be made by the responsible physician, preferably in co-operation with members of the team. If possible, the patient should consent, and significant others should be informed of the decision. Previous studies have shown that physicians and nurses can experience ethical dilemmas in relation to DNR decisions, but knowledge about what ethical reasoning they perform is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to describe and explore what ethical reasoning physicians and nurses apply in relation to DNR-decisions in oncology and hematology care. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive and explorative design was used, based on 287 free-text comments in a study-specific questionnaire, answered by 216 physicians and nurses working in 16 oncology and hematology wards in Sweden. Comments were given by 89 participants. RESULTS: The participants applied a situation-based ethical reasoning in relation to DNR-decisions. The reasons given for this were both deontological and utilitarian in kind. Also, expressions of care ethics were found in the material. Universal rules or guidelines were seen as problematic. Concerning the importance of the subject, nurses to a higher extent underlined the importance of discussing DNR-situations, while physicians described DNR-decisions as over-investigated and not such a big issue in their daily work. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that DNR-decisions in oncology and hematology care gave rise to ethical considerations. Important ethical values described by the participants were to avoid doing harm and to secure a peaceful and ""natural"" death with dignity for their dying patients. A preference for the expression ""allow for natural death"" instead of the traditional term ""do not resuscitate"" was found in the material.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00508-z,21,1,66,eng,1472-6939,Physicians and Ethics and Humans and Decision Making and Nurses and Sweden and Medical Oncology and *Physicians and Hematology and *Hematology and Resuscitation Orders and Allow for natural death and Do not resuscitate and Oncology,NA,NA,2020/07/31/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Herein, we aim to provide data and expert commentary about elective cochlear implant (CI) removal that may help to guide clinical decision-making and formulate guidelines related to CI explantation. DATA SOURCES: We address these objectives via three approaches: case report of a patient who desired elective CI removal; review of literature and expert discussion by surgeon, audiologist, bioethicist, CI user and member of Deaf community. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review using three scientific online databases was performed. Included articles addressed the benefits and/or complications of cochlear implantation in young children, CI explantation with or without revision surgery and the ethical debate between the medical and Deaf communities on cochlear implantation and explantation. CONCLUSIONS: The medical and audiological perspectives identify a host of risks related to implant removal without reimplantation, including risk from surgery, general anaesthesia, cochlear ossification and poor audiometric outcomes. The member of the deaf community and bioethicist argue that physicians need to guide the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and patient autonomy. Taken together, patient desires should be seen as paramount, if the patient is otherwise fit for surgery and well informed. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Similar to the case of device implantation, device explantation should be a multidisciplinary and collaborative decision with the patient and the family's desires at the centre.

This article explores how physicians ought to respond when new screening examinations that lack conclusive evidence of overall population benefit emerge in the marketplace and are requested by individual patients. To this end, the article considers the nature of evidence and how it influences decision-making for screening at both the public policy and individual patient levels.

Trankle_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Decisions that hasten death: double effect and the experiences of physicians in Australia,"Trankle, Steven A.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: In Australian end-of-life care, practicing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is illegal. Despite this, death hastening practices are common across medical settings. Practices can be clandestine or overt but in many instances physicians are forced to seek protection behind ambiguous medico-legal imperatives such as the Principle of Double Effect. Moreover, the way they conceptualise and experience such practices is inconsistent. To complement the available statistical data, the purpose of this study was to understand the reasoning behind how and why physicians in Australia will hasten death. METHOD: A qualitative investigation was focused on palliative and critical/acute settings. A thematic analysis was conducted on semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 specialist physicians. Attention was given to eliciting meanings and experiences in Australian end-of-life care. RESULTS: Highlighting the importance of a multidimensional approach, physicians negotiated multiple influences when death was regarded as hastened. The way they understood and experienced end-of-life care practices were affected by politico-religious and cultural influences, medico-legal imperatives, and personal values and beliefs. Interpersonal and intrapsychic aspects further emphasised the emotional and psychological investment physicians have with patients and others. In most cases death occurred as a result of treating suffering, and sometimes to fulfil the wishes of patients and others who requested death. Experience was especially subject to the efficacy with which physicians negotiated complex but context-specific situations, and was reflective of how they considered a good death. Although many were compelled to draw on the Principle of Double Effect, every physician reported its inadequacy as a medico-legal guideline. CONCLUSIONS: The Principle of Double Effect, as a simplistic and generalised guideline, was identified as a convenient mechanism to protect physicians who inadvertently or intentionally hastened death. But its narrow focus on the physician's intent illuminated how easily it may be manipulated, thus impairing transparency and a physician's capacity for honesty. It is suggested the concept of ""force majeure"" be examined for its applicability in Australian medical end-of-life law where, consistent with a multidimensional and complex world, a physician's motivations can also be understood in terms of the emotional and psychological pressures they face in situations that hasten death.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-26,15,NA,26,eng,1472-6939,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires and Australia and Qualitative Research and Intention and Religion and Attitude of Health Personnel and Palliative Care/*ethics and Advance Directives/legislation & jurisprudence and Critical Care/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Double Effect Principle and Empathy/*ethics and Physicians/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Supreme Court Decisions and Terminal Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology",NA,NA,2014/03/25/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Muramoto_2011_Joofmeet,JOUR,Socially and temporally extended end-of-life decision-making process for dementia patients,"Muramoto, Osamu",Journal of medical ethics,"There are two contrasting views on the decision-making for life-sustaining treatment in advanced stages of dementia when the patient is deemed incompetent. One is to respect the patient's precedent autonomy by adhering to advance directives or using the substituted judgement standard. The other is to use the best-interests standard, particularly if the current judgement on what is best for the incapacitated patient contradicts the instructions from the patient's precedent autonomy. In this paper, I argue that the protracted clinical course of dementia over many years requires the extended perspective of a progressive decision-making process-extended in both social space and time. The ongoing debate between these two competing views has missed this perspective by focussing on an exclusive disjunction between the competent former self and the incompetent current self. Drawing on theories of situated cognition in cognitive science, I will show that the cognition of a demented patient can be viewed as extended and embodied by her supportive social environment. As the disease progresses, the content of the mind of a demented person becomes partially constituted by such external resources along with her diminishing intrinsic mind. With this understanding, medical decision-making for a demented patient can be construed as a temporally and socially extended practice. A collective decision-making body consisting of the patient, her family and surrogates, and the clinician, should make progressive decisions as a whole over years of the disease course. Finally, I will provide a practical example of how this proposal can be applied in clinical practice.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.038950,37,6,339-343,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Personal Autonomy and Mental Competency/*psychology and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology and Terminal Care/*ethics/psychology and Patient Rights/*ethics and Advance Directives/*ethics/psychology and Dementia/*complications/psychology/therapy,NA,NA,2011/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, specific ethical considerations should guide the recommendation of medical cannabis. In many cases, these ethical considerations are extensions of well-established principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, which indicate that providers should recommend cannabis only for conditions that have the strongest evidence base.

In this response, we argue that it is possible to discuss trust in medical artificial intelligence (AI), if one refrains from simply assuming that trust describes human-human interactions. To do so, we consider an account of trust that distinguishes trust from reliance in a way that is compatible with trusting non-human agents. In this account, to trust a medical AI is to rely on it with little monitoring and control of the elements that make it trustworthy. This attitude does not imply specific properties in the AI system that in fact only humans can have.

J. and Clarke, M.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Informed consent is an integral component of good medical practice. Many researchers have investigated measures to improve the quality of informed consent, but it is not clear which techniques work best and why. To address this problem, we propose developing a core outcome set (COS) to evaluate interventions designed to improve the consent process for surgery in adult patients with capacity. Part of this process involves reviewing existing research that has reported what is important to patients and doctors in the informed consent process. METHODS: This qualitative synthesis comprises four phases: identification of published papers and determining their relevance; appraisal of the quality of the papers; identification and summary of the key findings from each paper while determining the definitiveness of each finding against the primary data; comparison of key themes between papers such that findings are linked across studies. RESULTS: Searches of bibliographic databases returned 11,073 titles. Of these, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 1996 and 2016 and included a total of 367 patients and 74 health care providers. Thirteen studies collected data using in-depth interviews and constant comparison was the most common means of qualitative analysis. A total of 94 findings were extracted from the primary papers and divided into 17 categories and ultimately 6 synthesised findings related to: patient characteristics, knowledge, communication, the model patient, trust and decision making. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative meta-aggregation is the first to examine the issue of informed consent for surgery. It has revealed several outcomes deemed important to capture by patients and clinicians when evaluating the quality of a consent process. Some of these outcomes have not been examined previously in research comparing methods for informed consent.

Using medical assistance in dying as a case study, we suggest that what has been lacking in the discussion of conscientious objection thus far is a recognition and prioritising of the relational nature of ethical decision-making in healthcare and the negative consequences of moral distress that occur when healthcare professionals find themselves in situations in which they feel they cannot provide what they consider to be excellent care.

It is not easy to determine how forensic physicians take account of evidence-based data obtained from medical journals in their medical decision-making. The question of what is an ethically acceptable probability that adolescents are incorrectly considered to be over 18 has not been answered. METHODS: In a retrospective study over 1 year (2007), 498 files (for 141 female subjects and 357 male subjects) regarding age assessment requested by the public prosecutor's office for purposes of criminal or asylum proceedings were reviewed. Chronological age was estimated from a combination of physical examination, radiographic examination of the left hand and determination of dental status. RESULTS: Estimates of chronological age in 498 subjects claiming to be 9-14 years old were incompatible with the alleged age in 356 (71%) when made by the forensic physician but in only 17 (3%) when based on data from published studies on age estimation in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that in most cases the forensic physician ignores the adolescent's word.

L. and Stolk, R. P. and Otten, S.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Large-scale, centralized data repositories are playing a critical and unprecedented role in fostering innovative health research, leading to new opportunities as well as dilemmas for the medical sciences. Uncovering the reasons as to why citizens do or do not contribute to such repositories, for example, to population-based biobanks, is therefore crucial. We investigated and compared the views of existing participants and non-participants on contributing to large-scale, centralized health research data repositories with those of ex-participants regarding the decision to end their participation. This comparison could yield new insights into motives of participation and non-participation, in particular the behavioural change of withdrawal. METHODS: We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with ex-participants, participants, and non-participants of a three-generation, population-based biobank in the Netherlands. The interviews focused on the respondents' decision-making processes relating to their participation in a large-scale, centralized repository for health research data. RESULTS: The decision of participants and non-participants to contribute to the biobank was motivated by a desire to help others. Whereas participants perceived only benefits relating to their participation and were unconcerned about potential risks, non-participants and ex-participants raised concerns about the threat of large-scale, centralized public data repositories and public institutes, such as social exclusion or commercialization. Our analysis of ex-participants' perceptions suggests that intrapersonal characteristics, such as levels of trust in society, participation conceived as a social norm, and basic societal values account for differences between participants and non-participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the fluidity of motives centring on helping others in decisions to participate in large-scale, centralized health research data repositories. Efforts to improve participation should focus on enhancing the trustworthiness of such data repositories and developing layered strategies for communication with participants and with the public. Accordingly, personalized approaches for recruiting participants and transmitting information along with appropriate regulatory frameworks are required, which have important implications for current data management and informed consent procedures.",2020,10.1186/s12910-020-00504-3,21,1,62,eng,1472-6939,Participation and Humans and Trust and Informed Consent and Netherlands and *Biological Specimen Banks and *Motivation and Biobanks and Biomedical research and Motives and Non-participation and Risks,NA,NA,2020/07/25/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to underline this significance, Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress base the principles in the common morality, i.e. they claim that the principles represent basic moral values shared by all persons committed to morality and are thus grounded in human moral psychology. We empirically investigated the relationship of the principles to other moral and non-moral values that provide orientations in medicine. By way of comparison, we performed a similar analysis for the business & finance domain. METHODS: We evaluated the perceived degree of ""morality"" of 14 values relevant to medicine (n1 = 317, students and professionals) and 14 values relevant to business & finance (n2 = 247, students and professionals). Ratings were made along four dimensions intended to characterize different aspects of morality. RESULTS: We found that compared to other values, the principles-related values received lower ratings across several dimensions that characterize morality. By interpreting our finding using a clustering and a network analysis approach, we suggest that the principles can be understood as ""bridge values"" that are connected both to moral and non-moral aspects of ethical dilemmas in medicine. We also found that the social domain (medicine vs. business & finance) influences the degree of perceived morality of values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in conflict with the common morality hypothesis of Beauchamp and Childress, which would imply domain-independent high morality ratings of the principles. Our findings support the suggestions by other scholars that the principles of biomedical ethics serve primarily as instruments in deliberated justifications, but lack grounding in a universal ""common morality"". We propose that the specific manner in which the principles are taught and discussed in medicine - namely by referring to conflicts requiring a balancing of principles - may partly explain why the degree of perceived ""morality"" of the principles is lower compared to other moral values.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-47,15,NA,47,eng,1472-6939,Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Social Values and Guidelines as Topic and Personal Autonomy and Cluster Analysis and Social Justice and *Morals and *Social Responsibility and Ethical Analysis and *Bioethics and Ethical Theory and *Principle-Based Ethics and Beneficence,NA,NA,2014/06/17/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result, important decisions (affecting lifestyle, medical treatment and end of life) become the responsibility of someone else, as the surrogate decision-maker. This study investigated how surrogate decision-makers make important decisions on behalf of a person living with dementia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 family members who had formally or informally taken on the role of surrogate decision-maker. Thematic analysis of interviews was undertaken, which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes arising from the data. RESULTS: Analysis revealed three main themes associated with the process of surrogate decision-making in dementia: knowing the person's wishes; consulting with others and striking a balance. Most participants reported that there was not an advance care plan in place for the person living with dementia. Even when the prior wishes of the person with dementia were known, the process of decision-making was often fraught with complexity. DISCUSSION: Surrogate decision-making on behalf of a person living with dementia is often a difficult process. Advance care planning can play an important role in supporting this process.

Purposefully not defining futility, the law leaves its determination in specific cases to an institutional process. While the law has received several criticisms, it does seem to work constructively in the cases that come to the review process. We introduce a new criticism: While the law has been justified by an appeal to professional values such as avoiding harm to patients, avoiding the provision of unseemly care, and good stewardship of medical resources, it is applied incompletely. It allows physicians and institutional committees to refuse ""futile"" treatments desired by patients and families while at the same time providing no way of regulating physicians who recommend or even push ""futile"" treatments in similar cases.

METHODS: Practising physicians from various specialties involved in the care of dying patients in Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia received structured questionnaires on end-of-life care, which included questions about their life stance. Response rates ranged from 53% in Australia to 68% in Denmark. General attitudes, intended behaviour with respect to two hypothetical patients, and actual behaviour were compared between all large life-stance groups in each country. RESULTS: Only small differences in life stance were found in all countries in general attitudes and intended and actual behaviour with regard to various end-of-life decisions. However, with regard to the administration of drugs explicitly intended to hasten the patient's death (PAD), physicians with specific religious affiliations had significantly less accepting attitudes, and less willingness to perform it, than non-religious physicians. They had also actually performed PAD less often. However, in most countries, both Catholics (up to 15.7% in The Netherlands) and Protestants (up to 20.4% in The Netherlands) reported ever having made such a decision.

Patrone_2009_Joofmeet,JOUR,Disfigured anatomies and imperfect analogies: body integrity identity disorder and the supposed right to self-demanded amputation of healthy body parts,"Patrone, D.",Journal of medical ethics,"Patients with the controversial diagnosis of body integrity identity disorder (BIID) report an emotional discomfort with having a body part (usually a limb) that they feel should not be there. This discomfort is so strong that it interferes with routine functioning and, in a majority of cases, BIID patients are motivated to seek amputation of the limb. Although patient requests to receive the best available treatment are generally respected, BIID demands for amputation, at present, are not. However, what little has been said in the ethics literature on the subject tends to favour doing so in cases of BIID. The general argument is that BIID demands should be respected, first, because of the importance that is already placed on respecting autonomy in medical decision-making contexts and second, because of the potential harm of not providing amputation coupled with the fact that no alternative means of relieving suffering exists. The defence of the right to self-demanded amputation is thus typically supported by the use of analogies with other unproblematical cases in order to show that the denial of BIID patient demands is inconsistent with conventional medical norms and practices. This paper criticises the appropriateness of the particular analogies that are thought to shed light on the allegedly unproblematical nature of BIID demands and argues that a proper understanding of the respect for autonomy in the medical decision-making context prohibits agreeing to BIID demands for amputation.",2009,10.1136/jme.2009.029256,35,9,541-545,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Patient Rights and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Elective Surgical Procedures/*ethics/psychology and Refusal to Treat/*ethics and Amputation/*ethics/psychology and Amputees/*psychology and Body Dysmorphic Disorders/*psychology,NA,NA,2009/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Killackey_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Advance care planning with chronically ill patients: A relational autonomy approach,"Killackey, Tieghan and Peter, Elizabeth and Maciver, Jane and Mohammed, Shan",Nursing ethics,"Advance care planning is a process that encourages people to identify their values, to reflect upon the meanings and consequences of serious illness, to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, and to discuss these goals with family and health-care providers. Advance care planning is especially important for those who are chronically ill, as patients and their families face a variety of complex healthcare decisions. Participating in advance care planning has been associated with improved outcomes; yet, despite over 25 years of public awareness campaigns, research, and interventions developed to increase participation, advance care planning completion rates for people with chronic illnesses are no different than those in the general public (approximately 25%). Advance care planning has traditionally used an individualistic approach to autonomy, which puts forward an understanding of agents as independent, rational and self-interested persons. Because this individualistic approach has been largely unsuccessful in improving advance care planning uptake, a re-examination of the philosophical underpinnings of this practice and an exploration of alternative frameworks is warranted. In offering this exploration, we briefly outline two current perspectives on autonomy: the individualistic view and the relational view as articulated by feminist philosophers. Using a critical examination of the theoretical and empirical work on this topic, we argue that the individualistic view of autonomy does not sufficiently capture the relational and social complexities of the decision-making process of advance care planning. To offer a counterpoint, we examine the relational view of autonomy and suggest that this perspective is better aligned with the process of advance care planning. Specifically, we demonstrate that a relational model of autonomy is well suited to exploring advance care planning for four main reasons: (1) it recognizes the importance of relationships, (2) it reflects the fluctuating nature of autonomy in chronic illness, (3) it recognizes vulnerability, and (4) it is consonant with empirical work examining the advance care planning process.",2020,10.1177/0969733019848031,27,2,360-371,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,decision-making and Humans and chronic disease and autonomy and Chronic Disease/*psychology and Patients/*psychology and Advance care planning and end-of-life care and *Relational Autonomy and Advance Care Planning/*trends and relational autonomy,NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ethical triage decisions are commonly based on the utilitarian approach of maximising total benefits and life expectancy.

Nevertheless, the complexity of processes and physical phenomena, time as well as economic constraints and not least further endeavours as well as achievements in medicine and healthcare continuously raise the need to evaluate and to improve clinical decision-making. This article scrutinises if and how clinical decision-making processes are challenged by the rise of so-called artificial intelligence-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS). In a first step, this article analyses how the rise of AI-DSS will affect and transform the modes of interaction between different agents in the clinic. In a second step, we point out how these changing modes of interaction also imply shifts in the conditions of trustworthiness, epistemic challenges regarding transparency, the underlying normative concepts of agency and its embedding into concrete contexts of deployment and, finally, the consequences for (possible) ascriptions of responsibility.

This study compares ethnicity and religious faith in the medical and general UK populations, and reports on their associations with ethically controversial decisions taken when providing care to dying patients. METHOD: A postal survey of 3733 UK medical practitioners, of whom 2923 reported on the care of their last patient who died. FINDINGS: Specialists in care of the elderly were somewhat more likely to be Hindu or Muslim than other doctors; palliative care specialists were somewhat more likely to be Christian, religious and 'white' than others. Ethnicity was largely unrelated to rates of reporting ethically controversial decisions. Independently of speciality, doctors who described themselves as non-religious were more likely than others to report having given continuous deep sedation until death, having taken decisions they expected or partly intended to end life, and to have discussed these decisions with patients judged to have the capacity to participate in discussions. Speciality was independently related to wide variations in the reporting of decisions taken with some intent to end life, with doctors in 'other hospital' specialities being almost 10 times as likely to report this when compared with palliative medicine specialists, regardless of religious faith.

Teaching moral reasoning to students is necessary toward promoting nursing ethics. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of problem-based learning and lecture-based methods in ethics education in improving (1) moral decision-making, (2) moral reasoning, (3) moral development, and (4) practical reasoning among nursing students. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a repeated measurement quasi-experimental study. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: The participants were nursing students in a University of Medical Sciences in west of Iran who were randomly assigned to the lecture-based (n = 33) or the problem-based learning (n = 33) groups. The subjects were provided nursing ethics education in four 2-h sessions. The educational content was similar, but the training methods were different. The subjects completed the Nursing Dilemma Test before, immediately after, and 1 month after the training. The data were analyzed and compared using the SPSS-16 software. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The program was explained to the students, all of whom signed an informed consent form at the baseline. FINDINGS: The two groups were similar in personal characteristics (p > 0.05).

Although the mean scores on moral reasoning improved in both the problem-based learning and the lecture-based groups immediately after the training and 1 month later, the change was significant only in the problem-based learning group (p < 0.05). The mean scores on moral decision-making, practical considerations, and familiarity with dilemmas were relatively similar for the two groups.

This SPRINT Data Analysis Challenge created a novel environment for using open data as data became open early. This allowed third-party researchers the opportunity to assess some of the trial's outcomes before trialists. Could this infringe on trialists' right to analyse their data?

Failure of recent data sharing initiatives indicates an urgent need to invest in societal trust in researchers and institutions. Key to an informed understanding of such a 'social license' is identifying the views patients and the public may hold with regard to data sharing for health research. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of the empirical evidence addressing patients' and public views and attitudes towards the use of health data for research purposes. The literature databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in April 2019 to identify relevant publications. Patients' and public attitudes were extracted from selected references and thematically categorised. RESULTS: Twenty-seven papers were included for review, including both qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic reviews. Results suggest widespread-though conditional-support among patients and the public for data sharing for health research. Despite the fact that participants recognise actual or potential benefits of data research, they expressed concerns about breaches of confidentiality and potential abuses of the data. Studies showed agreement on the following conditions: value, privacy, risk minimisation, data security, transparency, control, information, trust, responsibility and accountability.

Lofmark_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,"From cure to palliation: concept, decision and acceptance","Lofmark, R. and Nilstun, T. and Bolmsjo, I. Agren",Journal of medical ethics,"The aim of this paper is to present and discuss nurses' and physicians' comments in a questionnaire relating to patients' transition from curative treatment to palliative care. The four-page questionnaire relating to experiences of and attitudes towards communication, decision-making, documentation and responsibility of nurses and physicians and towards the competence of patients was developed and sent to a random sample of 1672 nurses and physicians of 10 specialties. The response rate was 52% (n = 844), and over one-third made comments. The respondents differed in their comments about three areas: the concept of palliative care, experiences of unclear decision-making and difficulties in acceptance of the patient's situation. The responses are analysed in terms of four ethical theories: virtue ethics, deontology, consequentialism and casuistry. Many virtues considered to be appropriate for healthcare personnel to possess were invoked. Compassion, honesty, justice and prudence are especially important. However, principles of medical ethics, such as the deontological principle of respect for self-determination and the consequence of avoidance of harm, are also implied. Casuistry may be particularly helpful in analysing certain areas of difficulty-namely, what is meant by ""palliative care"", decision-making and accepting the patient's situation. Keeping a patient in a state of uncertainty often causes more suffering than necessary. Communication among the staff and with patients must be explicit.

Arora_2016_BMCmedeth,JOUR,The Intensive Care Lifeboat: a survey of lay attitudes to rationing dilemmas in neonatal intensive care,"Arora, C. and Savulescu, J. and Maslen, H. and Selgelid, M. and Wilkinson, D.",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Resuscitation and treatment of critically ill newborn infants is associated with relatively high mortality, morbidity and cost. Guidelines relating to resuscitation have traditionally focused on the best interests of infants. There are, however, limited resources available in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), meaning that difficult decisions sometimes need to be made. This study explores the intuitions of lay people (non-health professionals) regarding resource allocation decisions in the NICU. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional quantitative survey, consisting of 20 hypothetical rationing scenarios. There were 119 respondents who entered the questionnaire, and 109 who completed it. The respondents were adult US and Indian participants of the online crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk. Respondents were asked to decide which of two infants to treat in a situation of scarce resources. Demographic characteristics, personality traits and political views were recorded. Respondents were also asked to respond to a widely cited thought experiment involving rationing. RESULTS: The majority of respondents, in all except one scenario, chose the utilitarian option of directing treatment to the infant with the higher chance of survival, higher life expectancy, less severe disability, and less expensive treatment. As discrepancy between outcomes decreased, however, there was a statistically significant increase in egalitarian responses and decrease in utilitarian responses in scenarios involving chance of survival (P = 0.001), life expectancy (P = 0.0001), and cost of treatment (P = 0.01). In the classic 'lifeboat' scenario, all but two respondents were utilitarian. CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that in situations of scarcity and equal clinical need, non-health professionals support rationing of life-saving treatment based on probability of survival, duration of survival, cost of treatment or quality of life. However, where the difference in prognosis or cost is very small, non-health professionals preferred to give infants an equal chance of receiving treatment.",2016,10.1186/s12910-016-0152-y,17,1,69,eng,1472-6939,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Infant and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Resource allocation and India and Questionnaires and Quality of Life and Thinking and *Attitude to Health and Intensive care units and Medical ethics and Decision Making/*ethics and *Health Resources and Resuscitation and Health Care Rationing/*ethics and *Resuscitation and Intensive Care, Neonatal/*ethics and Neonatal and Newborn",NA,NA,2016/11/08/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goals of the authors were to elucidate how clinicians define futility, when they perceive life-sustaining treatment (LST) to be futile, how they communicate this situation and why LST is sometimes continued despite being recognised as futile. METHODS: The authors reviewed ethics case consultation protocols and conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 physicians and 11 nurses from adult intensive and palliative care units at a tertiary hospital in Germany. The transcripts were subjected to qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Futility was identified in the majority of case consultations. Interviewees associated futility with the failure to achieve goals of care that offer a benefit to the patient's quality of life and are proportionate to the risks, harms and costs. Prototypic examples mentioned are situations of irreversible dependence on LST, advanced metastatic malignancies and extensive brain injury. Participants agreed that futility should be assessed by physicians after consultation with the care team. Intensivists favoured an indirect and stepwise disclosure of the prognosis. Palliative care clinicians focused on a candid and empathetic information strategy. The reasons for continuing futile LST are primarily emotional, such as guilt, grief, fear of legal consequences and concerns about the family's reaction. Other obstacles are organisational routines, insufficient legal and palliative knowledge and treatment requests by patients or families. CONCLUSION: Managing futility could be improved by communication training, knowledge transfer, organisational improvements and emotional and ethical support systems.

Little is known about how campaigners appeal to potential donors outside of anecdotal evidence collected in news reports on specific medical crowdfunding campaigns. This paper offers a first step towards addressing this knowledge gap by examining medical crowdfunding campaigns for Canadian recipients. Using 80 medical crowdfunding campaigns for Canadian recipients, we analyse how Canadians justify to others that they ought to contribute to funding their health needs. We find the justifications campaigners tend to fall into three themes: personal connections, depth of need and giving back. We further discuss how these appeals can understood in terms of ethical justifications for giving and how these justifications should be assessed in light of the academic literature on ethical concerns raised by medical crowdfunding.",2017,10.1136/medethics-2016-103933,43,6,364-367,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Decision-making and Humans and Canada and Biomedical Research/*economics and Resource Allocation and Allocation of Health Care Resources and Crowdsourcing/*ethics and Health Care Costs/*ethics and Healthcare Financing/*ethics and Research Support as Topic/ethics and Social Aspects,NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Health care personnel, however, widely perceive moral differences between withholding and withdrawing. The proponents of equivalence argue that any perceived difference can be explained in terms of cognitive biases and flawed reasoning. Thus, policymakers should clear away any resistance to accept the equivalence stance by moral education. To embark on such a campaign of changing attitudes, we need to be convinced that the ethical analysis is correct. Is it? In this article, I take a closer look at the moral relation between withholding and withdrawing. My conclusion is that withholding and withdrawing are not in general ethically equivalent. Thus, medical guidelines should be rewritten, and rather than being ""educated"" away from their sound judgments, medical professionals and patients should have nuanced medico-ethical discussions regarding withholding and withdrawing treatment.",2019,10.1080/15265161.2018.1561961,19,3,10-20,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,Humans and decision making and Morals and Health Personnel and *Life Support Care and Ethical Analysis and *Withholding Treatment and moral theory and professional ethics,NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Agozzino_2019_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Does written informed consent adequately inform surgical patients? A cross sectional study,"Agozzino, Erminia and Borrelli, Sharon and Cancellieri, Mariagrazia and Carfora, Fabiola Michela and Di Lorenzo, Teresa and Attena, Francesco",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Informed consent (IC) is an essential step in helping patients be aware of consequences of their treatment decisions. With surgery, it is vitally important for patients to understand the risks and benefits of the procedure and decide accordingly. We explored whether a written IC form was provided to patients; whether they read and signed it; whether they communicated orally with the physician; whether these communications influenced patient decisions. METHODS: Adult postsurgical patients in nine general hospitals of Italy's Campania Region were interviewed via a structured questionnaire between the second and seventh day after the surgery at the end of the first surgical follow up visit. Physicians who were independent from the surgical team administered the questionnaire. RESULTS: The written IC form was given to 84.5% of those interviewed. All recipients of the form signed it, either personally or through a delegate; however, 13.9% did not know/remember having done so; 51.8% said that they read it thoroughly. Of those who reported to have read it, 90.9% judged it to be clear. Of those receiving the written consent form, 52.0% had gotten it the day before the surgery at the earliest 41.1% received it some hours or immediately before the procedure. The written IC form was explained to 65.6% of the patients, and 93.9% of them received further oral information that deemed understandable. Most attention was given to the diagnosis and the type of surgical procedure, which was communicated respectively to 92.8 and 88.2% of the patients. Almost one in two patients believed that the information provided some emotional relief, while 23.2% experienced increased anxiety. Younger patients (age <e2><89><a4> 60) and patients with higher levels of education were more likely to read the written IC form. CONCLUSIONS: The written IC form is not sufficient in assuring patients and making them fully aware of choices they made for their health; pre-operative information that was delivered orally better served the patients' needs. To improve the quality of communication we suggest enhancing physicians' communication skills and for them to use structured conversation to ensure that individuals are completely informed before undergoing their procedures.",2019,10.1186/s12910-018-0340-z,20,1,1,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Surgery and Surveys and Questionnaires and Hospital and Patient Education as Topic and Follow-Up Studies and Italy and *Comprehension and Informed consent and Medical ethics and Decision Making/*ethics and Italy/epidemiology and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and *Hospitals, General and Informed Consent/*ethics/*psychology",NA,NA,2019/01/07/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Parker_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Junior doctors and moral exploitation,"Parker, Joshua",Journal of medical ethics,"In this paper I argue that junior doctors are morally exploited. Moral exploitation occurs where an individual's vulnerability is used to compel them to take on additional moral burdens. These might include additional moral responsibility, making weighty moral decisions and shouldering the consequent emotions. Key to the concept of exploitation is vulnerability and here I build on Rosalind McDougall's work on the key roles of junior doctors to show how these leave them open to moral exploitation by restricting their reasonable options. I argue that there are a number of ways junior doctors are morally exploited. First, their seniors can leverage their position to force a junior to take on some discreet decision. More common is the second type of moral exploitation where rota gaps and staffing issues means junior doctors take on more than their fair share of the moral burdens of practice. Third, I discuss structural moral exploitation where the system offloads moral burdens onto healthcare professionals. Not every instance of exploitation is wrongful and so I conclude by exploring the ways that moral exploitation wrongs junior doctors.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105311,45,9,571-574,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and ethics and Ethics, Medical and Clinical Decision-Making and Personnel Staffing and Scheduling and *Morals and health workforce and clinical ethics and applied and professional ethics and general medicine / internal medicine and Medical Staff, Hospital/ethics/*psychology and Physician's Role/psychology",NA,NA,2019/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

I draw on Peter Breggin's early critique of coercion of informal patients to supply an updated discussion of the ethical issues raised. Central questions are whether the admission was coercive, and if so, whether unethical. Whether or not involuntary admission would be justified, moral discomfort surrounds its appearance as a threat. This arises in part from ambivalence about autonomy: although a 'choice' is made, the threat of detention impinges on the patient's choice. Recent legal developments provide some experience of safeguarding those whose consent is not obtained. This highlights the lack of safeguards in this 'gap' and suggests that we have the tools with which to begin to deal with the problem.",2012,10.1136/medethics-2011-100187,38,5,281-285,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Decision Making and United Kingdom and Informed Consent and *Patient Admission and Hospital Units and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and *Choice Behavior and *Mental Competency and *Patient Rights/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Coercion and *Commitment of Mentally Ill/legislation & jurisprudence and *Mentally Ill Persons/psychology and Legislation, Medical/ethics/standards/trends and Patient Discharge/legislation & jurisprudence and Psychiatry/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and Schizophrenia/therapy",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hermann_2015_Joofmeet,JOUR,Physicians' personal values in determining medical decision-making capacity: a survey study,"Hermann, Helena and Trachsel, Manuel and Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Journal of medical ethics,"Decision-making capacity (DMC) evaluations are complex clinical judgements with important ethical implications for patients' self-determination. They are achieved not only on descriptive grounds but are inherently normative and, therefore, dependent on the values held by those involved in the DMC evaluation. To date, the issue of whether and how physicians' personal values relate to DMC evaluation has never been empirically investigated. The present survey study aimed to investigate this question by exploring the relationship between physicians' value profiles and the use of risk-relative standards in capacity evaluations. The findings indicate that physicians' personal values are of some significance in this regard. Those physicians with relatively high scores on the value types of achievement, power-resource, face and conformity to interpersonal standards were more likely to apply risk-relative criteria in a range of situations, using more stringent assessment standards when interventions were riskier. By contrast, those physicians who strongly emphasise hedonism, conformity to rules and universalism concern were more likely to apply equal standards regardless of the consequences of a decision. Furthermore, it has been shown that around a quarter of all respondents do not appreciate that their values impact on their DMC evaluations, highlighting a need to better sensitise physicians in this regard. The implications of these findings are discussed, especially in terms of the moral status of the potential and almost unavoidable influence of physicians' values.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2014-102263,41,9,739-744,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Ethics and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Paternalism and Health Care Surveys and Informed Consent and *Decision Making and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Judgment and *Clinical Decision-Making and *Personal Autonomy and Capacity and *Physicians/psychology and Autonomy,NA,NA,2015/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The history of the parliamentary process of this law is described, the present regulations are explained, their relevance for medical practice discussed and shortcomings are identified. Finally, the new law is compared with other regulations in the international context. Previously established legal practice in Germany has now become largely confirmed by the new law: An advanced directive must be respected in any decision concerning medical treatment, regardless of the stage of the illness. It can be informally revoked at any time, even with limited decision-making capacity. Nobody may be obliged to issue a directive in any way. Advance directives do not need notarisation or routine updating after certain time intervals. Provided that the patient, who is no longer mentally competent, has issued a lasting power of attorney (Bevollmachtiger), or provided that the patient has been appointed a healthcare proxy by the courts (Betreuer), this authorized surrogate must assert the patient's will. The role of the guardianship court is clarified: it only needs to be involved in cases of disagreement as to the patient's will.

Investigating nudge's neglected cousin,"Miyata-Sturm, Ainar",Journal of medical ethics,"The realm of non-rational influence, which includes nudging, is home to many other morally interesting phenomena. In this paper, I introduce the term bumping, to discuss the category of unintentional non-rational influence. Bumping happens constantly, wherever people make choices in environments where they are affected by other people. For instance, doctors will often bump their patients as patients make choices about what treatments to pursue. In some cases, these bumps will systematically tend to make patients' decisions worse. Put another way: doctors will sometimes harm their patients by bumping them in systematic (although still unintentional) ways. I use the case of medical overuse, the provision of medical services where the likely harm outweighs the likely benefit to the patient, as a touchstone for arguing that doctors who systematically bump their patients towards harm can be blameworthy for their unwitting influence.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105179,45,4,257-264,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"decision-making and Humans and Risk Assessment and autonomy and Morals and Attitude of Health Personnel and Persuasive Communication and Professional Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Dissent and Disputes and clinical ethics and Moral Obligations and Physicians/*ethics and informed consent and applied and professional ethics",NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

They also addressed the lack of communication with the patient, the absence of oral confirmation of the wish to die and the fact that the euthanasia was performed without the patient being aware of this. However, the doctor was acquitted by the criminal court as the court found she had in fact met all due care criteria laid down in the act. We then describe what this judgement means for euthanasia in the Netherlands.

Green_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Can animal data translate to innovations necessary for a new era of patient-centred and individualised healthcare? Bias in preclinical animal research,"Green, Susan Bridgwood",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The public and healthcare workers have a high expectation of animal research which they perceive as necessary to predict the safety and efficacy of drugs before testing in clinical trials. However, the expectation is not always realised and there is evidence that the research often fails to stand up to scientific scrutiny and its 'predictive value' is either weak or absent. DISCUSSION: Problems with the use of animals as models of humans arise from a variety of biases and systemic failures including: 1) bias and poor practice in research methodology and data analysis; 2) lack of transparency in scientific assessment and regulation of the research; 3) long-term denial of weaknesses in cross-species translation; 4) profit-driven motives overriding patient interests; 5) lack of accountability of expenditure on animal research; 6) reductionist-materialism in science which tends to dictate scientific inquiry and control the direction of funding in biomedical research. Bias in animal research needs to be addressed before medical research and healthcare decision-making can be more evidence-based. Research funding may be misdirected on studying 'disease mechanisms' in animals that cannot be replicated outside tightly controlled laboratory conditions, and without sufficient critical evaluation animal research may divert attention away from avenues of research that hold promise for human health. The potential for harm to patients and trial volunteers from reliance on biased animal data(1) requires measures to improve its conduct, regulation and analysis. This article draws attention to a few of the many forms of bias in animal research that have come to light in the last decade and offers a strategy incorporating ten recommendations stated at the end of each section on bias.

I propose two criteria for assessing the conceptions and maintain that, in light of the criteria, the latter is more plausible than the former.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2016-103487,42,9,601-604,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Death and Physician-Patient Relations and Patient Advocacy and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and End-of-life and Autonomy and *Value of Life and Euthanasia and Advance Directives/*ethics and *Medical Futility/ethics and *Suicide, Assisted/ethics and Right to Die/ethics",NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Althagafi_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Canadian neurosurgeons' views on medical assistance in dying (MAID): a cross-sectional survey of Canadian Neurosurgical Society (CNSS) members,"Althagafi, Alwalaa and Ekong, Chris and Wheelock, Brian W. and Moulton, Richard and Gorman, Peter and Reddy, Kesh and Christie, Sean and Fleetwood, Ian and Barry, Sean",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The Supreme Court of Canada removed the prohibition on physicians assisting in patients dying on 6 February 2015. Bill C-14, legalising medical assistance in dying (MAID) in Canada, was subsequently passed by the House of Commons and the Senate on 17 June 2016. As this remains a divisive issue for physicians, the Canadian Neurosurgical Society (CNSS) has recently published a position statement on MAID. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand the views and perceptions among CNSS members regarding MAID to inform its position statement on the issue. Data was collected from May to June 2016. RESULTS: Of the 300 active membes of the CNSS who recevied the survey, 89 respondents completed the survey, 71% of whom were attending neurosurgeons and 29% were neurosurgery residents. Most respondents,74.2%, supported the right of physicians to participate in MAID with 7.8% opposing. 37% had current patients in their practice fitting the criteria for MAID. 23.6% had been asked by patients to assist with MAID, but only 11% would consider personally providing it. 84% of neurosurgeons surveyed supported the physicians' right to conscientious objection to MAID while 21% thought attending surgeons should be removed from the inquiry and decision-making process. 43.8% agreed that the requirment to refer a patient to a MAID service should be mandatory. Glioblastoma multiforme (65%), quadriplegia/quadriparesis secondary to spinal tumour/trauma (54%) and Parkinson's disease (24%) were the most common suggested potential indications for MAID among the neurosurgical population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that most neurosurgeons in Canada are generally supportive of MAID in select patients. However, they also strongly support the physicians' right to conscientious objection.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105160,45,5,309-313,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Cross-Sectional Studies and Canada and Attitude of Health Personnel and Societies, Medical and Personal Autonomy and Professional Role and euthanasia and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and end-of-life and conscientious objection and neuroethics and Neurosurgeons/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and suicide/assisted suicide and Terminally Ill/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2019/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In CECs that involve actual ethical conflict, this view of a consult's endpoint runs the risk of overemphasizing the conflict's resolution at the expense of the consult's process, which can have deleterious effects on the various parties in the conflict. This overly narrow focus on reaching a decision or recommendation in consults that involve profound moral disagreement can result in two types of adverse, lingering sequelae: moral distress or negative moral emotions. The problem, succinctly named, is that such consults have insufficient ""closure"" for patients, families, and providers. To promote closure, and avoid the ills of moral distress and the moral emotions, I argue that CECs need to prioritize assisted conversation between the different stakeholders in these conflicts, what is often referred to as ""bioethics mediation.""",2015,10.1080/15265161.2014.974770,15,1,29-36,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,"Humans and Ethics, Medical and *Morals and Decision Making/*ethics and ethics committees and Ethicists and *Problem Solving and moral theory and *Negotiating and Ethics Committees, Clinical and Ethics Consultation/*ethics",NA,NA,2015///,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Under the current legal framework, this depends on whether the best interests test could be satisfied. It might be argued that, because the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (UK) (and the common law) makes it clear that the best interests test is not confined to the patient's clinical interests, but extends to include the individual's own values, wishes and beliefs, the proposal will be in the patient's best interests. We reject this claim. We argue that, as things currently stand, the proposal could not lawfully be justified as a blanket proposition by reference to the best interests test. Accordingly, a modification of the law would be necessary to render the proposal lawful. We conclude with a suggestion about how that could be achieved.",2013,10.1136/medethics-2012-100991,39,3,135-138,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Decision Making and United Kingdom and *Respiration, Artificial and Mental Competency/*legislation & jurisprudence and *Medical Futility and *Brain Death and Legislation, Medical/standards/*trends and Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution",NA,NA,2013/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to design a multisource informed consent procedure that is easily adaptable to both clinical and research applications, and to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of understanding and awareness, even in less educated patients. METHODS: We designed a multisource informed consent procedure for patients' enrolment in a Cancer Institute Biobank (CRO-Biobank). From October 2009 to July 2011, a total of 550 cancer patients admitted to the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS Aviano, who agreed to contribute to its biobank, were consecutively enrolled. Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire aim at exploring their understanding of biobanks and their needs for information on this topic, before and after study participation. Chi-square tests were performed on the questionnaire answers, according to gender or education. RESULTS: Of the 430 patients who returned the questionnaire, only 36.5% knew what a biobank was before participating in the study. Patients with less formal education were less informed by some sources (the Internet, newspapers, magazines, and our Institute). The final assessment test, taken after the multisource informed consent procedure, showed more than 95% correct answers. The information received was judged to be very or fairly understandable in almost all cases. More than 95% of patients were aware of participating in a biobank project, and gave helping cancer research (67.5%), moral obligation, and supporting cancer care as main reasons for their involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our multisource informed consent information system allowed a high rate of understanding and awareness of study participation, even among less-educated participants, and could be an effective and easy-to-apply model for others to consider to contribute to a well-informed decision making process in several fields, from clinical practice to research.Further studies are needed to explore the effects on the study comprehension by each source of information, and by other sources suggested by participants in the questionnaire.",2013,10.1186/1472-6939-14-30,14,NA,30,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Research Design and Multimedia and *Research Subjects and Patients/*psychology and *Comprehension and Biological Specimen Banks and Awareness and *Neoplasms and *Informed Consent/ethics/psychology/standards and Biomedical Research/*ethics/standards and *Tissue Banks/ethics/standards and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*ethics/standards",NA,NA,2013/07/30/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Haahr_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Nurses experiences of ethical dilemmas: A review,"Haahr, Anita and Norlyk, Annelise and Martinsen, Bente and Dreyer, Pia",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Nursing care is rapidly evolving due to the advanced technological and medical development, and also due to an increased focus on standardization and the logic of production, permeating today's hospital cultures. Nursing is rooted in a holistic approach with an ethical obligation to maintain and respect the individual's dignity and integrity. However, working within time limits and heavy workload leads to burnout and ethical insensitivity among nurses, and may challenge nurses' options to act on the basis of ethical and moral grounds in the individual care situation. AIM: The aim of this study is to describe and discuss ethical dilemmas described and experienced by nurses in clinical practice today. METHOD: The study was performed as a literature review following the matrix method allowing to synthesize literature across methodological approaches. A literature search was performed, including relevant studies published between 2011 and 2016. A total of 15 articles were included and analyzed focusing on their description of ethical dilemmas. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: We have considered and respected ethical conduct when performing a literature review, respecting authorship and referencing sources. RESULTS: The analysis revealed three themes, relating to important aspects of nursing practice, such as the nurse-patient relationship, organizational structures, and collaboration with colleagues. The findings are summarized in the following three themes: (1) balancing harm and care, (2) work overload affecting quality, and (3) navigating in disagreement. Ethically difficult situations are evident across settings and in very diverse environments from neonatal care to caring for the older people. Organizational structures and being caught in-between professional values, standardization, and busyness was evident, revealing the complexity of nursing practice and the diversity of ethical dilemmas, concerns, and distress experienced by clinical nurses.

We studied the attitudes of the Dutch population to assistance in dying for older persons who have a wish to die without the presence of a serious medical condition. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a random sample of the Dutch public (response rate 78%, n=1960), using statements and vignettes about attitudes to assistance in dying for older persons who are tired of living. RESULTS: A minority of 26% agreed with a vignette in which a physician warrants the request for physician-assisted suicide of an older person who is tired of living without having a serious medical condition. Furthermore, 21% agreed with the statement 'In my opinion euthanasia should be allowed for persons who are tired of living without having a serious disease'. People supporting euthanasia for older persons who are tired of living were more likely than opponents to be highly educated (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3), to be non-religious (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3), to have little trust in physicians (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.2), and to prefer to make their own healthcare decisions (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3). CONCLUSIONS: Although it is lower than the level of support for assistance in dying for patients whose suffering is rooted in a serious medical condition, our finding that a substantial minority of the general public supports physician assistance in dying for older people who are tired of living implies that this topic may need to be taken seriously in the debate about end-of-life decision-making.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2012-101304,41,2,145-150,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Young Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Aged and Decision Making and Physician-Patient Relations and Educational Status and Netherlands and Patients/*psychology and Euthanasia and Attitudes Toward Death and Elderly and Terminally Ill and End of Life Care and Euthanasia/*ethics/*psychology,NA,NA,2015/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

According to a recent report of the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights, article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) presents a wholesale rejection of the competence model. The High Commissioner here adopts the interpretation of article 12 proposed by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. On this interpretation, CRPD article 12 renders it impermissible to deny persons with mental disabilities the right to make treatment decisions on the basis of impaired decision-making capacity and demands the replacement of all regimes of substitute decision-making by supported decision-making.

Akpinar_2014_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Attitudes of physicians and patients towards disclosure of genetic information to spouse and first-degree relatives: a case study from Turkey,"Akpinar, Aslihan and Ersoy, Nermin",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: When considering the principle of medical confidentiality, disclosure of genetic information constitutes a special case because of the impact that this information can have on the health and the lives of relatives. The aim of this study is to explore the attitudes of Turkish physicians and patients about sharing information obtained from genetic tests. METHODS: The study was carried out in Kocaeli, Turkey. Participants were either paediatricians and gynaecologists registered in Kocaeli, or patients coming to the genetic diagnosis centre for karyotype analysis in 2008. A self-administered paper questionnaire was given to the physicians, and face-to-face structured interviews were conducted with patients. We used a case study involving a man who was found to be a balanced chromosome carrier as a result of a test conducted after his first baby was born with Down's syndrome. However, he refused to share this information with his wife or his siblings. Percentages of characteristics and preferences of the participants were calculated, and the results were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: A total of 155 physicians (68% response rate) and 104 patients (46% response rate) were participated in the study. Twenty-six percent of physicians and 49% of patients believed that genetic information belongs to the whole family. When participants were asked with whom genetic information should be shared for the case study, most of the physicians and patients thought the physician should inform the spouse (79%, 85%, respectively). They were less likely to support a physician informing a sibling (41%, 53%, respectively); whereas, many thought the testee has an obligation to inform siblings (70%, 94%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although Turkey's national regulations certainly protect the right of privacy of the testee, the participants in our study appear to believe that informing the spouse, who is not personally at risk of serious damage, is the physician's responsibility, while informing siblings, is the testee's responsibility. Therefore we believe that opening ethical discussions with clinicians about the sharing of genetic information, establishing guidelines for practice and sharing these guidelines and the reasons behind them with the wider population, will help to pre-empt ethical dilemmas.",2014,10.1186/1472-6939-15-39,15,NA,39,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Case-Control Studies and Attitude and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Confidentiality and Turkey and Family Relations and Human Rights and Personal Autonomy and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Information Dissemination/ethics and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Moral Obligations and *Spouses and Truth Disclosure/*ethics and *Duty to Warn/ethics and *Genetic Testing/ethics and Genetic Counseling/*ethics",NA,NA,2014/05/16/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

I use the example of Japanese physicians' non-disclosures of cancer diagnoses directly to patients, arguing that the concept of maternalism better captures these actions. To act paternalistically is to substitute one's own judgement for that of another person and decide in place of that person for his/her best interest. By contrast, to act maternalistically is to decide for another person based on a reasonable understanding of that person's own preferences. The concept of maternalism allows for a more thorough assessment of the moral justification of these types of actions.

Central to these is the extent to which precedent autonomous decisions should be respected in the absence of a legally binding advance decision. Well-being interests can survive the loss of many of the psychological faculties that support personhood. A decision to respect precedent autonomy can contradict the well-being interests of the individual after capacity is lost. These decisions raise difficult questions about personal identity and about the threshold of evidence that is required of an earlier decision in order for it to be respected.,2013,10.1136/medethics-2012-100663,39,9,547-550,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"mental health and Humans and Female and Adult and Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and Medical ethics and decision-making capacity and Personhood and *Persistent Vegetative State and mental capacity and Mental Competency/legislation & jurisprudence and Advance Directives/*legislation & jurisprudence and Life Support Systems/*ethics and mental health legislation",NA,NA,2013/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This problem can be formulated in the following way. On the one hand, emotions (fear, pity and so on) can alter our sense of discrimination and lead us to make our wrong decisions. On the other hand, it is known that lack of sensitivity can alter our judgment and lead us to sacrifice basic ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Only emotions can turn a decision into an ethical one, but they can also turn it into an unreasonable one. To avoid this contradiction, suggest integrating emotions with the decisional factors of the process of ""retrospective thinking"". During this thinking, doctors usually try to identify the nature and impact of feelings on the decision they have just made. In this retrospective moment of analysis of the decision, doctors also question themselves on the feelings they did not experience.

Schmitz_2012_Joofmeet,JOUR,Terminating pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis--with a little help of professional ethics?,"Schmitz, Dagmar",Journal of medical ethics,"Termination of pregnancy after a certain gestational age and following prenatal diagnosis, in many nations seem to be granted with a special status to the extent that they by law have to be discussed within a predominantly medical context and have physicians as third parties involved in the decision-making process ('indication-based' approach). The existing legal frameworks for indication-based approaches, however, do frequently fail to provide clear guidance for the involved physicians. Critics, therefore, asked for professional ethics and professional institutions in order to provide normative guidance for the physicians in termination of pregnancy on medical grounds. After outlining the clinical pathway in an indication-based approach and the involved types of (clinical) judgements, this paper draws upon different understandings of professional ethics in order to explore their potential to provide normative guidance in termination of pregnancy on medical grounds. The analysis reveals that professional ethics will not suffice-neither as a set of established norms nor as internal morality-in order to determine the normative framework of indication-based approaches on termination of pregnancy. In addition, there seem to be considerable inconsistencies regarding the target and outcome between prenatal testing on the one hand and following termination of pregnancy on the other hand.

Dressler_2018_Joofmeet,JOUR,Ethical implications of medical crowdfunding: the case of Charlie Gard,"Dressler, Gabrielle and Kelly, Sarah A.",Journal of medical ethics,"Patients are increasingly turning to medical crowdfunding as a way to cover their healthcare costs. In the case of Charlie Gard, an infant born with encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, crowdfunding was used to finance experimental nucleoside therapy. Although this treatment was not provided in the end, we will argue that the success of the Gard family's crowdfunding campaign reveals a number of potential ethical concerns. First, this case shows that crowdfunding can change the way in which communal healthcare resources are allocated. Second, within the UK's National Health Service, healthcare is ostensibly not a market resource; thus, permitting crowdfunding introduces market norms that could commodify healthcare. Third, pressures inherent to receiving funds from external parties may threaten the ability of patients-cum-recipients to voluntarily consent to treatment. We conclude that while crowdfunding itself is not unethical, its use can have unforeseen consequences that may influence conceptions of healthcare and how it is delivered.",2018,10.1136/medethics-2017-104717,44,7,453-457,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"decision-making and Humans and Infant and Health Care Costs and ethics and Morals and Health Services Accessibility/economics and informed consent and allocation of health care resources and Crowdsourcing/*ethics and Healthcare Financing/*ethics and Medical Tourism/*economics and Therapies, Investigational/*economics",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite guidelines and the medical literature outlining when it is acceptable to stop resuscitation, code cessation and deciding what not to do during a code, in practice, is an art form. Familiarity with classic evidence suggesting most codes are unsuccessful may influence decisions about when to terminate resuscitative efforts, in effect enacting self-fulfilling prophesies. Code interventions and duration may be influenced by patient demographics, gender or a concern about the stewardship of scarce resources. Yet, recent evidence links longer code duration with improved outcomes, and advances in resuscitation techniques complicate attempts to standardise both resuscitation length and the application of advanced interventions. In this context of increasing clinical and moral uncertainty, discussions between patients, families and medical providers about resuscitation plans take on an increased degree of importance.

Axson_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,Evaluating nurse understanding and participation in the informed consent process,"Axson, Sydney A. and Giordano, Nicholas A. and Hermann, Robin M. and Ulrich, Connie M.",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Informed consent is fundamental to the autonomous decision-making of patients, yet much is still unknown about the process in the clinical setting. In an evolving healthcare landscape, nurses must be prepared to address patient understanding and participate in the informed consent process to better fulfill their well-established role as patient advocates. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: This study examines hospital-based nurses' experiences and understandings of the informed consent process. RESEARCH DESIGN: This qualitative descriptive study utilized a semi-structured interview approach identifying thematic concerns, experiences, and knowledge of informed consent across a selected population of clinically practicing nurses. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In all, 20 baccalaureate prepared registered nurses practicing in various clinical settings (i.e. critical care, oncology, medical/surgical) at a large northeastern academic medical center in the United States completed semi-structured interviews and a demographic survey. The mean age of participants was 36.6 years old, with a mean of 12.2 years of clinical experience. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Participation in this study involved minimal risk and no invasive measures. This study received Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Pennsylvania. All participants voluntarily consented. FINDINGS: The majority of participants (N = 19) believe patient safety is directly linked to patient comprehension of the informed consent process. However, when asked if nurses have a defined role in the informed consent process, nearly half did not agree (N = 9). Through this qualitative approach, three major nursing roles emerged: the nurse as a communicator, the nurse as an advocate, and the clerical role of the nurse. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This investigation contributes to the foundation of ethical research that will better prepare nurses for patient engagement, advance current understanding of informed consent, and allow for future development of solutions. Nurses are at the forefront of patient-provider interactions and they are often presented opportunities to learn about and engage in the informed consent process.",2019,10.1177/0969733017740175,26,4,1050-1061,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and qualitative research and Pennsylvania and Qualitative Research and Clinical Competence/*standards and Clinical ethics and Patient Advocacy/ethics and informed consent and empirical approaches and professional ethics and ethics education and Informed Consent/ethics/*standards and Nurses/psychology/*standards,NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bartholdson_2016_Nursethi,JOUR,Clarifying perspectives: Ethics case reflection sessions in childhood cancer care,"Bartholdson, Cecilia and Lutzen, Kim and Blomgren, Klas and Pergert, Pernilla",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer care involves many ethical concerns. Deciding on treatment levels and providing care that infringes on the child's growing autonomy are known ethical concerns that involve the whole professional team around the child's care. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' experiences of participating in ethics case reflection sessions in childhood cancer care. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data collection by observations, individual interviews, and individual encounters. Data analysis were conducted following grounded theory methodology. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Healthcare professionals working at a publicly funded children's hospital in Sweden participated in ethics case reflection sessions in which ethical issues concerning clinical cases were reflected on. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The children's and their parents' integrity was preserved through measures taken to protect patient identity during ethics case reflection sessions. The study was approved by a regional ethical review board. FINDINGS: Consolidating care by clarifying perspectives emerged. Consolidating care entails striving for common care goals and creating a shared view of care and the ethical concern in the specific case. The inter-professional perspectives on the ethical aspects of care are clarified by the participants' articulated views on the case. Different approaches for deliberating ethics are used during the sessions including raising values and making sense, leading to unifying interactions. DISCUSSION: The findings indicate that ethical concerns could be eased by implementing ethics case reflection sessions. Conflicting perspectives can be turned into unifying interactions in the healthcare professional team with the common aim to achieve good pediatric care. CONCLUSION: Ethics case reflection sessions is valuable as it permits the discussion of values in healthcare-related issues in childhood cancer care. Clarifying perspectives, on the ethical concerns, enables healthcare professionals to reflect on the most reasonable and ethically defensible care for the child. A consolidated care approach would be valuable for both the child and the healthcare professionals because of the common care goals.",2016,10.1177/0969733015570511,23,4,421-431,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Cancer and Humans and Child and grounded theory and pediatrics and Qualitative Research and Grounded Theory and Sweden and Ethics, Nursing and Interprofessional Relations and Personal Autonomy and Hospitals, Pediatric and *Ethics, Medical and Neoplasms/*therapy and caregivers and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and *Ethics Committees, Clinical and Child Health/*ethics and ethics or moral perspectives and group interaction",NA,NA,2016/06//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Very few studies have focused on whether medical education can change the moral orientation of the students. The purpose of the present study was to document the types of moral orientation exhibited by medical students, and to study if their moral orientation was changed after preclinical education. METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, the Mojac scale was used to measure the moral orientation of Taiwan medical students. The students included 271 first-year and 109 third-year students. They were rated as a communitarian, dual, or libertarian group and followed for 2 years to monitor the changes in their Mojac scores. RESULTS: In both first and third-year students, the dual group after 2 years of preclinical medical education did not show any significant change. In the libertarian group, first and third-year students showed a statistically significant increase from a score of 99.4 and 101.3 to 103.0 and 105.7, respectively. In the communitarian group, first and third-year students showed a significant decline from 122.8 and 126.1 to 116.0 and 121.5, respectively.

Rimon.Zarfaty_2012_Joofmeet,JOUR,The Israeli abortion committees' process of decision making: an ethical analysis,"Rimon-Zarfaty, Nitzan and Jotkowitz, Alan",Journal of medical ethics,"The Israeli law of abortions (1977) legally authorises hospital committees to decide upon women's requests for selective abortion. One of the law's clauses determines that abortions can be approved in cases of an embryopathy. However, the law does not provide any clear definitions of those fetal 'physical or mental defects' in terms of severity and/or likelihood, which remain open to interpretation by the committee members. This paper aimed to determine which ethical methodologies are used by committee members and advisors as they face the dilemma of abortion approval due to mild to moderate possible embryopathy. Twenty interviews demonstrated that they use mainly a combination of deontology and a contextual-relational model. Their ethical considerations are both contextual such as the family's/woman's relational network and are influenced by the ethical principles of autonomy and in cases of late abortions the value of life. The findings reveal a paradoxical picture: on the one hand, committee members hold liberal perceptions and in practice abortion requests are very seldom rejected. On the other hand, the Israeli abortion law and practice of abortion committees is still problematical from liberal and feminist rights perspectives. This paradox is discussed further by reflecting upon the relevant theory as well as the Israeli context. The paper concludes by suggesting that within the specific Israeli sociopolitical climate the requirement for committee approval of what should be a private decision might be necessary in order to placate religious or other opposition to abortion.",2012,10.1136/jme.2009.032797,38,1,26-30,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Pregnancy and Human Rights and Politics and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and Israel and Jurisprudence and Ethical Analysis and Ethical Theory and Abortion, Induced and Abortion, Legal/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study with 15 families from the Otago/Southland region of New Zealand. Semistructured interviews explored their choice to opt out of intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis and thematic analysis was used to elucidate themes that captured important aspects of this parental decision-making process. RESULTS: Parents opt out of intramuscular vitamin K for a variety of reasons. These were clustered into three main themes: parents' beliefs and values (philosophy and spirituality), concerns about their child's welfare (pain and potential side effects) and external influencing factors (family, friends, media and health professionals). As part of a wider family hesitancy towards medical intervention, the majority of parents also raised concerns regarding other perinatal or childhood interventions. CONCLUSION: Many factors influence parental decision making and lead to a decision to opt out of newborn intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis.

Michaut_2019_Nursethi,JOUR,An assessment of advance relatives approach for brain death organ donation,"Michaut, Carine and Baumann, Antoine and Gregoire, Helene and Laviale, Corinne and Audibert, Gerard and Ducrocq, Xavier",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Advance announcement of forthcoming brain death has developed to enable intensivists and organ procurement organisation coordinators to more appropriately, and separately from each other, explain to relatives brain death and the subsequent post-mortem organ donation opportunity. RESEARCH AIM: The aim was to assess how potentially involved healthcare professionals perceived ethical issues surrounding the strategy of advance approach. RESEARCH DESIGN: A multi-centre opinion survey using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire was conducted in the six-member hospitals of the publicly funded East of France regional organ and tissue procurement network called 'Prelor'. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 460 physicians and nurses in the Neurosurgical, Surgical and Medical Intensive Care Units, the Stroke Units and the Emergency Departments. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The project was approved by the board of the Lorraine University Diploma in Medical Ethics and the Prelor Network administrators. MAIN FINDINGS: A slight majority of 53.5% of respondents had previously participated in an advance relatives approach: 83% of the physicians and 42% of the nurses. A majority of healthcare professionals (68%) think that the main justification for advance relatives approach is the comprehensive care of the dying patient and the research of his or her most likely opinion (74%). The misunderstanding of the related issues by relatives is an obstacle for 47% of healthcare professionals and 51% think that the answer given by the relatives regarding the most likely opinion of the person regarding post-mortem organ donation really corresponds to the person opinion in only 50% of the cases or less. CONCLUSION: Time given by advance approach should be employed to help and enable relatives to authentically bear the values and interests of the potential donor in the post-mortem organ donation discussion.

Jimenez.Herrera_2015_Nursethi,JOUR,Some ethical conflicts in emergency care,"Jimenez-Herrera, Maria F. and Axelsson, Christer",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making and assessment in emergency situations are complex and result many times in ethical conflicts between different healthcare professionals. AIM: To analyse and describe situations that can generate ethical conflict among nurses working in emergency situations. METHODS: Qualitative analysis. A total of 16 emergency nurses took part in interviews and a focus group. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Organisational approval by the University Hospital, and informed consent and confidentiality were ensured before conducting the research. RESULT/CONCLUSION: Two categories emerged: one in 'ethical issues' and one in 'emotions and feelings in caring'. The four ethical subcategories are presented: Autonomy, the first sub category: first, the nurse's ability to practise care on an emergency ward and, second, to support the patient and/or relatives in terms of care and medical treatment. The conflicts arise when the nurse ends up in the middle between the patient and the physician responsible for the diagnosis and treatment from a nature scientific perspective. Reification of injured body: patient was often reified and fragmented, becoming just a leg or arm. Different factors contributed in this perspective. Pain: pain relief was often inadequate but more effectively treated in the emergency medical services than at the emergency department. The nurses highlighted the phenomenon of suffering because they felt that pain was only an object, forgetting the patients' care need, like separating mind from body. Death: the nurses felt that the emergency services are only prepared to save lives and not to take care of the needs of patients with 'end-of-life' care. Another issue was the lack of ethical guidelines during a cardiac arrest. Resuscitation often continues without asking about the patient's 'previous wishes' in terms of resuscitation or not. In these situations, the nurses describe an ethical conflict with the physician in performing their role as the patient's advocate. The nurses express feelings of distress, suffering, anger and helplessness.",2015,10.1177/0969733014549880,22,5,548-560,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Qualitative Research and Focus Groups and emergency department and *Interprofessional Relations and nurses and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and *Conflict, Psychological and ethical conflicts and Emergency Service, Hospital/*ethics and Advance life support and caring and Emergency Nursing/*ethics",NA,NA,2015/08//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

These patients are completely dependent on care from others to continue living at home. AIM: This study aimed to gain insights into formal decisions related to the forced treatment and care of home-dwelling persons with dementia. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This is a cross-sectional study, based on formal decisions of forced treatment and care of home-dwelling persons with dementia in Norway between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016. METHODS: Descriptive statistical analysis. Statistically significant associations suitable for binary logistic regression were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approved by The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, and by the Norwegian Center for Research. RESULTS: We found 108 formal decisions of forced treatment and care of persons with dementia. Decisions of admission represented 57% of the data, other medical and safety decisions 27%, and assistance with activities of daily living 16%. In most cases, physicians were responsible for the decisions (77%), but nurses and family members were often involved. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a prevalence rate of formally documented decisions of forced treatment and care much lower than findings in previous studies. Poor documentation may constitute a risk for the safety and wellbeing of persons with dementia. Although physicians were usually responsible for the decisions, nurses and family members were often involved in the process.

Kious_2016_Joofmeet,JOUR,Respect for autonomy: deciding what is good for oneself,"Kious, Brent Michael",Journal of medical ethics,"Paternalistic interference in autonomous decisions is typically impermissible. This has several explanations, among which is a view I call the agent-constitution of the good: that the autonomous agent not only knows what is best for herself, but determines what is best for herself through her desires, goals and so on (her aims). For instance, it might seem that if an autonomous person does choose not to take insulin for her diabetes, then not only is it inappropriate to force treatment upon her, it is also not in her best interest to take insulin. Here I argue that agent-constitution, though appealing, is false. In fact, autonomous agents can be mistaken about their good, even when it seems to depend only upon their aims. Agent-constitution appears true only because we typically fail to notice constraints on a person's good in private, self-regarding decisions where paternalism might be considered.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-103340,42,12,769-775,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Paternalism and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Self Care and *Decision Making and *Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Autonomy and Paternalism/*ethics and Beneficence and Clinical Ethics and Philosophical Ethics",NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Proponents of implicit rationing argue that politicians cannot resist pressure from strong patient groups for treatments and conclude that physicians should ration without informing patients or the public. The authors subdivide this specific programme of implicit rationing, or ""hidden rationing"", into local hidden rationing, unsophisticated global hidden rationing and sophisticated global hidden rationing. They evaluate the appropriateness of these methods of rationing from the perspectives of individual and political autonomy and conclude that local hidden rationing and unsophisticated global hidden rationing clearly violate patients' individual autonomy, that is, their right to participate in medical decision-making. While sophisticated global hidden rationing avoids this charge, the authors point out that it nonetheless violates the political autonomy of patients, that is, their right to engage in public affairs as citizens.

Scott and Stevens, Elizabeth R. and Caplan, Arthur",Journal of medical ethics,"Physicians engage in risk stratification as a normative part of their professional duties. Risk stratification has the potential to be beneficial in many ways, and implicit recognition of this potential benefit underlies its acceptance as a cornerstone of the medical profession. However, risk stratification also has the potential to be harmful. We argue that 'profiling' is a term that corresponds to risk stratification strategies in which there is concern that ethical harms exceed likely or proven benefits. In the case of risk stratification for health goals, this would occur most frequently if benefits were obtained by threats to justice, autonomy or privacy. We discuss implications of the potential overlap between risk stratification and profiling for researchers and for clinicians, and we consider whether there are salient characteristics that make a particular risk stratification algorithm more or less likely to overlap with profiling, such as whether the risk stratification algorithm is based on voluntary versus non-voluntary characteristics, based on causal versus non-causal characteristics, or based on signifiers of historical disadvantage. We also discuss the ethical challenges created when a risk stratification scheme helps all subgroups but some more than others, or when risk stratification harms some subgroups but benefits the aggregate group.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-103047,42,5,325-329,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Ethics and Humans and *Public Health and Physicians/*psychology and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and Conflict, Psychological and Bioethical Issues and Professional Role/*psychology",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Winkler_2012_Joofmeet,JOUR,Evaluating a patient's request for life-prolonging treatment: an ethical framework,"Winkler, Eva C. and Hiddemann, Wolfgang and Marckmann, Georg",Journal of medical ethics,"Contrary to the widespread concern about over-treatment at the end of life, today, patient preferences for palliative care at the end of life are frequently respected. However, ethically challenging situations in the current healthcare climate are, instead, situations in which a competent patient requests active treatment with the goal of life-prolongation while the physician suggests best supportive care only. The argument of futility has often been used to justify unilateral decisions made by physicians to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. However, we argue that neither the concept of futility nor that of patient autonomy alone is apt for resolving situations in which physicians are confronted with patients' requests for active treatment. Instead, we integrate the relevant arguments that have been put forward in the academic discussion about 'futile' treatment into an ethical algorithm with five guiding questions: (1) Is there a chance that medical intervention will be effective in achieving the patient's treatment goal? (2) How does the physician evaluate the expected benefit and the potential harm of the treatment? (3) Does the patient understand his or her medical situation? (4) Does the patient prefer receiving treatment after evaluating the benefit-harm ratio and the costs? (5) Does the treatment require many resources? This algorithm shall facilitate approaching patients' requests for treatments deemed futile by the physician in a systematic way, and responding to these requests in an ethically appropriate manner. It thereby adds substantive considerations to the current procedural approaches of conflict resolution in order to improve decision making among physicians, patients and families.",2012,10.1136/medethics-2011-100333,38,11,647-651,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Algorithms and Treatment Outcome and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and *Patients and Decision Making/*ethics and *Life Expectancy and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and *Checklist and Dissent and Disputes and *Medical Futility and Choice Behavior/ethics and Physicians/*ethics and *Palliative Care/economics/ethics/trends and *Patient Care Planning/ethics/standards/trends and *Withholding Treatment/economics/ethics/trends and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/economics/*ethics/standards/trends and Terminal Care/ethics/standards/trends",NA,NA,2012/11//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ten years after the EURONIC study, which described the self-reported practices of neonatal caregivers towards ethical decision-making, a new study was conducted to assess the impact of the new law in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and compare the results reported by EURONIC with current practices. SETTING AND DESIGN: The study was carried out in the same two NICU as in the EURONIC qualitative study. A third centre was added to increase the sample size. From February to October 2007, 19 physicians and 17 nurses participated in semistructured interviews very similar to those for EURONIC. Content analysis identified the recurring themes emerging from the interviews. RESULTS: Compared with the EURONIC results, the caregivers reported that they pay greater attention to the views of parents and provided respectful support to the neonates when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn. Active termination of life has become exceptional. The possibility of withdrawal of treatment, the administration of sedatives to control pain even at the risk of hastening death, the emphasis on sparing parents the burden of decision, and the relative ignorance of the law were very similar to the EURONIC findings.

The role of distrust in ethics committee consultations for conflict over life-sustaining treatment among Afro-Caribbean patients,"Romain, Frederic and Courtwright, Andrew",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Distrust in the American healthcare system is common among Afro-Caribbeans but the role of this distrust in conflict over life-sustaining treatment is not well described. OBJECTIVE: To identify the ways that distrust manifests in ethics committee consultation for conflict over life-sustaining treatment among Afro-Caribbean patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at a large academic hospital of all ethics committee consultations for life-sustaining treatment among Afro-Caribbean patients and their surrogates. We reviewed medical records and identified cases in which ethics consultants described distrust as playing a role in the conflict over life-sustaining treatment. RESULTS: Of the 169 ethics committee consultation cases for conflict over life-sustaining treatment, 11 (6.5%) involved patients who self-identified as Afro-Caribbean. Distrust played a role in several of these cases, with surrogates of three patients, in particular, illustrating the way that perceived heath disparities, past labelling and concerns about continued maltreatment generated distrust leading to conflict over life-sustaining treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Exploring issues of distrust may help ethics consultants identify the source of conflict over life-sustaining treatment among Afro-Caribbean patients.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-103137,42,9,582-585,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Case-Control Studies and Trust and Ethnicity and Decision Making, Organizational and Attitude of Health Personnel and Conflict of Interest and United States/epidemiology and *Health Status Disparities and *African Americans and Medical Futility/*ethics and *Ethics Committees and End of Life Care and Critical Care/ethics/*standards and Ethics Committees/Consultation and Ethics Consultation/*statistics & numerical data and Health Care for Specific Diseases/Groups and Minorities and Racism/*ethics/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2016/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

C. and Onwuteaka-Philipsen, B. D. and van der Maas, P. J. and van der Heide, A. and van Delden, J. J. M.",Journal of medical ethics,"INTRODUCTION: The Dutch Euthanasia Act (2002) states that euthanasia is not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with the statutory due care criteria. These criteria hold that: there should be a voluntary and well-considered request, the patient's suffering should be unbearable and hopeless, the patient should be informed about their situation, there are no reasonable alternatives, an independent physician should be consulted, and the method should be medically and technically appropriate. This study investigates whether physicians experience problems with these criteria in medical practice. METHODS: In 2006, questionnaires were sent to a random, stratified sample of 2100 Dutch physicians (response rate: 56%). Physicians were asked about problems in their decision-making related to requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide after enforcement of the 2002 Euthanasia Act. RESULTS: Of all physicians who had received a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide (75%), 25% had experienced problems in the decision-making with regard to at least one of the criteria of due care. Physicians who had experienced problems mostly indicated to have had problems related to evaluating whether or not the patient's suffering was unbearable and hopeless (79%) and whether or not the patient's request was voluntary or well considered (58%). DISCUSSION: Physicians in The Netherlands most frequently reported problems related to aspects in which they have to evaluate the patient's subjective perspective(s). However, it can be questioned whether placing emphasis on these subjective aspects is an adequate fulfilment of the duties imposed on physicians, as laid down in the Dutch Euthanasia Act.",2008,10.1136/jme.2008.024976,34,9,e12,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Guidelines as Topic and Guideline Adherence and Statistics as Topic and Netherlands and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Physician's Role/psychology and Euthanasia/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data and Right to Die/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2008/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of the Bill is to encourage responsible innovation in medical treatment. We argue for the need to achieve a balance between the risks of medical innovation and patient safety considerations. We make the case for statutory regulation of medical innovation on the basis of responsible innovation, choice and patient-centred care. At the heart of regulation of medical innovation is care delivered by a process which is accountable, transparent and allows full consideration of all relevant matters. This paper proposes a two-stage test (to assess applicability of medical innovation as well as suitability for the choice of intervention to be undertaken). It is suggested that this model would provide safeguards for patients as well as define limits for doctors in the context of innovative therapy. Implementation and application of such therapy must be underpinned by due process and governance oversight, which could be provided through context-specific professional peer review. A combination of these ethicolegal principles would permit responsible medical innovation and maximise benefit in terms of therapy and patient-centred care.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2014-102366,41,6,474-477,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Humans and United Kingdom and Clinical Ethics and Legal Aspects and Therapies, Investigational/*ethics and *Quackery/prevention & control and Negligence and Patient Safety/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards and Patient-Centered Care/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Withholding or withdrawing life support therapy is widely considered ethical in patients with high treatment burden, poor premorbid status, or significant projected disability even when such treatment is not ""futile."" Whether such withdrawal of therapy in the aftermath of attempted suicide is ethical is not well established in the literature. We provide a clinical vignette and propose criteria under which such withdrawal would be ethical. We suggest that it is appropriate to withdraw life support, regardless of the cause of the critical illness or disability, when the following criteria are met: (1) Surrogates request withdrawal of care and the adequacy of surrogates is confirmed, (2) an external reasonability standard is met, (3) passage of time, perhaps 72 hours, to allow certainty regarding the patient's wishes, and (4) psychiatric morbidity should be considered as grounds for withdrawal only in truly treatment-refractory cases. Fundamentally, we believe the question to ask is, ""If this were not an attempted suicide, would a request to withdraw care be reasonable?"" We believe that under these circumstances, such withdrawal of life support, even in an individual who has attempted suicide, does not constitute physician assistance with suicide and is distinct from physician aid-in-dying in several important respects.",2013,10.1080/15265161.2012.760673,13,3,12-3,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,"United States and Humans and Time Factors and Algorithms and Personal Autonomy and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and *Suicide, Attempted/psychology and *Advance Directives and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and *Terminally Ill/psychology and *Life Support Care/ethics and *Suicide, Assisted/ethics and *Critical Illness/psychology and *Proxy/legislation & jurisprudence and Living Wills and Mental Disorders/*complications/psychology",NA,NA,2013///,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adapting to crisis conditions requires a rethink of traditional best practices in surgical management, delving into an area of unknown risk profiles. Key challenging areas include cancelling elective operations, modifying procedures to adapt local services and updating the consenting process. We aim to provide an ethical rationale to support change in practice and guide future decision-making. Using the four principles approach as a structure, Medline was searched for existing ethical frameworks aimed at resolving conflicting moral duties. Where insufficient data were available, best guidance was sought from educational institutions: National Health Service England and The Royal College of Surgeons. Multiple papers presenting high-quality, reasoned, ethical theory and practice guidance were collected. Using this as a basis to assess current practice, multiple requirements were generated to ensure preservation of ethical integrity when making management decisions. Careful consideration of ethical principles must guide production of local guidance ensuring consistent patient selection thus preserving equality as well as quality of clinical services. A critical issue is balancing the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19 and its associated complications. As such, the need for surgery must be sufficiently pressing to proceed with conventional or non-conventional operative management; otherwise, delaying intervention is justified. For delayed operations, it is our duty to quantify the long-term impact on patients' outcome within the constraints of pandemic management and its long-term outlook.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106446,46,8,505-507,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and England and Humans and Risk Assessment and Surgical Procedures, Operative and Surgeons and Cost-Benefit Analysis and ethics and surgery and Practice Guidelines as Topic and *Ethics, Medical and Betacoronavirus and Decision Making/*ethics and State Medicine and Ethical Analysis and Informed Consent/ethics and Principle-Based Ethics and Moral Obligations and Ethical Theory and Patient Selection/*ethics and public health ethics and right to healthcare and Coronavirus Infections/*complications/virology and General Surgery/*ethics and Health Equity/*ethics and Pandemics/*ethics and Pneumonia, Viral/*complications/virology",NA,NA,2020/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Birchley_2016_Joofmeet,JOUR,Harm is all you need? Best interests and disputes about parental decision-making,"Birchley, Giles",Journal of medical ethics,"A growing number of bioethics papers endorse the harm threshold when judging whether to override parental decisions. Among other claims, these papers argue that the harm threshold is easily understood by lay and professional audiences and correctly conforms to societal expectations of parents in regard to their children. English law contains a harm threshold which mediates the use of the best interests test in cases where a child may be removed from her parents. Using Diekema's seminal paper as an example, this paper explores the proposed workings of the harm threshold. I use examples from the practical use of the harm threshold in English law to argue that the harm threshold is an inadequate answer to the indeterminacy of the best interests test. I detail two criticisms: First, the harm standard has evaluative overtones and judges are loath to employ it where parental behaviour is misguided but they wish to treat parents sympathetically. Thus, by focusing only on 'substandard' parenting, harm is problematic where the parental attempts to benefit their child are misguided or wrong, such as in disputes about withdrawal of medical treatment. Second, when harm is used in genuine dilemmas, court judgments offer different answers to similar cases. This level of indeterminacy suggests that, in practice, the operation of the harm threshold would be indistinguishable from best interests. Since indeterminacy appears to be the greatest problem in elucidating what is best, bioethicists should concentrate on discovering the values that inform best interests.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-102893,42,2,111-115,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Humans and Social Responsibility and Adult and Child and Child, Preschool and Infant and United Kingdom and Law and Concept Formation and Decision Making/*ethics and Parents/*psychology and Dissent and Disputes and Child Advocacy/*ethics and Minors/Parental Consent and Paediatrics and *Minors and Human Rights/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Newborns and Minors and Parental Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Value of Life",NA,NA,2016/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hertogh_2009_Joofmeet,JOUR,The role of advance euthanasia directives as an aid to communication and shared decision-making in dementia,"Hertogh, C. M. P. M.",Journal of medical ethics,"Recent evaluation of the practice of euthanasia and related medical decisions at the end of life in the Netherlands has shown a slight decrease in the frequency of physician-assisted death since the enactment of the Euthanasia Law in 2002. This paper focuses on the absence of euthanasia cases concerning patients with dementia and a written advance euthanasia directive, despite the fact that the only real innovation of the Euthanasia Law consisted precisely in allowing physicians to act upon such directives. The author discusses two principal reasons for this absence. One relates to the uncertainty about whether patients with advanced dementia truly experience the suffering they formerly feared. There is reason to assume that they don't, as a consequence of psychological adaptation and progressive unawareness (anosognosia). The second, more fundamental reason touches upon the ethical relevance of shared understanding and reciprocity. The author argues that, next to autonomy and mercifulness, ""reciprocity"" is a condition sine qua non for euthanasia. The absence thereof in advanced dementia renders euthanasia morally inconceivable, even if there are signs of suffering and notwithstanding the presence of an advance euthanasia directive. This does not mean, however, that advance euthanasia directives of patients with dementia are worthless. They might very well have a role in the earlier stages of certain subtypes of the disease. To illustrate this point the author presents a case in which the advance directive helped to create a window of opportunity for reciprocity and shared decision-making.",2009,10.1136/jme.2007.024109,35,2,100-103,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Communication and Humans and Netherlands and Decision Making/*ethics and Dementia/*psychology and *Euthanasia/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Advance Directives/ethics/psychology and Suicide, Assisted/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2009/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

For patients, having both informed consent and a user agreement raises questions of understanding for autonomy and informed consent, therapeutic misconception, external influences on decision making, confidentiality and privacy, and device dependability.

Prevalence data are lacking; however, qualitative and survey research suggest device industry representatives, who are commonly present in clinical settings, play a key role in these relationships. Representatives, who are technical product specialists and not necessarily medically trained, may attend surgeries on a daily basis and be available to health professionals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide advice. However, device representatives have a dual role: functioning as commissioned sales representatives at the same time as providing advice on approaches to treatment. This duality raises the concern that clinical decision-making may be unduly influenced by commercial imperatives. In this paper, we identify three key ethical concerns raised by the relationship between device representatives and health professionals: (1) impacts on healthcare costs, (2) the outsourcing of expertise and (3) issues of accountability and informed consent. These ethical concerns can be addressed in part through clarifying the boundary between the support and sales aspects of the roles of device representatives and developing clear guidelines for device representatives providing support in clinical spaces.

Hain_2018_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Voices of moral authority: parents, doctors and what will actually help","Hain, Richard David William",Journal of medical ethics,"The public often believes that parents have a right to make medical decisions about their child. The idea that, in respect of children, doctors should do what parents tell them to do is problematic on the face of it. The effect of such a claim would be that a doctor who acted deliberately to harm a child would be making a morally correct decision, providing only that it is what the child's parents said they wanted. That is so obviously nonsense that it cannot be what people who claim it actually mean. In this paper, I suggest that the claim actually represents either or both of two misunderstandings. It can be a result of wrongly appealing to the principle of respect for autonomy, or a belief that doctors are not committed to acting in the interests of the child. In this paper, I show that, while neither belief is entirely justified, there are elements of truth in both. I argue that if ethically correct decisions are those that are directed to improving the quality of a child's existence, then neither parents nor doctors are in a position to make ethically correct decisions about a child except in discussion with one another.

The patient states that he is fasting and that his fast will be broken and his religious practice disrupted in the event that the serum is administered.

Over the last decade, in response to these threats, increasing scientific consensus has mobilised in support of a One Health (OH) approach so that OH is now widely regarded as the most effective way of addressing EID outbreaks and risks. Given the scientific focus on OH, there is growing interest in the philosophical and ethical dimensions of this approach, and a nascent OH literature is developing in the humanities. One of the key issues raised in this literature concerns ethical frameworks and whether OH merits the development of its very own ethical framework. In this paper, we argue that although the OH approach does not demand a new ethical framework (and that advocates of OH can coherently adhere to this approach while deploying existing ethical frameworks), an OH approach does furnish the theoretical resources to support a novel ethical framework, and there are benefits to developing one that may be lost in its absence. We begin by briefly explaining what an OH approach to the threats posed by EIDs entails before outlining two different ways of construing ethical frameworks.

Xafis_2015_Joofmeet,JOUR,Balancing obligations: should written information about life-sustaining treatment be neutral?,"Xafis, Vicki and Wilkinson, Dominic and Gillam, Lynn and Sullivan, Jane",Journal of medical ethics,"Parents who are facing decisions about life-sustaining treatment for their seriously ill or dying child are supported by their child's doctors and nurses. They also frequently seek other information sources to help them deal with the medical and ethical questions that arise. This might include written or web-based information. As part of a project involving the development of such a resource to support parents facing difficult decisions, some ethical questions emerged. Should this information be presented in a strictly neutral fashion? Is it problematic if narratives, arguments or perspectives appear to favour stopping over continuing life-sustaining treatment? Similar questions might arise with written materials about decisions for adults, or for other ethically contentious decisions. This paper explores the meaning of 'balance' in information provision, focusing particularly on written information about life-sustaining treatment for children. We contrast the norm of non-directiveness in genetic counselling with the shared decision-making model often endorsed in end-of-life care.

Ratnapalan_2010_BMCmedeth,JOUR,Documentation of best interest by intensivists: a retrospective study in an Ontario critical care unit,"Ratnapalan, Mohana and Cooper, Andrew B. and Scales, Damon C. and Pinto, Ruxandra",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care physicians often must rely on substitute decision makers to address all dimensions of the construct of ""best interest"" for incapable, critically ill patients. This task involves identifying prior wishes and to facilitate the substitute decision maker's understanding of the incapable patient's condition and their likely response to treatment. We sought to determine how well such discussions are documented in a typical intensive care unit. METHODS: Using a quality of communication instrument developed from a literature search and expert opinion, 2 investigators transcribed and analyzed 260 handwritten communications for 105 critically ill patients who died in the intensive care unit between January and June 2006. Cohen's kappa was calculated before analysis and then disagreements were resolved by consensus. We report results on a per-patient basis to represent documented communication as a process leading up to the time of death in the ICU. We report frequencies and percentages for discrete data, median (m) and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data. RESULTS: Our cohort was elderly (m 72, IQR 58-81 years) and had high APACHE II scores predictive of a high probability of death (m 28, IQR 23-36). Length of stay in the intensive care unit prior to death was short (m 2, IQR 1-5 days), and withdrawal of life support preceded death for more than half (n 57, 54%). Brain death criteria were present for 18 patients (17%). Although intensivists' communications were timely (median 17 h from admission to critical care), the person consenting on behalf of the incapable patient was explicitly documented for only 10% of patients. Life support strategies at the time of communication were noted in 45% of charts, and options for their future use were presented in 88%. Considerations relevant to determining the patient's best interest in relation to the treatment plan were not well documented. While explicit survival estimates were noted in 50% of charts, physicians infrequently documented their own predictions of the patient's functional status (20%), anticipated need for chronic care (0%), or post ICU quality of life (3%). Similarly, documentation of the patient's own perspectives on these ranged from 2-18%. CONCLUSIONS: Intensivists' documentation of their communication with substitute decision makers frequently outlined the proposed plan of treatment, but often lacked evidence of discussion relevant to whether the treatment plan was expected to improve the patient's condition. Legislative standards for determination of best interest, such as the Health Care Consent Act in Ontario, Canada, may provide guidance for intensivists to optimally document the rationales for proposed treatment plans.",2010,10.1186/1472-6939-11-1,11,NA,1,eng,1472-6939,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Ontario and Workforce and Length of Stay and *Medical Records and Palliative Care and Terminal Care and *Communication and Physicians/*standards and *Intensive Care Units and *Critical Illness and Decision Making/*ethics and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards and Patient Care Planning/*standards and Ethics Consultation and Critical Care/methods/*standards and Patient-Centered Care/ethics/*standards and Third-Party Consent/ethics",NA,NA,2010/02/10/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this essay, I present a novel construct for classifying empirical research in bioethics into four hierarchical categories: Lay of the Land, Ideal Versus Reality, Improving Care, and Changing Ethical Norms.

DESIGN: Questionnaire survey of the UK medical schools enquiring about content, structure and location of ethics teaching and learning; teaching and learning processes; assessment; influences over institutional approach to ethics education; barriers to teaching and assessment; perception of student engagement and perception of student preparation for clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: The lead for medical ethics at each medical school was invited to participate (n=33). RESULTS: Completed responses were received from 11/33 schools (33%). 73% (n=8) teach all IME recommended topics within their programme. 64% (n=7) do not include ethics in clinical placement learning objectives. The most frequently cited barrier to teaching was lack of time (64%, n=7), and to assessment was lack of time and suitability of assessments (27%, n=3). All faculty felt students were prepared for clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: IME recommendations are not followed in all cases, and ethics teaching is not universally well integrated into clinical placement. Barriers to assessment lead to inadequacies in this area, and there are few consequences for failing ethics assessments.

Mohammadi_2020_Nursethi,JOUR,Male nursing students' perception of dignity in neonatal intensive care units,"Mohammadi, Fateme and Oshvandi, Khodayar and Med, Hazel Kyle",Nursing ethics,"INTRODUCTION: Maintaining dignity is one of the most important human rights. However, maintaining and promoting the dignity of nursing students as an important caregiver group has scarcely been considered. Dignity can be viewed as an abstract concept particularly in relation to the perspective of male nursing student perspective. Therefore, more investigation is required to explore the male students' understanding of the concept of dignity. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to define and explain the concept of dignity among male nursing students in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a qualitative content analysis study. The data were collected through semi-structured individual interviews. The data were analyzed by conventional content analysis method. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Twenty male nursing students in public health centers in Iran were selected by targeted sampling to achieve data saturation between February 2017 and November 2017. FINDINGS: The findings of this study were presented in three main themes, including ""extensive support,"" ""belief in ability,"" and ""participation in decision making,"" and 7 sub-categories of data were extracted. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study's protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and the ethical principles were followed throughout the study. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the study, male nursing students required extensive support, and their academic and practical skills required to be respected; in addition, they should be involved in decision making, because in such an environment, the dignity of these students will be maintained and promoted. Therefore, it is suggested that a cultural, professional, and institutional background in which all components of the male nursing student's dignity are protected and emphasized should be provided.",2020,10.1177/0969733019848040,27,2,381-389,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Male and Adult and qualitative research and nursing and Qualitative Research and Iran and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Perception and Interviews as Topic/methods and Focus Groups/methods and *Personhood and Dignity and Students, Nursing/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data and male students and Nurses, Male/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Brick_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Worth living or worth dying? The views of the general public about allowing disabled children to die,"Brick, Claudia and Kahane, Guy and Wilkinson, Dominic and Caviola, Lucius and Savulescu, Julian",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about withdrawal of life support for infants have given rise to legal battles between physicians and parents creating intense media attention. It is unclear how we should evaluate when life is no longer worth living for an infant. Public attitudes towards treatment withdrawal and the role of parents in situations of disagreement have not previously been assessed. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with a sample of the UK public to assess public views about the benefit of life in hypothetical cases similar to real cases heard by the UK courts (eg, Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans). We then evaluated these public views in comparison with existing ethical frameworks for decision-making. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty participants completed the survey. The majority (94%) agreed that an infant's life may have no benefit when well-being falls below a critical level. Decisions to withdraw treatment were positively associated with the importance of use of medical resources, the infant's ability to have emotional relationships, and mental abilities. Up to 50% of participants in each case believed it was permissible to either continue or withdraw treatment. CONCLUSION: Despite the controversy, our findings indicate that in the most severe cases, most people agree that life is not worth living for a profoundly disabled infant. Our survey found wide acceptance of at least the permissibility of withdrawal of treatment across a range of cases, though also a reluctance to overrule parents' decisions. These findings may be useful when constructing guidelines for clinical practice.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105639,46,1,15-7,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Emotions and Physicians and Ethics and Humans and Child and Infant and Physician-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires and United Kingdom and Parents and Severity of Illness Index and Withholding Treatment and Child Development and *Ethics, Medical and *Attitude to Health and *Public Opinion and Decision Making/*ethics and Ethical Analysis and End-of-life and Clinical Ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics and Resource Allocation and *Disabled Children and Allocation of Health Care Resources and Value of Life and *Euthanasia, Passive and Quality/Value of Life/Personhood",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

R. and Forsmo, S.",Journal of medical ethics,"CONTEXT: Despite much research on informed choice and the individuals' autonomy in organised medical screening, little is known about the individuals' decision-making process as expressed in their own words. OBJECTIVES: To explore the decision-making process among women invited to a mammography screening programme. SETTING: Women living in the counties of Sor- and Nord-Trondelag, Norway, invited to the first round of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in 2003. METHODS: Qualitative methods based on eight semistructured focus-group interviews with a total of 69 women aged 50-69 years. RESULTS: The decision to attend mammography screening was not based on the information in the invitation letter and leaflet provided by the NBCSP. They perceived the invitation letter with a prescheduled appointment as if a decision for mammography had already been made. This was experienced as an aid in overcoming the postponements that easily occur in daily lives. The invitation to mammography screening was embraced as an indication of a responsible welfare state, ""like a mother taking care."" CONCLUSION: In a welfare state where governmental institutions are trusted, mass screening for disease is acknowledged by screening participants as a valued expression of paternalism. Trust, gratitude, and convenience were more important factors than information about benefits, harms, and risks when the women made their decisions to attend screening.

Bester_2020_TAjob.A,JOUR,"Beneficence, Interests, and Wellbeing in Medicine: What It Means to Provide Benefit to Patients","Bester, Johan Christiaan",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,"Beneficence is a foundational ethical principle in medicine. To provide benefit to a patient is to promote and protect the patient's wellbeing, to promote the patient's interests. But there are different conceptions of wellbeing, emphasizing different values. These conceptions of wellbeing are contrary to one another and give rise to dissimilar ideas of what it means to benefit a patient. This makes the concept of beneficence ambiguous: is a benefit related to the patient's goals and wishes, or is it a matter of objective criteria that constitute wellbeing? This paper suggests a unified conception of wellbeing for use in medicine to determine what counts as a benefit. Two components of wellbeing are identified: (1) objective functioning/health and (2) the patient's view of her own good. The paper explores how to apply, balance, and weigh these components in clinical situations to determine what counts as a benefit to a patient.",2020,10.1080/15265161.2020.1714793,20,3,53-62,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Quality of Life and welfare and Informed Consent and *Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and *Patient Preference and Mental Competency and *Beneficence and Moral Obligations and Patient Care/*ethics and Beneficence and benefit and harm and interests and wellbeing",NA,NA,2020/03//undefined,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, we argue that recognising value promotion as a goal of medicine will expand the scope of medical practice by including some procedures that are sometimes rejected as being outside the scope of acceptable medical practice, such as certain forms of physician-assisted death. We then rebut some common and possible objections to this view.

Mendyk_2015_BMCmedeth,JOUR,"Which factors influence the resort to surrogate consent in stroke trials, and what are the patient outcomes in this context?","Mendyk, Anne-Marie and Labreuche, Julien and Henon, Hilde and Girot, Marie and Cordonnier, Charlotte and Duhamel, Alain and Leys, Didier and Bordet, Regis",BMC medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: The provision of informed consent is a prerequisite for inclusion of a patient in a clinical research project. In some countries, the legislation on clinical research authorizes a third person to provide informed consent if the patient is unable to do so directly (i.e. surrogate consent). This is the case during acute stroke, when the symptoms may prevent the patient from providing informed consent and thus require a third party to be approached. Identification of factors associated with the medical team's decision to resort to surrogate consent may (i) help the care team during the inclusion process and (ii) enable the patient's family circle to be better informed (and thus feel less guilty) about providing surrogate consent. METHODS: Patients included in the BIOSTROKE cohort (initially dedicated to the analysis of factors influencing stroke severity) were divided into two groups: those having provided informed consent directly and those for whom a third party (such as a family member) had provided surrogate consent. We compared the groups in terms of the initial clinical characteristics (age, gender, type of stroke, severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), pre-stroke cognitive status according to the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and the stroke's aetiology) and the functional and cognitive impairments (according to the NIHSS, the modified Rankin score (mRS) and the Mini Mental State Examination) on post-stroke days 8 and 90. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety five patients were included (mean <c2><b1> SD age: 67 <c2><b1> 15 years; 53% males). Surrogate consent had been obtained in 228 cases, and 167 patients had provided consent themselves. The patients included with surrogate consent were likely to be older and more aphasic, with a pre-existing cognitive disorder and more severe stroke (relative to the patients having provided consent). In terms of recovery, the patients included with surrogate consent had a worse functional prognosis (day 90 mRS <e2><89><a5>3: 57.6%, compared with 16.8% in patients having provided consent themselves; p < 0.0001) and a worse cognitive prognosis (day 90 MMS < 24: 15.4% and 4.8%, respectively; p < 0.002). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the surrogate consent group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that in addition to age, aphasia and stroke severity, pre-stroke cognitive status is a factor that should prompt the care team to consider requesting surrogate consent for participation in a clinical study. Given that the unfavourable outcome in patients with surrogate consent is often due to their initial clinical state (rather than inclusion in a trial per se), the issue of the family's feelings of guilt (and how to avoid these feelings) should be further addressed.",2015,10.1186/s12910-015-0018-8,16,NA,26,eng,1472-6939,"United States and Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Cognition and Aged, 80 and over and Research Design and Age Factors and Cognition Disorders and *Research Subjects and *Informed Consent and *Severity of Illness Index and *Proxy and *Patient Selection/ethics and *Biomedical Research/ethics and *Stroke and Aphasia",NA,NA,2015/04/24/,BMC Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Nair_2017_Joofmeet,JOUR,Settling for second best: when should doctors agree to parental demands for suboptimal medical treatment?,"Nair, Tara and Savulescu, Julian and Everett, Jim and Tonkens, Ryan and Wilkinson, Dominic",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Doctors sometimes encounter parents who object to prescribed treatment for their children, and request suboptimal substitutes be administered instead (suboptimal being defined as less effective and/or more expensive). Previous studies have focused on parental refusal of treatment and when this should be permitted, but the ethics of requests for suboptimal treatment has not been explored. METHODS: The paper consists of two parts: an empirical analysis and an ethical analysis. We performed an online survey with a sample of the general public to assess respondents' thresholds for acceptable harm and expense resulting from parental choice, and the role that religion played in their judgement. We also identified and applied existing ethical frameworks to the case described in the survey to compare theoretical and empirical results. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two Mechanical Turk workers took our survey and there were 178 valid responses (73.6%). Respondents' agreement to provide treatment decreased as the risk or cost of the requested substitute increased (p<0.001). More than 50% of participants were prepared to provide treatment that would involve a small absolute increased risk of death for the child (<5%) and a cost increase of US$<500, respectively. Religiously motivated requests were significantly more likely to be allowed (p<0.001). Existing ethical frameworks largely yielded ambiguous results for the case. There were clear inconsistencies between the theoretical and empirical results.

PARTICIPANTS: 96 doctors from emergency, intensive care, palliative care, oncology, renal medicine, internal medicine, respiratory medicine, surgery, cardiology, geriatric medicine and medical administration departments. Participants were recruited using purposive maximum variation sampling. RESULTS: Doctors attributed the provision of futile treatment to a wide range of inter-related factors. One was the characteristics of treating doctors, including their orientation towards curative treatment, discomfort or inexperience with death and dying, concerns about legal risk and poor communication skills. Second, the attributes of the patient and family, including their requests or demands for further treatment, prognostic uncertainty and lack of information about patient wishes. Third, there were hospital factors including a high degree of specialisation, the availability of routine tests and interventions, and organisational barriers to diverting a patient from a curative to a palliative pathway. Doctors nominated family or patient request and doctors being locked into a curative role as the main reasons for futile care. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors believe that a range of factors contribute to the provision of futile treatment.

Chen_2017_TAjob.A,JOUR,A Framework for Unrestricted Prenatal Whole-Genome Sequencing: Respecting and Enhancing the Autonomy of Prospective Parents,"Chen, Stephanie C. and Wasserman, David T.",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,"Noninvasive, prenatal whole genome sequencing (NIPW) may be a technological reality in the near future, making available a vast array of genetic information early in pregnancy at no risk to the fetus or mother. Many worry that the timing, safety, and ease of the test will lead to informational overload and reproductive consumerism. The prevailing response among commentators has been to restrict conditions eligible for testing based on medical severity, which imposes disputed value judgments and devalues those living with eligible conditions. To avoid these difficulties, we propose an unrestricted testing policy, under which prospective parents could obtain information on any variant of known significance after a careful informed consent process that uses an interactive decision aid to deliver a mandatory presentation on the purposes, techniques, and limitations of genomic testing, as well as optional resources for reflection and consultation. This process would encourage thoughtful, informed deliberation by prospective parents before deciding whether or how to use NIPW.",2017,10.1080/15265161.2016.1251632,17,1,18-3,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,Humans and Social Responsibility and Female and decision making and Pregnancy and Parents and disability and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and children and families and informed consent and Genetic Testing/ethics and clinical genetics and Fetal Diseases/*diagnosis and Prenatal Diagnosis/*ethics and reproductive technologies and Whole Genome Sequencing/*ethics and Women's Rights/*ethics,NA,NA,2017/01//undefined,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA
Malpas_2011_Joofmeet,JOUR,Advance directives and older people: ethical challenges in the promotion of advance directives in New Zealand,"Malpas, Phillipa J.",Journal of medical ethics,"In New Zealand an advance directive can be either an oral statement or a written document. Such directives give individuals the opportunity to make choices about future medical treatment in the event they are cognitively impaired or otherwise unable to make their preferences known. All consumers of health care have the right to make an advance directive in accordance with the common law. When we consider New Zealand's rapidly ageing population, the fact that more people now live with and die of chronic rather than acute conditions, the importance given to respecting autonomous decision-making, increasing numbers of individuals who require long-term residential care, and financial pressures in the allocation of medical resources, there would seem to be a number of compelling reasons to encourage individuals to write or verbalize an advance directive. Indeed the promotion of advance directives is encouraged. However, caution should be exercised in promoting advance directives to older people, especially in light of several factors: ageist attitudes and stereotypes towards them, challenges in the primary healthcare setting, and the way in which advance directives are currently focused and formulated. This paper considers some of the specific challenges that need to be addressed if the promotion of advance directives are to improve outcomes of patient treatment and care near the end of life.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.039701,37,5,285-289,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Primary Health Care and Aged and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Aged, 80 and over and Quality of Life and Age Factors and New Zealand and Attitude to Death and Choice Behavior and *Decision Making and Right to Die/*legislation & jurisprudence and Advance Directives/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Living Wills/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology and Patient Rights/legislation & jurisprudence",NA,NA,2011/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

To fill the gap in the literature around Islamic bioethical perspectives on the matter, we derive a theologically rooted rubric for goals of care. We use the Islamic obligation for Muslims to seek medical treatment as the foundation for determining the clinical conditions under which Muslim physicians have a duty to treat. We next link the theological concept of accountability before God (taklif) to quality-of-life assessment.

It is the principle of justice, as espoused by Aristotle, which requires that equal things are treated equally and that unequal things are treated unequally that creates a presumption that Smith and Jones should be treated differently.

For reasons of cost effectiveness and promising effects, we prepared for its implementation in Italy, the Netherlands and Japan. Local teams translated and adapted the booklet to local ethical, legal and medical standards where needed, retaining guidance on palliative care. Using qualitative content analyses, we grouped and compared adaptations to understand culturally sensitive aspects. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) relationships among patient, physician and other professionals-the authority of the physician was more explicit in adapted versions; (2) patient rights and family position-adding detail about local regulations; and (3) typology of treatments and decisions. Considerations underlying palliative care decisions were detailed (Dutch and Italian versions), and the Japanese version frequently referred to professional and legal standards, and life-prolongation was a competing goal. Text on artificial feeding or fluids and euthanasia was revised extensively. CONCLUSIONS: Providing artificial feeding and fluids and discussing euthanasia may be particularly sensitive topics, and guidance on these subjects needs careful consideration of ethical aspects and possible adaptations to local standards and practice.

Halpern_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Informed consent for early-phase clinical trials: therapeutic misestimation, unrealistic optimism and appreciation","Halpern, Jodi and Paolo, David and Huang, Andrew",Journal of medical ethics,"Unrealistic therapeutic beliefs are very common-the majority of patient-subjects (up to 94%) enrol in phase 1 trials seeking and expecting significant medical benefit, even though the likelihood of such benefit has historically proven very low. The high prevalence of therapeutic misestimation and unrealistic optimism in particular has stimulated debate about whether unrealistic therapeutic beliefs in early-phase clinical trials preclude adequate informed consent. We seek here to help resolve this controversy by showing that a crucial determination of when such therapeutic beliefs are ethically problematic turns on whether they are causally linked and instrumental to the motivation to participate in the trial. Thus, in practice, it is ethically incumbent on researchers to determine which understanding and beliefs lead to the participant's primary motivation for enrolling, not to simply assess understanding, beliefs and motivations independently. We further contend that assessing patient-subjects' appreciation as a component of informed consent-it is already an established component of decision-making capacity assessments-can help elucidate the link between understanding-beliefs and motivation; appreciation refers to an individual's understanding of the personal significance of both the medical facts and the experience of trial participation. Therefore, we recommend that: (1) in addition to the usual question, 'Why do you want to participate in this trial?', all potential participants should be asked the question: 'What are you giving up by participating in this trial?' and (2) researchers should consider the settings in which it may be possible and practical to obtain 'two-point consent'.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-105226,45,6,384-387,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"decision-making and Humans and Comprehension and Motivation and Treatment Outcome and autonomy and Research Subjects/*psychology and clinical trials and Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology and informed consent and research ethics and *Optimism/psychology and Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*ethics",NA,NA,2019/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the ways in which doctors and nurses may intentionally, or unintentionally, avoid telling the truth to patients is either by using metaphors that obscure the truth or by failing to deploy appropriately powerful and revealing metaphors in their discussions. This failure to tell the truth may partly account for the observation by clinicians that patients sometimes make decisions that, from the perspective of their clinician, and given all that the clinician knows, seem unwise. For example, patients with advanced cancer may choose to undergo further, aggressive, treatment despite the fact that they are likely to accrue little or no benefit as a result. While acknowledging that the immediate task of telling patients the truth can be difficult for all those concerned, I argue that the long-term consequences of denying patients autonomy at the end of life can be harmful to patients and can leave doctors and nurses distressed and confused.",2007,10.1136/jme.2005.014993,33,1,11-14,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,"Humans and Decision Making and Professional-Patient Relations and Ethics, Medical and *Personal Autonomy and *Terminally Ill and Truth Disclosure/*ethics and *Metaphor",NA,NA,2007/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, this concept of a 'right to the truth' entails certain ambiguities, especially since it is difficult to apply the concept in medical practice based mainly on current evidence-based data that are probabilistic in nature. Furthermore, in some situations, the doctor is confronted with a moral dilemma, caught between the necessity to inform the patient (principle of autonomy) and the desire to ensure the patient's well-being by minimising suffering (principle of beneficence). To comply with the principle of beneficence as well as the principle of non-maleficence 'to do no harm', the doctor may then feel obliged to turn to 'therapeutic privilege', using lies or deception to preserve the patient's hope, and psychological and moral integrity, as well as his self-image and dignity. There is no easy answer to such a moral dilemma. This article will propose a process that can fit into reflective practice, allowing the doctor to decide if the use of therapeutic privilege is justified when he is faced with these kinds of conflicting circumstances. We will present the conflict arising in practice in the context of the various theoretical orientations in ethics, and then we will suggest an approach for a 'practice of truth'.

OBJECTIVES: To explore what people want in a surrogate decision-maker whom they themselves select and to test the assumption that people want their chosen surrogate to make only a substituted judgement. METHODS: 30 undergraduate students were recruited. They were presented with a hypothetical scenario about their expected loss of mental capacity in the future and asked to answer some questions about their choice of surrogate. These data were analysed qualitatively using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Most respondents talked about choosing someone who was caring and competent in certain ways, giving interesting evidence for their judgements. Surprisingly few highlighted how well they thought their chosen surrogate knew their preferences and would be able to make a substituted judgement. Moreover, few specified that their chosen surrogate had similar attitudes and values to their own and so would make a similar decision to theirs in the circumstances presented. Some respondents also referred to the social role of their chosen surrogate or the social dynamics of their situation which influenced their choices, as well as to ideas of reciprocity and characteristics of honesty and loyalty. CONCLUSION: In the event that they lose mental capacity, many people will not select a surrogate to decide about medical treatments on their behalf solely on the basis that they expect their surrogate to make a substituted judgement.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.037978,37,10,601-605,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Attitude to Health and *Decision Making and *Choice Behavior and Mental Competency/*psychology and *Third-Party Consent and Advance Directives/ethics/*psychology,NA,NA,2011/10//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Knowledge of these risk factors can often provide significant medical and psychological benefit, but also raises complex ethical and social issues. This paper focuses on one area of rapid progress: the identification of mutations causing long QT syndrome and other cardiac channel disorders, which can explain some previously unexplained deaths in infants (SIDS) and children and adults (SUDS) and prevent others from occurring. This genetic knowledge, discovered posthumously in many cases, has implications for clinical care for surviving family members who might carry the same mutations. The information obtained from genetic testing, in the context of personal and family history, can guide individually tailored interventions that reduce risk and save lives. At the same time, obtaining and disclosing genetic information raises difficult issues about confidentiality and decision making within families. We draw on the experience of the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cardiogenetics, which has played a leading role in the genetic diagnosis and clinical management of cardiac channel diseases, to explore some of the challenging ethical questions arising in affected families with adolescent children. We focus on the related issues of (1) family confidentiality, privacy and disclosure and (2) adolescent decision making about genetic risk, and argue for the value of interdisciplinary dialogue with affected families in resolving these issues.",2012,10.1136/medethics-2011-100087,38,3,163-167,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Disclosure and Mutation and Humans and Adolescent and Adult and Infant and Decision Making and Privacy and Risk Reduction Behavior and Confidentiality and Psychology, Adolescent and Family/*psychology and Conflict, Psychological and Genetic Testing/*ethics and Arrhythmias, Cardiac/diagnosis/*genetics and Genetic Counseling and Sudden Infant Death/diagnosis/genetics",NA,NA,2012/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The interventions prescribed have become known as ""the Ashley treatment"" and involve the performance of invasive medical procedures (eg, hysterectomy) and oestrogen treatment. A central aim of the treatment is to restrict the growth of the child and thus make it easier for her parents to care for her at home. The paper below discusses the main objections to the treatment. It concludes that the most serious concern raised by the case is that it may set a worrying precedent if the moral principle employed in justification of the treatment is applied again to endorse it in similar circumstances. Finally, it raises the possibility that that same moral principle may even be invoked to justify more radical interventions than those that were actually performed in the Ashley treatment.",2008,10.1136/jme.2007.020743,34,5,341-343,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Child and *Quality of Life and Decision Making/*ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and Patient Advocacy/ethics and Bioethical Issues and Moral Obligations and *Disabled Children and Patient Rights/ethics and *Developmental Disabilities/psychology/therapy and Caregivers/ethics",NA,NA,2008/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is argued here that physicians should be permitted to exercise conscientious objections, but that they have a professional obligation to provide advance notification to patients about those objections. It is further argued here that public disclosure is an appropriate and ethically justifiable limit to the principle of advance notification. The argument for publicly disclosing physicians' conscientious objections is made in this paper by discussing three practical benefits of public disclosure in medicine, and then addressing how publicly disclosing physicians' conscientious objections is not an undue invasion of privacy. Three additional concerns with public disclosure of physicians' conscientious objections are briefly addressed--potential harassment of physicians, workplace discrimination, and mischaracterising physicians' professional aptitude--concluding that each of these concerns requires further deliberation in the realm of business ethics.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2013-101731,41,3,224-228,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"United States and Humans and Informed Consent and Ethics, Medical and *Privacy and Decision Making/ethics and *Dissent and Disputes and *Workplace and *Disclosure and *Religion and Medicine and *Moral Obligations and Clinical Ethics and Refusal to Treat/*ethics and Applied and Professional Ethics and Conscientious Objection and *Social Discrimination and Confidentiality/Privacy and Physicians/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards",NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: (1) A questionnaire survey, (2) interviews with secretaries and (3) on-site document reviews of HECs in Shanghai were used in the study, which surveyed 33 hospitals. RESULTS: In Shanghai, 57.56% of the surveyed hospitals established HECs from 1998 to 2005. Most HECs used bioethical review of research involving human subjects as well as bioethical review or consultation regarding medical care services and administrative decision- making. Of the surveyed HECs, 14.3% did not provide any formal bioethical training to the HECs' members and many HECs had no standard operating procedures. Some HECs had no clear definition of what was ""conflict of interest"" that should be considered by the HECs, while 44.4% of the HECs did not perform continuing review. DISCUSSION: After the issues of related national regulations, more and more hospitals established HECs in Shanghai, but the functions of HECs need to be further developed and formal training on bioethics should be provided to HEC members. To assure the independence and good performance of HECs, the conflict of interest procedure, the standard operating procedures and bioethical review should be improved.

Lim_2016_Joofmeet,JOUR,Clarifying the best interests standard: the elaborative and enumerative strategies in public policy-making,"Lim, Chong-Ming and Dunn, Michael C. and Chin, Jacqueline J.",Journal of medical ethics,"One recurring criticism of the best interests standard concerns its vagueness, and thus the inadequate guidance it offers to care providers. The lack of an agreed definition of 'best interests', together with the fact that several suggested considerations adopted in legislation or professional guidelines for doctors do not obviously apply across different groups of persons, result in decisions being made in murky waters. In response, bioethicists have attempted to specify the best interests standard, to reduce the indeterminacy surrounding medical decisions. In this paper, we discuss the bioethicists' response in relation to the state's possible role in clarifying the best interests standard. We identify and characterise two clarificatory strategies employed by bioethicists -elaborative and enumerative-and argue that the state should adopt the latter. Beyond the practical difficulties of the former strategy, a state adoption of it would inevitably be prejudicial in a pluralistic society. Given the gravity of best interests decisions, and the delicate task of respecting citizens with different understandings of best interests, only the enumerative strategy is viable. We argue that this does not commit the state to silence in providing guidance to and supporting healthcare providers, nor does it facilitate the abuse of the vulnerable. Finally, we address two methodological worries about adopting this approach at the state level. The adoption of the enumerative strategy is not defeatist in attitude, nor does it eventually collapse into (a form of) the elaborative strategy.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2016-103454,42,8,542-549,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Decision-making and Humans and Decision Making and Public Policy and Law and Guidelines as Topic and Evidence-Based Practice and *Policy Making and *Public Policy and Bioethics and Guideline Adherence/*ethics and *Public Health/ethics and Competence/incompetence and Health Services Research/*ethics and Political Philosophy,NA,NA,2016/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kuehlmeyer_2012_Joofmeet,JOUR,How family caregivers' medical and moral assumptions influence decision making for patients in the vegetative state: a qualitative interview study,"Kuehlmeyer, Katja and Borasio, Gian Domenico and Jox, Ralf J.",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Decisions on limiting life-sustaining treatment for patients in the vegetative state (VS) are emotionally and morally challenging. In Germany, doctors have to discuss, together with the legal surrogate (often a family member), whether the proposed treatment is in accordance with the patient's will. However, it is unknown whether family members of the patient in the VS actually base their decisions on the patient's wishes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of advance directives, orally expressed wishes, or the presumed will of patients in a VS for family caregivers' decisions on life-sustaining treatment. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A qualitative interview study with 14 next of kin of patients in a VS in a long-term care setting was conducted; 13 participants were the patient's legal surrogates. Interviews were analysed according to qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of family caregivers said that they were aware of aforementioned wishes of the patient that could be applied to the VS condition, but did not base their decisions primarily on these wishes. They gave three reasons for this: (a) the expectation of clinical improvement, (b) the caregivers' definition of life-sustaining treatments and (c) the moral obligation not to harm the patient. If the patient's wishes were not known or not revealed, the caregivers interpreted a will to live into the patient's survival and non-verbal behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Whether or not prior treatment wishes of patients in a VS are respected depends on their applicability, and also on the medical assumptions and moral attitudes of the surrogates.

Decisions at the end of life require the involvement of patient, families and healthcare professionals. The degree of involvement can vary depending on the professional and social culture of the unit. Nurses have an important role to play in caring for dying patients and their families; however, their knowledge is not always sought. OBJECTIVES: This study explored nurses' care practices at the end of life, with the objective of describing and identifying end of life care practices that nurses contribute to, with an emphasis on culture, religious experiences and professional identity. Research Design and context: Grounded theory was used. In all, 10 nurses from intensive care unit in two large hospitals in Bahrain were participated. Ethical Considerations: Approval to carry out the research was given by the Research Ethics Committee of the host institution, and the two hospitals. FINDINGS: A core category, Death Avoidance Talk, was emerged. This was supported by two major categories: (1) order-oriented care and (2) signalling death and care shifting. DISCUSSION: Death talk was avoided by the nurses, doctors and family members. When a decision was made by the medical team that a patient was not to be resuscitated, the nurses took this as a sign that death was imminent. This led to a process of signalling death to family and of shifting care to family members. CONCLUSION: Despite the avoidance of death talk and nurses' lack of professional autonomy, they created awareness that death was imminent to family members and ensured that end of life care was given in a culturally sensitive manner and aligned to Islamic values.",2017,10.1177/0969733016629771,24,8,950-961,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and grounded theory and End of life care and Workforce and Grounded Theory and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and Family/psychology and *Death and Nurses/*psychology and Terminal Care/*methods and nurses and intensive care and Bahrain and Islam/psychology and Islamic values,NA,NA,2017/12//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

One major argument in favour of procedural approaches is that substantial principles are indeterminate so that we can reasonably disagree about how to apply them. To deal with indeterminacy, we need a just decision process. In this paper I argue that it is a mistake to abandon substantial principles just because they are indeterminate. It is true that reasonable substantial principles designed to deal with healthcare rationing can be expected to be indeterminate. Yet, the indeterminacy is only partial. In some situations we can fully determine what to do in light of the principles, in some situations we cannot. The conclusion to draw from this fact is not that we need to develop procedural approaches to healthcare rationing, but rather that we need a more complex theory in which both substantial principles and procedural approaches are needed.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-102937,42,1,22-25,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Ethics and Humans and Concept Formation and Global Health and Ethics, Medical and *Decision Making/ethics and Ethical Analysis and *Ethical Theory and Philosophical Ethics and Health Care Rationing/*ethics and Resource Allocation and Allocation of Health Care Resources and Political Philosophy",NA,NA,2016/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

While some sources present it as an unquestionably positive attribute, others question both the veracity of its decisions and the effect of conscientious objection on patient access to health care. This paper argues that the right to object conscientiously should be broadened, subject to certain previsos, as there are many benefits to healthcare practice in the development of the consciences of practitioners. While effects such as the preservation of moral integrity are widely considered to benefit practitioners, this paper draws on the work of Hannah Arendt to offer several original arguments in defence of conscience that may more directly benefit patients, namely that a pang of conscience may be useful in rapidly unfolding situations in which there is no time to reflect satisfactorily upon activities and that, given the hierarchical nature of healthcare institutions, a right to defy authority on the basis of conscience may benefit junior staff who lack the institutional power to challenge the orders of superiors.",2012,10.1136/jme.2011.043653,38,1,13-17,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Human Rights and Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/ethics and Moral Obligations and Health Services Accessibility/*ethics and *Conscience and Quality of Health Care/*ethics and Refusal to Treat/ethics",NA,NA,2012/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To elicit the perceived influence of Islam upon the practice patterns of immigrant Muslim physicians in the USA. DESIGN: Ten face-to-face, in-depth, semistructured interviews with Muslim physicians from various backgrounds and specialties trained outside the USA and practising within the the country. Data were analysed according to the conventions of qualitative research using a modified grounded-theory approach. RESULTS: There were a variety of views on the role of Islam in medical practice. Several themes emerged from our interviews: (1) a trend to view Islam as enhancing virtuous professional behaviour; (2) the perception of Islam as influencing the scope of medical practice through setting boundaries on career choices, defining acceptable medical procedures and shaping social interactions with physician peers; (3) a perceived need for Islamic religious experts within Islamic medical ethical deliberation. LIMITATIONS: This is a pilot study intended to yield themes and hypotheses for further investigation and is not meant to fully characterise Muslim physicians at large. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant Muslim physicians practising within the USA perceive Islam to play a variable role within their clinical practice, from influencing interpersonal relations and character development to affecting specialty choice and procedures performed. Areas of ethical challenges identified include catering to populations with lifestyles at odds with Islamic teachings, end-of-life care and maintaining a faith identity within the culture of medicine. Further study of the interplay between Islam and Muslim medical practice and the manner and degree to which Islamic values and law inform ethical decision-making is needed.",2008,10.1136/jme.2007.021345,34,5,365-369,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,United States and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Pilot Projects and Qualitative Research and Cultural Characteristics and *Physicians and *Religion and Medicine and *Islam/psychology and Emigrants and Immigrants/psychology and Professional Practice/*ethics,NA,NA,2008/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Corfield_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Prepared for practice? UK Foundation doctors' confidence in dealing with ethical issues in the workplace,"Corfield, Lorraine and Williams, Richard Alun and Lavelle, Claire and Latcham, Natalie and Talash, Khojasta and Machin, Laura",Journal of medical ethics,"This paper investigates the medical law and ethics (MEL) learning needs of Foundation doctors (FYs) by means of a national survey developed in association with key stakeholders including the General Medical Council and Health Education England. Four hundred sevnty-nine doctors completed the survey. The average self-reported level of preparation in MEL was 63%. When asked to rate how confident they felt in approaching three cases of increasing ethical complexity, more FYs were fully confident in the more complex cases than in the more standard case. There was no apparent relationship with confidence and reported teaching at medical school. The less confident doctors were no more likely to ask for further teaching on the topic than the confident doctors. This suggests that FYs can be vulnerable when facing ethical decisions by being underprepared, not recognising their lack of ability to make a reasoned decision or by being overconfident. Educators need to be aware of this and provide practical MEL training based on trainee experiences and real-world ethics and challenge learners' views. Given the complexities of many ethical decisions, preparedness should not be seen as the ability to make a difficult decision but rather a recognition that such cases are difficult, that doubt is permissible and the solution may well be beyond the relatively inexperienced doctor. Educators and supervisors should therefore be ensuring that this is clear to their trainees. This necessitates an environment in which questions can be asked and uncertainty raised with the expectation of a supportive response.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105961,NA,NA,2019-105961-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and clinical ethics and education for health care professionals,NA,NA,2020/04/10/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Bravo_2018_Joofmeet,JOUR,Making medical decisions for an incompetent older adult when both a proxy and an advance directive are available: which is more likely to reflect the older adult's preferences?,"Bravo, Gina and Sene, Modou and Arcand, Marcel",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate which of two sources of information about an older adult's wishes-choices made in an advance directive or proxy's opinion-provides better insight into the older adult's preferences measured in hypothetical clinical situations involving decisional incapacity. METHODS: Secondary analyses of data collected from 157 community-dwelling, decisionally competent adults aged 70 years and over who attended a group information session on advance directives with their proxy. Older adults were invited to complete a directive introduced during the session, designed to express healthcare preferences. An average of 3 months later, older adults were asked during an interview whether they would want to receive each of four medical interventions and what their goals of care would be should they develop one of three sudden health events, assuming that they had severe dementia. Proxies were asked to guess the older adult's answers in each of the seven scenarios. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of the older adults completed the directive. Choices they made in the directive were more in line with the preferences they stated during the interview than were their proxies' guesses at their answers. However, concordance was relatively low, with percentages of agreement ranging from 43% to 83% across scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a directive might provide better insight into a person's wishes than the person's proxy, although neither source is perfect. A multifaceted decision-making model that includes both sources of information might better serve the interests of older adults who have lost the capacity to make decisions on their own.

Birchley_2018_Joofmeet,JOUR,Charlie Gard and the weight of parental rights to seek experimental treatment,"Birchley, Giles",Journal of medical ethics,"The case of Charlie Gard, an infant with a genetic illness whose parents sought experimental treatment in the USA, brought important debates about the moral status of parents and children to the public eye. After setting out the facts of the case, this article considers some of these debates through the lens of parental rights. Parental rights are most commonly based on the promotion of a child's welfare; however, in Charlie's case, promotion of Charlie's welfare cannot explain every fact of the case. Indeed, some seem most logically to extend from intrinsic parental rights, that is, parental rights that exist independent of welfare promotion. I observe that a strong claim for intrinsic parental rights can be built on arguments for genetic propriety and children's limited personhood. Critique of these arguments suggests the scope of parental rights remains limited: property rights entail proper use; non-personhood includes only a small cohort of very young or seriously intellectually disabled children and the uniqueness of parental genetic connection is limited. Moreover, there are cogent arguments about parents' competence to make judgements, and public interest arguments against allowing access to experimental treatment. Nevertheless, while arguments based on propriety may raise concerns about the attitude involved in envisioning children as property, I conclude that these arguments do appear to offer a prima facie case for a parental right to seek experimental treatment in certain limited circumstances.",2018,10.1136/medethics-2017-104718,44,7,448-452,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Male and Infant and Decision Making and children and Infant, Newborn and Parents/*psychology and Terminally Ill/*psychology and Disabled Children and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and minors/parental consent and Human Rights/*ethics and Medical Tourism/*ethics/psychology and quality/value of life/personhood and rights and Therapies, Investigational/*ethics/psychology",NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Cross-sectional postal survey. SETTING: Data collection via the secretary of the German Society for Palliative Medicine using the German language version of the EURELD survey instrument. SUBJECTS: All 1645 physician members of the German Society for Palliative Medicine. Main outcome measures Types and frequencies of limitation of treatment and possible determinants. RESULTS: 901 physicians participated in the study (response rate 55.8%). Participants reported limitation of treatment in 69.1% of cases. These decisions most often affected artificial nutrition (19%), chemotherapy (14%), antibiotics (11%) and medication other than antibiotics (11%). In the majority of eligible cases, physicians estimated the life-shortening effect of limitation of treatment to be <7 days. However, estimations differ depending on the medical measures in question. Bivariate statistical analysis indicated that withholding of treatment was performed significantly more frequently for patients aged <e2><89><a5>65 years (p=0.019). In addition, there were significant associations between the incidence of limitation of treatment and the different diseases reported by respondents as the underlying cause of death.

P. and Fagerlin, A.",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Recent research demonstrates that people sometimes make different medical decisions for others than they would make for themselves. This finding is particularly relevant to end-of-life decisions, which are often made by surrogates and require a trade-off between prolonging life and maintaining quality of life. We examine the impact of decision role, patient age, decision maker age and multiple individual differences on these treatment decisions. METHODS: Participants read a scenario about a terminally ill cancer patient faced with a choice between an aggressive chemotherapy regimen that will extend life by two years and palliative treatments to control discomfort for one remaining month. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three decision roles (patient, physician, or an abstract other) and the scenario randomly varied whether the patient was described as 25 or 65-years old. RESULTS: When deciding for a 65-year old patient, approximately 60% of participants selected aggressive chemotherapy regardless of decision role. When deciding for a 25-year old patient, however, participants were more likely to select chemotherapy for a patient (physician role) or another person (abstract other) than for themselves (70%, 67%, and 59%, respectively). In addition, confidence that powerful others (eg, physicians) control one's health, as well as respondents' age and race, consistently predicted treatment choices. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age appears to influence medical decisions made for others but not those that we make for ourselves.

RESEARCH QUESTION/OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to explore Iranian nurses' experience of disaster response and their perception of the competencies required by nurses in this environment. RESEARCH DESIGN: This article discusses the findings of a descriptive study conducted in Iran in 2012. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: This research was conducted in Iran in 2012. Participants included 35 nurses who had experience in healthcare delivery following a disaster event in the past 10 years, either in a hospital or out-of-hospital context. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This research study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. FINDINGS: From this study, five themes emerged as areas that nurses require competence in to work effectively in the disaster setting. This article focusses on one theme, the ethical and legal issues that arise during disaster response. Within the theme of ethical and legal issues, two sub-themes emerged. (1) Professional ethics explores professional responsibility of nurses as well as sense of ethical obligation. (2) Adherence to law refers to nurses' familiarity with and observation of legal requirements. DISCUSSION: This article adds to a growing pool of literature which explores the role of nurses in disasters. The findings of this study emphasize the need for nurses working in the disaster setting to be aware of professional responsibilities and familiar with legal requirements and the challenges related to observing ethical responsibilities.

Furthermore, we studied factors associated with these preferences and whether people's preferences concurred with the content of their AD. METHODS: A representative sample of the Dutch population (n=1402) and a cohort of people who own an AD, consisting of members of Right to Die-NL (NVVE, n=5661) and the Christian-orientated Nederlandse Patienten Vereniging (NPV, n=1059), answered written questionnaires in 2005 or 2007. We used two hypothetical scenarios, about cancer and dementia, and asked questions about continuing or forgoing four medical treatments. RESULTS: A majority of the Dutch public (62-87%) and NVVE members (88-99%) wanted to forgo the different treatments in both scenarios, while members of the NPV generally wanted to continue treatment (46-73%). In all three groups, in both scenarios, a substantial group (13-38%) had different preferences for the different treatments. People were more explicit in their preferences in case of dementia than in case of cancer. Being female, over 55 years of age, having had a higher education and having no (significant) religion increased the odds to refuse treatment.

B. and Clawson, L. and Kub, J. and Hughes, M. and Sulmasy, D. P.",Journal of medical ethics,"AIM: Patients with advanced cancer need information about end-of-life treatment options in order to make informed decisions. Clinicians vary in the frequency with which they initiate these discussions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a long-term longitudinal study, patients with an expected 2-year survival of less than 50% who had advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were interviewed. Each patient's medical record was reviewed at enrollment and at 3 months for evidence of the discussion of patient wishes concerning ventilator support, artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH), resuscitation (DNR) and hospice care. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was also performed and 2-year survival calculated. RESULTS: 60 cancer and 32 ALS patients were enrolled. ALS patients were more likely than cancer patients to have evidence of discussion about their wishes for ventilator support (31% vs 0%, p<0.001), ANH (38% vs 0%, p<0.001), DNR (25% vs 0%, p<0.001) and hospice care (22% vs 5%, p = 0.03). At 6 months, 91% of ALS patients were alive compared with 62% of cancer patients; at 2 years, 63% of ALS patients were alive compared with 23% of cancer patients (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients were less likely than ALS patients to have had documented advanced care planning discussions despite worse survival. This may reflect perceptions that ALS has a more predictable course, that advanced cancer has a greater number of treatment options, or differing views about hope.

Of all the healthcare professions, nursing is especially prone to burnout, compassion fatigue and reduced compassion satisfaction, due to the tensions resulting from the physical and psychological stress of caring for extremely ill patients. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the professional quality of life of clinical nurses in Korea and the relationship between their experiences in ethical dilemmas and professional values. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample consisting of 488 clinical nurses. We used four questionnaires to measure the participants' demographic characteristics, experiences in ethical dilemmas, professional nursing values and professional quality of life (ProQOL assessment, Version 5). Ethical considerations: This study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Bronco Memorial Hospital. Written informed consent was given by all participants. RESULTS: The nurses' professional quality of life was affected by ethical dilemmas and professional nursing values. The factors influencing compassion satisfaction were age, client domain of ethical dilemmas, social awareness, professionalism of nursing and the roles of nursing services in professional values. The factors influencing burnout were marital status (married), religion (yes), human life domain, professional work domain of ethical dilemmas, social awareness and the role of nursing services in nursing professional values. The factors influencing secondary traumatic stress were human life domain, client domain and the professional work domain of ethical dilemmas.

Sadooghiasl_2018_Nursethi,JOUR,Concept analysis of moral courage in nursing: A hybrid model,"Sadooghiasl, Afsaneh and Parvizy, Soroor and Ebadi, Abbas",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: Moral courage is one of the most fundamental virtues in the nursing profession, however, little attention has been paid to it. As a result, no exact and clear definition of moral courage has ever been accessible. OBJECTIVE: This study is carried out for the purposes of defining and clarifying its concept in the nursing profession. METHODS: This study used a hybrid model of concept analysis comprising three phases, namely, a theoretical phase, field work phase, and a final analysis phase. To find relevant literature, electronic search of valid databases was utilized using keywords related to the concept of courage. Field work data were collected over an 11 months' time period from 2013 to 2014. In the field work phase, in-depth interviews were performed with 10 nurses. The conventional content analysis was used in two theoretical and field work phases using Graneheim and Lundman stages, and the results were combined in the final analysis phase. Ethical consideration: Permission for this study was obtained from the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Oral and written informed consent was received from the participants. RESULTS: From the sum of 750 gained titles in theoretical phase, 26 texts were analyzed. The analysis resulted in 494 codes in text analysis and 226 codes in interview analysis. The literature review in the theoretical phase revealed two features of inherent-transcendental characteristics, two of which possessed a difficult nature. Working in the field phase added moral self-actualization characteristic, rationalism, spiritual beliefs, and scientific-professional qualifications to the feature of the concept. CONCLUSION: Moral courage is a pure and prominent characteristic of human beings. The antecedents of moral courage include model orientation, model acceptance, rationalism, individual excellence, acquiring academic and professional qualification, spiritual beliefs, organizational support, organizational repression, and internal and external personal barriers.

German courts revisit an old problem in a new context,"Pfeifer, Ulrich and Horn, Ruth",Journal of medical ethics,"This article discusses a recent ruling by the German Federal Court concerning medical professional liability due to potentially unlawful clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) at the end of life. This case raises important ethical and legal questions regarding a third person's right to judge the value of another person's life and the concept of 'wrongful life'. In our brief report, we discuss the concepts of the 'value of life' and wrongful life, which were evoked by the court, and how these concepts apply to the present case. We examine whether and to what extent value-of-life judgements can be avoided in medical decision-making. The wrongful-life concept is crucial to the understanding of this case. It deals with the question whether life, even when suffering is involved, could ever be worse than death. The effects of this ruling on medical and legal practice in Germany are to be seen. It seems likely that it will discourage claims for compensation following life-sustaining treatment (LST). However, it is unclear to what extent physicians' decisions will be affected, especially those concerning withdrawal of CANH.

This topic was examined by contacting 473 medical directors of German psychiatric hospitals and departments. They were asked to complete a questionnaire developed by us. That form contained questions about the incidence and acceptance of joint crisis plans and psychiatric advance directives and previous experiences with them. 108 medical directors of psychiatric hospitals and departments responded (response rate: 22.8%). Their answers demonstrate that in their hospitals these documents are rarely used. Among the respondents, joint crisis plans are more accepted than psychiatric advance directives. There is a certain uncertainty when dealing with these instruments. Our main conclusion is that German psychiatry needs an intensified discussion on the use of instruments for patients to constitute procedures for future critical psychiatric events. For this purpose it will be helpful to collect more empirical data.

M.",Journal of medical ethics,"A recurrent issue in the vast amount of literature on reasoning models in ethics is the role and nature of moral intuitions. In this paper, we start from the view that people who work and live in a certain moral practice usually possess specific moral wisdom. If we manage to incorporate their moral intuitions in ethical reasoning, we can arrive at judgements and (modest) theories that grasp a moral experience that generally cannot be found outside the practice. Reflective equilibrium (RE) provides a framework for balancing moral intuitions, ethical principles and general theories. Nevertheless, persisting problems associated with the use of intuitions need to be addressed. One is the objection that moral intuitions lack the credibility necessary to guide moral reasoning. Ethicists have tried to solve this problem by formulating criteria to separate the ""bad"" intuitions from the ""good"" ones at the beginning of the reasoning process. We call this the credible input-justified outcome strategy. An example is the appeal to the common morality by Beauchamp and Childress. We think this approach is unsuccessful. As an alternative, we outline the good reasoning-justified outcome strategy. It connects to a variant of RE in which intuitions from different sources are incorporated. We argue that the elements of RE have different levels of justificatory power at the start of reasoning. In our strategy, each element can gain or lose justificatory power when it is tested in a reasoning process that meets several criteria.",2009,10.1136/jme.2008.026559,35,4,234-237,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and *Ethics, Medical and *Morals and Decision Making/*ethics and Ethical Relativism and Ethical Analysis/*methods",NA,NA,2009/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Weisleder_2008_Joofmeet,JOUR,Physicians as healthcare surrogate for terminally ill children,"Weisleder, P.",Journal of medical ethics,"The parents of some terminally ill children have reported that being asked to authorise removal of life-sustaining measures is akin to being requested to sign a ""death warrant"". This dilemma leaves families not only enduring the grief of losing a loved one, but also with feelings of ambivalence, anxiety and guilt. A straightforward method by which the parents of terminally ill children can entrust the role of healthcare surrogate to the treating physician is presented. The cornerstone of this paradigm is parental awareness that the physician will act in the child's best interest, even if that means discontinuing life-sustaining measures. The goal is to mitigate parental guilt and fear of misperception, by self and others, of having given up on their child. From a moral standpoint this concept is an appealing option as it conforms to the four basic principles of medical ethics. While laws in the USA and several European nations prevent members of the medical team from taking on the responsibilities of healthcare surrogate for terminally ill patients, formal and informal precedence for this option already exists in France, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Canadian province of Manitoba.",2008,10.1136/jme.2007.023051,34,9,e8,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Child and Decision Making and Attitude to Death and Child, Hospitalized/*psychology and Parents/psychology and Professional-Family Relations and Terminal Care/*ethics and Physician's Role/*psychology and Third-Party Consent/*ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics/psychology",NA,NA,2008/09//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Kara_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,Applicability of the principle of respect for autonomy: the perspective of Turkey,"Kara, Mahmut Alpertunga",Journal of medical ethics,"Turkey has a complex character, which has differences from the Western world or Eastern Asia as well as common points. Even after more than a century of efforts to modernise and integrate with the West, Turkish society has values that are different from those of the West, as well as having Western values. It is worth questioning whether ordinary Turkish people show an individualistic character. The principle of respect for individual autonomy arises from a perception of oneself as an individual, and the person's situation may affect the applicability of the principle. Patients who perceive themselves to be members of a community rather than free persons and who prefer to participate in the common decisions of the community and to consider the common interest and the common value system of the community concerning problems of their life (except healthcare or biomedical research) rather than to decide as independent, rational individuals may not be competent to make an autonomous choice. Expectations that such patients will behave as autonomous individuals may be unjustified. The family, rather than the patient, may take a primary role in decisions.

Criteria for a critical appraisal of empirical research for use in ethics,"Strech, Daniel",Journal of medical ethics,"Most contributions to the current debate about the consideration and application of empirical information in ethics scholarship deal with epistemological issues such as the role and the meaning of empirical research in ethical reasoning. Despite the increased publication of empirical data in ethics literature we still lack systematic analyses and conceptual frameworks that would help us to understand the rarely discussed methodological and practical problems in appraising empirical research. This paper demonstrates the need for critical appraisal and its crucial methodological role in the application of empirical information in ethical reasoning. Furthermore, it systematically examines the criteria and the appropriate appraisal of empirical research and the associated challenges by highlighting current problems in empirical ethics literature. These problems reveal the following challenges for a critical and responsible consideration of empirical information in ethical reasoning: (i) training in the basic skills of locating and communicating empirical data from the relevant studies; (ii) training in basic knowledge of how to critically appraise empirical (qualitative and quantitative) research and its results; (iii) determination of quality standards for empirical ethics research; (iv) adequate reporting of the methodology and results of empirical ethics research in scientific journals.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.033225,36,4,222-225,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and *Ethics, Medical and Decision Making/*ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and *Empirical Research and Evidence-Based Medicine/*ethics and Patient Participation/methods",NA,NA,2010/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

K.",Journal of medical ethics,"This paper looks at the issue of consent from children and whether the test of Gillick competency, applied in medical and healthcare practice, ought to extend to participation in research. It is argued that the relatively broad usage of the test of Gillick competency in the medical context should not be considered applicable for use in research. The question of who would and could determine Gillick competency in research raises further concerns relating to the training of the researcher to make such a decision as well as to the obvious issue of the researcher's personal interest in the project and possibility of benefiting from the outcome. These could affect the judgment of Gillick competency if the researcher is charged with making this decision. The above notwithstanding, there are two exceptional research situations in which Gillick competency might be legitimately applied: (1) when the research is likely to generate significant advantages for the participants while exposing them to relatively minor risks, and (2) when it is likely to generate great societal benefit, pose minimal risks for the participants and yet raise parental objection. In both cases, to ensure that autonomy is genuinely respected and to protect against personal interest, Gillick competency should be assessed by an individual who has no interest or involvement in the research.",2007,10.1136/jme.2006.018853,33,11,659-662,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,Humans and Child and Personal Autonomy and *Decision Making and Informed Consent/*ethics and Biomedical Research/*ethics and *Mental Competency/psychology and Judgment/ethics and Minors/psychology,NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

The data have prompted concern that financial incentives associated with insurance status might influence American physicians' decisions to perform Caesarean deliveries. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differences in medical risk factors account for the apparent Caesarean rate discrepancy between Medicaid and privately insured patients in Michigan, USA. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed of 617 269 live birth deliveries in Michigan hospitals during 2004-8. All live birth records that were able to be linked to their mothers' hospital discharge records were utilised. Diagnosis-related group codes from the hospitalisation records were used to identify Caesarean deliveries. Regression models determined Caesarean probability for the time period under study, adjusted for insurance type, maternal age, race, maternal medical conditions, multiple births, prematurity and birth weight. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2008, Caesarean rates were 33% for privately insured patients and 29% for Medicaid patients. The probability of Caesarean delivery was significantly greater for privately insured than Medicaid patients on univariate analysis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.22) but not on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02). CONCLUSION: No significant disparity was found in the odds of Caesarean delivery between privately insured and Medicaid patients in Michigan after adjusting for other Caesarean risk factors. A positive disparity would have provided de facto evidence that financial incentives play a role in physician decision-making regarding Caesarean delivery.",2012,10.1136/medethics-2011-100209,38,8,470-473,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"United States and Humans and Regression Analysis and Female and Adult and Retrospective Studies and Risk Factors and Pregnancy and Analysis of Variance and Odds Ratio and Decision Making/ethics and Insurance Coverage/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Choice Behavior/*ethics and Cesarean Section/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Diagnosis-Related Groups/statistics & numerical data and Insurance, Health/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Medicaid/economics/*statistics & numerical data and Medically Uninsured/statistics & numerical data and Michigan/epidemiology and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*economics/ethics and Private Sector/*statistics & numerical data and Public Sector/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2012/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Seller_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Situating requests for medical aid in dying within the broader context of end-of-life care: ethical considerations,"Seller, Lori and Bouthillier, Marie-Eve and Fraser, Veronique",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Medical aid in dying (MAiD) was introduced in Quebec in 2015. Quebec clinical guidelines recommend that MAiD be approached as a last resort when other care options are insufficient; however, the law sets no such requirement. To date, little is known about when and how requests for MAiD are situated in the broader context of decision-making in end-of-life care; the timing of MAiD raises potential ethical issues. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all MAiD requests between December 2015 and June 2017 at two Quebec hospitals and one long-term care centre was conducted to explore the relationship between routine end-of-life care practices and the timing of MAiD requests. RESULTS: Of 80 patients requesting MAiD, 54% (43) received the intervention. The median number of days between the request for MAiD and the patient's death was 6 days. The majority of palliative care consults (32%) came less than 7 days prior to the MAiD request and in another 25% of cases occurred the day of or after MAiD was requested. 35% of patients had no level of intervention form, or it was documented as 1 or 2 (prolongation of life remains a priority) at the time of the MAiD request and 19% were receiving life-prolonging interventions. INTERPRETATION: We highlight ethical considerations relating to the timing of MAiD requests within the broader context of end-of-life care. Whether or not MAiD is conceptualised as morally distinct from other end-of-life options is likely to influence clinicians' approach to requests for MAiD as well as the ethical importance of our findings. We suggest that in the wake of the 2015 legislation, requests for MAiD have not always appeared to come after an exploration of other options as professional practice guidelines recommend.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-104982,45,2,106-111,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Retrospective Studies and Aged and Time Factors and Decision Making and regulation and Aged, 80 and over and Palliative Care and Quebec and euthanasia and palliative care and Terminal Care/*ethics/methods/psychology and Suicide, Assisted/*ethics/psychology and end of life care",NA,NA,2019/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

AIM: This paper reports the findings of a study of the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, conducted as part of a study of the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions. The findings for hospitals, home care and nursing homes are described and compared. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to 1509 nurses, employed in 73 hospitals, 55 home care organisations and 63 nursing homes. 1179 responses (78.1%) were suitable for analysis. The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 106 nurses, with a response rate of 85%. RESULTS: In 37.0% of cases, the nurse was the first person with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Consultation between physicians and nurses during the decision-making process took place quite often in hospitals (78.8%) and nursing homes (81.3%) and less frequently in home care situations (41.2%). In some cases (12.2%), nurses administered the euthanatics. CONCLUSIONS: The results show substantial differences between the intramural sector (hospitals and nursing homes) and the extramural sector (home care), which are probably linked to the organisational structure of the institutions.

It is a primary step in involving underage patients and families in care and lays the foundation for obtaining parental permission and patient assent for treatment. In practice child participation in care is often difficult to obtain due to patients' different and sometimes fluctuating preferences, but also parents' protective strategies. Physicians may be susceptible to parental wishes to limit information and feel uncomfortable discussing issues related to uncertainty of cure with patients. A qualitative study in Romanian paediatric oncology units was conducted to explore children's involvement from the perspectives of parents and oncologists. Interviews with participants discussed 18 patient cases. Data were transcribed and thematic analysis was used to interpret and mine patients' involvement during treatment. Different facets of patient participation were identified: restricting, widening and enhancing involvement. A fourth category, unintentional involvement, occurred for all patients due to children's observations during long-term hospitalisations and access to Internet. Uncertainty overarched parental attitudes regarding the extent to which children should be included. Physicians usually complied with parental wishes to limit involvement, but together with parents involved patients at least in a practical way. Adults' protective attitude may backfire, as adolescents' online searches often expose patients to worse-case scenarios. Further research should acknowledge the hazards of restricted diagnosis disclosure and develop clinician tools to support families in communicating with patients.

Contemporary ethical guidelines for critical care give ambiguous advice, largely because they focus on the moral equivalence of withdrawing and withholding care without confronting the very real differences regarding who is aware and informed of intervention options and how patient values are communicated and enacted. In withholding care, doctors typically withhold information about interventions judged too futile to offer. They thus retain greater decision-making burden (and power) and face weaker obligations to secure consent from patients or proxies. In withdrawing care, there is a clearer imperative for the doctor to include patients (or proxies) in decisions, share information and secure consent, even when continued life support is deemed futile. How decisions to withhold and withdraw life support differ ethically in their implications for positive versus negative interpretations of patient autonomy, imperatives for consent, definitions of futility and the subjective evaluation of (and submission to) benefits and burdens of life support in critical care settings are explored. Professional reflection is required to respond to trends favouring a more positive interpretation of patient autonomy in the context of life support decisions in critical care. Both the bioethics and critical care communities should investigate the possibilities and limits of growing pressure for doctors to disclose their reasoning or seek patient consent when decisions to withhold life support are made.",2007,10.1136/jme.2006.017038,33,4,215-218,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,Humans and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Consensus and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Informed Consent/ethics and Critical Care/*ethics and Terminal Care/ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics and Treatment Refusal/ethics,NA,NA,2007/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Even when working with accurate information, some nevertheless remain resolute in demanding maximal treatment. They maintain that even if survival after cardiac arrest with CPR is extremely low, the fact remains that it is still greater than the probability of survival after cardiac arrest without CPR (ie, zero). Without realising it, this line of reasoning is strikingly similar to Pascal's Wager, a Renaissance-era argument for accepting the proposition for God's existence. But while the original argument is quite logical-if not universally compelling-the modern variant makes several erroneous assumptions. The authors here present a case of a patient who unwittingly appeals to Pascal's Wager to explain his request for maximal treatment, in order to highlight the crucial divergences from the original Wager.

The technological paradigm is challenged by a social-liberal political ideology in postmodern Western societies. The question raised in this study was as follows: Which arguments, attitudes, values and paradoxes between modern and postmodern tendencies concerning treatment and care of older persons with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator appear in the literature? AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe and interpret how the field of tension concerning older persons with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator - especially end-of-life issues - has been expressed in the literature throughout the last decade. METHODS: Paul Ricoeur's reflexive interpretive approach was used to extract the meaningful content of the literature involving qualitative, quantitative and normative literature. Analysis and interpretation involved naive reading, structural analysis and critical interpretation. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The investigation complied with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS: The unifying theme was 'Normativity under change'. The sub-themes were 'Death has become legitimate', 'The technological imperative is challenged' and 'Patients and healthcare professionals need to talk about end-of-life issues'. There seems to be a considerable distance between the normative approach of how practice ought to be and findings in empirical studies. CONCLUSION: Modern as well as postmodern attitudes and perceptions illustrate contradictory tendencies regarding deactivation of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator and replacement of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator in older persons nearing the end of life. The tendencies challenge each other in a struggle to gain position. On the other hand, they can also complement each other because professionalism and health professional expertise cannot stand alone when the patient's life is at stake but must be unfolded in an alliance with the patient who needs to be understood and accepted in his vulnerability.",2016,10.1177/0969733014564906,23,3,328-338,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Aged and ethics and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and sociology and older people and Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics and end of life and Terminal Care/*ethics and Refusal to Treat/ethics and Defibrillators, Implantable/*ethics and Dilemmas and implantable cardioverter defibrillator",NA,NA,2016/05//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are no industry-wide best practices, and many companies that have granted compassionate use, or 'preapproval', access to their investigational products have done so without fanfare and without divulging the process or grounds on which decisions were made. The number of compassionate use requests has increased over time. Driving the demand are new treatments for serious unmet medical needs; patient advocacy groups pressing for access to emerging treatments; internet platforms enabling broad awareness of compelling cases or novel drugs and a lack of trust among some that the pharmaceutical industry and/or the FDA have patients' best interests in mind. High-profile cases in the media have highlighted the gap between patient expectations for compassionate use and company utilisation of fair processes to adjudicate requests. With many pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient groups, healthcare providers and policy analysts unhappy with the inequities of the status quo, fairer and more ethical management of compassionate use requests was needed.

Elger_2015_Joofmeet,JOUR,Paternalistic breaches of confidentiality in prison: mental health professionals' attitudes and justifications,"Elger, Bernice Simone and Handtke, Violet and Wangmo, Tenzin",Journal of medical ethics,"AIM: This manuscript presents mental health practitioners' (MHPs) practice, attitudes and justifications for breaching confidentiality when imprisoned patients disclose suicidal thoughts or abuse by others. METHODS: 24 MHPs working in Swiss prisons shared their experiences regarding confidentiality practices. The data were analysed qualitatively and MHPs' attitudes and course of action were identified. RESULTS: Analysis revealed paternalistic breaches of confidentiality. When patients reported suicidal thoughts and abuse, MHPs believed that forgoing confidentiality is necessary to protect patients, providing several justifications for it. Patients were informed that such information will be transmitted without their consent to medical and non-medical prison personnel. With reference to suicidal attempts, MHPs resorted to methods that may reduce suicidal attempts such as transfer to hospital or internal changes in living arrangements, which would require provision of certain information to prison guards. In cases of abuse, some MHPs convinced patients to accept intervention or sometimes overrode competent patients' refusals to report. Also in the case of abuse, provision of limited information to other prison personnel was seen as an acceptable method to protect patients from further harm. DISCUSSION: Breaches of confidentiality, whether limited or full, remain unethical, when used for competent patients based solely on paternalistic justifications. Institutionalising ethical and legal procedures to address suicidal and abuse situations would be helpful. Education and training to help both medical and prison personnel to respond to such situations in an appropriate manner that ensures confidentiality and protects patients from suicide and abuse are necessary.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2013-101981,41,6,496-500,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Ethics and Suicide and Humans and Male and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Confidentiality and Suicidal Ideation and Switzerland and *Prisoners and Suicide/*prevention & control and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Mental Competency and Health Personnel/*ethics and Truth Disclosure/*ethics and Confidentiality/*ethics and Health Professionals and *Paternalism/ethics and *Prisons and *Violence and Abuse and Forensic Medicine,NA,NA,2015/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Hunt_2011_Joofmeet,JOUR,Moral experience: a framework for bioethics research,"Hunt, Matthew R. and Carnevale, Franco A.",Journal of medical ethics,"Theoretical and empirical research in bioethics frequently focuses on ethical dilemmas or problems. This paper draws on anthropological and phenomenological sources to develop an alternative framework for bioethical enquiry that allows examination of a broader range of how the moral is experienced in the everyday lives of individuals and groups. Our account of moral experience is subjective and hermeneutic. We define moral experience as ""Encompassing a person's sense that values that he or she deem important are being realised or thwarted in everyday life. This includes a person's interpretations of a lived encounter, or a set of lived encounters, that fall on spectrums of right-wrong, good-bad or just-unjust"". In our conceptualisation, moral experience is not limited to situations that are heavily freighted with ethically-troubling ramifications or are sources of debate and disagreement. Important aspects of moral experience are played out in mundane and everyday settings. Moral experience provides a research framework, the scope of which extends beyond the evaluation of ethical dilemmas, processes of moral justification and decision-making, and moral distress.

METHODS: Philosopher-ethicist-led interprofessional team ethics rounds concerning dialysis patient care problems were applied at three Swedish hospitals. The philosophers were instructed to promote mutual understanding and stimulate ethical reflection, without giving any recommendations or solutions. Interviews with seven doctors and 11 nurses were conducted regarding their experiences from the rounds, which were then analysed using content analysis. FINDINGS: The goal of the rounds was partly fulfilled. Participants described both positive and negative experiences. Good rounds included stimulation to broadened thinking, a sense of connecting, strengthened confidence to act, insight into moral responsibility and emotional relief. Negative experiences were associated with a sense of unconcern and alienation, as well as frustration with the lack of solutions and a sense of resignation that change is not possible. The findings suggest that the ethics rounds above all met the need of a forum for crossing over professional boundaries. The philosophers seemed to play an important role in structuring and stimulating reasoned arguments. The nurses' expectation that solutions to the ethical problems would be sought despite explicit instructions to the contrary was conspicuous. CONCLUSION: When assisting healthcare professionals to learn a way through ethical problems in patient care, a balance should be found between ethical analyses, conflict resolution and problem solving. A model based on the findings is presented.",2008,10.1136/jme.2006.019810,34,5,399-406,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Sweden and Aged, 80 and over and Attitude of Health Personnel and Professional Role and *Decision Support Techniques and Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Decision Making/*ethics and *Physician-Nurse Relations and Conflict, Psychological and Group Processes and Terminal Care/ethics/methods and Medical Staff, Hospital/*psychology and Ethics, Clinical/*education and Renal Dialysis/ethics",NA,NA,2008/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

S.",Journal of medical ethics,"AIM: This study explores priority dilemmas in dialysis treatment and care offered elderly patients within the Norwegian public healthcare system. BACKGROUND: Inadequate healthcare due to advanced age is frequently reported in Norway. The Norwegian guidelines for healthcare priorities state that age alone is not a relevant criterion. However, chronological age, if it affects the risk or effect of medical treatment, can be a legitimate criterion. METHOD: A qualitative approach is used. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analysed through hermeneutical content analysis. The informants were five physicians and four nurses from dialysis wards. FINDINGS: Pressing priority dilemmas centre around decision-making concerning withholding and withdrawal of dialysis treatment. Advanced age is rarely an absolute or sole priority criterion. It seems, however, that advanced age appears to be a more subtle criterion in relation with, for example, comorbidity, functional status and cognitive impairment. Nurses primarily prioritise specialised dialysis care and not comprehensive nursing care. The complex needs of elderly patients are therefore often not always met. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical priorities should be made more transparent in order to secure legitimate and fair resource allocation in dialysis treatment and care. Difficult decisions concerning withholding or withdrawal of dialysis ought to be openly discussed within the healthcare team as well as with patients and significant others. The biomedical focus and limitations on comprehensive care during dialysis should be debated.",2008,10.1136/jme.2007.022061,34,8,585-589,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Aged and Delivery of Health Care and Norway and Aged, 80 and over and Age Factors and Attitude of Health Personnel and Decision Making/*ethics and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Public Health/ethics and Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy and Life Support Care/instrumentation and Renal Dialysis/*ethics",NA,NA,2008/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the prevalent moral issues in this profession is moral distress. Moral distress appears more in intensive care units due to the widespread need for moral decision-making regarding treatment and care in emergency situations. In this connection, organizational justice is of high importance and, as a significant motivational tool, leaves important impacts upon attitude and behavior of personnel. AIM/OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigation of the relationship between perceived organizational justice and moral distress in intensive care unit nurses. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a descriptive-correlational research which examined the relationship between perceived organizational justice and moral distress in intensive care unit nurses. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A total of 284 intensive care unit nurses were selected via census sampling. The data were collected through questionnaires and then were analyzed via SPSS-20 using Pearson and Spearman correlation tests. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Medical Research. Completion of informed consent form, guarantee of the confidentiality of information, explanation on purposes of the research, and voluntary participation in the study were moral considerations observed in this study. FINDINGS: There was a statistically significant negative correlation between the total perceived organizational justice and the total moral distress (p = 0.024, r = -0.137) and also between ""procedural and interactional justice and errors"" and ""not respecting the ethics principles."" Meanwhile, no relationship was found by the findings between distributive justice and dimensions of moral distress. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the study, there was a reverse significant relationship between moral distress and perceived organizational justice; therefore, the head nurses are expected to contribute to reduce moral distress and to increase perceived organizational justice in nurses.",2019,10.1177/0969733017712082,26,2,460-470,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Surveys and Questionnaires and procedural justice and Iran and Attitude of Health Personnel and Job Satisfaction and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration and *Perception and Nurses/*psychology and moral distress and *Organizational Culture and Stress, Psychological/*etiology/psychology and Distributive justice and intensive care unit nurses and interactional justice and perceived organizational justice and Social Justice/*psychology/standards",NA,NA,2019/03//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Paradis_2010_Joofmeet,JOUR,A pilot study to examine research subjects' perception of participating in research in the emergency department,"Paradis, Carmen and Phelan, Michael P. and Brinich, Margaret",Journal of medical ethics,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: The emergency department (ED) provides an arena for patient enrollment into a variety of research studies even for non-critically ill patients. Given the types of illness, time constraints and sense of urgency that exists in the ED environment, concern exists about whether research subjects in the ED can provide full consent for participation. We sought to identify enrolled research subjects' perspectives on the informed consent process for research conducted in the ED. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of ED subjects, 18&emsp14;years or older, who had been approached to participate in research in the ED and who were judged to have decision-making capacity. Exclusions were critical illness and refusal to participate. Subjective were followed up within 1&emsp14;week after enrolling using structured phone interviews by trained interviewers. RESULTS: During the study period, 229 eligible patients were approached to participate in both a target study and this study. Of these, 66% (150/229) agreed to participate in this study, at least to the extent of allowing us access to their demographic data. The study participant group was similar in terms of gender to this particular ED's patient population but had significantly more African-Americans and persons older than 45. CONCLUSION: Despite rigorous time constraints and rapid throughput times, the majority of subjects who consented to research participation in the ED felt that they were sufficiently informed and had adequate time to decide to participate.",2010,10.1136/jme.2009.032904,36,10,580-587,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Decision Making and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Motivation and Prospective Studies and Patient Participation/*psychology and *Emergency Medical Services and Informed Consent/psychology and *Biomedical Research and Research Subjects/*psychology,NA,NA,2010/10//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Longitudinal comparison with similar 1987 and 1993 studies. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional postal survey of doctors in Victoria. RESULTS: 53% of doctors in Victoria support the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia.

The discussion canvasses what is at stake morally and clinically in each of these cases and explores clinician-patient interactions, dynamics in relationships between consulting physicians and consultant psychiatrists, patient transference, and physician countertransference. The article defines legalism and countertransference and argues that an ethically and clinically important consequence of these phenomena for patients is distortion of clinicians' perceptions of patients' decisions and vulnerabilities.

Many have assumed that advance directives would lack moral authority if dementia truly produced a complete discontinuity in personal identity, such that the predementia individual is a separate individual from the postdementia individual. I argue that even if dementia were to undermine personal identity, the continuity of the body and the predementia individual's rights over that body can support the moral authority of advance directives. I propose that the predementia individual retains posthumous rights over her body that she acquired through historical embodiment in that body, and further argue that claims grounded in historical embodiment can sometimes override or exclude moral claims grounded in current embodiment. I close by considering how advance directives grounded in historical embodiment might be employed in practice and what they would and would not justify.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-104971,45,4,249-256,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and dementia and Human Rights and Third-Party Consent and Personal Autonomy and *Mental Competency and Decision Making/*ethics and advance directives and Dissent and Disputes and *Dementia and Personhood and Bioethical Issues and Moral Obligations and Advance Directives/*ethics and bioethics and Advance Directive Adherence/*ethics,NA,NA,2019/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

He argues that psychiatric disorders do not necessarily impair decision-making ability, that they are not necessarily treatable and that legalising PAS for psychiatric patients would not diminish research and therapeutic interest in psychiatric treatments or impair their recovery through loss of hope. However, by erasing distinction between somatic and psychiatric disorders on those grounds, he also erases distinction between healthy adults and patients (whether somatic or psychiatric) essentially implying that PAS should be available to all, for all reasons or, ultimately no reason. Furthermore, as psychiatric patients are much more likely to be a source of usable organs for transplantation, their broad inclusion would strengthen the link between PAS/euthanasia and organ donation, potentially undermining both as well as diminishing already declining general trust in medical authorities and professionals and public health authorities and activists.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106089,NA,NA,2020-106089-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,euthanasia and transplantation and public health ethics and suicide/assisted suicide and dead donor rule,NA,NA,2020/03/27/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet resolution of such conflicts demands much effort of both the medical team and parents. OBJECTIVE: To discuss who can best protect a child's interests, which often becomes a central issue, putting considerable pressure on mutual trust and partnership. METHODS: We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy with acquired brain damage due to autoimmune-mediated encephalitis whose parents wanted to stop treatment. By comparing this case with relevant literature, we systematically explored the pros and cons of sharing end-of-life decisions with parents in cases where treatment is considered futile by parents and not (yet) by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing end-of-life decisions with parents is a more important duty for physicians than protecting parents from guilt or doubt. Moreover, a request from parents on behalf of their child to discontinue treatment is, and should be, hard to over-rule in cases with significant prognostic uncertainty and/or in cases with divergent opinions within the medical team.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2013-101395,41,2,195-200,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Male and Child, Preschool and Physician-Patient Relations and Family and Decision Making/*ethics and Dissent and Disputes and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Minors/Parental Consent and End of Life Care and Allowing Minors to Die and Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy/mortality and Continuity of Patient Care/standards and Encephalitis/*drug therapy/mortality and Parental Consent/*ethics/psychology and Right to Refuse Treatment",NA,NA,2015/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lynoe_2014_Joofmeet,JOUR,Physicians' practices when frustrating patients' needs: a comparative study of restrictiveness in offering abortion and sedation therapy,"Lynoe, Niels",Journal of medical ethics,"In this paper it is argued that physicians' restrictive attitudes in offering abortions during 1946-1965 in Sweden were due to their private values. The values, however, were rarely presented openly. Instead physicians' values influenced their assessment of the facts presented--that is, the women's' trustworthiness. In this manner the physicians were able to conceal their private values and impede the women from getting what they wanted and needed. The practice was concealed from both patients and physicians and never publicly discussed. It is also argued that a similar tacit practice could currently be applied by palliative care physicians. Such practice might allow palliative care physicians to be restrictive when offering sedation therapy without appearing paternalistic or declaring conscientious objections. However, the practice runs counter to patients' right to participate in making decisions. The women seeking abortion began to oppose the situation and eventually a new abortion law was introduced 1975. Patients at the end of life will never be able to protest against palliative care physicians' restrictive attitudes. This is a vulnerable and weak group, unable to lodge complaints after the treatment. In order to respect patients' autonomy, even suffering patients at the end of their lives, it is suggested that physicians should openly declare their values when it comes to providing treatments that might shorten life. Such transparency might facilitate more genuine shared decision-making and accordingly less suboptimal end-of-life care.",2014,10.1136/medethics-2012-101194,40,5,306-309,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Time Factors and Paternalism and Attitude to Death and Palliative Care and Ethics, Medical and Poland and *Attitude of Health Personnel and Decision Making/*ethics and *Vulnerable Populations and Sweden/epidemiology and Physician-Patient Relations/ethics and Autonomy and *Social Values and Physicians/*ethics and Applied and Professional Ethics and End of Life Care and *Abortion, Legal/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/trends and *Deep Sedation/ethics/methods and *Palliative Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods and *Practice Patterns, Physicians'/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards/trends and *Terminal Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods and Abortion Counselling",NA,NA,2014/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

I attach my Advance Decision to Refuse Life Prolonging Treatment to the online version of this paper for comment advice and possible general interest. I argue that while a Supreme Court judgement in 2013, followed by a Court of Protection judgement in 2015 greatly ameliorate my earlier concerns about excessive judicial emphasis on the sanctity of life, certain current requirements in the Code of Practice to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and in the Rules of the Court of Protection, especially Practice Direction 9E, concerning permanent vegetative state and minimally conscious state, seem clearly to contradict aspects of that Supreme Court judgement. If the logical implications of those legal requirements were thoroughly implemented medical practice would be substantially and undesirably skewed towards provision of treatments to prolong life that are unwanted, non-beneficial and wasteful of healthcare resources.

We argue that criminalisation of doctors in this way is fraught with ethical tensions at levels of individual blameworthiness, systemic failures, professionalism, patient safety and at the interface of the regulator and doctor. The current response to alleged manslaughter during clinical care is not fit for purpose because of its narrow focus on criminalisation and punishment of individual doctors. The justice system fails to take into account systemic issues in a sufficiently proper and informed way particularly in respect of human factors involved in decision-making. It is easier to convict individual doctors for gross negligence manslaughter than it is to effect legal accountability upon organisations. If educational reflections are used to apportion blame, then this could impact detrimentally on honesty and the duty of candour, with negative implications for patient safety. Regulatory processes should not be deployed without consideration of context. There is an urgent need for a fresh and open evaluation of professional and societal expectations from the regulator that should include positive action as well as those that are proportionately punitive. Justice and patient safety would be served better by more sophisticated contextualisation through an approach that balances accountability in healthcare with failures that can occur within complex systems, and by working to a radical shift towards a just culture.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2018-104938,45,1,10-14,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Male and Child and ethics and regulation and United Kingdom and medical error and negligence and *Malpractice/legislation & jurisprudence and Homicide/*legislation & jurisprudence and Physicians/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence and professional misconduct,NA,NA,2019/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Epanomeritakis_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Moral ambivalence towards the Cancer Drugs Fund,"Epanomeritakis, Ilias Ektor",Journal of medical ethics,"The UK's Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) was introduced in 2010 following the Conservative Party's promise to address the fact that numerous efficacious cancer drugs were not available because of their cost ineffectiveness, as deduced by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. While, at face value, this policy appears only to promote the UK's public welfare, a deeper analysis reveals the ethically unjustifiable inconsistencies that the CDF introduces; where is the analogous fund for other equally severe diseases? Have the patients without cancer been neglected simply due to the fear-inducing advertising and particularly ferocious speech which surrounds cancer? The CDF is unjustifiable when challenged by such questions. However, it is troubling to think that the CDF might be repealed in order to abolish these ethical concerns. Intuitively, one feels uncomfortable stripping the cancer patient of their benefits just so that they might be on an equally pessimistic footing with others. In the present essay, I argue that, although there are no ethically justifiable grounds for the CDF's introduction, its removal would be inappropriate. Following this realisation, I investigate whether the procedural steps of the CDF itself-theoretically removed from the context of resource distribution for all disease types-represent an ethically justifiable system.

Charlie's parents chose one horn of that moral dilemma and the courts, like Charlie Gard's doctors, chose the other horn. Contrary to the first UK court's assertion, supported by all the higher courts that considered it, that its judgement was 'objective', this paper argues that the judgement was not and could not be 'objective' in the sense of objectively correct but was instead a value judgement based on the judge's choice of one horn of the moral dilemma. While that horn was morally justified so too was the horn chosen by the parents. The court could and should have avoided depriving the parents of their normal moral and legal right and responsibility to decide on their child's best interests. Instead, this paper argues that the court should have acknowledged the lawfulness of both horns of the moral dilemma and added to its judgement that Charlie Gard's doctors were not legally obliged to provide treatment that they believed to be against their patient's best interests the additional judgement that Charlie's parents could lawfully transfer his care to other doctors prepared to offer the infant a trial of the experimental treatment requested by his parents.",2018,10.1136/medethics-2017-104723,44,7,462-465,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Male and Infant and law and Decision Making/*ethics and Parents/*psychology and Terminally Ill/*psychology and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and clinical ethics and care of dying minors and applied and professional ethics and Patient Rights/*ethics and attitudes towards death and Disabled Children/*psychology and Medical Futility/*psychology,NA,NA,2018/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
McMahon.Parkes_2013_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Rationality, religion and refusal of treatment in an ambulance revisited","McMahon-Parkes, Kate",Journal of medical ethics,"In their recent article, Erbay et al considered whether a seriously injured patient should be able to refuse treatment if the refusal was based on a (mis)interpretation of religious doctrine. They argued that in such a case 'what is important...is whether the teaching or philosophy used as a reference point has been in fact correctly perceived' (p 653). If it has not been, they asserted that this eroded the patient's capacity to make an autonomous decision and that therefore, in such cases, it is the role of the healthcare professional (HCP) to 'assist patients to think more clearly and rationally' (p 653). There are, however, a number of problems with the reasons why Erbay et al suggest we should help patients to rationalise their decisions and how HCPs should go about this. In this article, the author explores some of their main arguments regarding consent and rationality (particularly in relation to religious beliefs), as well as Erbay et al's normative claim that HCPs have an obligation to promote autonomy by helping patients to come to a 'rational' decision. Ultimately, the author agrees that the (temporary) solution to the dilemma presented in this scenario (which was to insert an intravenous cannula into the patient in order to allow an infusion of fluids in the event that he changed his mind) seemed both pragmatic and ethically permissible.

By way of background, we begin by briefly presenting two conceptual approaches to 'health' and 'disease': objectivism (ie, based on biological facts) and constructivism (ie, based on human values). The basic challenge under both is sorting out whether and to what extent social and environmental factors have a role in helping to define what qualifies as a 'serious' disease beyond the medical criteria. We then focus on how a human rights framework (eg, right to science and right to the highest attainable health) could integrate the concepts of objectivism and constructivism so as to provide guidance for a more actionable consideration of 'serious'. Ultimately, it could be argued that a human rights framework, by way of its legally binding nature and its globally accepted norms and values, provides a more universal foundation for discussions of the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging or disruptive technologies.",2019,10.1136/medethics-2019-105436,45,8,508-513,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Health Policy and ethics and Pregnancy and *Genetic Predisposition to Disease and Decision Making/*ethics and Embryo Research/*ethics and Genetic Counseling and concept of health and Gene Editing/*ethics/trends and Gene Targeting/*ethics and gene therapy/transfer and genethics and genetic engineering and Germ Cells and Human Rights/ethics and Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*ethics/trends",NA,NA,2019/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Saarni_2008_Joofmeet,JOUR,Ethically problematic treatment decisions in different medical specialties,"Saarni, S. I. and Halila, R. and Palmu, P. and Vanska, J.",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Ethical dilemmas are an integral part of medicine. Whether physicians actually feel that they have made ethically problematic treatment decisions or choices in their work is largely unknown. Identifying physicians with ethical problems, and the types of problems and underlying factors, might benefit organisational and educational efforts to help physicians solve ethical dilemmas in a constructive way. We investigated how the frequency and types of ethically difficult treatment decisions vary by specialty. METHOD: A mail survey of all non-retired Finnish physicians (n = 17,172, response rate 75.6%) was conducted in 2004. Of those who had made any ethically problematic treatment decisions, the types of decisions and reasons given for these decisions were asked for. Factor analysis was used to investigate clustering of ethically problematic treatment decisions, and logistic regression to investigate the effect of specialty, adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: Psychiatrists experienced ethically problematic treatment decisions most frequently, followed by pulmonologists, internists and neurologists. Problems were reported least often by pathologists, laboratory physicians and ophthalmologists. Overtreatment was more common than undertreatment in most specialties, with the exception of psychiatrists who emphasised undertreatment and patient rights issues. CONCLUSION: Physicians of different specialties differ significantly regarding frequency and types of ethically problematic treatment decisions they have made. Psychiatrists differ from all other specialists in reporting more undertreatment and patient rights issues. Experiencing ethically problematic decisions might affect the quality of care and physician well-being in many ways. The findings could be useful for both under- and postgraduate ethics education.",2008,10.1136/jme.2007.020529,34,4,262-267,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Health Care Surveys and Finland and *Decision Making and *Ethics, Medical and *Specialization and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Health Care Rationing/*ethics",NA,NA,2008/04//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This disclosure may itself induce adverse effects through expectancy mechanisms known as nocebo effects, contradicting the principle of nonmaleficence. Rigorous research suggests that providing patients with a detailed enumeration of every possible adverse event-especially subjective self-appraised symptoms-can actually increase side effects. Describing one version of what might happen (clinical ""facts"") may actually create outcomes that are different from what would have happened without this information (another version of ""facts""). This essay argues that the perceived tension between balancing informed consent with nonmaleficence might be resolved by recognizing that adverse effects have no clear black or white ""truth.""

Intensive care unit nurses are potentially exposed to this phenomenon. A deep study of the phenomenon can help prevent and treat it. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at determining the frequency, degree, level of exposure, and type of ethical conflict among nurses working in the intensive care units. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross-sectional research. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In total, 382 nurses working in the intensive care units in Iranian hospitals were selected using the random sampling method. Data were collected using the Ethical Conflict in Nursing Questionnaire-Critical Care Version (Persian version). ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee. Ethical considerations such as completing the informed consent form, ensuring confidentiality of information, and voluntary participation were observed. FINDINGS: The results showed that the average level of exposure to ethical conflict was 164.39 <c2><b1> 79.06. The most frequent conflict was related to ""using resources despite believing in its futility,"" with the frequency of at least once a week or a month (68.6%, n = 262). The most conflictive situation was violation of privacy (76.9%, n = 294). However, the level of exposure to ethical conflict according to the theoretical model followed was the situation of ""working with incompetent staff."" The most frequently observed type of conflict was moral dilemma. CONCLUSION: The moderate level of exposure to ethical conflict was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, the frequency, degree, and type of ethical conflict were different compared to the results of other studies. Recognizing ethical conflict among intensive care unit nurses can be useful as it allows to consolidate those measures that favor low levels of ethical conflict, design appropriate strategies to prevent ethical conflicts, and improve the nursing work environment.",2019,10.1177/0969733018796686,26,7-8,2225-2238,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Cross-Sectional Studies and Surveys and Questionnaires and Iran and Attitude of Health Personnel and *Ethics, Nursing and moral distress and Nurses/*psychology/statistics & numerical data and nurses and intensive care units and Critical Care Nursing/*ethics/methods/standards and Ethical conflict and Intensive Care Units/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data and moral dilemma and Workplace/psychology/standards",NA,NA,2019/12//Nov undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

William",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of cognitive impairment and frailty complicates the feasibility of advance care planning in the long-term-care population. Research aim: To identify challenges in implementing the 'Let Me Decide' advance care planning programme in long-term-care. RESEARCH DESIGN: This feasibility study had two phases: (1) staff education on advance care planning and (2) structured advance care planning by staff with residents and families. Participants and research context: long-term-care residents in two nursing homes and one community hospital. Ethical considerations: The local research ethics committee granted ethical approval. FINDINGS: Following implementation, over 50% of all residents had completed some form of end-of-life care plan. Of the 70 residents who died in the post-implementation period, 14% had no care plan, 10% (with capacity) completed an advance care directive and lacking such capacity, 76% had an end-of-life care plan completed for them by the medical team, following discussions with the resident (if able) and family. The considerable logistical challenge of releasing staff for training triggered development of an e-learning programme to facilitate training. DISCUSSION: The challenges encountered were largely concerned with preserving resident's autonomy, avoiding harm and suboptimal or crisis decision-making, and ensuring residents were treated fairly through optimisation of finite resources. CONCLUSIONS: Although it may be too late for many long-term-care residents to complete their own advance care directive, the ' Let Me Decide' programme includes a feasible and acceptable option for structured end-of-life care planning for residents with variable capacity to complete an advance care directive, involving discussion with the resident (to the extent they were able) and their family.

DESIGN: A 2-year prospective survey. SETTING: A 12-bed PICU at the Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, Lille, France. PATIENTS: Were included when limitation of treatments was expected. RESULTS: Of 967 children admitted, 55 were included with a 2-day median delay. They were younger than others (24 v 60 months), had a higher paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score (14 v 4), and a higher paediatric overall performance category (POPC) score at admission (2 v 1); all p<0.002. 34 (50% of total deaths) children died. A limitation decision was made without meeting for 7 children who died: 6 received do-not-resuscitate orders (DNROs) and 1 received withholding decision. Decision-making meetings were organised for 31 children, and the following decisions were made: 12 DNROs (6 deaths and 6 survivals), 4 withholding (1 death and 3 survivals), with 14 withdrawing (14 deaths) and 1 continuing treatment (survival). After limitation, 21 (31% of total deaths) children died and 10 survived (POPC score 4). 13 procedures were interrupted because of death and 11 because of clinical improvement (POPC score 4). Parents' opinions were obtained after 4 family conferences (for a total of 110 min), 3 days after inclusion. The first meeting was planned for 6 days after inclusion and held on the 7th day after inclusion; 80% of parents were immediately informed of the decision, which was implemented after half a day. CONCLUSIONS: GFRUPs procedure was applicable in most cases. The main difficulties were anticipating the correct date for the meeting and involving nurses in the procedure.

Rivera.Lopez_2017_Joofmeet,JOUR,Is medically assisted death a special obligation?,"Rivera-Lopez, Eduardo",Journal of medical ethics,"Several distinct arguments conclude that terminally ill patients have a right to a medically assisted death; two are especially influential: the autonomy argument and the non-harm argument. Both have proven convincing to many, but not to those who view the duty not to kill as an (almost) absolute constraint. Some philosophers see the source of such a constraint in general (deontological) moral principles, other in the nature of the medical profession. My aim in this paper is not to add one further argument in favour of medically assisted death. Rather, I want to shed light on a kind of reason that, to my mind, has not been previously highlighted or defended, and that might shake the principled conviction that doctors are never allowed to actively assist their patients to die. Specifically, my purpose is to show that doctors (as members of the medical profession) have a special duty to provide medically assisted death to consenting terminally ill patients, because (and insofar as) they have been participants in the process leading to the situation in which a patient can reasonably ask to die. In some specific ways (to be explained), they are involved in the tragic fate of those patients and, therefore, are not morally allowed to straightforwardly refuse to assist them to die.",2017,10.1136/medethics-2016-103575,43,6,401-406,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Attitude of Health Personnel and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Mental Competency and Terminally Ill/*psychology and *Moral Obligations and Ethical Analysis and *Physician's Role/psychology and Euthanasia and Philosophical Ethics and Right to Die/*ethics and Euthanasia, Active, Voluntary/*ethics/psychology",NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Significant differences have been found between doctors' ethical attitude to clinical nudging and that of patients. We show how these differences weaken the argument for nudging from public support.

Bringedal_2011_Joofmeet,JOUR,On the relevance of personal responsibility in priority setting: a cross-sectional survey among Norwegian medical doctors,"Bringedal, Berit and Feiring, Eli",Journal of medical ethics,"The debate on responsibility for health takes place within political philosophy and in policy setting. It is increasingly relevant in the context of rationing scarce resources as a substantial, and growing, proportion of diseases in high-income countries is attributable to lifestyle. Until now, empirical studies of medical professionals' attitudes towards personal responsibility for health as a component of prioritisation have been lacking. This paper explores to what extent Norwegian physicians find personal responsibility for health relevant in prioritisation and what type of risk behaviour they consider relevant in such decisions. The proportion who agree that it should count varies from 17.1% ('Healthcare priority should depend on the patient's responsibility for the disease') to 26.9% ('Access to scarce organ transplants should depend on the patient's responsibility for the disease'). Higher age and being male is positively correlated with acceptance. The doctors are more willing to consider substance use in priority setting decisions than choices on food and exercise. The findings reveal that a sizeable proportion have beliefs that conflict with the norms stated in the Norwegian Patient Act. It may be possible that the implementation of legal regulations can be hindered by the opposing attitudes among doctors. A further debate on the role personal responsibility should play in priority setting seems warranted. However, given the deep controversies about the concept of health responsibility and its application, it would be wise to proceed with caution.

Availability of critical care beds has become a hot topic, and in many countries, we have seen a huge increase in the provision of temporary intensive care bed capacity. However, there is a limit where the hospitals may run out of resources to provide critical care, which is heavily dependent on trained staff, just-in-time supply chains for clinical consumables and drugs and advanced equipment. In the first (good) phase, we can still do clinical prioritisation and decision-making as usual, based on the need for intensive care and prognostication: what are the odds for a good result with regard to survival and quality of life. In the next (bad phase), the resources are mostly available, but the system is stressed by many patients arriving over a short time period and auxiliary beds in different places in the hospital being used. We may have to abandon admittance of patients with doubtful prognosis. In the last (ugly) phase, usual medical triage and priority setting may not be sufficient to decrease inflow and there may not be enough intensive care unit beds available.

Su_2014_Joofmeet,JOUR,When ethical reform became law: the constitutional concerns raised by recent legislation in Taiwan,"Su, Yi-Chen",Journal of medical ethics,"In an effort at ethical reform, Taiwan recently revised the Hospice Palliative Care Law authorising family members or physicians to make surrogate decisions to discontinue life-sustaining treatment if an incompetent terminally ill patient did not express their wishes while still competent. In particular, Article 7 of the new law authorises the palliative care team, namely the physicians, to act as sole decision-makers on behalf of the incompetent terminally ill patient's best interests if no family member is available. However, the law fails to provide guidance as to what constitutes the patient's best interests or what specific procedures the treating physicians should follow, and so has raised constitutional concerns. It may be difficult to translate ethical reform into law but it is not impossible if essential requirements are carefully followed. First, there must be substantial nexus between the purpose of the statute and the measures provided under the statute. Second, advocates need to convince the public that futility or waste has amounted to a public health emergency so as to justify lower procedural requirements.

In this article, we first review previously implemented medical product and personnel allocation systems, examining their applicability to cellular therapy provider shortages to demonstrate that this problem requires a novel approach. We then present an innovative system for allocating cellular therapy access, which accounts for the constraints of distribution during real-world oncology practice by using a combination of the following principles: (1) maximising life-years per personnel time, (2) youngest and robust first, (3) sickest first, (4) first come/first served and (5) instrumental value.

However, nurses usually experience ethical dilemmas over using physical restraint because they need to weigh patient autonomy against patient safety. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore factors behind ethical dilemmas for critical care nurses over using physical restraint for patients. DESIGN: This is a qualitative study using conventional content analysis approach, as suggested by Graneheim and Lundman, to analyze the data. METHODS: Seventeen critical care nurses were purposefully recruited from the four intensive care units in Tehran, Iran. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and were concurrently analyzed through conventional content analysis as suggested by Graneheim and Lundman. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran with the code: IR.IUMS.REC.1397.795. Before interviews, participants were provided with explanations about the aim of the study, the confidentiality of the data, their freedom to participate, and the right to withdraw the study, and their free access to the study findings. Finally, their consents were obtained, and interviews were started. RESULTS: Factors behind ethical dilemmas for critical care nurses over using physical restraint were categorized into three main categories, namely the outcomes of using physical restraint, the outcomes of not using physical restraint, and emotional distress for nurses. The outcomes of using physical restraint were categorized into the three subcategories of ensuring patient safety, physical damage to patients, and mental damage to the patient. The outcomes of not using physical restraint fell into two subcategories, namely the risks associated with not using physical restraint and legal problems for nurses. Finally, the two subcategories of the emotional distress for nurses main category were nurses' negative feelings about restraint use and uncertainty over the decision on physical restraint use. CONCLUSION: Decision-making for restraint use is often associated with ethical dilemmas, because nurses need to weight the outcomes of its use against the outcomes of not using it and also consider patient safety and autonomy.

Trobec_2015_Nursethi,JOUR,Developing nursing ethical competences online versus in the traditional classroom,"Trobec, Irena and Starcic, Andreja Istenic",Nursing ethics,"BACKGROUND: The development of society and science, especially medical science, gives rise to new moral and ethical challenges in healthcare. RESEARCH QUESTION/OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: In order to respond to the contemporary challenges that require autonomous decision-making in different work contexts, a pedagogical experiment was conducted to identify the readiness and responsiveness of current organisation of nursing higher education in Slovenia. It compared the successfulness of active learning methods online (experimental group) and in the traditional classroom (control group) and their impact on the ethical competences of nursing students. The hypothesis set in the experiment, hypothesis 1 (the experimental group will be successful and will have good achievements in comprehension and application of ethical principles) was confirmed based on pre-tests and post-tests. The hypothesis tested by the questionnaire, hypothesis 2 (according to the students, the active learning methods online in the experimental group have a positive impact on the development of ethical competences) was confirmed. RESEARCH DESIGN: The pedagogical experiment was supported by a multiple-case study that enabled the in-depth analysis of the students' attitudes towards the active learning methods in both settings. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: The study included Slovenian first-year nursing students (N = 211) of all the enrolled students (N = 225) at the University of Ljubljana and University of Primorska in the academic year 2010/2011. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Before the study ethical permission was obtained from the managements of both participating faculties. The students were given all the necessary information of the experiment before the tutorials. FINDINGS: No significant difference was found between the two learning settings and both had a positive impact upon learning. The results of the content analysis show that the students' active engagement with the active learning methods in the group enables the development of ethical competences and the related communicative competences, interpersonal skills, collaboration and critical thinking. DISCUSSION: Active learning methods in the settings compared, online and the traditional classroom, enabled the development of a higher level of knowledge defined by the ability of critical thinking and reflective response, the core of ethical competences. Students develop ethical competence through active engagement in a group work, role play and discussion, and there is no difference between online or traditional learning settings. CONCLUSION: In the healthcare, it is crucial for providers to be capable of making autonomous decisions and managing various communication situations and contexts in which the moral attitudes and ethical sensibility are essential.",2015,10.1177/0969733014533241,22,3,352-366,eng,1477-0989 0969-7330,"Communication and Humans and Female and Male and experiment and Attitude to Computers and healthcare and online learning and Attitude of Health Personnel and Teaching/*standards and *Learning and Slovenia and Students, Nursing/*psychology and Ethics, Nursing/*education and Active learning methods and ethical competences and multiple-case study and Online Systems/standards",NA,NA,2015/05//undefined,Nurs Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ethical guidelines and socio-cultural public awareness exist for modern samples, whereas for ancient mummy studies both are de facto lacking. This is particularly striking considering the fact that examinations are done without informed consent or that the investigations are invasive due to technological aspects and that it affects personality traits. The aim of this study is to show the pro and contra arguments of ancient mummy research from an ethical point of view with a particular focus on the various stakeholders involved in this research. Relevant stakeholders in addition to the examined individual are, for example, a particular researcher, and the science community in general, likely descendents of the mummy or any future generation. Our broad discussion of the moral dilemma of mummy research should help to extract relevant decision-making criteria for any such study in future. We specifically do not make any recommendations about how to rate these decision-factors, since this is highly dependent on temporal and cultural affiliations of the involved researcher. The sustainability of modern mummy research is dependent on ethical orientation, which can only be given and eventually settled in an interdisciplinary approach such as the one we attempt to present here.",2010,10.1136/jme.2010.036608,36,10,608-613,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Morals and *Ethics, Research and Informed Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Bioethical Issues and *Mummies",NA,NA,2010/10//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Banerjee_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,Ordering suicide: media reporting of family assisted suicide in Britain,"Banerjee, Albert and Birenbaum-Carmeli, Daphna",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the presentation of suffering and support for euthanasia in the British news media. METHOD: Data was retrieved by searching the British newspaper database LexisNexis from 1996 to 2000. Twenty-nine articles covering three cases of family assisted suicide (FAS) were found. Presentations of suffering were analysed employing Heidegger's distinction between technological ordering and poetic revealing. FINDINGS: With few exceptions, the press constructed the complex terrain of FAS as an orderly or orderable performance. This was enabled by containing the contradictions of FAS through a number of journalistic strategies: treating degenerative dying as an aberrant condition, smoothing over botched attempts, locating the object of ethical evaluation in persons, not contexts, abbreviating the decision making process, constructing community consensus and marginalising opposing views. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the view that news reporting of FAS is not neutral or inconsequential. In particular, those reports presenting FAS as an orderly, rational performance were biased in favor of technical solutions by way of the legalisation of euthanasia and/or the involvement of medical professionals. In contrast, while news reports sensitive to contradiction did not necessarily oppose euthanasia, they were less inclined to overtly support technical solutions, recognising the importance of a trial to address the complexity of FAS.",2007,10.1136/jme.2007.020776,33,11,639-642,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,"Humans and Female and Male and Publication Bias and Publishing/standards and *Attitude to Death and *Family/psychology and *Mass Media and Suicide, Assisted/*psychology",NA,NA,2007/11//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article discusses ethical questions related to controlled and uncontrolled NHBD. It argues that certain preparative measures, such as giving anticoagulants, should be acceptable before patients are dead, but when they have passed a point where further curative treatment is futile, they are in the process of dying and they are unconscious. Furthermore, the article discusses consequences of technological developments based on improvement of a chest compression apparatus used today to make mechanical heart resuscitation. Such technological development can be used to transform cases of non-controlled NHBD to controlled NHBD. In our view, this is a step forward since the ethical difficulties related to controlled NHBD are easier to solve than those related to non-controlled NHBD.

Persad et al argue that their system is the product of a successful process of reflective equilibrium-a philosophical methodology whereby theories, principles and considered judgements are balanced with each other and revised until we achieve an acceptable coherence between our various beliefs. Yet I argue that many of the principles and intuitions underpinning CLF conflict with each other, and that Persad et al have failed to achieve an acceptable coherence between them.

This does not mean that all Dutch neonatologists are willing to engage in such behaviour. This paper discusses the use of neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) in connection with abstention decisions in neonatology and the boundaries between 'deliberate ending of life' and other end-of-life decisions. These boundaries are of paramount importance because, of all end-of-life decisions, only 'deliberate ending of life' must be reported by the responsible doctor and exposes him to the risk of being prosecuted. METHODS: 14 Dutch neonatologists were presented with a hypothetical case of a severely asphyxiated baby who faces a long dying process after withdrawal of 'medically futile' (zinloos) life-sustaining ventilation. Doctors were asked whether it is acceptable to administer NMBs in this situation and whether such behaviour should be reported. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Doctors' responses were heterogeneous, showing that the acceptability of using NMBs in certain situations and the boundaries between end-of-life decisions are currently a subject of discussion among Dutch neonatologists. Many respondents reported feeling threatened by the potential involvement of the criminal law authorities in the system of control over 'deliberate ending of life'.",2011,10.1136/jme.2010.037267,37,1,29-33,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Attitude of Health Personnel and Infant, Newborn and Netherlands and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal and Decision Making/*ethics and Withholding Treatment/*ethics and Medical Futility/ethics and Neonatology/*ethics and Euthanasia/*ethics and Infant, Newborn, Diseases/*drug therapy and Neuromuscular Blocking Agents/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,2011/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

'Fertility preservation' for children who have not yet reached puberty involves surgically removing and cryopreserving reproductive tissue prior to treatment in the expectation that strategies for the use of this tissue will be developed in the future. Fertility preservation for prepubertal children is ethically complex because the techniques largely lack proven efficacy for this age group. There is professional difference of opinion about whether it is ethical to offer such 'experimental' procedures. The question addressed in this paper is: when, if ever, is it ethically justifiable to offer fertility preservation surgery to prepubertal children? We present the ethical concerns about prepubertal fertility preservation, drawing both on existing literature and our experience discussing this issue with clinicians in clinical ethics case consultations. We argue that offering the procedure is ethically justifiable in certain circumstances. For many children, the balance of benefits and burdens is such that the procedure is ethically permissible but not ethically required; when the procedure is medically safe, it is the parents' decision to make, with appropriate information and guidance from the treating clinicians.

In doing so, it reinforces the protection afforded to informed consent and autonomous patient decision making under the law of negligence. However, some commentators have expressed a concern that the widening of the healthcare providers' duty of disclosure may provide impetus, in future cases, for courts to adopt a more rigorous approach to the application of causation principles.

My guiding question is how such interventions can be ethically justified within the bounds of contemporary bioethical mainstream that places great weight on the patient's informed consent. The answer that is standardly given today is that patients should be informed about the identity effects, thus suggesting that changes in identity can be treated like 'normal' side effects. In the paper, I argue that this approach is seriously lacking because it misses important complexities going along with decisions involving identity changes and consequently runs into mistakes. As a remedy I propose a new approach, the 'perspective-sensitive account', which avoids these mistakes and thus provides the conceptual resources to systematically reflect on and give a valid consent to identity-changing interventions.",2017,10.1136/medethics-2016-103684,43,6,384-390,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Humans and Personality Assessment and Adaptation, Psychological and Quality of Life and Informed Consent and Personal Autonomy and *Personality and Informed Consent/*ethics and *Social Behavior and Patient Education as Topic/*ethics and *Life Change Events and *Deep Brain Stimulation/adverse effects/psychology and *Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/psychology and Deep Brain Stimulation and Neuroethics",NA,NA,2017/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: To review the different ethical issues involved in cancer and palliative care in developing countries, with special reference to India. METHODS: Published literature on pain relief and palliative care in the developing countries was reviewed to identify ethical issues and dilemmas related to these, and ways in which ethical principles could be observed in delivery of palliative care in such countries are discussed. RESULTS: The literature review revealed a number of ethical dilemmas and challenges that professionals, cancer patients and their families encountered during palliative care. It was noted that patients' preferences and decisions are influenced by family members. Dilemmas leave the professionals and families confused about how ethical their actions have been. Specific ethical issues were noted in relation to the availability and use of oral morphine for pain relief, spiritual care, lack of adequate palliative care services, and palliative care education. CONCLUSIONS: The four principles of ethics posed difficulties in understanding the complex ethical issues in a developing country with a traditional background.

A recent issue of FT for patients who are blind has arisen. Some bioethicists recommend not excluding a patient who is blind, as this may amount to discrimination. From an ethical standpoint, FT for those with blindness is appropriate in selected candidates. This article seeks to add to the clinical evidence supporting FT for those with blindness by detailing a complementary psychosocial perspective. Currently, there is little relevant research about the subjectivity of the blind. This is critical since the arguments against FT for the blind refer to their inability to see their face and to view the reaction of others to their disfigured faces. We begin with a brief look at examples of FT involving blindness and associated arguments. The next part is a multidisciplinary investigation of the experiences of the blind. These are gleaned from a close reading of the literature and drawing inferences, as direct studies are rare. The discussion analyses identity themes of the blind in relation to their faces: as they experience it; the face they wish to show to the world; and how others perceive and react to their face in a saturated environment of imagery and visual communication. Disability and the blind person's experience of faces are well-founded considerations for medical practitioners and ethics boards in the process of FT decision-making.",2018,10.1136/medethics-2017-104560,44,6,361-365,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and ethics and Adaptation, Psychological and disability and Interpersonal Relations and Self Concept and psychology and Patient Selection/*ethics and transplantation and Facial Transplantation/*ethics/psychology and persons and Recognition, Psychology/physiology and Touch/physiology and Visual Perception/physiology and Visually Impaired Persons/*psychology",NA,NA,2018/06//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Barsky_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Parental manual ventilation in resource-limited settings: an ethical controversy,"Barsky, Emily and Sayeed, Sadath",Journal of medical ethics,"Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. Children in low-income countries are disproportionately affected. This is in large part due to limitations in healthcare resources and medical technologies. Mechanical ventilation can be a life-saving therapy for many children with acute respiratory failure. The scarcity of functioning ventilators in low-income countries results in countless preventable deaths. Some hospitals have attempted to adapt to this scarcity by using hand-bag ventilation, as either a bridge to a mechanical ventilator, or until clinical improvement occurs rendering mechanical ventilation no longer necessary. In instances of hand-bag ventilation, an endotracheal tube is first placed. Family members are then asked to play the role of a ventilator, manually compressing a bag repeatedly to inflate the child's lungs. This approach is fraught with numerous ethical challenges. A careful examination of the data and a nuanced approach to the ethical considerations are imperative. Ethical arguments in support of and in opposition to allowing parental hand-bag ventilation are explored, including the best interests of the child, the child's right to an open future, beneficence and parental protection, legitimising substandard care, and finally, contextual concerns.

Kontos_2019_Joofmeet,JOUR,Ethics of Incongruity: moral tension generators in clinical medicine,"Kontos, Nicholas",Journal of medical ethics,"Affectively uncomfortable concern, anxiety, indecisionand disputation over 'right' action are among the expressions of moral tension associated with ethical dilemmas. Moral tension is generated and experienced by people. While ethical principles, rules and situations must be worked through in any dilemma, each occurs against a backdrop of people who enact them and stand much to gain or lose depending on how they are applied and resolved. This paper attempts to develop a taxonomy of moral tension based on its intrapersonal and interpersonal sources and expressions. The proposed 'ethics of incongruity' (EoI) outlines ways in which values, actions and needs can find themselves mismatched in morally relevant ways between patients and their clinicians, their own psychologies and their societies. Patient-clinician incongruities may manifest as discord, value misalignment and deception. Patient-patient (ie, intrapersonal) incongruities may manifest as incapacity, akrasia and self-deception. Patient-society incongruities may manifest as disenfranchisement, disaffiliation and disregard. Brief explanations of the incongruities in this scheme are provided, as are suggestions on working within them. Using concepts from moral philosophy when applicable, these suggestions may either ease direct resolution of problems arising from the incongruities, or make sense of the moral tension that arises from the human context of the ethical dilemma at hand. This presentation of content and resolution methods for the EOI is no doubt incomplete.

We examined how transplant providers weigh the importance of social support for kidney transplantation compared with other factors, and variation by clinical role and personal beliefs. METHODS: The National survey of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the Society of Transplant Social Work in 2016. Using a discrete choice approach, respondents compared two hypothetical patient profiles and selected one for transplantation. Conditional logistic regression estimated the relative importance of each factor; results were stratified by clinical role (psychosocial vs medical/surgical providers) and beliefs (outcomes vs equity). RESULTS: Five hundred and eighy-four transplant providers completed the survey. Social support was the second most influential factor among transplant providers. Providers were most likely to choose a candidate who had social support (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.86), always adhered to a medical regimen (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.88), and had a 15 years life expectancy with transplant (OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.85). Psychosocial providers were more influenced by adherence and quality of life compared with medical/surgical providers, who were more influenced by candidates' life expectancy with transplant (p<0.05). For providers concerned with avoiding organ waste, social support was the most influential factor, while it was the least influential for clinicians concerned with fairness (p<0.05).

An essential requirement for the validity of consent is that clear, exhaustive and adequate information be provided to the patient himself: the practice of informed consent is a communicative relationship in which the patient can express doubts, perplexities and clarification requests to the dentist. Furthermore, dental treatment has specific peculiarities: the relationship between dentistry and aesthetics, the concomitant presence of pathologies requiring different treatments, the elongated care process and the establishment of a trustworthy relationship and familiarity with the patient represent important aspects in the configuration of the dentist-patient relationship and in the process of acquiring informed consent. The dentist must offer correct information on diagnosis, prognosis, the therapeutic perspective and the likely consequences of therapy, alternative therapy and refusal of therapy, as well as eventual commitments for the period after treatment. Particular consideration must be given to minors and patients of unsound mind: the dentist's approach to these patients needs to be clear and appropriate to the person's age and understanding ability, even if the decisional power for sanitary treatment may be in the hands of a third person.",2013,10.1136/medethics-2012-100850,39,1,59-61,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Decision Making and Europe and Trust and Italy and *Personal Autonomy and Informed Consent/*ethics and Disclosure/*ethics and Dental Care/*ethics and Dentist-Patient Relations/*ethics,NA,NA,2013/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Chambaere_2014_Joofmeet,JOUR,Forgoing artificial nutrition or hydration at the end of life: a large cross-sectional survey in Belgium,"Chambaere, Kenneth and Loodts, Ilse and Deliens, Luc and Cohen, Joachim",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the frequency and characteristics of decisions to forgo artificial nutrition and/or hydration (ANH) at the end of life. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire survey regarding end-of-life decisions (including ANH) to physicians certifying a large representative sample (n=6927) of Belgian death certificates in 2007. SETTING: Flanders, Belgium, 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Treating physicians of deceased patients. RESULTS: Response rate was 58.4%. A decision to forgoANH occurred in 6.6% of all deaths (4.2% withheld,3.0% withdrawn). Being female, dying in a care home or hospital and suffering from nervous system diseases(including dementia) or malignancies were the most important patient-related factors positively associated with a decision to forgo ANH. Physicians indicated that the decision to forgo ANH had had some life-shortening effects in 77% of cases. There had been no consultation with the patient in 81%, mostly due to incapacity (coma or dementia). The family, colleague physicians and nurses were involved in decision making in 76%,41% and 62%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of deaths are preceded by a decision to forgo ANH in Belgium. These decisions, ethically laden and involving a considerable chance of life shortening, are mostly not preceded by discussion with the patient despite existing patient rights legislation. It is recommended that physicians and patients and their families alike dedicate ample time to the discussion of treatment options and communication about the possibility of forgoing ANH and that this discussion takes place earlier as part of overall end-of life care planning rather than at the very end of life.",2014,10.1136/medethics-2013-101527,40,7,501-504,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Data Collection and Female and Male and Cross-Sectional Studies and Ethics, Medical and Belgium/epidemiology and *Terminally Ill and Fluid Therapy and *Nutritional Support and Withholding Treatment/ethics/*statistics & numerical data",NA,NA,2014/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Baker_2017_Joofmeet,JOUR,A matter of life and death,"Baker, Justice",Journal of medical ethics,"Cases concerning the withdrawal or withholding of artificial nutrition and hydration from patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state raise difficult medical, legal and ethical questions including the diagnosis and classification of disorders of consciousness, the legal processes to be followed, and the legal and ethical principles to be applied when making decisions. There is also an issue as to whether it is necessary or appropriate for such decisions to be taken by judges. This article, based on a lecture given in Oxford in October 2016, considers a number of these issues and concludes that any consideration of the question from the patient's point of view must include an objective analysis of what is in his or her best interests, as well as subjective expressions of wishes and feelings. Whilst noting that it has been suggested that applications to the court should be confined to those cases where there is a dispute as to whether withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) would be in the patient's best interests, the author proposes that, until such time as we have greater clarity and understanding about the disorders of consciousness, and about the legal and ethical principles to be applied, there remains a need for independent oversight and that applications to the court should continue to be obligatory in all cases where the withdrawal of ANH is proposed, at least for the time being.",2017,10.1136/medethics-2017-104256,43,7,427-434,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Ethics and Humans and Morals and Decision Making/*ethics and *Persistent Vegetative State and Withholding Treatment/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and *Consciousness and Life Support Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence,NA,NA,2017/07//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a consequence, it is important to understand patients' perspectives of suffering and their ability to cope. However, there is poor insight into what determines their suffering and their ability to bear it. PURPOSE: To explore the constituent elements of suffering of patients who explicitly request euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to better understand unbearable suffering from the patients' perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A qualitative study using in-depth face-to-face interviews was conducted with 31 patients who had requested EAS. The grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Medical, psycho-emotional, socio-environmental and existential themes contributed to suffering. Especially fatigue, pain, decline, negative feelings, loss of self, fear of future suffering, dependency, loss of autonomy, being worn out, being a burden, loneliness, loss of all that makes life worth living, hopelessness, pointlessness and being tired of living were constituent elements of unbearable suffering. Only patients with a psychiatric (co)diagnosis suffered unbearably all the time. CONCLUSIONS: Unbearable suffering is the outcome of an intensive process that originates in the symptoms of illness and/or ageing. According to patients, hopelessness is an essential element of unbearable suffering. Medical and social elements may cause suffering, but especially when accompanied by psycho-emotional and existential problems suffering will become 'unbearable'. Personality characteristics and biographical aspects greatly influence the burden of suffering. Unbearable suffering can only be understood in the continuum of the patients' perspectives of the past, the present and expectations of the future.",2011,10.1136/jme.2011.045492,37,12,727-734,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Qualitative Research and Aged, 80 and over and Cost of Illness and Ethics, Clinical and Pain/*psychology and Stress, Psychological/*psychology and Suicide, Assisted/*psychology and Euthanasia, Active, Voluntary/*psychology",NA,NA,2011/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Euthanasia is, however, rarely practiced, so the average physician will not attain routine in this matter. AIM: To explore how general practitioners in Flanders (Belgium) deal with euthanasia. This was performed via qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with 52 general practitioners (GPs). RESULTS: Although GPs can understand a patient's request for euthanasia, their own willingness to perform it is limited, based on their assumption that legal euthanasia equates to an injection that ends life abruptly. Their willingness to perform euthanasia is affected by the demanding nature of a patient's request, by their views on what circumstances render euthanasia legitimate and by their own ability to inject a lethal dose. Several GPs prefer increasing opioid dosages and palliative sedation to a lethal injection, which they consider to fall outside the scope of euthanasia legislation. CONCLUSIONS: Four attitudes can be identified: (1) willing to perform euthanasia; (2) only willing to perform as a last resort; (3) feeling incapable of performing; (4) refusing on principle. The situation where GPs have to consider the request and-if they grant it-to perform the act may result in arbitrary access to euthanasia for the patient. The possibility of installing transparent referral and support strategies for the GPs should be further examined.

A. and Norheim, O. F.",Journal of medical ethics,"INTRODUCTION: Hundreds of thousands of premature neonates born in low-income countries are implicitly denied treatment each year. Studies from India show that treatment is rationed even for neonates born at 32 gestational age weeks (GAW), and multiple external factors influence treatment decisions. Is withholding of life-saving treatment for children born between 28 and 32 GAW acceptable from an ethical perspective? METHOD: A seven-step impartial ethical analysis, including outcome analysis of four accepted priority criteria: severity of disease, treatment effect, cost effectiveness and evidence for neonates born at 28 and 32 GAW. RESULTS: The ethical analysis sketches out two possibilities: (a) It is not ethically permissible to limit treatment to neonates below 32 GAW when assigning high weight to health maximisation and overall health equality. Neonates below 32 GAW score high on severity of disease and efficiency and cost-effectiveness of treatment if one gives full weight to early years of a newborn life. It is in the child's best interest to be treated. (b) It can be considered ethically permissible if high weight is assigned to reducing inequality of welfare and maximising overall welfare and/or not granting full weight to early years of newborns is considered acceptable. From an equity-motivated health and welfare perspective, we would not accept (b), as it relies on accepting the lack of proper welfare policies for the poor and disabled in India. CONCLUSION: Explicit priority processes in India for financing neonatal care are needed. If premature neonates are perceived as worth less than other patient groups, the reasons should be explored among a broad range of stakeholders.",2010,10.1136/jme.2010.035535,36,8,473-478,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Decision Making and Prognosis and Socioeconomic Factors and India and Infant, Newborn and Patient Selection and Cross-Cultural Comparison and *Ethics, Medical and Infant, Premature and Gestational Age and Birth Weight and Terminal Care/*ethics and Life Support Care/*ethics and Health Care Rationing/*ethics and Euthanasia, Passive/ethics and Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/economics/*ethics",NA,NA,2010/08//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Muramoto_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Is informed consent required for the diagnosis of brain death regardless of consent for organ donation?,"Muramoto, Osamu",Journal of medical ethics,"In the half-century history of clinical practice of diagnosing brain death, informed consent has seldom been considered until very recently. Like many other medical diagnoses and ordinary death pronouncements, it has been taken for granted for decades that brain death is diagnosed and death is declared without consideration of the patient's advance directives or family's wishes. This essay examines the pros and cons of using informed consent before the diagnosis of brain death from an ethical point of view. As shared decision-making in clinical practice became increasingly indispensable, respect for the patients' autonomous wishes regarding how to end their lives has a significant role in deciding how death is diagnosed. Brain death, as a fully technologically controlled death, may require a different ethical framework from the old one for traditional cardiac death. With emerging and proliferating options in end-of-life care for those who suffer from catastrophic brain injury, the traditional reasoning that 'death gives no choice, hence no consent' requires another examination. Patients facing imminent brain death now have options other than undergoing the diagnostic workup for brain death, such as donation after circulatory death and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment with maximum comfort measures for death with dignity. Nevertheless, just as in the debate over opt-in versus opt-out organ donation policies, informed consent before the diagnosis of brain death faces fierce opposition from consequentialists urging the expansion of the donor pool. This essay examines these objections and provides constructive replies along with a proposal to accommodate this morally required consent.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106240,47,12,e5,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,diagnosis and informed consent and presumed consent and brain death and organ procurement,NA,NA,2020/06/05/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

Interviews with women about the donation of embryos to stem cell research,"Mitzkat, Anika and Haimes, Erica and Rehmann-Sutter, Christoph",Journal of medical ethics,"The social interface between reproductive medicine and embryonic stem cell research has been investigated in a pilot study at a large IVF clinic in central China. Methods included observation, interviews with hospital personnel, and five in-depth qualitative interviews with women who underwent IVF and who were asked for their consent to the donation of embryos for use in medical (in fact human embryonic stem cell) research. This paper reports, and discusses from an ethical perspective, the results of an analysis of these interviews. The participants talked of extreme social pressure to become pregnant. Once they had a baby, 'spare' embryos lost practical significance due to the Chinese one-child policy. In the context of decision making about donating embryos to research, the women used the clinical distinctions between 'good and bad quality' embryos and also between frozen and transferred embryos, as guiding moral distinctions. In the absence of concrete information about what sort of research their embryos should be used for, the women interviewed either refused consent (for fear that the embryo would be given to another couple) or accepted, expressing motives of solidarity with other women in a similar situation. This reveals that they filled the knowledge gap with an image of research improving fertility treatment.",2010,10.1136/jme.2010.036764,36,12,754-757,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Humans and Female and Pilot Projects and Surveys and Questionnaires and Pregnancy and Morals and Informed Consent and Tissue Donors/*psychology and Embryo Research/*ethics and Embryo Disposition/*psychology and Fertilization in Vitro/ethics/psychology and Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethics/*psychology and Women/*psychology,NA,NA,2010/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Klitzman_2020_Joofmeet,JOUR,Roles of genetics and blood type in clinical responses to COVID-19: ethical and policy concerns,"Klitzman, Robert",Journal of medical ethics,"Recently, several genetic variants have been associated with increased or decreased risks of becoming infected and/or seriously ill with COVID-19-not only offering important potential medical benefits but also posing critical ethical questions. These genetic factors, some of which are associated with blood type, may account for variations in observed responses to COVID-19. Hence, assessments of these genetic differences and blood type could provide possible benefits in gauging patients' risks of disease acquisition and prioritising allocation of interventions or vaccines, if supplies are limited. The media has widely reported these findings, and people online are now discussing their blood type and its possible effects on their COVID-19 risks, but several ethical concerns arise. Individuals possessing genetic variants or blood types associated with lower risk may engage in 'risk compensation', erroneously assuming that they can protect themselves less, and hence less frequently wearing masks or washing hands. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians, hospitals, patients, policymakers, members of the public, testing companies and others may well consider these factors in making critical prevention/treatment decisions. Researchers, providers and others should thus begin to address these concerns. Increased awareness and education aimed at providers, patients, family members, public health officials, political leaders and the public-at-large are critical. Attitudinal research is vital to examine how providers, patients and the public understand these findings. Ethical frameworks and guidelines are needed, addressing whether such genetic information should be incorporated into decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources-including hospital and ICU beds, ventilators, medications (eg, remdesivir) and vaccines-and if so, how.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2020-106920,NA,NA,2020-106920-medethics,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,decision-making and public policy and ethics and public health ethics and genethics,NA,NA,2020/12/09/,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Cheung_2021_Joofmeet,JOUR,Mistrust and inconsistency during COVID-19: considerations for resource allocation guidelines that prioritise healthcare workers,"Cheung, Alexander T. M. and Parent, Brendan",Journal of medical ethics,"As the USA contends with another surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitals may soon need to answer the unresolved question of who lives and dies when ventilator demand exceeds supply. Although most triage policies in the USA have seemingly converged on the use of clinical need and benefit as primary criteria for prioritisation, significant differences exist between institutions in how to assign priority to patients with identical medical prognoses: the so-called 'tie-breaker' situations. In particular, one's status as a frontline healthcare worker (HCW) has been a proposed criterion for prioritisation in the event of a tie. This article outlines two major grounds for reconsidering HCW prioritisation. The first recognises trust as an indispensable element of clinical care and mistrust as a hindrance to any public health strategy against the virus, thus raising concerns about the outward appearance of favouritism. The second considers the ways in which proponents of HCW prioritisation deviate from the very 'ethics frameworks' that often preface triage policies and serve to guide resource allocation-a rhetorical strategy that may undermine the very ethical foundations on which triage policies stand. By appealing to trust and consistency, we re-examine existing arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation and provide a more tenable justification for adjudicating on tie-breaker events during crisis standards of care.",2021,10.1136/medethics-2020-106801,47,2,73-77,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"SARS-CoV-2 and United States and Ethics and Humans and resource allocation and Trust and Attitude to Health and Ethics, Clinical and *Pandemics and *Health Personnel and Decision Making/ethics and *Health Policy and Dissent and Disputes and Principle-Based Ethics and Health Priorities/ethics and Public Health/ethics and Health Care Rationing/*ethics and Resource Allocation and public health ethics and allocation of health care resources and Triage/*ethics and COVID-19/*therapy/virology and Hospitals/*ethics and policy guidelines/inst. review boards/review cttes",NA,NA,2021/02//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Jamrozik_2016_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Victims, vectors and villains: are those who opt out of vaccination morally responsible for the deaths of others?","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz and Handfield, Toby and Selgelid, Michael J.",Journal of medical ethics,"Mass vaccination has been a successful public health strategy for many contagious diseases. The immunity of the vaccinated also protects others who cannot be safely or effectively vaccinated-including infants and the immunosuppressed. When vaccination rates fall, diseases like measles can rapidly resurge in a population. Those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons are at the highest risk of severe disease and death. They thus may bear the burden of others' freedom to opt out of vaccination. It is often asked whether it is legitimate for states to adopt and enforce mandatory universal vaccination. Yet this neglects a related question: are those who opt out, where it is permitted, morally responsible when others are harmed or die as a result of their decision? In this article, we argue that individuals who opt out of vaccination are morally responsible for resultant harms to others. Using measles as our main example, we demonstrate the ways in which opting out of vaccination can result in a significant risk of harm and death to others, especially infants and the immunosuppressed. We argue that imposing these risks without good justification is blameworthy and examine ways of reaching a coherent understanding of individual moral responsibility for harms in the context of the collective action required for disease transmission. Finally, we consider several objections to this view, provide counterarguments and suggest morally permissible alternatives to mandatory universal vaccination including controlled infection, self-imposed social isolation and financial penalties for refusal to vaccinate.",2016,10.1136/medethics-2015-103327,42,12,762-768,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,Risk and Ethics and Humans and Infant and Death and Decision Making and Morals and Freedom and *Personal Autonomy and Immunocompromised Host and Public Health/*ethics and Dissent and Disputes and *Social Responsibility and Vaccination/*ethics and Mandatory Programs/*ethics and Measles/mortality/*prevention & control/transmission and Public Health Ethics and Refusal to Participate/*ethics,NA,NA,2016/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Wade_2017_Joofmeet,JOUR,Back to the bedside? Making clinical decisions in patients with prolonged unconsciousness,"Wade, Derick",Journal of medical ethics,"In 1993, the UK High Court decided that Tony Bland was unaware of himself and his environment, had no interest in medical treatment and allowed withdrawal of treatment. Subsequently, the court has reviewed all cases of stopping feeding and hydration in people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness. Their focus has been on determining whether the person is in the permanent vegetative state, because this avoids considering what is in a person's Best Interests. Consequently, much resource is spent distinguishing the vegetative state from the minimally conscious state and often clinical decisions are delayed or not made because of the requirement to go to court. In this paper, I argue that the neurophysiological basis of consciousness is unknown, and one cannot test whether the necessary structures are functioning. Unconscious people have responsiveness which varies; they may even have brief behaviours suggestive of awareness. No single clinical sign or investigation nor assessment battery can prove the presence (or absence) of consciousness or its permanence. The diagnosis of consciousness is clinical. Furthermore, awareness varies across a spectrum. There is no separate vegetative state. People simply have very limited or absent awareness. Even if there were such a state, it cannot be identified. The ethical and legal issues associated with decisions on treatment of unconscious people are no different from similar decisions in other patients. All decisions should be taken within the Best Interests framework and process.

Drawing on a study that involved over 150 families in the USA and the UK, I show that children are able to report threats to authenticity, but that the majority of children are not concerned with such threats. On balance, children report that stimulants improve their capacity for moral agency, and they associate this capacity with an ability to meet normative expectations.

Preferences of patients and their relatives: a pilot study,"Chenaud, C. and Merlani, P. and Verdon, M. and Ricou, B.",Journal of medical ethics,"INTRODUCTION: Research in intensive care is necessary for the continuing advancement of patient care. In research, informed consent is considered essential for patient protection. In intensive care, the modalities of informed consent are currently being debated by both lawyers and the medical community. The preferences of patients and their relatives regarding informed consent for research in intensive care have never been assessed. The aim of this study was to investigate these preferences. METHODS: A pilot study conducted via a questionnaire mailed to patients and relatives who had experienced intensive care. RESULTS: 52/400 patient-relative pairs completed the questionnaire fully. If the patient was imagined to be conscious, 75% of patients and 77% of relatives believed the patient should be the person who should consent. If the patient was imagined to be unconscious, 72% of patients and 67% of relatives thought that a relative should be asked to consent. The majority of responders thought that at least two persons should consent. Their answers were concordant in 61-80% of cases, depending on the question. Patients (25%) and relatives (30%) did not feel free in their decision to participate in a study. The majority of patients and relatives wanted to consent by writing, indifferently with or without a witness. CONCLUSION: Patients are willing to decide on their own participation in a study.

Wood_2011_Joofmeet,JOUR,What constitutes consent when parents and daughters have different views about having the HPV vaccine: qualitative interviews with stakeholders,"Wood, Fiona and Morris, Lucy and Davies, Myfanwy and Elwyn, Glyn",Journal of medical ethics,"OBJECTIVE: The UK Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine programme commenced in the autumn of 2008 for year 8 (age 12-13&emsp14;years) schoolgirls. We examine whether the vaccine should be given when there is a difference of opinion between daughters and parents or guardians. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 25 stakeholders: 14 professionals involved in the development of the HPV vaccination programme and 11 professionals involved in its implementation. RESULTS: Overriding the parents' wishes was perceived as problematic and could damage the relationship between school and parents. A number of practical problems were raised in relation to establishing whether parents were genuinely against their daughter receiving the vaccine. Although many respondents recognised that the Gillick guidelines were relevant in establishing whether a girl could provide consent herself, they still felt that there were significant problems in establishing whether girls could be assessed as Gillick competent. In some areas school nurses had been advised not to give the vaccine in the absence of parental consent. None of the respondents suggested that a girl should be vaccinated against her consent even if her parents wanted her to have the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: While the Gillick guidelines provide a legal framework to help professionals make judgements about adolescents consenting to medical treatment, in practice there appears to be variable and confused interpretation of this guidance.

In this article we examine whether PGS programs should offer individuals the opportunity to selectively opt out of the sequencing or analysis of specific genomic conditions (the menu approach) or whether PGS should be implemented using an all-or-nothing panel approach. We conclude that any responsible scale-up of PGS will require a menu approach that may seem impractical to some, but that draws its justification from a rich mix of normative, legal, and practical considerations.",2015,10.1080/15265161.2015.1039721,15,7,14-3,eng,1536-0075 1526-5161,"Humans and decision making and public health and Paternalism and law and *Personal Autonomy and Genomics/ethics and informed consent and Choice Behavior/*ethics and medical humanities and Genetic Privacy/ethics and *Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics and *Genetic Testing/economics/ethics/methods and *Primary Prevention/ethics/methods and *Sequence Analysis, DNA/economics/ethics and Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics/*prevention & control and genetics (clinical) and Metagenomics/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Public Health/ethics/trends",NA,NA,2015///,Am J Bioeth,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, a consistent approach to training members of CECs is lacking. A systematic scoping review was conducted to evaluate prevailing CEC training curricula to guide the design of an evidence-based approach. METHODS: Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was used to evaluate prevailing accounts of CEC training published in six databases. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis approach was adopted to thematically analyse data across different healthcare and educational settings. RESULTS: 7370 abstracts were identified, 92 full-text articles were reviewed and 55 articles were thematically analysed to reveal four themes: the design, pedagogy, content and assessment of CEC curricula. CONCLUSION: Few curricula employ consistent approaches to training. Many programmes fail to provide CEC trainees with sufficient knowledge, skills and experience to meet required competencies. Most programmes do not inculcate prevailing sociocultural, research, clinical and educational considerations into training processes nor provide longitudinal support for CEC trainees. Most CEC training programmes are not supported by host institutions threatening the sustainability of the programme and compromising effective assessment and longitudinal support of CEC trainees. While further reviews are required, this review underlines the need for host organisations to support and oversee a socioculturally appropriate ethically sensitive, clinically relevant longitudinal training, assessment and support process for CEC trainees if CECs are to meet their roles effectively.",2020,10.1136/medethics-2019-105666,46,1,36-42,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Professional Competence and Health Personnel/*education and Curriculum/*standards and medical ethics and *Ethics, Clinical and *Ethics Committees, Clinical and ethics consultation and clinical ethics committees and Committee Membership and ethicist and healthcare ethics committee",NA,NA,2020/01//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
van.Tol_2015_Joofmeet,JOUR,Dutch physicians on the role of the family in continuous sedation,"van Tol, Donald G. and Kouwenhoven, Pauline and van der Vegt, Bea and Weyers, Heleen",Journal of medical ethics,"In order to relieve intractable suffering of a terminal patient, doctors may decide to continuously sedate a patient until the end of life. Little research is done on the role the family plays during the process of continuous sedation. This study aims to get a view of doctors' experiences with continuous sedation, and the role of the family throughout that process. We held in-depth interviews with 48 doctors (19 general practitioners, 16 nursing home doctors and 18 medical specialists). Participants were selected varying in experience and opinions concerning end-of-life decisions. Dutch physicians experience the role of family in continuous sedation as important and potentially difficult. Difficulties may rise especially during the final stages when the patient is no longer conscious and family members are waiting for death to come. Disagreement may arise between physician and family, concerning the dignity of the dying process or the question whether the sedated patient is suffering or not. Some physicians report they hastened the dying process, in order to relieve the families' suffering.",2015,10.1136/medethics-2013-101624,41,3,240-244,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Decision-making and Geriatrics and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Surveys and Questionnaires and Interviews as Topic and Qualitative Research and Family and General Practitioners and Netherlands and Palliative Care and Nursing Homes and *Attitude of Health Personnel and *Dissent and Disputes and Physicians/*statistics & numerical data and *Family/psychology and End-of-life and Terminal Care/ethics/*methods and Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control and *Deep Sedation/ethics and Central Nervous System Depressants/*administration & dosage and Pain/*prevention & control",NA,NA,2015/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Perez.Carceles_2007_Joofmeet,JOUR,Elderly patients also have rights,"Perez-Carceles, M. D. and Lorenzo, M. D. and Luna, A. and Osuna, E.",Journal of medical ethics,"BACKGROUND: Sharing information with relatives of elderly patients in primary care and in hospital has to fit into the complex set of obligations, justifications and pressures concerning the provision of information, and the results of some studies point to the need for further empirical studies exploring issues of patient autonomy, privacy and informed consent in the day-to-day care of older people. OBJECTIVES: To know the frequency with which ""capable"" patients over 65 years of age receive information when admitted to hospital, the information offered to the families concerned, the person who gives consent for medical intervention, and the degree of satisfaction with the information received and the healthcare provided. METHOD: A descriptive questionnaire given to 200 patients and 200 relatives during the patients' stay in hospital. RESULTS: Only 5% of patients confirmed that they had been asked whether information could be given to their relatives. A significantly higher proportion of relatives received information on the successive stages of the care offered than did patients themselves. As the age of the patients increased, so the number who were given information, understood the information and were asked for their consent for complementary tests decreased. The degree of satisfaction with the information offered was high for both patients and relatives (86.5% and 84%, respectively), despite the irregularities observed. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity of elderly patients to participate in the decision-making process is frequently doubted simply because they have reached a certain age and it is thought that relatives should act as their representatives. In Spain, the opinion of the family and doctors appears to play a larger role in making decisions than does the concept of patient autonomy.",2007,10.1136/jme.2006.018598,33,12,712-716,eng,0306-6800 1473-4257,"Disclosure and Humans and Quality of Health Care and Female and Male and Aged and Health Services Research and Surveys and Questionnaires and Aged, 80 and over and Chi-Square Distribution and Family and Spain and Informed Consent/*ethics and Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics and Patient Rights/*ethics and Geriatric Nursing/*ethics",NA,NA,2007/12//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Blease_2013_Joofmeet,JOUR,"Electroconvulsive therapy, the placebo effect and informed consent","Blease, Charlotte Rosalind",Journal of medical ethics,"Major depressive disorder is not only the most widespread mental disorder in the world, it is a disorder on the rise. In cases of particularly severe forms of depression, when all other treatment options have failed, the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a recommended treatment option for patients. ECT has been in use in psychiatric practice for over 70 years and is now undergoing something of a restricted renaissance following a sharp decline in its use in the 1970s. Despite its success in treating severe depression there is continued debate as to the effectiveness of ECT: in some studies, it is argued that ECT is marginally more effective than sham ECT. In addition, there is still no clear explanation of how ECT works; among the range of hypotheses proposed it is claimed that ECT may work by harnessing placebo effects. In light of the uncertainties over the mechanism of action of ECT and given the risk of serious side effects that ECT may produce, I contend that the process of informed consent must include comprehensive accounts of these uncertainties. I examine the possible consequences of providing adequate information to potential ECT patients, including the consideration that ECT may still prove to be effective even if physicians are open about the possibility of it working as a placebo. I conclude that if we value patient autonomy as well as the professional reputation of medical practitioners, a fuller description of ECT must be provided to patients and their carers.",2013,10.1136/medethics-2012-100955,39,3,166-170,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"United States and Deception and Uncertainty and Humans and United Kingdom and Paternalism and History, 21st Century and History, 20th Century and Italy and Personal Autonomy and Decision Making/*ethics and Informed Consent/*ethics and Mental Competency and Clinical Trials as Topic/*ethics and *Placebo Effect and *Truth Disclosure and Cognition Disorders/*etiology and Depressive Disorder, Major/*therapy and Electroconvulsive Therapy/*adverse effects/*ethics/history/statistics & numerical data/trends and Memory Disorders/*etiology",NA,NA,2013/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ivo_2012_Joofmeet,JOUR,"A survey of the perspectives of patients who are seriously ill regarding end-of-life decisions in some medical institutions of Korea, China and Japan","Ivo, Kwon and Younsuck, Koh and Ho, Yun Young and Sang-Yeon, Suh and Seog, Heo Dae and Hyunah, Bae and Kenji, Hattori and Xiaomei, Zhai",Journal of medical ethics,"PURPOSE: The debate about the end-of-life care decision is becoming a serious ethical and legal concern in the Far-Eastern countries of Korea, China and Japan. However, the issues regarding end-of-life care will reflect the cultural background, current medical practices and socioeconomic conditions of the countries, which are different from Western countries and between each other. Understanding the genuine thoughts of patients who are critically ill is the first step in confronting the issues, and a comparative descriptive study of these perspectives was conducted by collaboration between researchers in all three countries. METHODS: Surveys using self-reporting paper questionnaire forms were conducted from December 2008 to April 2009 in Korea (six hospitals in two regions), China (five hospitals in four regions) and Japan (nine hospitals in one region). The subjects were patients who were critically ill who had been diagnosed as having cancer. A total of 235 participants (Korea, 91; China, 62; Japan, 52) were eventually recruited and statistically analysed. RESULTS: Most respondents had sometimes or often thought of their own death, mostly fear of 'separation from loved ones'. They wanted to hear the news regarding their own condition directly and frankly from the physician. A quarter of them preferred making end-of-life care decisions by themselves, while many respondents favoured a 'joint decision' with their family members. The most favoured proxy decision maker was the spouse, followed by the children. Most admitted the necessity of 'advance directives' and agreed with artificial ventilation withdrawal in irreversible conditions. The most common reason was 'artificial prolongation of life is unnecessary'. Most respondents agreed with the concept of active euthanasia; however, significant differences were sometimes observed in the responses according to variables such as patient's country of origin, age, gender and education level. CONCLUSION: Patients in Far-Eastern countries gave various responses regarding end-of-life care decisions. Although familial input is still influential, most patients think of themselves as the major decision maker and accept the necessity of advance directives with Westernization of the society. Artificial ventilation withdrawal and even active euthanasia may be acceptable to them.",2012,10.1136/medethics-2011-100153,38,5,310-316,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"China and Language and Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Aged and Decision Making and Surveys and Questionnaires and Japan and Attitude to Death and Internationality and Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and *Choice Behavior and Republic of Korea and Patients/psychology/*statistics & numerical data and *Terminal Care/ethics/methods/trends and *Critical Illness/psychology and Translations and *Euthanasia, Active/trends and *Withholding Treatment/ethics/trends and Advance Directives/ethics/*trends",NA,NA,2012/05//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) To examine the relation between physicians' estimation of the severity and frequency of these side-effects and their willingness to inform patients. (3) To identify the reasons for informing or not informing the patients. METHODS: A questionnaire, presenting three hypothetical cases involving decisions about ordinary medical treatments and a series of general questions about information about side-effects, was distributed to 500 Lithuanian GPs. The response rate was 42%. RESULTS: The respondents differed considerably with regard to their willingness to inform patients about side-effects, but they informed their patients significantly more if the side effect was considered to be common and serious, than in cases when it was considered to be rare and trivial. The majority of the respondents informed their patients primarily to enable them to react appropriately to the side-effects in question. The major reason for not informing was that the side-effects were considered too rare to be relevant to the patient's decision-making. CONCLUSION: Information, given to patients about side-effects by Lithuanian GPs, is not in accordance with the principle of respect for patients' autonomy and requirements of Lithuanian legislation.",2008,10.1136/jme.2006.019448,34,3,137-140,eng,1473-4257 0306-6800,"Humans and Female and Male and Middle Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Surveys and Questionnaires and Population Surveillance and *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and Informed Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence and Lithuania and Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/adverse effects and Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects and Family Practice/*methods/statistics & numerical data and Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*ethics/statistics & numerical data and Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects",NA,NA,2008/03//undefined,J Med Ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA
