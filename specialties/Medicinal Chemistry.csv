Caesar_2019_Natuprodrepo,JOUR,Synergy and antagonism in natural product extracts: when 1 + 1 does not equal 2,"Caesar, Lindsay K. and Cech, Nadja B.",Natural product reports,"Covering: 2000 to 2019 According to a 2012 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 18% of the U.S. population uses natural products (including plant-based or botanical preparations) for treatment or prevention of disease. The use of plant-based medicines is even more prevalent in developing countries, where for many they constitute the primary health care modality. Proponents of the medicinal use of natural product mixtures often claim that they are more effective than purified compounds due to beneficial ""synergistic"" interactions. A less-discussed phenomenon, antagonism, in which effects of active constituents are masked by other compounds in a complex mixture, also occurs in natural product mixtures. Synergy and antagonism are notoriously difficult to study in a rigorous fashion, particularly given that natural products chemistry research methodology is typically devoted to reducing complexity and identifying single active constituents for drug development. This report represents a critical review with commentary about the current state of the scientific literature as it relates to studying combination effects (including both synergy and antagonism) in natural product extracts. We provide particular emphasis on analytical and Big Data approaches for identifying synergistic or antagonistic combinations and elucidating the mechanisms that underlie their interactions. Specific case studies of botanicals in which synergistic interactions have been documented are also discussed. The topic of synergy is important given that consumer use of botanical natural products and associated safety concerns continue to garner attention by the public and the media. Guidance by the natural products community is needed to provide strategies for effective evaluation of safety and toxicity of botanical mixtures and to drive discovery in botanical natural product research.",2019,10.1039/c9np00011a,36,6,869-888,eng,1460-4752 0265-0568,"Humans and Drug Combinations and Drug Synergism and Drug Antagonism and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods and Echinacea/microbiology and Endotoxins/pharmacology and Metabolomics/methods and Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology and Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry",NA,NA,2019/06/19/,Nat Prod Rep,NA,NA,NA,NA
Abrusan_2019_Joofmech,JOUR,Ligands and Receptors with Broad Binding Capabilities Have Common Structural Characteristics: An Antibiotic Design Perspective,"Abrusan, Gyorgy and Marsh, Joseph A.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,"The spread of antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious global public-health problems. Here we show that a particular class of homomers with binding sites spanning multiple protein chains is particularly suitable for targeting by broad-spectrum antibacterial agents because due to the slow evolutionary change of such binding pockets, ligands of such homomers are much more likely to bind their homologs than ligands of monomers, or homomers with a single-chain binding site. Additionally, using de novo ligand design and deep learning, we show that the chemical compounds that can bind several different receptors have common structural characteristics and that halogens and fragments similar to the building blocks existing antimicrobials are overrepresented in them. Finally, we show that binding multiple receptors selects for flexible compounds, which are less likely to accumulate in Gram-negative bacteria; thus there is trade-off between reducing the emergence of resistance by multitargeting and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.",2019,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00220,62,21,9357-9374,eng,1520-4804 0022-2623,Protein Binding and *Drug Design and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology and Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects/metabolism and Ligands and Protein Multimerization/drug effects,NA,NA,2019/11/14/,J Med Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA

Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. The best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.",2009,10.1021/jm8015365,52,7,2006-2015,eng,1520-4804 0022-2623,"Artificial Intelligence and Models, Molecular and Neural Networks, Computer and Microbial Sensitivity Tests and *Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology and Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*chemistry/pharmacology and Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial and Enterobacter cloacae/drug effects and Enterococcus/drug effects and Escherichia coli/drug effects and Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects and Pseudomonas/drug effects",NA,NA,2009/04/09/,J Med Chem,NA,NA,NA,NA

Through screening peer-reviewed literature, we have cited specific examples where RWD can be used for biomarker discovery or validation, gaining a new understanding of a disease or disease associations, discovering new markers for patient stratification and targeted therapies, new markers for identifying persons with a disease, and pharmacovigilance. None of the papers meeting our criteria was specifically geared toward novel targets or indications in the biopharmaceutical sector; the majority were focused on the area of public health, often sponsored by universities, insurance providers or in combination with public health bodies such as national insurers. The field is still in an early phase of practical application, and is being harnessed broadly where it serves the most direct need in public health applications in early, rare and novel disease incidents. However, these exemplars provide a valuable contribution to insights on the use of RWD to create novel, faster and less invasive approaches to advance disease understanding and biomarker discovery.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for about 85% of all lung cancers, includes squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated large cell carcinoma. The majority of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis, and medical treatment is the cornerstone of management. Several randomized trials comparing third-generation platinum-based doublets concluded that all such combinations are comparable in their clinical efficacy, failing to document a difference based on histology. However, recent evidences, arising from the availability of pemetrexed, have shown that histology represents an important variable in the decision making. The major progresses in the understanding cancer biology and mechanism of oncogenesis have allowed the development of several potential molecular targets for cancer treatment such as vascular growth factor and its receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor. Targeted drugs seem to be safer or more effective in a specific histology subtype. All of these data have led to choose the optimal first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC based on histologic diagnosis.

The predictive ability of the different techniques used were assessed and discussed on the basis of different validation criteria and results show in general a better performance of AsNNs in terms of learning ability and prediction of antitubercular behaviors when compared with all other methods. MLR have, however, the advantage of pinpointing the most relevant molecular characteristics responsible for the behavior of these compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
