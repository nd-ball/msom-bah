Solomon_2020_NatureviRheu,JOUR,Digital health technologies: opportunities and challenges in rheumatology,"Solomon, Daniel H. and Rudin, Robert S.",Nature reviews. Rheumatology,"The past decade in rheumatology has seen tremendous innovation in digital health technologies, including the electronic health record, virtual visits, mobile health, wearable technology, digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The increased availability of these technologies offers opportunities for improving important aspects of rheumatology, including access, outcomes, adherence and research. However, despite its growth in some areas, particularly with non-health-care consumers, digital health technology has not substantially changed the delivery of rheumatology care. This Review discusses key barriers and opportunities to improve application of digital health technologies in rheumatology. Key topics include smart design, voice enablement and the integration of electronic patient-reported outcomes. Smart design involves active engagement with the end users of the technologies, including patients and clinicians through focus groups, user testing sessions and prototype review. Voice enablement using voice assistants could be critical for enabling patients with hand arthritis to effectively use smartphone apps and might facilitate patient engagement with many technologies. Tracking many rheumatic diseases requires frequent monitoring of patient-reported outcomes. Current practice only collects this information sporadically, and rarely between visits. Digital health technology could enable patient-reported outcomes to inform appropriate timing of face-to-face visits and enable improved application of treat-to-target strategies. However, best practice standards for digital health technologies do not yet exist. To achieve the potential of digital health technology in rheumatology, rheumatology professionals will need to be more engaged upstream in the technology design process and provide leadership to effectively incorporate the new tools into clinical care.",2020,10.1038/s41584-020-0461-x,16,9,525-535,eng,1759-4804 1759-4790,Humans and Practice Guidelines as Topic and Focus Groups and Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Patient Participation/*psychology and Telemedicine/methods and Artificial Intelligence/*statistics & numerical data and Machine Learning/statistics & numerical data and Biomedical Technology/*instrumentation and Rheumatic Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology and Rheumatology/*instrumentation and Speech Recognition Software/trends,NA,NA,2020/09//undefined,Nat Rev Rheumatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, this is an emergent area where recommendations for optimal use and implementation are needed. The objective of these European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) points to consider is to guide the collection, analysis and use of big data in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders (RMDs). METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force of 14 international experts was assembled with expertise from a range of disciplines including computer science and artificial intelligence. Based on a literature review of the current status of big data in RMDs and in other fields of medicine, points to consider were formulated. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were allocated and mean levels of agreement of the task force members were calculated. RESULTS: Three overarching principles and 10 points to consider were formulated. The overarching principles address ethical and general principles for dealing with big data in RMDs. The points to consider cover aspects of data sources and data collection, privacy by design, data platforms, data sharing and data analyses, in particular through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Furthermore, the points to consider state that big data is a moving field in need of adequate reporting of methods and benchmarking, careful data interpretation and implementation in clinical practice.

J. and Pappas, Dimitrios A. and Kremer, Joel M. and Zhu, Fan","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)","OBJECTIVE: Accurate prediction of treatment responses in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients can provide valuable information on effective drug selection. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs are an important second-line treatment after methotrexate, the classic first-line treatment for RA. However, patient heterogeneity hinders identification of predictive biomarkers and accurate modeling of anti-TNF drug responses. This study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of machine learning to assist in developing predictive models for treatment response. METHODS: Using data on patient demographics, baseline disease assessment, treatment, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array from the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM): Rheumatoid Arthritis Responder Challenge, we created a Gaussian process regression model to predict changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) for the patients and to classify them into either the responder or the nonresponder group. This model was developed and cross-validated using data from 1,892 RA patients. It was evaluated using an independent data set from 680 patients. We examined the effectiveness of the similarity modeling and the contribution of individual features. RESULTS: In the cross-validation tests, our method predicted changes in DAS28 (<ce><94>DAS28), with a correlation coefficient of 0.405. It correctly classified responses from 78% of patients. In the independent test, this method achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.393 in predicting <ce><94>DAS28. Gaussian process regression effectively remapped the feature space and identified subpopulations that do not respond well to anti-TNF treatments. Genetic SNP biomarkers showed small contributions in the prediction when added to the clinical models. This was the best-performing model in the DREAM Challenge.

Although family history of RA is an old concept, the degree of familial aggregation of RA, whether it differs by age, sex, or serology, and what value it has for clinical decisions once a diagnosis of RA has been made remain unclear. New data have been emerging in parallel to substantial progress made in genetic association studies. In this Review, we describe the various ways that familial aggregation has been measured, and how the findings from these studies, whether they are based on twins, cohorts of first-degree relatives, or genetic data, correspond to each other and aid understanding of the aetiology of RA.

In both sets of recommendations, the heterogeneity of PsA is recognized and the place of various drugs in the therapeutic armamentarium is discussed. Such agents include conventional DMARDs, such as methotrexate, and targeted therapies including biologic agents, such as ustekinumab, secukinumab and TNF inhibitors, or the targeted synthetic drug apremilast. The proposed sequential use of these drugs, as well as some other aspects of PsA management, differ between the two sets of recommendations. This disparity is partly the result of a difference in the evaluation process; the focus of EULAR was primarily rheumatological, whereas that of GRAPPA was balanced between the rheumatological and dermatological aspects of disease.

Owing to its rarity, outcomes data in pediatric-onset GPA are also lacking. The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiology of GPA and outcomes in GPA patients in the US, and to compare outcomes between pediatric and working-age adult patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the 2006-2014 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database was conducted. The incidence and prevalence rates of pediatric and adult GPA (age <65 years) were calculated. Outcomes among the 2 age groups were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 5,562 cases of GPA were identified, of which 214 (3.8%) were pediatric onset and 5,348 (96.2%) were adult onset. The incidence rate of pediatric-onset GPA was 1.8 cases per 1 million person-years, compared to 12.8 cases per 1 million person-years in working-age adults. There was a slight female preponderance in both groups (63% and 53% among pediatric and adult GPA patients, respectively). Rates of hospitalization and severe infections were high in both children and working-age adults, but children had more frequent hospitalizations (rate ratio [RR] 1.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1-1.4]) and 2-3-times higher rates of leukopenia (RR 2.6 [95% CI 1.5-4.3]), neutropenia (RR 2.2 [95% CI 1.2-4.0]), and hypogammaglobulinemia (RR 3.7 [95% CI 2.0-6.4]).

Although several synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are available, there is still a medical need for novel drugs that control disease progression. As only 10% of experimental drug candidates for treatment of RA that enter phase I trials are eventually registered by the Food and Drug Administration, there is an immediate need for translational tools to facilitate early decision-making in drug development. In this study, we aimed to determine if the inability of fostamatinib (a small molecule inhibitor of Syk) to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in phase III of a previous clinical study could have been predicted earlier in the development process. METHODS: Biomarkers of bone, cartilage, and interstitial matrix turnover (C-telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-I], matrix metalloproteinase-derived types I, II, and III collagen neoepitopes [C1M, C2M, and C3M]) were measured in 450 serum samples from the Oral Syk Inhibition in Rheumatoid Arthritis 1 study (OSKIRA-1, a phase III clinical study of the efficacy of fostamatinib in RA) at baseline and follow-up. Additionally, the same biomarkers were subsequently measured in conditioned media from osteoclast, cartilage, and synovial membrane cultured with the active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, to assess the level of suppression induced by the drug. RESULTS: In OSKIRA-1 serum samples and osteoclast and cartilage cultures, fostamatinib suppressed the levels of CTX-I and C2M. In OSKIRA-1 serum samples and synovial membrane cultures, fostamatinib did not mediate any clinical or preclinical effect on either C1M or C3M, which have previously been associated with disease response and efficacy.

METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of various treatment options. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the quality of evidence. We employed a group consensus process to grade the strength of recommendations (either strong or conditional). A strong recommendation indicates that clinicians are certain that the benefits of an intervention far outweigh the harms (or vice versa). A conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty over the balance of benefits and harms and/or more significant variability in patient values and preferences. RESULTS: The guideline covers the use of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in early (<6 months) and established (<e2><89><a5>6 months) RA. In addition, it provides recommendations on using a treat-to-target approach, tapering and discontinuing medications, and the use of biologic agents and DMARDs in patients with hepatitis, congestive heart failure, malignancy, and serious infections. The guideline addresses the use of vaccines in patients starting/receiving DMARDs or biologic agents, screening for tuberculosis in patients starting/receiving biologic agents or tofacitinib, and laboratory monitoring for traditional DMARDs. The guideline includes 74 recommendations: 23% are strong and 77% are conditional. CONCLUSION: This RA guideline should serve as a tool for clinicians and patients (our two target audiences) for pharmacologic treatment decisions in commonly encountered clinical situations.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study using a mixed methods sequential explanatory design at an academic arthritis clinic. RA patients completed selected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures on tablets in the waiting room. Results were immediately available to discuss during the visit. Post-visit surveys with patients and physicians evaluated topics discussed and their impact on decision making; patients rated confidence in treatment. Focus groups or interviews with patients, treating rheumatologists and clinic staff were conducted to understand perspectives and experiences. RESULTS: Some 196 patients and 20 rheumatologists completed post-visit surveys at 816 and 806 visits, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiologic association of HZ events with incident GCA. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in 2 large independent US administrative data sets: Medicare 5% and Truven Health Analytics MarketScan. Eligible subjects had 12 months of continuous coverage, were >50 years old, and had no history of GCA or polymyalgia rheumatica. HZ events (complicated and uncomplicated) and GCA were identified by the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from physician visit or hospital discharge records. Antiviral therapies and vaccinations were identified from prescription claims and drug codes. Risk of incident GCA was calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Among 16,686,345 subjects, a total of 5,942 GCA cases occurred, with 3.1% (MarketScan) and 6.0% (Medicare) having preceding HZ events. Unadjusted GCA incidence rates were highest in the groups with complicated and uncomplicated HZ. After multivariable adjustment, complicated HZ was associated with an increased risk of GCA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32-3.02] in the Medicare cohort and 2.16 [95% CI 1.46-3.18] in the MarketScan cohort), as was uncomplicated HZ (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1.02-1.99] and HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.05-2.01] in the respective cohorts). Vaccination and antiviral treatment were not consistently associated with GCA risk, although antiviral treatment was marginally associated with a decreased risk of GCA in the Medicare cohort (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.46-0.99]). CONCLUSION: HZ is associated with an increased risk of GCA. The infrequency of HZ in GCA patients suggests that it is only one potential trigger for GCA.

Sheppard_2008_Rheu.OxfEngl,JOUR,'I just thought it was normal aches and pains': a qualitative study of decision-making processes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis,"Sheppard, J. and Kumar, K. and Buckley, C. D. and Shaw, K. L. and Raza, K.","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","OBJECTIVE: Effective treatment can only be given during the early stages of RA if patients are seen early. However, many patients delay for prolonged periods before seeking medical advice. This study explores factors influencing the decision to seek medical advice in RA patients. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 24 patients. Purposive sampling ensured a cross-section in terms of time to presentation, gender, age and ethnic background. Interview transcripts were analysed and themes identified using established methods. RESULTS: Four main themes influenced the decision to seek medical advice: (i) symptom experience: the severity of symptoms and their impact on functional ability; (ii) symptom evaluation: the patient's explanation for their symptoms and recognition of their significance; (iii) knowledge of RA and available therapies; and (iv) experience of and attitudes towards health care providers. A significant and rapid impact of the disease on functional ability characterized those presenting early. Many developed an explanation for their symptoms that related to preceding activities. Recognition that this explanation was inadequate to explain symptom progression frequently prompted a consultation. Only one patient sought advice because she thought that she might have RA. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom evaluation is a key factor influencing how quickly medical advice is sought in other diseases. In contrast to the situation with many cancers where there is widespread association of symptoms and signs with the eventual diagnosis, this was not the case in RA.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. We used a group consensus process to determine the final recommendations and grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term (<e2><89><a5>3 months) glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, as well as the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and of calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab treatment in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment, as well as in special populations of long-term GC users. RESULTS: Because of limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users, most recommendations in this guideline are conditional (uncertain balance between benefits and harms). Recommendations include treating only with calcium and vitamin D in adults at low fracture risk, treating with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication (oral bisphosphonate preferred) in adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk, continuing calcium plus vitamin D but switching from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication in adults in whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate, and continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching to another antifracture medication in adults who complete a planned oral bisphosphonate regimen but continue to receive GC treatment. Recommendations for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, women of childbearing potential, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment, are also made.

The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all-cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long-term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first-line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first-line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision-making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",2018,10.1002/art.40583,70,11,1702-1709,eng,2326-5205 2326-5191,Mortality and Humans and Europe and Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic and Comorbidity and United States Food and Drug Administration and Japan and United States/epidemiology and Allopurinol/*therapeutic use and Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality and Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use and Febuxostat/*therapeutic use and Gout Suppressants/*therapeutic use and Gout/*drug therapy/epidemiology and Hyperuricemia/*drug therapy/epidemiology and Xanthine Oxidase/*antagonists & inhibitors,NA,NA,2018/11//undefined,Arthritis Rheumatol,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Patients with rheumatic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis) or psoriasis who experienced a serious infection between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011 were identified in a claims database. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Research Database for 12 months prior to and at least 60 days after the date of discharge or the end of intravenous antibiotic therapy for the index serious infection. Subsequent serious infection incidence rates per 100 patient-years with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for up to 18 months post-index, starting 60 days post-index. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment duration, and changes during followup. RESULTS: Among the 21,699 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the majority (84.3%) had RA. Patients who received tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy after their index infection had a lower rate of subsequent serious infections (18.1 per 100 patient-years for those treated with a TNF inhibitor alone and 17.3 per 100 patient-years for those treated with a TNF inhibitor plus a nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD]) compared with those treated with a nonbiologic DMARD alone (21.4 per 100 patient-years).

Using these data, we developed suggestions to enhance future recruitment. METHODS: A postal survey was sent to rheumatology specialist registrars (SpRs) on the Joint Committee for Higher Medical Training (JCHMT) database between December 2005 and January 2006, and concurrently by e-mail to the Rheumatologists at Training e-mail list. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent (165/227) of trainees responded. Of them, 89.1% had previous senior house officer (SHO) experience in rheumatology and 81.8% made a career decision in favour of rheumatology during their SHO post. The top four ranked factors influencing choice of rheumatology were SHO experience, subject matter, inspirational consultants and lifestyle aspects; 89.1% would still choose rheumatology now. Factors felt to be negatively influencing future trainees came under three key themes: poor student or postgraduate exposure, employment and service delivery issues (including concern over the future place of rheumatology in primary vs secondary care), and perceived poor profile of rheumatology. Factors positively influencing future candidates were subject matter, work/life balance and prior exposure to the speciality.

METHODS: An enriched cohort of 7853 eligible patients was created from electronic health records of two large hospitals using automated searches (<e2><a9><be>1 ICD codes combined with simple text searches). Key disease concepts from free-text data were extracted using NLP and combined with ICD codes to develop algorithms. We created both supervised regression-based algorithms-on a training set of 127 axSpA cases and 423 non-cases-and unsupervised algorithms to identify patients with high probability of having axSpA from the enriched cohort. Their performance was compared against classifications using ICD codes only. RESULTS: NLP extracted four disease concepts of high predictive value: ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, HLA-B27 and spondylitis. The unsupervised algorithm, incorporating both the NLP concept and ICD code for AS, identified the greatest number of patients. By setting the probability threshold to attain 80% positive predictive value, it identified 1509 axSpA patients (mean age 53 years, 71% male). Sensitivity was 0.78, specificity 0.94 and area under the curve 0.93. The two supervised algorithms performed similarly but identified fewer patients. All three outperformed traditional approaches using ICD codes alone (area under the curve 0.80-0.87).

METHODS: According to the EULAR standardised operating procedures, a systematic literature review was followed by a consensus meeting to develop this update involving 28 international taskforce members in May 2019. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were determined. RESULTS: The updated recommendations comprise 6 overarching principles and 12 recommendations. The overarching principles address the nature of PsA and diversity of both musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal manifestations; the need for collaborative management and shared decision-making is highlighted. The recommendations provide a treatment strategy for pharmacological therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and local glucocorticoid injections are proposed as initial therapy; for patients with arthritis and poor prognostic factors, such as polyarthritis or monoarthritis/oligoarthritis accompanied by factors such as dactylitis or joint damage, rapid initiation of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. If the treatment target is not achieved with this strategy, a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-17A or IL-12/23 should be initiated, taking into account skin involvement if relevant. If axial disease predominates, a TNF inhibitor or IL-17A inhibitor should be started as first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Use of Janus kinase inhibitors is addressed primarily after bDMARD failure.

Miyamoto_2019_Rheu.OxfEngl,JOUR,Health-related quality of life and costs in Sjogren's syndrome,"Miyamoto, Samira T. and Valim, Valeria and Fisher, Benjamin A.","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has an increasing role in medical decision-making. This review of the literature aims to provide an overview on HRQoL, costs, and work disability in SS, a disease characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands with no therapeutics of proven immunomodulatory potential. HRQoL is markedly reduced in SS in multiple studies across many countries when compared with HRQoL in healthy controls. The reduction in HRQoL is similar to that observed in other chronic diseases such as RA, SLE, FM and, interestingly, non-SS sicca syndrome. Impaired HRQoL in SS has been found to be associated with fatigue, pain/articular involvement, ocular and oral involvement, pruritus, sexual dysfunction, impaired sleep, pulmonary manifestations, psychological dysfunction and impaired physical function. Until now, no therapeutic has been shown to improve HRQoL in an adequately powered double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. Although primary SS does not, in general, impair life expectancy and is often inappropriately considered a benign 'nuisanvce' disease for those patients without systemic manifestations, the associated costs and work disability are striking. This, together with the significant reduction in HRQoL, strongly argues for the development of new therapeutic approaches to manage this neglected disease.",2019,10.1093/rheumatology/key370,NA,NA,key370,eng,1462-0332 1462-0324,cost and quality of life and health-related quality of life and EQ-5D and SF-36 and Sjogren's syndrome and work disability,NA,NA,2019/02/15/,Rheumatology (Oxford),NA,NA,NA,NA

A. G. and Calabrese, Leonard H. and Mariette, Xavier and Schaeverbeke, Thierry",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic and musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are observed in about 10% of patients with cancer receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Given the recent emergence of these events and the lack of guidance for rheumatologists addressing them, a European League Against Rheumatism task force was convened to harmonise expert opinion regarding their identification and management. METHODS: First, the group formulated research questions for a systematic literature review. Then, based on literature and using a consensus procedure, 4 overarching principles and 10 points to consider were developed. RESULTS: The overarching principles defined the role of rheumatologists in the management of irAEs, highlighting the shared decision-making process between patients, oncologists and rheumatologists. The points to consider inform rheumatologists on the wide spectrum of musculoskeletal irAEs, not fulfilling usual classification criteria of rheumatic diseases, and their differential diagnoses. Early referral and facilitated access to rheumatologist are recommended, to document the target organ inflammation. Regarding therapeutic, three treatment escalations were defined: (1) local/systemic glucocorticoids if symptoms are not controlled by symptomatic treatment, then tapered to the lowest efficient dose, (2) conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, in case of inadequate response to glucocorticoids or for steroid sparing and (3) biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, for severe or refractory irAEs. A warning has been made on severe myositis, a life-threatening situation, requiring high dose of glucocorticoids and close monitoring. For patients with pre-existing rheumatic disease, baseline immunosuppressive regimen should be kept at the lowest efficient dose before starting immunotherapies. CONCLUSION: These statements provide guidance on diagnosis and management of rheumatic irAEs and aim to support future international collaborations.",2021,10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217139,80,1,36-48,eng,1468-2060 0003-4967,"Humans and Europe and treatment and Advisory Committees and Societies, Medical and Severity of Illness Index and Medical Oncology and Rheumatology and Methotrexate/therapeutic use and inflammation and Decision Making, Shared and autoimmunity and Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use and Neoplasms/*drug therapy and Autoantibodies/immunology and Deprescriptions and Analgesics/therapeutic use and Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use and Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use and Arthralgia/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and arthritis and Arthritis, Psoriatic/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Arthritis, Reactive/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*adverse effects and Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use and Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use and multidisciplinary team care and Myalgia/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Myocarditis/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Myositis/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Plasma Exchange and Polymyalgia Rheumatica/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy and Rheumatic Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy and Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors/therapeutic use",NA,NA,2021/01//undefined,Ann Rheum Dis,NA,NA,NA,NA
Vina_2012_Rheu.OxfEngl,JOUR,A study of racial/ethnic differences in treatment preferences among lupus patients,"Vina, Ernest R. and Masi, Christopher M. and Green, Stephanie L. and Utset, Tammy O.","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are racial/ethnic differences in the willingness of SLE patients to receive CYC or participate in clinical trials, and whether demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics contribute to these differences. METHODS: Data from 120 African-American and 62 white lupus patients were evaluated. Structured telephone interviews were conducted to determine treatment preferences, as well as to study characteristics and beliefs that may affect these preferences. Data were analysed using serial hierarchical multivariate logistic regression and deviances were calculated from a saturated model. RESULTS: Compared with their white counterparts, African-American SLE patients expressed less willingness to receive CYC (67.0% vs 84.9%, P = 0.02) if their lupus worsened. This racial/ethnic difference remained significant after adjusting for socioeconomic and psychosocial variables. Logistic regression analysis showed that African-American race [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% CI 0.10, 0.80], physician trust (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00, 1.12) and perception of treatment effectiveness (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22, 1.61) were the most significant determinants of willingness to receive CYC. A trend in difference by race/ethnicity was also observed in willingness to participate in a clinical trial, but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated reduced likelihood of accepting CYC in African-American lupus patients compared with white lupus patients. This racial/ethnic variation was associated with belief in medication effectiveness and trust in the medical provider, suggesting that education about therapy and improved trust can influence decision-making among SLE patients.",2012,10.1093/rheumatology/kes128,51,9,1697-1706,eng,1462-0332 1462-0324,"Humans and Female and Male and Adult and Middle Aged and Physician-Patient Relations and Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice and Patient Education as Topic and *Decision Making and *Patient Care Planning and Patient Preference/*ethnology/psychology and Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use and Whites/ethnology and Attitude to Health/ethnology and *Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/drug therapy/ethnology/psychology and *Minority Groups/psychology and African Americans/ethnology and Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use and Illinois/ethnology",NA,NA,2012/09//undefined,Rheumatology (Oxford),NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective was to update these recommendations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed regarding pharmacological treatment in PsA. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and the expert opinion of the 34 Task Force members. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were allocated. RESULTS: The updated recommendations comprise 5 overarching principles and 10 recommendations, covering pharmacological therapies for PsA from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to conventional synthetic (csDMARD) and biological (bDMARD) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, whatever their mode of action, taking articular and extra-articular manifestations of PsA into account, but focusing on musculoskeletal involvement. The overarching principles address the need for shared decision-making and treatment objectives. The recommendations address csDMARDs as an initial therapy after failure of NSAIDs and local therapy for active disease, followed, if necessary, by a bDMARD or a targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD). The first bDMARD would usually be a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. bDMARDs targeting interleukin (IL)12/23 (ustekinumab) or IL-17 pathways (secukinumab) may be used in patients for whom TNF inhibitors are inappropriate and a tsDMARD such as a phosphodiesterase 4-inhibitor (apremilast) if bDMARDs are inappropriate. If the first bDMARD strategy fails, any other bDMARD or tsDMARD may be used.

The 2009 recommendations were on the management of primary small and medium vessel vasculitis. The 2015 update has been developed by an international task force representing EULAR, the European Renal Association and the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS). The recommendations are based upon evidence from systematic literature reviews, as well as expert opinion where appropriate. The evidence presented was discussed and summarised by the experts in the course of a consensus-finding and voting process. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were derived and levels of agreement (strengths of recommendations) determined. In addition to the voting by the task force members, the relevance of the recommendations was assessed by an online voting survey among members of EUVAS. Fifteen recommendations were developed, covering general aspects, such as attaining remission and the need for shared decision making between clinicians and patients. More specific items relate to starting immunosuppressive therapy in combination with glucocorticoids to induce remission, followed by a period of remission maintenance; for remission induction in life-threatening or organ-threatening AAV, cyclophosphamide and rituximab are considered to have similar efficacy; plasma exchange which is recommended, where licensed, in the setting of rapidly progressive renal failure or severe diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage.

T.",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,"OBJECTIVE: The original European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for managing fibromyalgia assessed evidence up to 2005. The paucity of studies meant that most recommendations were 'expert opinion'. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group from 12 countries assessed evidence with a focus on systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerned with pharmacological/non-pharmacological management for fibromyalgia. A review, in May 2015, identified eligible publications and key outcomes assessed were pain, fatigue, sleep and daily functioning. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used for making recommendations. RESULTS: 2979 titles were identified: from these 275 full papers were selected for review and 107 reviews (and/or meta-analyses) evaluated as eligible. Based on meta-analyses, the only 'strong for' therapy-based recommendation in the guidelines was exercise. Based on expert opinion, a graduated approach, the following four main stages are suggested underpinned by shared decision-making with patients. Initial management should involve patient education and focus on non-pharmacological therapies. In case of non-response, further therapies (all of which were evaluated as 'weak for' based on meta-analyses) should be tailored to the specific needs of the individual and may involve psychological therapies (for mood disorders and unhelpful coping strategies), pharmacotherapy (for severe pain or sleep disturbance) and/or a multimodal rehabilitation programme (for severe disability). CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations are underpinned by high-quality reviews and meta-analyses. The size of effect for most treatments is relatively modest.
