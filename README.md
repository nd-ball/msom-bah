This repo contains a Shiny R app. 
The purpose of the app is to assist OM researchers in making sense of Business Analytics in Healthcare.

The app does several things:

- learns a topic model for papers in the OM space related to business analytics in healthcare
- identifies trends in those topics over time, based on the year a particular article was written
- lists the highest-ranked articles by topic so researchers can identify papers
- visualizes human-generated keywords in a co-occurrence network so researchers can see how different concepts are connected
